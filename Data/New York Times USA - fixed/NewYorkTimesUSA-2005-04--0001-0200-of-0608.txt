A Weak Quarter for Stocks, And the Outlook Is Mixed
Even with the best daily rally of the year on Wednesday, the Dow average and the S.&P. 500 finished down 2.6 percent for the quarter, while the Nasdaq composite fell 8.1 percent.
 From here on, analysts say, the outlook for stocks is dependent on whether crude oil prices drop, whether inflation leads to interest rate increases and how much the economy slows down. [Page C6.]

HEADLINE: If 22 Million Chinese Prevail at U.N., Japan Won't

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 31 

 BODY:
A grass-roots Chinese campaign to keep Japan out of the United Nations Security Council has gathered some 22 million signatures, increasing the chances that China will block Japan's bid to join the elite group, organizers and analysts said Thursday.
 The petition effort, conducted through popular Chinese Web sites, enjoys tacit support from the government, which has allowed state-controlled media to cover the campaign prominently.
 Japan is expected to be among several nations granted a permanent seat on a revamped Security Council under a plan that could come up for a vote in September. As one of the five existing permanent members, China has the power to veto the proposal. It has not said how it plans to vote. 
 If China were to prevent Japan's elevation, it would be the most direct confrontation between Asia's leading powers since they re-established diplomatic ties in 1972.
 Relations between the countries have sharply deteriorated in recent weeks, strained by competition for energy resources, disputes over the way history textbooks assess Japan's role in World War II, Japan's pledge to aid the United States in defending Taiwan and the recent incursion of a Chinese submarine into Japanese waters.
 By allowing millions of people to sign their names to a petition against Japan, Beijing's new leadership seems determined to show that recent Japanese actions have so inflamed popular sentiment that China has no choice but to adopt a tougher diplomatic line.
 Officials may also see the petition as leverage to force concessions from Japan as the price of admission to the Security Council. It could also serve as cover for a veto, which would be one of the most bold assertions of Chinese authority in many years. But the campaign has the potential to restrict China's diplomatic leeway, making it harder to reach a quiet compromise. China could also feel pressured to veto the whole United Nations overhaul if the plan promotes Japan, an unusual position for a country that has rarely used its veto power to oppose an international consensus.
 ''China must vote no and not just abstain,'' said Tong Zeng, a longtime organizer of efforts to force Japan to recognize and apologize for World War II atrocities. ''The government may not want to take the lead, but the Chinese people have taken the lead.''
 In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, ''The Chinese government has said the U.N. needs reform, so we believe that the Chinese and Japanese governments both have the same type of feeling and thinking on this issue.'' 
 ''The petition itself is being conducted by private citizens and, according to press reports, the same petitioners' names keep appearing,'' the spokesman, Hatsuhisa Takashima, said. ''So we just don't know how valid this petition effort is.'' 
 The effort to rally anti-Japan sentiment in China began in late February, when several overseas Web sites began circulating a petition directed at the United Nations, which is currently debating a blueprint for changing its governing structure.
 It gathered momentum last week when leading Chinese Web sites, including portals like Sina, Sohu and Netease, advertised the drive with links on their main pages. Some sites allow users to register their names through text messages sent from mobile phones.
 After initially aiming to collect one million signatures, organizers now say they think they can gather 30 million before they present the petition to Secretary General Kofi Annan. The New China News Agency reported Thursday that 22.2 million Chinese had signed the petition so far.
 ''The response was far beyond our expectations,'' said Lu Yunfei, who has led several grass-roots protests against Japan. ''No one -- not the United Nations nor the Chinese government -- can ignore so many people expressing their views.''
 There was no way to independently verify whether 22 million people had in fact signed the petition or whether they all did so voluntarily. But many Web sites kept their own tallies of how many people had signed up through their portal, and there were no telltale indications that the effort had been centrally organized. 
 Chinese officials have not explicitly endorsed the petition, but they have offered supportive comments.
 Liu Jianchao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this week that the effort reflected growing alarm about Japan's treatment of history.
 ''Japan has to take a responsible attitude toward history to build trust among the people of Asia, including China,'' he said. He added that China believed that the United Nations overhaul should mainly focus on increasing the power of developing countries rather than the rich industrialized ones.
 Japan has the world's second-largest economy and is one of the largest financial contributors to the United Nations. The United States has backed Japan's demand to become a Security Council member.
 Mr. Annan appeared to signal that Japan and Germany would be prime candidates for a revised Security Council lineup when he discussed plans to remake the governing structure last week.
 The council should ''increase the involvement in decision-making of those who contribute most to the United Nations financially, militarily and diplomatically, specifically in terms of contributions to United Nations assessed budgets,'' he told reporters.
 Japan and Germany are by far the largest contributors that do not have permanent seats on the Security Council. Japan has said it will cut its contributions if it does not get a seat.
 North and South Korea, which were colonized by Japan, have already said that they oppose Japan's bid. They argue that Tokyo has not done as much as Germany to atone for its imperialist abuses and that it cannot become a leading member of the international community unless it addresses the legacy of mistrust among its neighbors.
 China, which has historically sought to keep relations with Japan on an even keel, has officially remained neutral. The two countries have a robust trading relationship. China last year replaced the United States as Japan's largest export market, and China's strong growth has helped pull the sluggish Japanese economy out of recession.
 But Beijing has also encouraged anti-Japanese sentiment. Textbooks, newspapers and government-sponsored films emphasize China's suffering after the 1935 Japanese invasion. They largely gloss over the improvement in relations, including generous Japanese aid packages, that occurred after the two sides re-established relations.
 China often uses public opinion as a diplomatic lever. Its news media stirred up an anti-American frenzy after a United States spy plan collided with a Chinese fighter and crash-landed on Chinese soil in 2001. But when the crisis passed, news coverage resumed a more neutral tone. Managing sentiment about Japan is trickier, partly because there is a deeper reservoir of resentment against Japan left over from the war. Mr. Tong, the organizer, says the police have begun allowing people to take part in small-scale anti-Japanese activities rather than repressing them in the name of social stability as they once did. But he said that did little to satisfy popular demands for a tougher approach to Japan. 
 ''There has never before been a petition campaign of this magnitude in China,'' he said. ''It will be much harder for the government to suppress in the future.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 6, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a Chinese campaign to prevent Japan from gaining a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council misstated the year, in the prelude to World War II, that China was invaded by the Imperial Japanese Army, an event that China's government sometimes cites to encourage anti-Japanese sentiment. It was 1937, not 1935.

HEADLINE: Spending Cools Inflation Talk

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Reports yesterday on consumer spending and income eased concern that the economy is overheating, tempering speculation that the Federal Reserve may need to accelerate interest rate increases to limit inflation.
 Personal spending rose 0.5 percent in February while incomes rose a less-than-expected 0.3 percent, the Commerce Department reported. 
 The spending report showed that inflation stayed within the Fed's predicted range, with prices excluding food and energy rising 1.6 percent in the 12 months through February. 
 Personal spending rose for the eighth consecutive month as job growth helped propel income and sales. February's increase followed a gain of 0.1 percent in January, the Commerce Department said. Incomes rose 0.3 percent after falling 2.5 percent the previous month. The savings rate declined.
 ''The improving labor market is the principal factor keeping spending afloat,'' said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland.
 Prices of goods and services bought by consumers rose 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in January. They rose 2.3 percent from February of last year, compared with a 2.2 percent year-over-year rise in January.
 Consumer purchases rose 0.3 percent, after falling 0.1 percent in January when adjusted for changes in prices, the government reported. Spending on durable goods like autos, furniture and other long-lasting items, adjusted for inflation, rose 1 percent after declining 4 percent a month earlier.
 Purchases of nondurable goods rose 0.2 percent while spending on services, which account for almost 60 percent of all purchases, rose 0.2 percent.
 Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 0.3 percent in February after a 2.8 percent drop the previous month. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent, the smallest gain since November. Last year, wage growth accelerated to 4.9 percent, from 2.6 percent in 2003.
 Another report from the Commerce Department showed that orders at United States factories rose less than forecast, restrained in part by a drop in demand for automobiles and appliances. The 0.2 percent increase, to $380.4 billion, trailed the predicted 0.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Orders excluding transportation fell 0.1 percent.
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that first-time jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 350,000 last week, from 330,000, the highest since the week that ended Jan. 8.

HEADLINE: Protecting the Work Force

 BODY:
The Supreme Court struck an important blow for older workers this week by making it easier for them to sue for age discrimination. The ruling, which allows older workers to use the same kind of proof as victims of race or sex discrimination, corrects numerous bad rulings by lower courts. Now that the law has changed for the better, employers should be far more careful about how they treat older workers. 
 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act bars discrimination against workers over the age of 40. But courts have blunted the law's impact by interpreting it in an unduly narrow way. When women, blacks and members of other groups sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they do not need to prove intentional discrimination. They can show ''disparate impact,'' which means that their group was disproportionately harmed by an employer's policy or behavior. Even though the age law has nearly identical language, many courts have refused to allow older workers to bring disparate-impact claims.
 This misreading of the statute was part of a larger, and shameful, hostility by the courts to suits by older workers. In case after case, judges have refused to recognize intentional discrimination, which was illegal even before this week's ruling, despite clear evidence. In one notable instance, a 56-year-old worker was fired by a North Carolina company two weeks after a supervisor told him, ''O'Connor, you are too damn old for this kind of work.'' A federal appeals court ruled that the worker had not proved his case.
 The Supreme Court has now given older workers the protection Congress intended by allowing them to sue based on disparate impact. This week's ruling still leaves employers a significant way out because it allows them to prevail if they can show that they acted based on ''reasonable factors other than age.'' But wise in-house lawyers will be warning their companies in the days ahead to re-evaluate their treatment of older workers in things like promotions and layoffs.
 Workers over the age of 40, who are nearly half of the work force, deserve to be treated fairly. But they are not the only ones who are likely to benefit. Older people are often the most competent and conscientious workers, but employers may be too ignorant or biased to realize it. As the United States is thrust into an ever more competitive global economy, it cannot afford to let prejudice prevent it from having the best possible work force.

HEADLINE: China's Request for Art-Import Ban Stirs Debate

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY; Michael Zao contributed reporting from Beijing for this article.

 BODY:
As art dealers and collectors are descending on New York for the auctions, shows and lavish parties surrounding Asia Week, the attention of many is focused elsewhere -- on Washington, where the Bush administration is now considering restrictions on the importation of Chinese art and antiquities that could have serious implications for American museums and auction houses.
 Chinese officials have asked the State Department to impose the restrictions, on a wide range of artifacts from the prehistoric period through the early 20th century, because they believe that demand in the United States for Chinese antiquities has helped fuel a sharp increase in looting of archaeological sites and even thefts from museums over the last several years.
 Currently, United States Customs officials can reject the importation of items from China that are suspected of having been stolen or looted, but in practice relatively few items are seized. Under the proposed restrictions, which would most likely be made as part of a bilateral treaty, many artworks and artifacts could be prevented from entering unless they were specifically approved for export by the Chinese government. 
 The request has sparked an impassioned debate in the Asian-art world, in which many prominent archaeologists, preservationists and scholars have lined up to support the Chinese government, while many antiquities dealers and museum officials argue that the changes would be unfair, ineffective in stopping looting and devastating for the art market and for museums. 
 Opponents of the restrictions say that the United States represents only one part of a thriving international market for Chinese artifacts, including growing demand among wealthy collectors in China itself. And they contend that China has not done enough within its own borders to protect its cultural patrimony -- a key requirement under a 1983 United States art-importation law that offers help to countries that can show they are working to protect their cultural heritage in keeping with a 1970 United Nations agreement. 
 ''The statutory requirements have not been met -- it's as simple as that,'' said Ashton Hawkins, a former lawyer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and now president of the American Council for Cultural Policy, a New York-based group of museum officials and prominent art collectors. ''Until they are, this remedy should not be offered to China.''
 But supporters of stricter laws argue that China has made great strides in recent years in protecting archaeological and other cultural sites and in prosecuting pillagers, many of whom sell antiquities to smugglers for a tiny fraction of the price the items eventually fetch at foreign auctions. The supporters acknowledge that the United States is only one player in the world market, but they contend that it would set a powerful example by helping China stem the flow of plundered artifacts.
 ''The U.S. is a major market for the purchase of these antiquities that have been illegally dug up and illegally exported from China, and the United States ought to be leading the way on this,'' said Robert E. Murowchick, director of the International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History at Boston University. ''Once a site is gone, it's gone forever. You can't put it back together.''
 The looting of thousands of antiquities from Iraq since the American invasion in 2003 has heightened international concern about the threats to many countries' cultural treasures. Over the last few years, the trade in plundered Chinese artifacts has also drawn more attention in the United States because of several high-profile cases, including one in 2000 in which customs officials seized a 10th-century marble relief panel they said had been chiseled from an ancient tomb in northeastern China and was scheduled be sold at Christie's.
 Opponents of the changes argue that the United States may make up only 4 percent of international auction sales of Chinese antiquities, but some dealers say that a much larger percentage of such items sold around the world end up in the United States, a contention echoed in an interview yesterday with an official in China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage, which works to protect antiquities. ''The U.S. is a big part of this market,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 The 1983 law, in conjunction with the 1970 Unesco agreement, allows countries to ask the United States to restrict the import of cultural objects as a way to try to stop such pillaging. Over the last several years, 11 countries, including Cambodia and Mali, have been granted import restrictions under the law, which does not cover items that can be proved to have left their countries of origin before the curbs took effect.
 China's request is now being considered by a committee made up of 11 people -- including representatives from academia, the art trade and the museum world -- appointed by the White House to advise the State Department. There is no deadline for the panel to make a decision and, because most hearings and deliberations are closed to the public, there are also few indications of what the group may recommend. But China is unlikely to get everything it wants. For one thing, the 1983 law covers only cultural items at least 250 years old, so the 19th- and early-20th-century art China is seeking to protect is highly unlikely to be included in any treaty. And in previous cases with other countries, the committee and the State Department have not always granted all the requested import curbs -- for example, leaving out certain categories like coins or restricting items only from certain periods.
 The debate over the issue has illuminated what some see as a growing rift between museums and archaeologists over the proper ways of studying and preserving antiquities. Directors of four American museums -- the Art Institute of Chicago, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo. -- spoke out against China's request at a hearing in February on the issue. While officials from the Metropolitan Museum of Art did not attend, James C.Y. Watt, chairman of the Met's Asian art department, has in interviews been highly critical of archaeologists and their calls for tougher import restrictions.
 ''Archaeologists have overemphasized their own importance and used the present political and social atmosphere to behave in a way that is extremely damaging,'' Mr. Watt said in a 2002 interview in Orientations magazine, a publication for Asian art collectors. ''They should not be given a monopoly on the study of culture and antiquities.''
 He added: ''I am not in favor of illegal digging, but it is not something that can be stopped. In the first place, every time a farmer tills his field or a worker lays the foundation for a building, there is a chance they might uncover another ancient burial ground. Secondly, the economic situation in China is such that the material gain from finding just one little minor antiquity is so great in relation to the earnings of the typical worker that the temptations are too great to stop.''

HEADLINE: Port Authority to Replace PATH Fleet for $499 Million

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided yesterday to spend $499 million to replace its fleet of PATH trains, some of which are 40 years old, with 340 cars built by a Japanese company, Kawasaki Rail Car.
 The contract to design and build the cars, which was approved during a three-minute public meeting of the Port Authority's board of directors, will be the single biggest investment in the PATH system since it was created in the 1960's, said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority.
 It is part of an $809 million program to renovate the PATH system, which runs from downtown Newark to Lower Manhattan and Herald Square. The system carries about 200,000 riders each weekday. 
 The new fleet, which is expected to go into service between late 2008 and 2011, would sharply improve the PATH's reliability, Mr. Coscia said. Kawasaki has guaranteed that, on average, its cars will travel 160,000 miles between breakdowns, he said. They will also be more comfortable and easier to clean, he added.
 Mr. Coscia would not say if Kawasaki's bid was the lowest of the three the board considered, but he said it offered the ''best value'' because the total cost of acquiring, operating and maintaining the trains would be lowest with the Kawasaki cars. He also declined to identify the other bidders.
 Michael DePallo, the general manager of the PATH system, said the contract would provide a ''tremendous economic boost'' to the local economy because Kawasaki has promised to spend $128 million in the region on labor and parts. Kawasaki has an assembly plant in Yonkers, but makes the shells of its cars in Lincoln, Neb., a Port Authority spokesman said.
 Hiroji Iwasaki, a senior vice president at Kawasaki Rail Car's American headquarters in Yonkers, attended the meeting, but declined to comment about the contract. The company is a unit of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., which is based in Kobe, Japan.
 Kawasaki's first big assignment to build subway cars in America came from the Port Authority two decades ago. In 1986, it built the 94 cars that make up the fourth generation of the current PATH fleet. The oldest PATH cars were built in 1965.
 With an average age of 33 years, the fleet is the oldest of any heavy rail line in the country, Mr. DePallo said.
 Kawasaki also built many of the newest New York City subway trains, including the R142A cars that run on the Lexington Avenue line and the R143 cars on the L line. Kawasaki also formed a partnership with Alstom Transportation, a French company, to produce cars that will be known as R160's under a $961.7 million contract the Metropolitan Transportation Authority awarded in 2002.
 Mr. Coscia said the new PATH cars would be an updated version of the R142's the MTA bought. ''Our price on a per-car basis is actually lower than they paid, but we're getting better cars,'' Mr. Coscia said with a grin.
 He said the Port Authority has no plan to raise fares or tolls on the Hudson River bridges and tunnels to cover the cost of the trains. The money will come from $809 million the agency allocated in late 2003 for PATH improvements. He added that the agency had been hunting for ways to cut its annual expenses by $150 million, or about 10 percent, and has already identified potential savings of about $100 million.

HEADLINE: Your Car: Politics on Wheels

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
IT has always been tempting to think you can figure out who a person is and what he thinks by what he drives. That subject was raised recently by Chely Wright in her country and western hit, ''Bumper of My S.U.V.,'' in which she tells of a ''lady in a minivan'' giving her a vulgar hand gesture for driving a car with a Marines bumper sticker: 
 ''Does she think she knows what I stand for/Or the things that I believe/Just by looking at a sticker for the U.S. Marines/On the bumper of my S.U.V.?'' 
 The lady in the minivan might not know, but some of the finest minds in market research think they do. By analyzing new-car sales, surveying car owners and keeping count of political bumper stickers, they are identifying the differences between Democratic cars and Republican ones. 
 Among their findings: buyers of American cars tend to be Republican -- except, for some reason, those who buy Pontiacs, who tend to be Democrats. Foreign-brand compact cars are usually bought by Democrats -- but not Mini Coopers, which are bought by almost equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. And Volvos may not actually represent quite what you think.
 How valuable is this information? ''I think it's fun to talk about,'' the political analyst James Carville said, ''but I mean, you see a guy in a pickup truck with a rifle and a Confederate flag, and you know how he's going to vote anyway.'' But upon further reflection Mr. Carville acknowledged the value of the surveys. ''It actually does have some merit, especially when used in conjunction with other information about consumer habits. It can be a very accurate predictor.''
 Last year, the Republican National Committee applied data supplied by Scarborough Research, a New York market research firm, to a range of leisure-time and consumer activities to find where it could reach potential voters with advertising. Part of Scarborough's effort was to survey 200,000 car owners about their political affiliations.
 Scarborough found that Porsche owners identified themselves as Republican more often than owners of any other cars, with 59 percent calling themselves Republicans, 27 percent Democrats and the rest either calling themselves independents or declining to answer. Jaguars and Land Rovers also registered as very ''Republican'' vehicles. 
 Scarborough also determined that Volvos were the most ''Democratic'' cars, by 44 to 32 percent, followed by Subarus and Hyundais. But although a lot of old Volvos on the road are driven by Democrats, the customers in Volvo showrooms no longer fit the old stereotype, according to a survey of 163,000 new-car buyers last year that was conducted by CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore. 
 As Volvo's advertising has stressed performance in addition to safety, more and more Republicans are buying Volvos. The CNW survey last year showed that Democratic buyers of Volvo cars outnumbered Republicans by only 32 percent to 27 percent.
 ''Volvos have become more plush and bourgeois, which is a Republican thing to be,'' said Mickey Kaus, a dual expert in politics and cars as the author of the Kausfiles and Gearbox columns for Slate. ''Subaru is the new Volvo -- that is, it is what Volvos used to be: trusty, rugged, inexpensive, unpretentious, performs well, maybe a bit ugly. You don't buy it because you want to show you have money; you buy it because you have college-professor values.''
 The CNW survey, which measured political affiliation not just by make but also by model, found that a Jeep Grand Cherokee S.U.V. was more than half again as likely to be bought by a Republican than by a Democrat, at 46 percent to 28. Among Hummer buyers, the Republican-to-Democrat ratio was a whopping 52 to 23. 
 According to CNW's figures, staunch Democrats drive S.U.V.'s too, but they tend to prefer smaller, foreign-made ones. Republicans generally like them bigger and American-made, or at least bearing the name of an American company, even if they were built elsewhere. 
 The survey also found that minivans skewed blue, just as Chely Wright surmised in her song. At first glance, this might seem odd, because Republican car buyers tended to have more children -- 3.5 on average, versus 1.7 for the Democratic buyers. Explaining this apparent contradiction offers a look into the increasing exactitude marketers seem to be applying to the question of who drives what.
 ''You might think with all the kids, they'd want the practicality of a minivan,'' said Art Spinella, the president of CNW. But practicality was not the Republican customer's highest priority, as Mr. Spinella's company discovered by tracking the customers throughout the buying process. 
 ''There is a certain resistance that male new-car buyers have to minivans even in a household with two or three kids,'' Mr. Spinella explained. ''For the most part, red-state households are more male-dominated when it comes to decision-making for a vehicle. In blue states, it's more of a joint decision-making process.'' Because the Democratic women get more of a say in the decision, their families end up with more minivans than S.U.V.'s. 
 The Democrats also tend to consider a wider range of cars before buying. ''In red states, there's more affinity to specific brands or loyalty to the same brand they had before,'' Mr. Spinella said. ''A person in a red state will start with an average of 2.5 vehicles on the shopping list. In the blue states the average is 6.''
 The blue-staters, not surprisingly, are a lot more likely to put hybrid cars on their list: buyers of the Toyota Prius hybrid were Democrats by a 35 to 22 percent. Democrats in general are more fond of smaller cars (the Ford Escort and Dodge Neon both skewed blue by about 34 to 20), although energy efficiency is hardly the only reason. Besides having fewer children, Democrats tend to be younger, less affluent and more likely to live in cities where small cars are easier to park.
 Some of these differences have more to do with geography than personal politics. Democrats are concentrated in port cities with more links to Europe and Asia, making them more open to foreign car companies. Republicans are more likely to be living in the heartland, where there's room for bigger cars and a tradition of loyalty to the American cars built in nearby factories.
 But car buyers are also responding to the political images that come with some cars. Some foreign car companies have marketed cars as environmentally friendly, and some have at times focused on parts of the Democratic base. Saab and Subaru were the first and most visible to aim advertising at gay drivers. 
 Midsize and large American cars skew Republican, and so, of course, do big American pickup trucks. That may have something to do with American car companies marketing themselves through one of the great symbols of Republicanism, Nascar, which is enormously popular in the red states.
 ''Nascar has an American-made-only requirement for cars and a variety of other rules that discourage foreign makers from competing,'' said Steve Sailer, a conservative journalist who has analyzed the red-blue divide. ''Toyota has dipped its toe into Nascar's truck-racing series with its American-made trucks, but there isn't a lot of demand for Japanese participation.
 ''In truth, a lot of fans would be sore about ending the all-American monopoly. Nascar has become a covert ethnic-pride celebration for red-state whites of Northern European descent.'' 
 All surveys found that nothing is more Republican than a big pickup. ''The No. 1 vehicle bought by millionaires is the Ford F-Series pickup truck,'' Mr. Spinella said. ''They're farmers, ranchers, contractors, independent businesspeople. They basically work for themselves and they have substantial assets.''
 The Saab is a Democratic car, according to both CNW and Scarborough, which found that Saab owners were about twice as likely to be Democrats. It's an upscale car an affluent Democrat can drive without feeling guiltily ostentatious while also reveling in a different sort of status symbol, said the president of Scarborough, Bob Cohen.
 ''The Saab owner is not going after the obvious status symbol like a BMW,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''He wants to make a statement that he's in a small group with specialized knowledge who don't go for a safe choice like BMW, because he can get a better deal with a Saab.''
 A less affluent version of that car buyer might go for a Saturn, the offbeat brand of choice for aficionados who skew heavily Democratic, by 39 to 11 among last year's car buyers. Mr. Kaus says they appeal to Democrats because they are ''clunky, Earth Shoe-like cars.'' 
 SATURN owners were also prone to put their Democratic loyalties on display, at least according to a count undertaken by Political Bumpers, which was billed as ''an extremely unscientific'' project undertaken near the end of the presidential campaign last year.
 Volunteers counted more than 1,300 bumper stickers in a half dozen states from Sept. 20 to Oct. 31 and came up with results (www.laze.net/bumpers) that roughly jibed with the much larger market-research surveys. Like the larger surveys, the Political Bumpers totals added up to within a couple of percentage points of the 51-percent-to-48 result of the 2004 presidential election.
 The Political Bumpers spotters, who recorded bumper stickers in favor of or against any of the candidates in the 2004 election, found that the drivers of pickup trucks and large S.U.V.'s were overwhelmingly right-leaning. But the leader of the project, Ryan MacMichael, of Leesburg, Va., said his biggest surprise was the pronounced Democratic skew of bumper stickers on economy cars (71 percent were left-leaning) and station wagons (67 percent). 
 The most left-leaning models with at least a dozen sightings in Mr. MacMichael's project were the Honda Civic (80-20 left-leaning), Toyota Corolla (78-19) and Toyota Camry (74-26). The list of most right-leaning was led by another Toyota, but a midsize S.U.V., the Toyota 4Runner (86-14), followed by the Ford Expedition (76-24) and Ford F-150 (75-25).
 To Mr. Spinella, those bumper stickers merely provided further proof of the most fundamental difference between the two parties.
 ''Democrats buy cars,'' he said. ''Republicans buy trucks.''

HEADLINE: Jets Win Stadium Battle by 2 Touchdowns (the Vote Is 14-0)

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted unanimously yesterday to sell control of its West Side railyards to the Jets for about $210 million, after several members said the long-term gains from having a football stadium and convention center on the site outweighed a rival bid that offered nearly twice as much money up front.
 The vote was a milestone in one of the most bitter land-use disputes in New York City in recent years, and it is certain to draw a legal challenge from Cablevision, the stadium opponent whose $400 million offer was rejected by the board. Company lawyers said the Cablevision lawsuit, to be filed shortly, would accuse the board of violating its responsibility to do what is best for the transit system and to accept the higher offer.
 Just before the 14-to-0 vote, several board members took the rare step of explaining their reasoning -- a tacit recognition that lawsuits will almost certainly be filed. In an unusual dissent, three nonvoting members who represent transit riders and workers said they would reject the deal, if they could. 
 The authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, argued that the Jets' plan would be of greater benefit to the city, because it would assure the city's intention of extending the No. 7 subway line to the west, and would make it possible for the agency to sell development rights for the stadium property. Several members said those rights -- which they said could be transferred to nearby properties to allow higher buildings -- could be worth as much as $1 billion over time. 
 Both arguments were fairly new, and may have represented an effort by the board to justify its reasoning in preparation for a lawsuit. 
 Mr. Kalikow has up to now not been enthusiastic about the No. 7 project -- one reason the city agreed to pay the $2 billion cost of the one-mile extension. And the authority's ability to sell development rights for nearby properties depends on the state of the real estate market, and is far from certain. In a market downturn, those rights could be worth much less than the nearly $1 billion estimated by the authority, and the city will already be selling rights from other nearby parcels, diminishing the value further.
 The boardroom at the authority's Midtown headquarters overflowed with spectators, some of whom had waited in line since 5 a.m. Over two hours, until 11:30 a.m., 41 people testified. Most urged the board to reject all offers or to delay its decision, arguing that the truncated bidding process slanted the auction in favor of the Jets. 
 Mr. Kalikow ended one-on-one talks with the Jets only last month and hastily called for an open auction. But the authority ultimately looked at only three bids, rejecting a third offer by an energy firm that made its bid contingent on the purchase of energy from the company.
 Last week, seeking to bolster their bid, the Jets brought together six developers who agreed to pay $440 million for unused development rights over the railyard if the city would rezone the site, a process that could take at least a year. But the authority had warned against contingent bids, and yesterday Mr. Kalikow rejected the $440 million addition without discussion. Also, the Jets' previous $280 million part of the bid was discounted to $210 million, after a maintenance fund was subtracted and long-term payouts were adjusted.
 Yesterday, the chairman banged a wooden gavel repeatedly, trying to quell a chorus of boos and hisses that erupted every few minutes from the audience and highlighted the striking divisions the dispute has spawned. 
 Co-op activists, community board leaders and elderly residents of Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen applauded well-heeled lawyers for Cablevision. Union leaders wearing nylon-satin jackets cheered African-American city councilmen who said the stadium would be a boon for jobless black and Hispanic workers.
 The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, told the board that it had forsaken the public's trust. He noted that the stadium would cost city and state taxpayers $600 million to build a platform over the yards, while Cablevision would pay for the platform itself. 
 ''This is a terrible mistake,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I urge you to take a step back and really consider whether it is worth it to this subway, bus and transit system to give away this much taxpayer money to build a football stadium we don't want and we don't need.''
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who like Mr. Miller is running for mayor, was just as blunt.
 ''You're going to be sued,'' said Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens. ''You're going to have to explain in court over months and months and months, and perhaps years, why it is that you chose a lower bid.''
 It fell to James S. Simpson, the chairman of the board's planning and real estate committee, to offer the most thorough defense of the board's position. The Cablevision offer would be worth taking if the transit system were desperate for cash and about to default on its bonds, he said, adding: ''But that's not the case. I think we need to take the longer-term view.''
 Mr. Simpson argued that selling the development rights in future years would bring in more money than Cablevision's cash up front.
 ''We can't think of ourselves strictly as a transportation company,'' he said. ''We are part of, and the most important part of, the economic engine of the City of New York.''
 Mr. Miller and another council member, Christine C. Quinn, said the City Council was unlikely to approve any transfer of development rights that would make the adjoining neighborhoods more dense than they already are. ''That money will never be seen by the authority,'' said Ms. Quinn, a vocal stadium opponent.
 Of the board's six nonvoting members, the three who stayed for the entire meeting were united in their dissent. 
 The stadium is still far from being authorized, requiring approval from leaders in Albany that may be difficult to obtain. Nonetheless, at a victory party at the Roosevelt Hotel, the Jets' president, L. Jay Cross, said, ''This morning the M.T.A. paved the way to our future.''

HEADLINE: Plagues of a Dismal Quarter: Oil Prices and Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For the stock market, the first quarter was not even a fair fight.
 With the price of crude oil rising to a record $56.72 a barrel, longer-term interest rates jumping more than half a percentage point and Federal Reserve policy makers worrying out loud about inflationary pressures, what else could have been expected?
 Despite the best daily rally of the year on Wednesday -- when the three main market gauges jumped more than 1.3 percent -- the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 2.6 percent for the quarter, while the Nasdaq composite index plunged 8.1 percent. With small declines yesterday, all three are near their lows for the year. 
 ''The first quarter was dismal,'' said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors. ''It's not just that stocks went down, it's that investors have become risk adverse,'' as they shifted from stocks to cash, bonds to cash and to the safer sectors of the stock market.
 From here on, many analysts have said recently, the outlook for stocks depends whether the price of crude oil falls back below $50 a barrel, whether inflation forces Fed policy makers to accelerate their rate increases and how much the economy and corporate earnings slow down in the second half of the year. 
 If oil prices do not fall, ''the stock market will continue to struggle and investors will play it on the safe side,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 A test for stocks and the economic outlook comes today with the release of the March jobs report. Wall Street expects to hear that 213,000 new jobs were created last month, down from 262,000 in February, according to Bloomberg News. A much higher number, although a signal of growth, would probably scare the stock and bond markets by fueling fears of faster Fed rate increases and higher inflation.
 There was a little positive inflation news yesterday: the price measure of expenditures for personal consumption, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in February and only 1.6 percent over the previous 12 months. Forecasters had feared the numbers would be higher.
 A 7 percent first-quarter decline in the S.&P.'s financial sector, and a drop of 5.9 percent in the consumer discretionary sector, reflected worries about higher interest rates and slower economic growth in the future. Utilities rose 4.4 percent, indicating that many investors were looking for a place to hide. Consumer staples, which also are often regarded as a haven, managed to rise 0.2 percent. 
 Energy, with the rise in the price of oil, was the best performer, up 17.1 percent. Telecommunications and information technology were the worst, falling 8.6 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, accounting for the steep fall in the Nasdaq.
 EBay and Microsoft were the biggest drags on the S.&P. 500 in the quarter, reflecting technology's weakness and accounting for 6.1 points, or 18.5 percent, of the S.&P.'s total decline of 33 points.
 American International Group, the insurance giant that has now acknowledged improper accounting, was responsible for 8.6 percent of the S.&P.'s decline. The departure of A.I.G.'s chairman, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the conviction of Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive officer at WorldCom, may have been unwelcome reminder to many investors that Wall Street has yet to clean up its act.
 Without a decline in the price of crude oil, which jumped 2.6 percent yesterday, to $55.40 a barrel, investors will be facing two big worries: that high oil prices will slow growth and hurt corporate earnings, or that high oil prices will jack up inflationary pressures, which would eat into future earnings and push interest rates up -- both bad for stocks.
 To this uncertainty about the impact of oil prices add the new stance of Federal Reserve policy makers, who said after their March meeting that they were seeing signs of inflationary pressures. Investors are now much more worried that the Fed will raise its benchmark short-term interest rate faster and higher.
 Since that policy meeting on March 22, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has jumped as high as 4.64 percent and as of yesterday, at 4.48 percent, was still up half a percentage point from its 2005 low of 3.99 percent on Feb. 9.
 At the same time, some economists are scaling back their growth forecasts for the second half of the year. Anthony Chan, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, expects economic growth of around 3.6 percent in the last six months of the year, down from over 4 percent in the first six months. And, he said, ''if we were revising it, I would probably revise it downward from here.'' 
 In the next two months, the course of the stock market will depend a lot on whether new economic data calm fears of inflation and higher interest rates. Another big factor will be corporate earnings for the first quarter and company outlooks for the months ahead. The rush of earnings announcements begins in two weeks.
 While fourth-quarter earnings were strong at 19.7 percent, Wall Street analysts expect the growth rate to slow. Still, the current first-quarter estimate of 8.1 percent growth, compared with the first quarter of 2004, is up half a percentage point since the beginning of the year, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Among the few comforts for investors in the bleak first quarter was the dollar, which managed to hold its own, staving off for now worries of a sharp fall that could disrupt financial markets. The dollar's rally has reduced returns for Americans investing abroad, however.
 While deal making helped fuel the market's rally late year, the continued wave of mergers apparently failed to have the same result. There were $264 billion in deals announced in the United States in the first quarter, level with the $263.7 billion announced in the fourth quarter. 
 The first quarter was also noted for the absence of stock market volatility. The Dow rose or fell 1 percent or more only five days last quarter, in contrast to 15 days in last year's first quarter and 25 days in the first quarter of 1999. For the Nasdaq, the number of days with moves of 1 percent or more was 15, down from 25 last year and 40 in 1999.
 Still, the ride was a roller coaster to nowhere, with the S.&P. 500 falling 4 percent to a 2005 low and then rebounding 5.3 percent its highest close since the summer of 2001 -- only to fall 3.6 percent by quarter's end. 
 ''The market is just trendless,'' said Paul Hickey, United States equity analyst at Birinyi Associates.
 In trading yesterday, the Dow fell 37.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,503.76, while the S.&P. 500 slipped 0.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,180.59. The Nasdaq dropped 6.44 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,999.23.

 Now we have another wrong turn by the Bush administration. Instead of selling Pakistan fighter planes, we should be opening our markets to its textile industry. This would promote long-term economic growth and reduce the poverty and desperation that cause terrorism. It would also show that our commitment is to foster economic freedom rather than to arm an authoritarian government with repressive firepower. 
 Just look back to the arms sales to Iraq in the 1980's. If we sell these powerful weapons to Pakistan today, we will surely regret it in the future.

To the Editor:
 ''Fuel for South Asia's Arms Race'' criticizes the Bush administration for allowing the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, suggesting that weapons purchases are at the root of Pakistan's problems. But security provides the environment in which one can focus on reform, economic and otherwise.
 It is no surprise that Pakistan's gross domestic product will grow more than 7 percent this year, while the country tackles education reform head on. The Bush administration understands the importance of a credible national defense and is rightly helping a critical ally feel secure.
 After all, an insecure country is a dangerous country.

HEADLINE: Audit Firm Facing Risk Of Lawsuits Over A.I.G.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Where was the auditor?
 The insurance giant American International Group disclosed on Wednesday that it had accounted improperly for certain transactions with other insurance and reinsurance companies and that some of the questionable transactions may have occurred more than a decade ago. 
 In the intervening years, the company filed various regulatory reports and statements, which were approved by A.I.G.'s longtime auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
 The accounting firm could now find itself facing a wave of lawsuits brought by shareholders and bondholders asserting that they relied on those regulatory filings when making investments. 
 Accounting firms have many defenses to lawsuits in such situations, securities lawyers said. ''The federal securities laws establish liability for auditors in registration statements, but at the same time provide auditors with the ability to establish a due diligence defense,'' said Joseph Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 In other words, the accounting firm can assert that it did nothing wrong, asked the right questions, checked the right numbers and should not be liable.
 ''The challenge in the current environment,'' Mr. Grundfest said, ''is that there is not a lot of case law as to the substance of the due diligence defense.''
 ''This situation has unfortunately become so common over the last several years,'' he said, ''that the audit firms have likely developed a fire drill scenario for addressing such contingencies.''
 A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment yesterday.
 The statement released this week by A.I.G. suggests that some transactions with improper accounting may date back to 1991. Some of the transactions that have drawn scrutiny, according to the statement, took place in December 2000 and March 2001 between an A.I.G. subsidiary and a subsidiary of the General Re Corporation, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. Other issues involve reinsurance companies that were characterized as independent entities but may have to be reclassified as distinctly related to A.I.G. 
 Since December 2000, A.I.G. has issued billions of dollars in stock and bonds, according to regulatory filings. Lawyers say that the filings would probably be the basis for lawsuits by shareholders and debtholders, who would argue that if they had known the company's true financial condition, they would have paid less for the stock and would have demanded a higher interest rate on the debt.
 ''You're having your own forensic accountants -- which all of us now have on our staff -- forensic accountants with auditing experience,'' said Paul Geller, a partner at Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins, a plaintiff-side securities law firm. ''We're going through all of the public filings and we're looking for red flags.'' 
 Accounting firms can also argue that any adjustments to A.I.G.'s financial statements are so small, given the size of the company, that the changes did not harm investors.
 Correcting the accounting for the Gen Re transaction, for example, ''will have virtually no impact on A.I.G.'s financial condition as of Dec. 31, 2004,'' A.I.G. said, ''but will reduce the reserve for losses and loss expenses by $250 million and increase other liabilities by $245 million.''
 But accounting firms face another challenge because of the increasing willingness to name them, law firms and investment banks as defendants in shareholder lawsuits.
 In the past, such firms could more easily avoid having to go to trial on the claims against them by arguing that they should not be held liable for wrongdoing at the company if they did not actively participate in any misdeeds.
 ''For a while there, it was very, very difficult for auditors, law firms, investment banks to be held liable for the underlying fraud,'' Mr. Geller said. ''It's getting easier.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Clinton Adviser to Admit Taking Classified Papers

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
Samuel R. Berger, a national security adviser to President Bill Clinton, has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and give up his security clearance for three years for removing classified material from a government archive, the Justice Department and associates of Mr. Berger's said Thursday.
 A respected figure in foreign policy circles for years, Mr. Berger has also agreed to pay a $10,000 fine as part of an agreement reached recently with the Justice Department after months of quiet negotiations, the associates said. 
 He is expected to enter his plea on Friday in United States District Court here, capping an embarrassing episode that reverberated in last year's presidential campaign.
 Mr. Berger was a senior policy adviser to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee, and was often mentioned as a possible secretary of state in a Kerry presidency. But he quit the campaign abruptly in July after accusations surfaced that he had inappropriately removed classified material from a secure reading room at the National Archives.
 The material involved a classified assessment of terrorist threats in 2000, which Mr. Berger was reviewing in his role as the Clinton administration's point man in providing material to the independent commission investigating the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Officials with the Archives and the Sept. 11 commission ultimately determined that despite the incident, the commission had access to all the material needed in its work.
 When the issue surfaced last year, Mr. Berger insisted that he had removed the classified material inadvertently. But in the plea agreement reached with prosecutors, he is expected to admit that he intentionally removed copies of five classified documents, destroyed three and misled staff members at the National Archives when confronted about it, according to an associate of Mr. Berger's who is involved in his defense but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plea has not been formalized in court.
 The Justice Department, without discussing details, acknowledged that Mr. Berger had said he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor count for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents.
 Mr. Berger, 59, was unavailable for comment Thursday. In a statement, his lawyer, Lanny Breuer, said that Mr. Berger ''has cooperated fully with the Department of Justice and is pleased that a resolution appears very near.''
 ''He accepts complete responsibility for his actions, and regrets the mistakes he made during his review of documents at the National Archives,'' Mr. Breuer said, adding that Mr. Berger ''looks forward to putting this episode behind him very soon and continuing his career of public and private service to this country.''
 It is unclear what impact the case will have on Mr. Berger's future in government. While the plea agreement requires him to give up his secret security clearance for three years, it allows him to have it reviewed and restored within that time if the government asks him to serve on a panel or in another position with access to secret material, associates said. But some political analysts said the case against him, which Republican leaders seized on last year in accusing him of imperiling national security, may have made him unemployable in government in the short term. He is currently chairman of a global business strategy firm.
 The charge carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail, but the plea agreement, which must be approved by a judge, does not call for jail time.
 The criminal charge stems from Mr. Berger's removal of documents from the National Archives on two occasions during his review of material for the Sept. 11 commission.
 On Sept. 2, 2003, in a daylong review of documents, Mr. Berger took a copy of a lengthy White House ''after-action'' report that he had commissioned to assess the government's performance in responding to the so-called millennium terrorist threat before New Year's 2000, and he placed the document in his pocket, the associate said. A month later, in another Archives session, he removed four copies of other versions of the report, the associate said.
 Mr. Berger's intent, the associate said, was to compare the different versions of the 2000 report side by side and trace changes.
 ''He was just too tired and wasn't able to focus enough, and he felt like he needed to look at the documents in his home or his office to line them up,'' the associate said. ''He now admits that was a real mistake.''
 Mr. Berger admits to compounding the mistake after removing the second set of documents on Oct. 2, 2003, the associate said. In comparing the versions at his office later that day, he realized that several were essentially the same, and he cut three copies into small pieces, the associate said. He also admitted to improperly removing handwritten notes he had taken at the Archives, the associate said.
 Two days later, staff members at the Archives confronted Mr. Berger, and he now admits to misleading the Archives about what had happened. He indicated that the removal was inadvertent, and though he returned the two remaining copies of the report, he said nothing about the three he had destroyed, the associate said.

HEADLINE: Medicare Costs Rise, So Premiums Will, Too

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
Medicare spending for doctors' services shot up 15 percent last year, and beneficiaries will have to pay premiums of $89 a month in 2006, up $11 from the current level, the Bush administration said Thursday. 
 Doctors are billing Medicare for longer, more intensive office visits, more laboratory tests, more frequent and complex imaging procedures and more prescription drugs given to patients in their offices, the administration said.
 Federal officials said Medicare will cut the payment for each physician service by 4.3 percent next year unless Congress intervenes. Any action to prevent those cuts would further increase Medicare spending and premiums, they said. 
 But doctors said that if the cuts took effect, many physicians would be less willing to take elderly and disabled patients covered by Medicare.
 Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, provided the new data in a letter to a federal advisory panel. He expressed ''great concern'' about the rapid increase in Medicare spending.
 His tone on Thursday differed from that of senior Bush administration officials last week. Eight days ago, John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary; and Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said the financial problems of Social Security were more severe and urgent than those of Medicare. 
 Under federal law, premiums are set each year to cover about 25 percent of projected spending under Part B of Medicare, which pays for doctors' services and other outpatient care. When such spending increases, so do premiums.
 Beneficiaries now pay a premium of $78.20 a month. The administration said last week that the premium would rise to $87.70 next year. On Thursday, Medicare officials raised their estimate to $89.20. That amounts to a 34 percent increase in two years, from $66.60 in 2004.
 Those numbers do not include the cost of the Medicare prescription drug benefit that becomes available in January. Those premiums are expected to average $35 a month.
 Dr. J. James Rohack, chairman of the American Medical Association, attributed some of the increase in spending to research breakthroughs, new drugs and technology approved for coverage under Medicare, and screenings for cancer and diabetes encouraged by the government.
 ''It's not surprising that the volume of physician services has gone up,'' Dr. Rohack said. ''We're providing better care. For a patient with heart failure, I often prescribe a powerful medication known as carvedilol, or Coreg. But I may need to see the patient every three weeks for six months to set the proper dosage. I see the patients more often to keep them out of the hospital.''
 Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, said that payments to doctors and other health care professionals under the Medicare fee schedule totaled $88.3 billion last year, up from $76.7 billion in 2003. 
 The payments are calculated under a complex formula that sets goals for spending each year, based partly on economic growth. If spending repeatedly exceeds the goals, Medicare reduces the fees that would otherwise be paid to doctors in later years.
 In a report issued on Thursday, the Bush administration said the ''allowed expenditures'' this year were $79.9 billion, far less than the ''estimated actual expenditures'' of $92.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Insurers' Trails Lead to Dublin

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY and TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN; Brian Lavery reported from Dublin for this article and Timothy L. O'Brien from New York.

DATELINE: DUBLIN, March 31 

 BODY:
Inside a sprawling complex of emerald-green glass towers, where derelict shipyards once lined the River Liffey, financiers have helped transform this city into one of the world's most innovative insurance providers. They have also turned Dublin into an unlikely hot spot in a growing insurance scandal that has toppled chief executives and even pulled the investing legend Warren E. Buffett into its orbit.
 Regulators around the world have followed several trails of suspect financial transactions back to Ireland, which more than a decade ago instituted accommodating tax and regulatory standards aimed at encouraging insurers to set up shop here. At the center of those investigations is the General Re Corporation, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company that includes Mr. Buffett's insurance operations. 
 Investigators are exploring General Re in connection with possible financial manipulation at some of the world's largest and most prestigious insurers. General Re, which has a substantial presence here, is just one among dozens of companies that have enjoyed a surge in business since first venturing to Dublin in the early 1990's. 
 Dublin's insurance boom came on the heels of a natural disaster. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew ravaged southern Florida and Louisiana, causing more than $25 billion in damage and forcing insurers to pay a host of claims. Some insurers, battered by the losses, were hesitant to take on large risks after that disaster. That spawned a new breed of competitors in Bermuda willing to fill the gap. Another crop of insurers chose to hopscotch past the Caribbean and locate here.
 The city's insurance industry is based in a 40-acre self-contained business park, the International Financial Services Center, where the Irish government offers a corporate tax rate far below the rates other large European Union members impose on companies. The center is home to hundreds of concerns that employ about 16,000 people. Aided by what even members of the Irish Parliament fondly call the ''light touch'' of the country's financial regulators, Dublin has promoted an entrepreneurial culture that allows billion-dollar insurance companies to open their doors and begin selling policies in a matter of weeks.
 In 2003, the most recent year with data available, 56 international insurance and reinsurance companies in Dublin wrote gross premiums worth at least 14 billion euros ($18 billion), and held around 45 billion euros ($58 billion) in assets, according to the industry's lobbying arm, the Dublin International Insurance and Management Association. Despite handsome compensation, Dublin's insurance executives tend to keep a low profile and disdain ostentatious displays of wealth.
 ''People are working too hard to be caring about their egos,'' said Sarah Goddard, head of the insurance association. 
 An educated work force, a good family environment and Dublin's cosmopolitan attractions have also drawn insurers. Despite its wet weather, Dublin has other pluses compared with balmier insurance locales like Bermuda, including more available housing, parking spaces and long-term visas.
 But along with its reputation for innovation, Dublin has become known in the insurance industry as something of the Wild West of European finance, a perception that helped prompt the creation of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority two years ago. 
 Despite its mandate for stricter oversight, the agency has yet to impose major sanctions on any Irish institution, even though Ireland has recently experienced several major banking scandals. But industry representatives dispute the idea that Ireland may be home to unchecked financial frauds. 
 ''I don't regard this regime as being in any way lax,'' said Aileen O'Donoghue, director of Financial Services Ireland, a trade group. ''We certainly wouldn't be selling ourselves as fast and loose.''
 Even so, investigators and regulators in the United States, Australia and Europe are examining General Re's role in selling policies that, in some cases, may have helped paper over weaknesses at insurers and other companies. 
 In at least one case, such policies may have contributed to a major financial collapse. In many instances, financial technicians working for a General Re unit here known as the ''alternative solutions group'' devised complex, newfangled insurance products that have drawn investigative scrutiny and have come back to haunt Berkshire and other major insurance companies.
 ''The vast majority of the world doesn't regulate reinsurance because it's a business-to-business operation,'' Ms. Goddard said. ''These are all big boys playing the same game together.''
 The centerpiece of the current round of inquiries is an arcane product called finite reinsurance. Insurers buy reinsurance to limit their own exposure to catastrophic claims. Finite reinsurance is used to soften the impact of claims paid out over a long period. While finite products are at the center of current inquiries, analysts say that the entire reinsurance business, much of it in offshore locales like Ireland and Bermuda, is plagued by poor documentation and weak regulation.
 ''They are very much handshake, frenzied types of transactions; that has always been the culture of the business,'' said Keith Buckley, a managing director and head of the insurance group at Fitch Ratings. ''It's been something of the good-old-boy type of network, with a somewhat lackadaisical approach to documentation and other things that still exists in the reinsurance departments of too many companies.''
 Dublin has attracted numerous reinsurers enamored of Ireland's advantages, particularly affiliates of American and German companies. Henning Ludolphs, managing director of the Irish division of Hannover Re of Germany, said that a low cost base was a significant reason reinsurance companies, among other financial institutions, initially set up operations here. 
 ''In the early days of '92 or '93, it was a reasonably affordable place to do business,'' and an easy place to start a company because of the accommodating stance of the Irish government, Mr. Ludolphs said. The strong euro and Ireland's soaring inflation rate in the late 1990's have eroded those cost advantages, but Dublin is cheaper -- ''a couple of times'' so -- than Bermuda as a place to do business, he added.
 Cologne Re, another German reinsurer, was among the pioneers of the Irish industry in the early 1990's. General Re acquired a controlling stake in Cologne Re in 1994, and Berkshire, in turn, acquired General Re in June 1998. A Cologne Re executive, John Houldsworth, oversaw the company's business here in the early 1990's and he later became a senior member of General Re's alternative solutions group.
 Regulators and investigators said that the group was at the center of two high-profile finite reinsurance investigations, one in Australia and the other in the United States.
 Australian regulators said that a troubled insurer named FAI used finite products to feign profitability shortly before HIH Insurance Ltd., a fast-growing Australian conglomerate, bought it in 1998. HIH collapsed four years ago beneath the weight of ill-considered acquisitions like FAI and other problems. 
 Mr. Houldsworth and five other General Re executives were involved in improprieties related to the FAI transactions, Australian regulators said. In October, the regulators permanently barred all the executives from Australia's insurance industry. Regulators say that Mr. Houldsworth and another executive, Tore Ellingsen, continue to work for another General Re unit in Dublin, where Mr. Houldsworth oversees finite reinsurance operations. 
 In December, Australian regulators barred another General Re executive, Milan Vukelic, for the FAI deal, but reinstated him on appeal. Mr. Vukelic is now the chief executive of the Faraday Group, a General Re unit based in London. Mr. Houldsworth, Mr. Ellingsen and Mr. Vukelic declined to comment. 
 In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, are investigating a questionable finite transaction between General Re and the American International Group that originated in Dublin in late 2000 and involved Ronald E. Ferguson, General Re's chief executive at the time. Regulators say the transaction artificially increased A.I.G.'s premium reserves, ultimately helping its stock price and its ability to acquire another company. 
 Mr. Buffett will be meeting with American regulators and law enforcement officials on April 11 to discuss that transaction. Mr. Spitzer's office considers Mr. Buffett to be a witness in the investigation, not a target, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. Berkshire has said repeatedly that its chairman had no knowledge of improprieties related to the transaction and that his subordinates are responsible for decisions made by units like General Re.
 Regardless of whether the perception of lax regulation is justified in Ireland, the rules governing reinsurance in Europe are due to change soon. A European Union directive currently under discussion and scheduled to take effect next year will establish a regulatory framework spanning the 25-country union. It will mandate closer scrutiny than that provided by the current Irish system, in which one of the chief regulatory requirements is that an insurer notify authorities whenever there is a change on its board.

PERSON: Terence D. Tolbert

HEADLINE: From Harlem, for Bloomberg, With No Regrets

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
UNDER a sign that reads, ''Go Ahead, Make My Pork Chop,'' Terence D. Tolbert, the Harlem-centric Democrat who is stiffing his own party to help a billionaire Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, seek re-election, is transferring a blue-and-yellow stress ball from hand to hand like a hot potato. It is a feat he performs with utmost agility and no apparent stress. 
 He seems fully recovered from the mysterious chest pains -- he swears they weren't guilt-induced -- that sent him to the hospital during his first week on the job as a Bloomberg operative, provoking concern from his new colleagues. One phoned the hospital to ask him if the Bloomberg camp ''had a lemon'' on its hands. 
 ''Jokingly,'' notes Mr. Tolbert, a jovial type himself.
 He stops the ball-play long enough to explain the presence of the pork chop sign. It is one of the few decorative touches -- the Nevada license plates from his previous gig as (talk about contrasts) director of America Coming Together, a nonprofit group dedicated to electing progressive Democrats, are another -- in his cubicle at the mayor's bullpen-style Midtown campaign headquarters. ''I call it the pit,'' Mr. Tolbert says. 
 His sign, a gag gift from a friend, is a tribute to his culinary prowess. As his girth attests, Mr. Tolbert, 40, is comfortable cooking or eating most anything except turkey wings, a holdover boycott from childhood. His grandmother, who raised him in the St. Nicholas projects and taught him to cook, sew, and do laundry the old-fashioned way, via washboard, was militant about making him eat his turkey wings. Or he went hungry.
 As for the stress ball, that is an item he orders in bulk before starting any campaign, and he keeps a black one on his desk in the office of Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright of Harlem, for whom he is chief of staff when he's not out putting his grass-roots imprimatur on candidates. 
 ''The ball doesn't alleviate any stress,'' he admits. And the contradictions don't stop there. 
 It has been a harsh couple of months since he signed on, for an impressive $15,000 per month, as a senior adviser to the Bloomberg campaign instead of toeing the party line and taking a similar, though less lucrative, campaign post with the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller. The Miller contingent, he says, pursued him ardently. But he couldn't commit. Not when he believed the best candidate for the job was the incumbent. Would it have been better for his street cred to sit this one out? Possibly. Mr. Wright, with whom he enjoys what he calls a Batman and Robin relationship, warned him that it might be a hard road back to Harlem.
 ''But campaigns are in my blood,'' he says. ''I can't watch from the outside.'' 
 Mr. Tolbert has 20 campaigns on his resume since breaking into the business in 1989, but this is the first time he's thrown his clout behind a Republican (not counting the fact that two years ago he improbably married one, Freida Foster-Tolbert, a deputy director for community affairs for the Pataki administration). He says Mr. Bloomberg is the only Republican he could work for. He is unrepentant despite scads of ''political claptrap'' regarding his defection to stump for a guy who, lest anybody forget, used to be a Democrat. 
 He denies he was hired simply to mobilize the black vote, a role he played in John Edwards's presidential primary campaign: ''Yes, I happen to be African-American by an accident of birth, but when somebody says, 'So, you're the black political strategist for Michael Bloomberg,' I say, ''No, I'm a senior adviser.' I don't care if you're black, white, green or yellow: a vote for Mike Bloomberg is a vote for New York.''
 He says he and Mr. Bloomberg are on the same ideological page on education, housing, commerce, health care, even the West Side stadium, and claims they differ on few issues except capital punishment -- the mayor opposes it, he doesn't. He says they even agree on lunch: burgers or pizza.
 THERE are some Democrats out there who don't deserve to be Democrats,'' he says, ''and there are some Republicans who deserve to be Democrats.'' Interesting logic. ''At my age I can decide who I want to help and who I don't. I've always believed good government is supposed to serve the people, but if you don't win, you can't govern. I feel the mayor deserves four more years. He came into office when the city had been ruined economically and spiritually by 9/11 and brought it back from the brink. He has a good mind for business, which is what government is, a big business that needs to be reined in and controlled.''
 Since crossing the party divide, Mr. Tolbert, a Hunter College grad, has been branded a mercenary and denies it: he says he took the job before learning his salary. At a recent fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton, he heard someone say, ''Oh, it's the traitor.'' Meaning him. At the unveiling of an Adam Clayton Powell statue in Harlem, it was, ''Here comes Bloomberg's money.'' 
 But Mr. Tolbert, whose dream of attending the Air Force Academy and being the first African-American pilot on the moon was derailed by faulty eyesight, isn't cracking. He unbuttons his gold micro-suede jacket and flashes an anti-Bush T-shirt from his Nevada stint. ''I'm still a Democrat,'' he says. ''One of the nice things about making more money is I can make contributions to Democratic candidates I support.'' In every race but one.

HEADLINE: Irish Financial Regulator Faces Its First Major Test

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY

DATELINE: DUBLIN, March 31 

 BODY:
Regulators at Ireland's fledgling financial watchdog are facing the test of a lifetime as the trail of a suspect reinsurance transaction brings investigators to Dublin. 
 The agency, which is cooperating with Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, in his inquiry into American International Group and General Re, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, is still best known here for publishing reports on consumer-friendly products like home insurance. The typical warning tends to be: shop around. 
 ''They don't have enough of a track record to say how efficient or effective they are,'' said Richard Bruton, parliamentary finance spokesman for the Fine Gael opposition party. 
 ''There was no effort to say, post-Enron, was our system really up to speed?''
 The agency, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, has its roots in the late 1990's, when a handful of European countries established financial watchdogs. 
 By the time the Irish government had followed suit, the public clamor for tighter rules was deafening because of a series of scandals that shook the country's banking sector. In one case, an investment banker had stolen $2.5 million from private clients; in another, a retail bank had encouraged customers to dodge taxes with illegal offshore accounts.
 Political wrangling over who would control the new body delayed its creation by nearly five years. The scandals continued, meanwhile, as did new tax-avoidance schemes. In one, a trader at Ireland's biggest financial institution, Allied Irish Banks, lost more than $700 million in fraudulent foreign exchange deals. In 2004, when Allied Irish, the largest bank on the Irish Stock Exchange, was found to be overcharging its own customers on foreign exchange transactions, the regulatory authority was up and running, but it still lacked the legal ability to impose penalties or sanctions.
 Critics say that its official status as a subsidiary of the Central Bank of Ireland means that it is not truly independent, and they worry about its ability to regulate nontraditional businesses, like hedge funds and reinsurance, which have grown substantially in Ireland. But its supporters say that links to the Central Bank keep Ireland's best economic minds under one roof.
 Ireland, like most European countries, does not fully regulate reinsurance companies, which must simply provide evidence of financial solvency and notification of their directors and executives. That will change over the next few years, as domestic legislation and directives from the European Union require stronger enforcement powers. 
 In the meantime, the agency, which is nearly two years old, seems reluctant to adopt the confrontational stance of American investigators.
 ''We are satisfied with the corrective actions taken to date by Cologne Re and will continue to actively monitor the situation,'' an authority spokeswoman, Jill Forde, wrote in an e-mail interview. (General Re acquired a controlling stake in Cologne Re in 1994.)
 Executives of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority declined to comment.
 ''Key to our principles-based approach to regulation is that the people in top positions in firms are subject to regular scrutiny,'' Ms. Forde wrote.
 ''People in the top level of institutions are required to be vigilant in the running of their business and will be held to account.'' 
 Even if it is simply the reputation of Ireland's financial sector, there is a lot at stake. More than one in every 40 people working in the country is employed in financial services.

HEADLINE: Duties to Rise On Some Items From U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa for this article.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 31 

 BODY:
The European Union and Canada said Thursday that they would impose trade sanctions on a variety of American goods in retaliation for a tax system that compensates American manufacturers deemed to have been hurt by foreign goods sold below cost.
 Beginning May 1, the European Commission and Canada will raise import duties 15 percent on a range of American products. In Europe, pocket diaries, women's trousers and frozen sweet corn are among the $28 million in exports that will be taxed more heavily. Canada will impose the duty on some $11.5 million in American exports of cigarettes, pigs, oysters and specialty fish. 
 Though the amount of goods is quite modest in trans-Atlantic trade terms, European officials feared the move could cast a shadow over the dispute about government aid to Airbus and Boeing. That rift, in contrast, could result in billions of dollars of sanctions. 
 The actions Thursday were in retaliation for the Byrd amendment, named after Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who proposed it in 2000. The amendment gives American companies the proceeds of duties levied on foreign companies that are selling their goods in the United States at below-market prices, a practice known as dumping. 
 In November, the World Trade Organization ruled the Byrd amendment was unfair, and allowed seven countries to impose sanctions in retaliation. If fully imposed, the sanctions would affect $150 million in American exports.
 Richard Mills, a spokesman for the United States trade representative's office, said Thursday, ''We're disappointed that this step is being taken.'' He said the United States was working to alter the Byrd amendment to comply with the W.T.O. ruling. 
 ''It's important to remember that the W.T.O. decision in the dispute does not affect our underlying trade laws,'' Mr. Mills said. ''The United States will continue to vigorously implement our trade laws to make sure Americans are treated fairly.'' 
 Legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives to repeal the Byrd amendment, though the Senate has not followed suit. Indeed, Senator Byrd has sponsored a law to instruct the United States trade representative to negotiate a change at the W.T.O. to allow his namesake amendment.
 Some also feared that the relationship of two new trade diplomats could get off on the wrong foot. Peter Mandelson became Europe's trade commissioner in November, and Rob Portman was nominated by President Bush as United States trade representative two weeks ago, 
 Assuming Mr. Portman's nomination is approved, he would succeed Robert B. Zoellick, who moved to the State Department.
 Mr. Mandelson succeeded Pascal Lamy. 
 Mr. Zoellick and Mr. Lamy presided over some important trade disputes, but their personal friendship prevented those issues from curdling the broader relationship. Their successors may have a tougher time maintaining cordiality after the breakdown in talks on Boeing and Airbus. 
 In Canada, Thursday's action comes amid its longstanding dispute with the United States over softwood lumber. Canada estimates that the United States has collected $3.29 billion in tariffs, though Canada has overwhelmingly won its appeals before the W.T.O. and the North American Free Trade Agreement. A small amount of those tariffs has gone to American lumber producers. 
 Because of the fight, the W.T.O. authorized only limited retaliation by Canada for now.

HEADLINE: World Bank Vote Confirms Wolfowitz Unanimously

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary and one of the administration's earliest advocates of invading Iraq, was unanimously confirmed Thursday as the new president of the World Bank in a vote by the institution's executive board.
 President Bush nominated Mr. Wolfowitz two weeks ago for the post, which has always been held by an American.
 ''It is humbling to be entrusted with the leadership of this critically important international institution,'' Mr. Wolfowitz, 61, said Thursday. 
 The World Bank, which has 184 member countries, provided $20 billion for 245 development projects in 2004. When Mr. Wolfowitz begins his five-year term in June, he will immediately face decisions about how to encourage the world's wealthiest nations to increase aid to the poor, meet the United Nations' development goals and offer debt relief to the poorest nations.
 Mr. Wolfowitz brings to his new position varied experience from government and academia. He is a former professor of political science and dean of the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He also held important posts in the State and Defense Departments under President Ronald Reagan and the first President George Bush, gaining a reputation for promoting the spread of American-style democracy around the world, sometimes with the use of American military might.
 The White House announced Thursday that Gordon R. England, secretary of the Navy, would be nominated to succeed Mr. Wolfowitz.
 Mr. Wolfowitz's reputation has brought loud criticism of the World Bank nomination from Europe and from private groups that champion aid for the poor. Nevertheless, the board's approval of him to be the 10th president of the international development institution was never in doubt.
 The other largest shareholders of the World Bank -- Japan, Germany, France and Britain -- signed off almost immediately on his appointment, and no country offered an alternative candidate.
 As one European official said, ''No one was enthusiastic but no one was fighting.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz mounted a serious campaign to convince all 24 executive directors of the bank that he understood its mission as the world's leading development agency and would not use the presidency to promote the goals of the Bush administration. He repeated what the directors wanted to hear: that he respected the multilateral nature of the institution and its overall goal of eradicating world poverty through loans, aid and advice.
 He succeeded.
 In a signed statement released Thursday, the eight European executive directors at the bank said that they were convinced of Mr. Wolfowitz's ''unreserved commitment to the bank's mission of poverty reduction'' and were confident that he would not change the focus from African nations and other countries most in need.
 The directors representing the 108 developing countries at the bank said in a separate statement that Mr. Wolfowitz had assured them that his loyalty was to the bank and ''to no other authority.''
 James Mann, the author of ''Rise of the Vulcans,'' which chronicles the role of the neoconservatives in the Bush administration, said: ''Under the surface, I think he and the White House have different agendas for this appointment. For Wolfowitz, this is taking on a new area but for the Bush White House this is putting in the bank a guy who has been one of the most closely involved with advising the president on foreign policy.''
 Critics, while acknowledging that Mr. Wolfowitz may prove to be an accomplished leader, say they worry that he will provoke renewed antagonism toward the bank just as the open hostility demonstrated in the last decade had begun to wane.
 A small band of protesters gathered Thursday morning outside the World Bank's modern headquarters here, just blocks from the White House, criticizing Mr. Wolfowitz and his stance on the Iraq war. The Global Justice Ecology Project, one of the groups criticizing the appointment, said it feared that Mr. Wolfowitz would be ''the link between shooting wars and economic wars.'' 
 Jessica P. Einhorn, who succeeded Mr. Wolfowitz at the School for Advanced International Study, predicted that he would surprise the critics.
 ''The kind of idealism that motivated what many think are his errors in Iraq is in fact the kind of inspirational leadership that may be needed in the bank,'' she said. ''I think you can turn this around and see he has a belief in the human spirit.'' 
 He will succeed James D. Wolfensohn, a wealthy former Wall Street financier who managed to win over many of his critics who had said he lacked the experience to lead one of the world's largest, most unwieldy bureaucracies.
 Mr. Wolfowitz is known as an intellectual rather than a manager and is expected to rely on strong assistants to help him run the organization.
 As the bank's president, Mr. Wolfowitz will have significant power to decide what projects are approved and to hire and fire personnel.
 To ensure a strong voice in these decisions, the countries that might have blocked him have won agreement from Mr. Wolfowitz that he will appoint several managing directors, especially from Europe.

HEADLINE: Intel Officer Says High Taxes Could Send Plant Overseas

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 31 

 BODY:
The president of Intel, Paul S. Otellini, warned a federal panel addressing tax issues that because of high tax rates in the United States, his company may build its next $3 billion semiconductor factory overseas. 
 Mr. Otellini, who will become Intel's chief executive in May, testified Thursday at a hearing of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform that over the 10-year life of a modern chip factory, the company would save $1 billion by placing the factory in Asia or Europe rather than in the United States. He said Intel, the world's largest chip maker, would make its decision this year. 
 There would be some advantages to building in this country, near Intel's other factories, Mr. Otellini said. But while trade barriers and wage factors were significant issues in earlier decisions, taxes are now an important consideration, he said.
 ''The problem that we have and which the industry has is that it costs us $1 billion more to operate inside the U.S. than outside of the country,'' he said. ''It's not wages and capital; its almost all attributed to tax benefits -- or the lack thereof -- in the United States compared to what is offered elsewhere.''
 While 12 of Intel's 16 factories are in the United States, 75 percent of its sales are outside the country.
 An industry analyst said Intel's decision was being closely watched by its competitors.
 ''This has huge ramifications throughout the industry,'' said Risto Puhakka, president of VLSI Research, a chip industry consulting firm based in Santa Clara, Calif. He said that in addition to low tax rates and incentives, the industry needed pools of labor to run advanced manufacturing plants, something Asian countries can provide.
 Mr. Otellini said that while there are some state-level incentives for locating factories in the United States, they are insignificant when compared to the 35 percent federal tax rate the company faces.
 In contrast, Mr. Otellini pointed to Israel, which offers a 20 percent capital grant, a 10 percent tax rate and a two-year tax deferral. Malaysia offers a 10-year tax deferral and Ireland offers a 12.5 percent tax rate. Two-thirds of the most advanced factories being built, those producing 300-millimeter chip wafers, are in Asia, Mr. Otellini said. 
 China has not attracted much advanced chip industry investment because of United States restrictions on high-technology exports.
 Mr. Otellini acknowledged the criticism that the semiconductor industry was asking for special treatment compared to other industries, but said he thought the country would benefit more from investments in ''knowledge-based'' industries.
 Potential solutions to the foreign tax advantage might include cuts in United States taxes, investment tax credits or permitting companies to take the full cost of building the factory as an expense during the first year, Mr. Otellini said.
 The advisory panel, which has been holding hearings in different cities on the issue of tax reform, met in San Francisco to explore how the federal tax code affects economic growth and the nation's competitiveness.

HEADLINE: A Bloomberg Victory, at a Price

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's decision yesterday to sell the Jets the rights to build a football stadium on the West Side waterfront may be one of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's greatest victories since he took office three years ago. But it could become his most costly. 
 By devoting so much energy to the development of the Far West Side, Mr. Bloomberg has potentially alienated a broad swath of voters who deplore the idea of the stadium. 
 Perhaps more politically dangerous, the bidding process exposed a mayor who casts himself as a reformer to criticism that he was pushing the authority to offer a sweetheart deal to the Jets, at taxpayer expense. The point was underscored by the fact that the team's initial, informal offer of $100 million was eventually turned to about $210 million after the chief stadium opponent, Cablevision, came forward with a much larger counteroffer in February.
 If the mayor had gotten his way several months ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, in dire need of cash to repair the faltering subway system, would have arguably been tens of millions of dollars poorer for it, a point his Democratic challengers were quick to cling to yesterday.
 The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, called the project ''the worst land deal since Manhattan Island was sold for 24 bucks.'' He said that the mayor had been ''willing to let New Yorkers be cheated out of almost a billion dollars.''
 The battle also often forced Mr. Bloomberg, who is fond of the bees-with-honey approach when dealing with adversaries, to take the occasional low road, personally insulting Cablevision's owners. Yesterday, he practically said that continuing to oppose the stadium was un-American.
 Now, even some of his supporters worry that even though he finally landed his harpoon in what has become his white whale, as the fight for the stadium inevitably moves to the courts, selling the idea will continue to cost him political capital and take considerable attention away from his other signature issues this election year: crime, the economy and education.
 ''It has diverted the mayor from talking about his accomplishments and it's generated a lot of negative ads against him,'' said one supporter, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of appearing disloyal. 
 As Mr. Bloomberg's aides are quick to point out, the mayor has also made important friends in this fight. The project has aligned Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, with powerful Democratic-leaning construction and service-industry unions and several Democratic minority leaders -- including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem -- who support the stadium for its job-creation potential.
 Even the harshest critics of the stadium have done little to beat back Mr. Bloomberg's central argument in favor of the stadium: that it would create many jobs.
 Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, equated the stadium battle with Mr. Bloomberg's push for a smoking ban in public places in 2002, initially an unpopular rule, to the say the least, that even some smokers now say they like.
 ''The mayor doesn't think there's any point in having this job if all you're going to do is try to keep it,'' he said. 
 Even though court battles will almost certainly ensue, and the deal requires state approval, Mr. Bloomberg portrayed the board's decision yesterday as a reflection of the general population's view of the stadium. ''The public has spoken,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Queens (although the board members are political appointees, not elected officials). 
 Filing a lawsuit, the mayor said, would not be ''the American way'' -- in contrast to years of evidence that it is. 
 William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University, said the mayor could prove critics wrong if the stadium helps the city win the 2012 Summer Olympics, which would spur economic development throughout the boroughs. 
 ''If they get the Olympics, it's his legacy, kind of Robert Moses redux, with an opportunity to have a capital program that will change the face of New York for the next hundred years,'' he said. ''If it doesn't happen, he risks a lot. I think he's re-elected, but he's weakened politically and it's hard for him to recover politically. It's a big roll of the die.'' 
 For all of their public confidence, Mr. Bloomberg's aides seemed keenly aware of the perils. As the transportation agency's board deliberated the fate of the mayor's signature election-year initiative, he was in Queens promoting a plan to combat the damage tree roots cause to sidewalks -- a move apparently intended to show that he was tending to nonstadium, non-Manhattan business. 
 But his opponents are sure to seize on any negative consequences of his West Side victory. ''You know what the Greeks say,'' said Norman Adler, a New York political consultant, ''When the gods want to punish you, they answer your prayers.''

HEADLINE: Budget Passed, It's the Governor's Move

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1 

 BODY:
Now, the ball is back in Gov. George E. Pataki's court.
 As the state's new fiscal year began Friday with a budget in place for the first time in 21 years, Governor Pataki found himself in a difficult political position: trying to share the credit for its passage while working to undo or renegotiate many provisions of it that the State Legislature passed without his approval. 
 Feelings of relief, finality and celebration around the capital were tempered Friday by uncertainty because the Legislature and the governor remained divided over many important issues. 
 Mr. Pataki's office circulated copies of proposed new budget language to the Legislature. And issues that had seemed settled when the budget was passed on Thursday -- including the Legislature's rejection of the governor's proposed tuition increases at state universities, and its decision not to raise taxes on nursing homes -- were suddenly on the table again. 
 Whether Governor Pataki will be able to persuade lawmakers to make major changes in their budget remains to be seen, but he does have a few arrows in his quiver. 
 Foremost among them is the veto pen, which he has until April 12 to use. With several strokes of the pen, he could potentially cut hundreds of millions of dollars of spending that the Legislature added to the budget if he cannot reach an amicable agreement with lawmakers, a goal everyone claims to share. 
 But the budget passed both houses of the Legislature Thursday with strong bipartisan majorities, and for the first time in recent memory, even the minority-party leaders were involved and invested in the budget-making process, leading many to believe that it would be easy to muster the votes for veto overrides.
 But some lawmakers question whether a Republican-controlled State Senate would move to embarrass Mr. Pataki, who is weighing a run for national office. 
 The governor has other powers as well. The legislators left $1.1 billion in spending on welfare programs out of its budget because they could not persuade the governor to resubmit his proposal in a way they could accept, but they were unable to amend his proposal because of a recent court decision limiting their budget-making powers. 
 The spending on welfare programs -- including on day care slots for 22,000 children and summer jobs for 8,000 teenagers that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wants -- is particularly dear to the Assembly. 
 Several officials said Friday that while all sides were close to reaching agreement on how to spend the money, the governor appeared to be holding off on the final agreement to try to win some concessions from the Assembly. 
 One of the biggest looming battles, as always, is over the state's Medicaid program. Governor Pataki made cutting costs in the program a centerpiece of his budget proposal this year, and as he weighs a run for national office and fends off barbs from conservatives who cast him as a big spender, winning cuts would prove an essential victory.
 But the Legislature restored nearly $700 million of the $1.1 billion in cuts he called for. So now the governor is working to persuade legislators to find more; one area being explored is a tax increase on nursing homes.
 Another, more contentious set of negotiations revolves around the state's health insurance plan for the working poor, Family Health Plus. The governor, who created the program, is continuing to push for cutting some benefits and raising co-payments in the program, officials said. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, called cutting benefits ''a nonstarter.'' 
 Perhaps the biggest issue is Mr. Pataki's desire to create an independent commission to suggest closing struggling hospitals and nursing homes around New York -- akin to the commission that was created to study closing military bases.
 The governor has said that the creation of this commission is critical to getting $1.5 billion in federal assistance to help the state overhaul its health care system. 
 The Senate and the Assembly agreed in principle to the idea, but the deal was mired in divisions over who would serve on the panel, what powers they would have and how to give members appointed from different regions in the state a voice in the process.
 Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, expressed satisfaction in the budget that the Legislature passed Thursday but said that he was always willing to listen to other ideas. ''I don't think there are going to be major changes,'' he said. ''I think you are going to see some ongoing discussions to see if we can refine or improve any of what is there.'' 
 Some of the talks Friday centered on tuition increases at state universities -- just a day after lawmakers boasted about averting Governor Pataki's proposed $500-a-year tuition increase. 
 And there were a host of other issues being discussed, from economic development programs to money for the environment, to plans to convert nonprofit health insurance plans into publicly held, for-profit companies. 
 Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said in a statement, ''The governor is working to make the budget better, and as everyone is aware, staff discussions are ongoing that will allow us to arrive at a final and fiscally responsible budget.''
 Even in a year marked by talks of health care cuts, the Legislature's budget contained a few provisions that pleased the state's powerful health care unions -- including at least $79.5 million that was earmarked to help pay for salary increases and training for health care workers who care for patients at upstate nursing homes. 
 And it provided $121 million for hospital work force ''retention and recruitment'' that was widely seen in Albany as a way to soften the blow of a new tax on hospitals the lawmakers enacted.

HEADLINE: University Scientists Concerned by Cuts in Computer Projects

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 1 

 BODY:
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency at the Pentagon -- which has long underwritten open-ended ''blue sky'' research by the nation's best computer scientists -- is sharply cutting such spending at universities, researchers say, in favor of financing more classified work and narrowly defined projects that promise a more immediate payoff. 
 Hundreds of research projects supported by the agency, known as Darpa, have paid off handsomely in recent decades, leading not only to new weapons, but to commercial technologies from the personal computer to the Internet. The agency has devoted hundreds of millions of dollars to basic software research, too, including work that led to such recent advances as the Web search technologies that Google and others have introduced.
 The shift away from basic research is alarming many leading computer scientists and electrical engineers, who warn that there will be long-term consequences for the nation's economy. They are accusing the Pentagon of reining in an agency that has played a crucial role in fostering America's lead in computer and communications technologies. 
 ''I'm worried and depressed,'' said David Patterson, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who is president of the Association of Computing Machinery, an industry and academic trade group. ''I think there will be great technologies that won't be there down the road when we need them.''
 University researchers, usually reluctant to speak out, have started quietly challenging the agency's new approach. They assert that Darpa has shifted a lot more work in recent years to military contractors, adopted a focus on short-term projects while cutting support for basic research, classified formerly open projects as secret and placed new restrictions on sharing information.
 This week, in responding to a query from the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Darpa officials acknowledged for the first time a shift in focus. They revealed that within a relatively steady budget for computer science research that rose slightly from $546 million in 2001 to $583 million last year, the portion going to university researchers has fallen from $214 million to $123 million.
 The agency cited a number of reasons for the decline: increased reliance on corporate research; a need for more classified projects since 9/11; Congress's decision to end controversial projects like Total Information Awareness because of privacy fears; and the shift of some basic research to advanced weapons systems development.
 In Silicon Valley, executives are also starting to worry about the consequences of Darpa's stinting on basic research in computer science.
 ''This has been a phenomenal system for harnessing intellectual horsepower for the country,'' said David L. Tennenhouse, a former Darpa official who is now director of research for Intel. ''We should be careful how we tinker with it.''
 University scientists assert that the changes go even further than what Darpa has disclosed. As financing has dipped, the remaining research grants come with yet more restrictions, they say, often tightly linked to specific ''deliverables'' that discourage exploration and serendipitous discoveries.
 Many grants also limit the use of graduate students to those who hold American citizenship, a rule that hits hard in computer science, where many researchers are foreign.
 The shift at Darpa has been noted not just by those researchers directly involved in computing technologies, but by those in other fields supported by the agency.
 ''I can see they are after deliverables, but the unfortunate thing is that basic research gets squeezed out in the process,'' said Wolfgang Porod, director of the Center for Nano Science and Technology at the University of Notre Dame. 
 The concerns are highlighted in a report on the state of the nation's cybersecurity that was released with little fanfare in March by the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Darpa has long focused on long-term basic research projects with time horizons that exceed five years, the report notes, but by last year, very little of Darpa's financing was being directed toward fundamental research in the field.
 ''Virtually every aspect of information technology upon which we rely today bears the stamp of federally sponsored university research,'' said Ed Lazowska, a computer scientist at the University of Washington and co-chairman of the advisory panel. ''The federal government is walking away from this role, killing the goose that laid the golden egg.''
 As a result of the new restrictions, a number of computer scientists said they had chosen not to work with Darpa any longer. Last year, the agency offered to support research by Leonard Kleinrock, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was one of the small group of researchers who developed the Arpanet, the 1960's predecessor to today's Internet. 
 Dr. Kleinrock said that he decided that he was not interested in the project when he learned that the agency was insisting that he employ only graduate assistants with American citizenship.
 Darpa officials, who declined repeated requests for interviews, disputed the university researchers. The agency, which responded only in writing to questions, contended that the criticisms leveled by the advisory committee and other researchers were not accurate and that it had always supported a mix of longer- and shorter-term research.
 ''The key is a focus on high-risk, high-payoff research,'' Jan Walker, a Darpa spokeswoman, stated in an e-mail message. Given the threat from terrorism and the demands on troops in Iraq, she wrote, Darpa is rightly devoting more attention to ''quick reaction'' projects that draw on the fruits of earlier science and technology to produce useful prototypes as soon as possible.
 The Pentagon shift has put added pressure on the other federal agencies that support basic information technology research.
 At the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering of the National Science Foundation, the number of research proposals has soared from 2,000 in 1999 to 6,500 last year. Peter A. Freeman, its director, said that the sharp rise was partly attributable to declines in Pentagon support.
 ''Darpa has moved away from direct funding to universities,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''Even when they do directly fund, some of the conditions and constraints seem to be pretty onerous. There is no question that the community doesn't like what the head of Darpa has been doing, but he has his reasons and his prerogatives.''
 The transformation of Darpa has been led by Anthony J. Tether, a Stanford-educated electrical engineer who has had a long career moving between executive positions at military contractors and the Pentagon.
 Last year, Dr. Tether's new approach led to a series of cutbacks at a number of computer science departments. Program financing for a Darpa project known as Network Embedded Sensor Technology -- intended to develop networks of sensors that could potentially be deployed on battlefields to locate and track enemy tanks and soldiers -- has been cut back or ended on as many as five university campuses and shifted instead to traditional military contractors.
 ''The network has now become as vital as the weapons themselves,'' Dr. Tether said in an appearance before the advisory committee last year, testifying that secrecy had become more essential for a significant part of the agency's work.
 That has created problems for university researchers. Several scientists have been instructed, for example, to remove previously published results from Web sites. And at U.C.L.A. and Berkeley, Darpa officials tried to classify software research done under a contract that specified that the results would be distributed under so-called open-source licensing terms.
 ''We were requested to remove all publicly accessible pointers to software developed under the program,'' said Deborah Estrin, director of embedded network sensing at U.C.L.A. ''This is the first time in 15 years that I have no Darpa funding.''
 At Berkeley, Edward A. Lee, who was recently named chairman of the computer science department, agreed not to publish a final report at Darpa's request, even though he told officials the data had already become widely available.
 Despite the complaints, some pioneering researchers support the changes being driven by Dr. Tether and say they are necessary to prepare the nation for a long battle against elusive enemies.
 ''There are pressures and demands on Darpa to be relevant,'' said Robert Kahn, a former Darpa administrator who is now president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives in Reston, Va. ''People think it should stay the same, but times have changed.''
 Still, a number of top scientists argue that the Pentagon's shift in priorities could not have come at a worse time. Most American companies have largely ended basic research and have begun to outsource product research and development extensively even as investments in Asia and Europe are rising quickly.
 And many computer scientists dispute Darpa's reasoning that fighting wars demands a shift away from basic research. During the Vietnam War, they say, Darpa kept its commitment to open-ended computer research, supporting things like a laboratory in the hills behind Stanford University dedicated to the far-out idea of building computing machines to mimic human capabilities.
 John McCarthy founded the Stanford artificial research lab in 1964, helping to turn it into a wellspring for some of Silicon Valley's most important companies, from Xerox Parc to Apple to Intel.
 ''American leadership in computer science and in applications has benefited more from the longer-term work,'' Mr. McCarthy said, ''than from the deliverables.''

HEADLINE: Pace of Job Creation Slows Markedly

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1 

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate dipped slightly in March, the government said on Friday, but job creation was weaker than most analysts had expected.
 The nation added about 110,000 jobs last month, about half the number that Wall Street analysts had predicted, and the unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in February.
 The pace of job creation was much slower than in February, when the economy added 243,000 jobs, and it was the smallest increase in employment since last July. 
 Over all, the Labor Department report suggested a continuation of the unusually slow job recovery that has been under way over the last two years. 
 The markets initially rose Friday after reports of the unexpectedly weak job report, which was potentially good news for investors because it eased fears that inflationary pressures would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly in the months ahead. But stocks turned sharply lower after an increase in oil prices and a manufacturing report, which indicated high prices, fanned fears of inflation. 
 The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 99.46 points.
 The nation lost about 2.7 million jobs during and after the recession of 2001, and employment has recovered in fits and starts in the last two years. About 3.1 million jobs have been added since May 2003, and the unemployment rate has declined from a high of 6.3 percent.
 But wages have not kept up with inflation, suggesting that workers still have little bargaining power even as corporate profits have soared.
 Hourly wages and average weekly earnings climbed 2.6 percent over the last year, while consumer prices climbed 3 percent. 
 ''You have a good recovery in the job market -- not spectacular, but enough to generate a very slow decline in unemployment,'' the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, Ethan Harris, said. ''It's not enough to generate any negotiating power for labor.''
 The central bank jolted financial markets on March 22, when it warned that inflationary pressures were building and hinted that it might have to speed up its ''measured'' pace of rate increases.
 The Fed has pushed short-term rates up in baby steps since last June, from 1 percent to 2.75 percent. But its new warning about inflation, and a jump in consumer prices in February, raised fears that it would either move faster or keep raising rates longer than expected.
 Analysts said Friday's report of modest growth in employment would allow the Fed to stick to its gradual pace of quarter-point increases at each of its policy meetings. 
 In addition to the weak labor data for March, economists said other indicators suggested that economic growth and job creation would be slower in 2005 than it was in 2004.
 New claims for unemployment insurance have climbed for the last three weeks, after trending downward for months, and hit 350,000 last week. Economists say fewer than 400,000 claims a week are an indicator of rising employment, but the recent uptick has raised doubts about the strength of job creation.
 Factory employment, where most of the recent job losses have occurred, remains stagnant. Manufacturers have restored only a small fraction of the jobs they shed from 2001 through 2003, and manufacturing employment edged down by 8,000 jobs in March.
 The biggest job gains last month came in construction and in service industries. The nation added 27,000 jobs in business and professional services, and 23,000 jobs in education and health care. But retailers eliminated 10,000 jobs.
 In a separate report on Friday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity edged down slightly in March but remained above the level that points to expanding activity. But the institute's separate index for activity in service industries, which it accidentally released ahead of schedule on Friday, showed an increase as companies reported a jump in new orders.
 The most immediate potential concern is rising oil prices, which have climbed by 36 percent this year and hit a record on Friday of $57.27.
 Rising gasoline prices weakened consumer spending last summer, though economic growth continued to be strong throughout 2004, and some forecasters worry about a slowdown this summer.
 The University of Michigan's monthly index of consumer confidence, released on Friday, declined slightly, to 92.6 in March from 94.1 in February.
 The sluggish job growth is a harbinger of an ''oil-induced soft patch,'' predicted Richard Yamarone, economist at Argus Research. ''As long as businesses have to struggle with higher health care costs and higher energy costs, they are going to hold back on hiring.''
 The reluctance to hire has been particularly high at manufacturing companies, which shed about 2.7 million jobs during and after the recession of 2001. 
 Kendig Kneen, owner of Al-Jon Inc. in Ottumwa, Iowa, said he was relying primarily on subcontractors rather than expanding his factory or adding people.
 ''We could probably get away with doubling our manufacturing capacity, but we prefer to use our money for research and development and expanding our product line,'' said Mr. Kneen, whose company makes equipment for processing scrap materials.
 Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig/ITG, said companies were investing more of their money and earning more of their profits outside the United States.
 ''What we're seeing is very strong profit growth, but pedestrian gains for investment and employment,'' Mr. Barbera said. The reason, he said, is that American direct investment overseas is much higher than foreign direct investment in the United States. 
 The United States' widening trade deficit is a reflection of the growing reliance on foreign manufacturers. 
 ''Clearly, consumers continue to demand manufactured goods,'' wrote Jared Bernstein, economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington. ''But as shown by the growing trade deficit and loss of manufacturing jobs, their demands are being met by imports.''

HEADLINE: 3.4% Surge Pushes Oil Above $57

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices jumped 3.4 percent to a record yesterday, prompted by concerns over the level of gasoline stockpiles in the United States before the summer driving season.
 The May contract for crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.87 and settled at $57.27 a barrel after reaching $57.70 in earlier trading. The closing futures price was the highest since trading began in 1983.
 Gasoline futures in New York trading also rose, closing up 7 cents, to $1.73 a gallon. They have jumped 10 percent in the last three days. 
 The increase in oil prices and concerns over a pickup in inflation have rippled through stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 99.46 points, or nearly 1 percent yesterday, to 10,404.30 points. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 14.42 points, to 1,984.81.
 Oil markets continue to be rocked by the tightness in global production and concerns over rising demand. These issues, along with unexpected interruptions from producers like Iraq or Venezuela, have contributed to a 67 percent jump in oil prices in the last year.
 More recently, problems at oil refineries in the United States and abroad have increased worries that gasoline demand this summer will not be met. 
 A refinery in Venezuela, the world's fifth-biggest oil exporter, was shut on Thursday by a power failure. The incident came after an explosion last week at a Texas City, Tex., refinery that is the third largest in the United States.
 Despite the record prices, gasoline demand in the United States has shown no sign of a slowdown and, over the last month, has been running 2 percent higher than it did a year ago. At the same time, gasoline reserves are falling. 
 The Energy Information Administration said this week that gasoline stocks fell 2.9 million barrels, to 214.4 million barrels, the fourth consecutive weekly decline.
 ''Until something derails the current trends in supply and demand, prices have no way to go down significantly, let alone stay down significantly,'' said Jan Stuart, an oil analyst at Fimat USA in New York.
 The rise in energy costs is starting to be felt in the economy. Fewer jobs were created in March, according to the Labor Department, although America's unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent, from 5.4 percent in February. In addition, airlines, including Delta, United and Continental, have increased fares in response to rising costs.
 The gains in oil prices yesterday came after Goldman, Sachs released a report Thursday that suggested oil prices could go as high as $105 a barrel -- the level that the bank analysts estimate is needed to significantly curb consumption.
 ''Oil markets may have entered the early stages of what we have referred to as a 'super spike' period,'' the report said, ''a multiyear trading band of oil prices high enough to meaningfully reduce energy consumption and recreate a spare capacity cushion only after which will lower energy prices return.''
 In its report, Goldman, Sachs also raised its forecasts for light crude futures, the most commonly traded contract, for 2005 and 2006, to $50 and $55 a barrel, up from $41 and $40 a barrel.
 Still, not everyone was convinced that prices would keep rising indefinitely. 
 ''I don't think the sky's the limit,'' Marshall Steeves, an oil analyst at the Refco Group, told The Associated Press. ''At some point, there'll be some impact on demand. But where that price is, is hard to determine.'' 
 Some analysts suggested that oil markets remain well supplied, with crude oil stocks building at a higher level than last year. But one reason prices remain high is the continued attraction the oil market still has for hedge funds and other speculative traders.

HEADLINE: Before the Fall

 BODY:
The recent rally of the United States dollar notwithstanding, the greenback has nowhere to go but down. But the Bush administration is betting that foreign investors will continue to invest huge sums in this depreciating currency. How huge? Last month, the government reported that the United States' deficit in international transactions, mainly trade, reached an unprecedented $666 billion in 2004, a 24 percent increase from the 2003 level and, at 5.7 percent of the economy, about two to three times what most economists consider sustainable. 
 The administration expects foreigners, mainly Asian central bankers, to keep plugging the trade gap because buying American securities increases their exports. It is also assuming that foreign central banks won't risk the losses in their dollar reserves that would occur if they started shunning dollar-based investments. In brief, the United States is betting that it's too big -- in other countries' eyes -- to fail. 
 The dollar's current uptick is just a breather in its overall downward trajectory. It's due largely to the United States' higher interest rates, which lure foreign investors away from euros and into dollar-based investments. But what will happen when the Federal Reserve stops raising rates? Here's a hint: When one Federal Reserve governor suggested recently that rates might peak at a lower level than analysts expected, the dollar promptly slid. 
 The dollar also drew some of its recent momentum from a government report last month that showed the United States attracted $91.5 billion in net foreign capital in January, easily covering that month's near-record trade deficit, $58.3 billion. That allayed concerns, at least temporarily, about the United States' continued ability to finance its debt on favorable terms. But hedge funds were responsible for much of January's investment, and that clouds the picture. 
 In general, private investment -- as opposed to investment by foreign governments -- is an encouraging sign because private investors seek out the best opportunities, while foreign governments often pour money in simply to prop up the dollar. But hedge funds are different; they are often short-term investors that can move out of dollars as quickly as they move in. Given the unreliability of those inflows, and the enormous borrowing needs of the United States, the country will be dependent on foreign government lenders for a long time. 
 That's a precarious position. To close its trade gap, which must be financed by foreigners, and its budget gap, most of which is covered by foreign investors, the United States will need to attract a projected $1 trillion in 2005 alone -- an unprecedented sum. At the same time, however, the Bush administration is relying on a cheap dollar to correct the nation's trade imbalance. So far, the trade deficit has only grown, even as the dollar has fallen. A further decline this year of about 20 percent would probably be needed to begin to have a real impact. 
 There is gathering evidence that foreign central bankers are seeking to avoid the losses that future dollar investments seem to threaten. Recently, financial markets have been unsettled by comments from Japan, South Korea, India and Russia about diversifying away from dollars. And this week, a tough-talking China vowed not to allow its economic decisions to be dictated by any other country, a statement that was a rebuff to the United States. 
 If the world's central bankers accumulate fewer dollars, the result would be an unrelenting American need to borrow in the face of an ever weaker dollar -- a recipe for higher interest rates and higher prices. The economic repercussions could unfold gradually, resulting in a long, slow decline in living standards. Or there could be a quick unraveling, with the hallmarks of an uncontrolled fiscal crisis. Or the pain could fall somewhere in between. If foreign reluctance to buy Treasury bonds pushed up long-term interest rates, mortgage rates would follow. If the economy is in a housing bubble, as many analysts believe, higher mortgage rates would pop it, with dire results for homeowners' balance sheets and the overall health of the economy. 
 The dollar is heading down, no matter what. To mitigate the potential harm, the administration and Congress should deliver on budget discipline -- far beyond the lip service that's been offered so far -- to limit the amounts the United States needs to attract in loans and pay in interest. The administration should also try to forge cooperation among America's trading partners to manage the dollar's decline. Unfortunately, government leaders aren't poised to do either of those things, though action, not attitude, is what the country needs.

HEADLINE: Refinancing the Future

BYLINE: By Peter J. Wallison. 
Peter J. Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was general counsel of the Treasury in the Reagan administration.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
CONGRESS has been working for more than a year now to tighten the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two troubled government-sponsored mortgage companies that have helped banks to finance home ownership for millions of Americans. Accounting problems at both have spurred this effort, because it has become clear that if the companies should fail or otherwise encounter a severe financial setback, it would pose a considerable risk to taxpayers (who may have to bail them out) and the economy in general (because of their dominance of the residential mortgage market and the potential vulnerability of their financial partners). 
 Yet, as much as tougher regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is warranted, Congress has so far circled the central issue instead of engaging it. The purpose of tighter regulation is to reduce or control the companies' risks. But we already know why these risks arise: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have accumulated portfolios of mortgages amounting to $1.7 trillion that are financed largely by short-term borrowing. Much of their income depends on the spread between the interest rates on the long-term mortgages they purchase from commercial lenders and the short-term rates on the money they borrow -- a strategy that makes them extremely vulnerable to changes in interest rates. 
 In recent Congressional testimony, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, made a notably sensible suggestion: limit the size of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolios of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to $100 billion to $200 billion. He is likely to repeat this idea, and perhaps go beyond it, in Senate testimony scheduled for Wednesday. A restriction of this kind would substantially reduce the interest rate risks faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without interfering with their support for the residential housing market. Instead of holding mortgages for investment, they would expand their existing business of pooling these mortgages and selling interests in them as mortgage-backed securities that offload the interest rate risk onto investors. This idea, of course, is not new: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been doing this for many years and now bear the credit risk -- but not the interest rate risk -- of $1.5 trillion in outstanding mortgage-backed securities. 
 Advocates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will point out that limiting their ability to buy and hold mortgages and mortgage-backed securities will substantially reduce their profits, and they will be right. Both companies profit handsomely from using their government-granted financing advantages to buy and hold these assets, which pay considerably higher interest rates than they have to pay to their lenders. But Congress ought to understand that this strategy is a classic case of making society take the risks while private investors take the profits -- just as the savings and loan associations that went belly up in the late 1980's did. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profit from the interest rate risks they are taking, the management and the shareholders pocket the gains; but if they fail or suffer financial reverses because of this risk, the taxpayers will bear the burden. 
 If there were some evidence that this risk-taking was necessary to make the country's mortgage system function, then it might be argued that the taxpayers should take these risks because they receive benefits as homebuyers. Mr. Greenspan and other eminent economists have advised Congress that this is not the case. When the companies borrow to buy and hold mortgages, it does nothing to reduce mortgage rates.
 Since Mr. Greenspan's testimony, the chairmen of both the Senate Banking Committee and the relevant House subcommittee have said that they will consider limiting the size of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolios as part of the legislation they are developing. If so, this proposal will properly be the key element of the Congressional debate. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will not like it. But tightening regulation of these two companies without reducing the real source of the risks they create would be like bailing furiously while ignoring the hole in the boat.

HEADLINE: SEARS HOLDINGS TO LAY OFF AT LEAST 250 AT HEADQUARTERS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Sears Holdings Corporation, created last week by the Kmart Holding Corporation's purchase of Sears, Roebuck & Company, will lay off at least 250 workers at its headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., as the company streamlines operations. Sears Holdings gave notice of the job cuts March 29, according to a statement on Web site of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Layoffs of at least 250 employees must be posted 60 days in advance, according to Illinois law. Sears Holdings employs about 4,000 people in Hoffman Estates and about 1,000 at the office in Troy, Mich., that was Kmart's base. The company will keep the vast majority of its 336,000 workers in the United States, the chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, said last week.

HEADLINE: Bush Picks Fed Governor as Economic Adviser

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1 

 BODY:
President Bush said on Friday that he would nominate Ben S. Bernanke, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, to head his Council of Economic Advisers. 
 Mr. Bernanke, a former professor of economics at Princeton, has been one of the central bank's most visible policy makers and is regarded as a leading monetary economist. 
 In a brief written statement on Friday, Mr. Bernanke accepted the offer. 
 ''I am honored by the president's intention to nominate me,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Subject to Senate confirmation, I look forward to this new opportunity.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke, 51, will be taking over a post that has waxed and waned in its influence. Mr. Bush's first chairman, R. Glenn Hubbard, was a principal architect of the 2003 tax cuts that reduced taxes on dividends and capital gains by half. 
 But N. Gregory Mankiw, who succeeded Mr. Hubbard and recently returned to Harvard University, had a more distant relationship with Mr. Bush. 
 Mr. Bernanke, though named by the president to his current post at the Federal Reserve, has not been known as a political figure. He has said relatively little about Mr. Bush's tax-cutting policies but has voiced strong views about the economy and the conduct of monetary policy. 
 One former White House official said Mr. Bernanke had earned high marks for his work since joining the Federal Reserve in August 2003. 
 He has been rumored as a possible candidate to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. Mr. Greenspan, who has been Fed chairman for 17 years, is expected to retire when his term as a Fed governor expires next January. 
 But Mr. Bernanke, who has few personal ties to President Bush, is considered a less likely candidate than either Mr. Hubbard or Martin Feldstein, a professor at Harvard who was a chairman of the group under President Ronald Reagan. 
 While at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke has said relatively little about the budget deficits that ballooned during Mr. Bush's first term and are likely to remain high. 
 But in keeping with his former career as an academic, Mr. Bernanke made a point of laying out his own views, from the significance of the United States' current-account deficit to the outlook for productivity, even when he disagreed with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 Mr. Bernanke agreed with Mr. Greenspan on most issues, but he strongly disagreed on how the central bank should communicate its goals. Mr. Bernanke argued that the Fed should set a public ''inflation target,'' which he contended would make Fed policy more transparent to investors. Mr. Greenspan opposes that idea, saying it would overly restrict the Fed's flexibility. 
 David Skidmore, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, said Mr. Bernanke would remain at the central bank until the Senate confirms him for the White House position.

HEADLINE: Mugabe's Party Wins Majority In Zimbabwe

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and SHARON LaFRANIERE

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, April 1 

 BODY:
President Robert G. Mugabe's party routed its opponents in parliamentary elections, nearly complete returns showed Friday, dashing forecasts of an opposition surge and solidifying the president's 25-year grip on Zimbabwe politics.
 The lopsided outcome cast fresh doubts on the strength and strategy of the opposition, as well as the fairness of the vote. Mr. Mugabe's opponents, who lost elections in 2000 and 2002 that were widely condemned as rigged, again charged fraud in Thursday's election. 
 Some democracy advocates urged the opposition to mount mass protests. They said the returns proved that a fair election was impossible in this increasingly isolated country where democratic freedoms are a matter of Mr. Mugabe's whim. 
 At a news conference, Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, charged that Mr. Mugabe's party had stolen the election through intimidation and vote-rigging, and he left open the prospect that he would urge his supporters to take to the streets. ''Zimbabweans must defend their right to vote and they must defend their vote,'' he said. 
 But supporters of Mr. Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF, said the results of Zimbabwe's first peaceful election in five years showed that the 81-year-old president ruled not by force or threats, but with overwhelming popular support. 
 Reports of irregularities were scattered but persistent. Domestic election observers said the fairness of the vote would be impossible to assess until reports were filed this weekend from more than 6,000 poll monitors. The Bush administration, however, issued a statement that all but condemned the vote. ''Although the election campaign and election day itself were generally peaceful, the election was not free and fair,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a written statement. ''The electoral playing field was heavily tilted in the government's favor.'' 
 With almost 90 percent of the districts reporting, election analysts said that ZANU-PF had captured 70 seats in the 150-seat Parliament. Because Mr. Mugabe appoints 30 other members, that gave the party a two-thirds majority in the legislature, Mr. Mugabe's main goal.
 The opposition Movement for Democratic Change, known as the M.D.C., had won 35 seats, far short of the 51 it held entering Thursday's vote. One seat was won by an independent candidate. With just 14 races undecided, the opposition could gather only a few more seats, at best, analysts said. 
 That would make the ruling ZANU-PF all but unassailable in the national legislature, and render the opposition essentially toothless. 
 The opposition and some democracy advocates contended even before the election that the ruling party had rigged the vote. While they monitored the actual voting, election observers could not verify either the number of ballots printed or the accuracy of voter rolls, which are widely reported to be padded with vast numbers of dead or nonresident citizens. 
 About one in 10 voters was turned away from polling stations, although government officials insisted that those voters had been improperly registered. Opposition officials complained that large numbers of their election monitors had been wrongly evicted from polling places as votes were being tallied.
 The government also redrew the boundaries in some districts, weakening opposition strongholds. 
 But the crucial factor in Mr. Mugabe's victory, some democracy advocates said, was five years of strong-arm rule that they said had conditioned voters to fear government retaliation if they supported the opposition. 
 A relaxation of that intimidation created the appearance of a free election in recent weeks, as foreign journalists and observers entered the country, but did not reverse the impact of years of violence and threats, they said.
 ''All the things you are seeing now only happened in the last four weeks,'' Reginald Matchaba-Hove, head of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, a pro-democracy coalition, said in an interview on Friday. Until then, he said, ''the political space was closed.''
 Lovemore Madhuku, one of Zimbabwe's best-known democracy advocates, echoed opposition calls for protests. ''People must show their disaffection with Mugabe through other means,'' Mr. Madhuku said. ''Let us make people appreciate that unless we change the rules, there is no way that we can win an election.''
 Friday's tallies poured cold water on the predictions of several top opposition officials earlier this week of big electoral gains. Those predictions were based in part on huge turnouts of supporters at rallies for M.D.C. candidates, the tepid response to Mr. Mugabe's appearance at many ZANU-PF rallies, and a strong turnout of voters in the first hours of Thursday's vote.
 Before the election, Mr. Mugabe presided over a political party riven by blood feuds and beset by a resurgent opposition. After it, the opposition is in disarray, and the issue of who will succeed him seems his to decide. Some analysts suggest that Mr. Mugabe expressly wanted a two-thirds parliamentary majority so he could rewrite the Constitution to allow him to select a successor before the 2008 presidential elections.
 Should sympathetic international observers declare the vote fair, Mr. Mugabe may even puncture Zimbabwe's diplomatic isolation by Western nations. That might increase foreign assistance, making his gamble that he could persuade outsiders that the election was honest look shrewd.
 But that is the short term. In the long run, some say, the renewal of Mr. Mugabe's 25-year autocracy may be its undoing. Zimbabwe's problems -- a worthless currency, a collapsed economy, an exodus of skilled citizens, a hungry and sick population whose life expectancy has literally been halved -- are unchanged by the election.

HEADLINE: U.S. Automakers Lose Ground to Rivals

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1 

 BODY:
Auto sales perked up in March, though domestic carmakers continued to lose ground to foreign competitors. 
 Sales at General Motors fell 1.5 percent and were down 4.9 percent at Ford Motor from the month a year earlier, while Nissan Motor reported a 12.6 percent increase, the first time the company had sold more than 100,000 cars and trucks in the United States in a month. 
 Also on Friday, the outlook for the nation's largest auto parts supplier, the Delphi Corporation, continued to darken with a report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Postal Service had joined the Securities and Exchange Commission in investigating a widening accounting scandal that has already led to the ouster of some of the company's top executives. 
 Shares of Delphi fell 3.6 percent, to $4.32 each, near the company's record low. 
 With the release of the March sales figures, automakers continued to argue among themselves about the effect of rising gas prices on the behavior of shoppers. While Ford contended that gas prices were a contributing factor to slipping sales of large sport utility vehicles, Paul Ballew, the chief industry sales analyst at G.M., said that was not the case, adding that such suggestions reflected ''poor analysis and poor journalism.''
 G.M., which is struggling on a number of fronts and expecting sharply lower earnings this year, is banking on strong sales of big new S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks when they start to arrive in showrooms next year.
 Over all, auto sales rose 0.8 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 16.8 million cars and trucks, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That rate, considered robust by analysts and executives, was an improvement over a sluggish January and February. Ward's adjusts sales figures for the number of selling days in any given month.
 Continuing losses of market share by G.M. and Ford are taking their toll on the Midwest, because auto suppliers like Delphi depend on the two automakers for business. Michigan now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, at 7.5 percent, according to new jobs data released this week. 
 In the first quarter, traditional domestic brands accounted for 57.8 percent of American sales, down from 59.1 percent a year earlier, according to the Autodata Corporation. 
 G.M. said its relatively flat sales performance for the month was a marked improvement over steep sales declines in the previous two months, and the company reported its biggest March for large pickup truck sales in more than two decades. 
 ''We admit that January and February were very subpar,'' Mr. Ballew said in a conference call Friday. ''It was important for us to see our sales accelerate in March on the retail side of the business, and we're pleased with the rate of improvement we saw.''
 At Delphi, G.M.'s former parts division and one of the nation's largest companies, intense scrutiny has followed recent revelations that an internal accounting inquiry disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars in accounting irregularities since the company was spun off from G.M. in 2000. The involvement of the F.B.I. and Postal Service was first reported today by The Detroit News. 
 ''We're working with the other agencies, the S.E.C., the Department of Justice and the postal inspectors,'' said Dawn Clenney, an F.B.I. spokeswoman. She declined to discuss the investigation. 
 Detroit's bright spot remains the Chrysler division of the German automaker DaimlerChrysler, whose sales were up 4 percent in March. The division has been propelled by strong sales of new products, chiefly the Chrysler 300 sedan and minivans like the Chrysler Town and Country. But sales of the company's Dodge Ram pickup, a crucial profit center, fell 20 percent in March as newer models from Ford and Nissan and big rebate offers from G.M. made for a competitive market. The company will start selling a modestly redesigned Ram late in the year.
 American shoppers continued to migrate to Asian brands. Sales at Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were up 12.3 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. Nissan, in addition to setting a one-month sales record, sold one million vehicles for the first time in its fiscal year, which ends in March.

 BODY:

Lions Gate Said to Consider Bid for British TV Company
Lions Gate Entertainment, the large independent film studio, is considering making an unsolicited bid worth more than $1 billion for HIT Entertainment, the British television company behind programs like ''Barney'' and ''Bob the Builder,'' according to executives close to the company.
 The bid would come just two weeks after HIT reached a deal to be sold to Apax Partners, a private equity firm, for $:489.4 million, or about $922 million, and could prompt a protracted takeover battle. [C2.]

Fed Governor Nominated to Council
President Bush said he would nominate Ben S. Bernanke, left, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, to head his Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Bernanke, a former professor of economics at Princeton, has been one of the central bank's most visible policymakers and is regarded as one of the nation's leading monetary economists. Mr. Bernanke, 51, will be taking over a position that has waxed and waned in its influence over the years. [C4.]

MCI to Renew Talks With Qwest
MCI said that it would reopen merger talks with Qwest Communications, which bid $8.9 billion for the company on Thursday. MCI's board agreed this week to be bought by Verizon Communications for $7.6 billion. [C4.]

Executives in Japan Less Optimistic
Japanese corporate leaders are much less optimistic about business prospects than they were three months ago as they worry about fading export growth, a widely followed Bank of Japan survey showed. [C3.]

Tobacco Industry Trial Widens
The racketeering trial against the tobacco industry, already one of the costliest cases prosecuted by the Justice Department, is being heard in two courts at once and could reach a third, raising questions about what the government might gain with a victory. [A11.]

MetLife Building in Manhattan Sold
The MetLife Building, a signature Manhattan skyscraper formerly known as the PanAm Building, has been sold for $1.72 billion. The principal buyer is Tishman Speyer Properties, which also owns the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center. [B3.]

Insulation Problem Found on Planes
Maintenance workers have found burned pieces of insulation blankets apparently ignited by electrical sparks, on Boeing airplanes built in the 1980's, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The agency proposed replacing the blankets on 831 planes. [A16.]

Google to Expand E-Mail Capacity
Google is doubling the amount of storage offered on its e-mail service and plans to remove limits on message capacity. [C3.]

Taser Issues Warning on Revenue
Taser International, the maker of electric stun guns, said its first-quarter revenue would fall short of expectations because of negative publicity about the safety of its products. [C10.]

Stocks Decline on Economic News
A report showing strong growth in the service sector and record high oil prices sent stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 99.46 points, to 10,404.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.67 points, to 1,172.92, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 14.42 points, to 1,984.81. For the week, the Dow lost 0.37 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.31 percent. The S.&P. 500 rose 0.13 percent for the week. [C4.]

A.I.G. Shares Fall to a Two-Year Low
Shares of the American International Group tumbled 8 percent to their lowest price in two years, as concerns mounted that investigators may find more improper accounting. [C10.]

HEADLINE: Budget Airlines Set Off on a Cross-Country Joy Ride

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, flying across the United States was much the same as it had been throughout much of the jet age. Passengers booked a ticket on one of the big airlines, like United or American, and paid an average of $600 round-trip in coach class unless they snagged a discount.
 As recently as 2000, major airlines had a lock on 85 percent of transcontinental business, defined as trips of 2,000 miles or more within the 48 contiguous states. Most offered at least two classes of service, sometimes three, with hot meals and all the other amenities customers came to expect on long flights. 
 ''It was really a market that the big legacy carriers had all to themselves,'' said Darin Lee, a senior economist with LECG, an economics forecasting and consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. 
 Not any more. Low-fare airlines have been gobbling market share throughout the industry, and they are now focusing on the transcontinental market with a vengeance. Cross-country flights account for almost half the business that the low-fare companies have added during this decade, LECG estimates.
 The low-fare airlines' share of this market jumped to 37 percent of available seats last year, from just 13 percent five years ago. As a result, average ticket prices have plummeted, turning the transcontinental market, like those for flights within California or from East Coast cities to Florida -- into a big air-fare flea market. 
 And the transcontinental growth of the low-fare airlines looks far from finished.
 Over the next few weeks and months, airlines like Southwest, JetBlue, Independence Air and Song, the low-fare carrier run by Delta, all plan to start new routes and add flights between the coasts.
 Major airlines are battling back with a number of strategies, including extra frequent-flier miles, fare cuts to lure bargain hunters and premium services to attract well-heeled travelers, on the theory that there are still people willing to pay more for cross-country comfort. 
 Yet, clearly, consumers are eager to pay less. The average one-way fare for a transcontinental flight has dropped by 39 percent, to $183, this year, from $302 in 2000, according to Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting firm.
 Inevitably, airlines' revenue on those flights has tumbled. In 2000, major airlines collected 11.4 cents a seat mile -- flying one passenger one mile -- on transcontinental routes, according to LECG. Last year, that figure was just 8.3 cents. Low-fare airlines, meanwhile, took in even less: about 6.2 cents a seat mile, according to LECG.
 But in that same period, the number of daily nonstop flights on transcontinental routes has jumped by 7.5 percent, to 670 from 623, proof that plenty of passengers want to fly cross-country. 
 Within weeks, travelers will have even more opportunities. On April 14, Independence Air begins flights between Washington Dulles International Airport and San Diego. On May 1, it plans to add flights from Dulles to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, Calif., and Seattle. 
 That is the same day Song begins service between Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles, taking over a route that its parent, Delta, has long operated. 
 On May 4, Southwest begins flights from Pittsburgh to four cities. On May 17, JetBlue will begin service between Kennedy and Portland, Ore., and on May 24 between J.F.K. and Burbank, Calif., its third airport in the Los Angeles area. (It already serves Long Beach and Ontario.) 
 Even more long-distance routes will be added later in the spring and during the summer. But not all the service is aimed at those on a budget.
 United, which is owned by the UAL Corporation and is traditionally the biggest player on the transcontinental scene, has upgraded its service from Kennedy to focus on upscale passengers who may be willing to pay for frills that low-fare rivals do not offer.
 In October, United introduced p.s., for premium service, on some flights between New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. The airline pulled 70 seats out of a series of Boeing 757's, leaving them with just 120 seats in first, business and economy-plus, which provides more legroom than standard economy. 
 Reminiscent of the top-level service that airlines once offered routinely, United redecorated the planes, hired a chef and, in first class, installed lie-flat beds like those already used by airlines on overseas flights.
 Prices are competitive: on United's Web site last week, the cheapest round-trip p.s. flight from Kennedy to Los Angeles was $266.90. A flight from Kennedy to Long Beach, on JetBlue, meanwhile, was $268. (Neither price included taxes or fees.)
 All seven of United's daily flights from Kennedy to both Los Angeles and San Francisco now offer p.s. service, a step that the airline said was justified by an increase in demand on those routes. 
 The low-fare market ''is the biggest market out there, but it's not the only market,'' said John P. Tague, United executive vice president for sales and marketing. ''The fight over customers who will purchase our product is equally as important as the fight with the low-fare carriers.''
 That philosophy wins applause from one of Mr. Tague's low-fare rivals. ''You don't defend everything,'' said Robert Fornaro, the president at AirTran Airways, which offers transcontinental flights from Atlanta. ''You pick your core markets and that's where you should be.''
 Despite United's service upgrade, its 757 is a narrow-body plane. That is a nod to another trend in the transcontinental market: smaller aircraft.
 Even at the beginning of this decade, airlines routinely flew wide-body jumbo jets on such routes. By contrast, many low-fare carriers fly the same smaller Airbus A-320's and Boeing 737's cross-country that they use on shorter trips.
 That is where amenities like in-flight entertainment systems, a hallmark on JetBlue since it began flying five years ago, can make a big difference, at least in assuaging boredom.
 As Song introduces its West Coast service, which also includes flights to Seattle and San Francisco beginning in July, it is heralding a new seatback system with 24 channels of live satellite TV, 24 channels of audio programs, digitally streamed music allowing passengers to create their own playlists and the choice of 10 movies.
 Delta's vice president for marketing, Paul Matsen, says he thinks that the entertainment system, as well as ''wonderful food and custom cocktails'' (available at a price), will help his airline battle JetBlue, which has a valuable head start on transcontinental travel. Song is also trumpeting that it will fly to Los Angeles International Airport, which JetBlue does not serve. 
 Mr. Lee at LECG said Delta, which is struggling to avoid a bankruptcy filing, might have made the right move by substituting Song's one-class service for its traditional flights, which, like those of its traditional rivals, featured multicabin service.
 ''In light of what United has done, I don't know if there's room'' for more airlines to try to attract passengers with premium service, especially because American is also in that market, Mr. Lee said. 
 ''If you're talking about maximum differentiation, this may be the right bet,'' he said of Song.
 Yet some analysts wonder whether the transcontinental fare competition can continue as the industry battles record prices for jet fuel. Airlines have raised prices three times over the last six weeks, including fares for some transcontinental flights, and more increases are likely if fuel prices continue to climb.
 But Robert W. Mann, an industry analyst based in Port Washington, N.Y., said he thought the transcontinental market could keep growing as long as prices remained relatively low. But, Mr. Mann said, airlines ''are never headed back to those old levels of profitability, ever again.''

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:

THE AMERICAN LEAGUE team capsules were written by Murray Chass. Teams are listed in the predicted order of finish.

A.L. EAST

YANKEES
Joe Torre, 10th season
Last season: 101-61, first place
George Steinbrenner sent his favorite vehicle into the shop for an overhaul in the off-season, and it emerged with a new driver and two new passengers. He expects Randy Johnson, Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright to lead the Yankees to the World Series.
 Pitching was below par last year, and the Yankees made its improvement the No. 1 priority over the winter. With Johnson in the driver's seat, the Yankees should have little trouble gaining their eighth straight division title.
 Perhaps more significant, the Yankees can become the first team to win 100 or more games in four consecutive seasons. Last year, the Yankees became the fifth team to reach 100 victories for a third straight season.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Johnson, Pavano, Wright, Tony Womack, Tino Martinez
KEY LOSSES -- Jon Lieber, Javier Vazquez, Orlando Hernandez, Miguel Cairo
KEY TO SEASON -- Instead of dwelling on how they lost to the Red Sox in the playoffs last season, they have to make sure it does not happen again.

BOSTON RED SOX
Terry Francona, 2nd season
Last season: 98-64, wild card
No one currently alive has previewed the Red Sox coming off a World Series-winning season, so how do we do this? Say that for the first time in 86 years they have a chance to repeat? Say that they have a chance to start another 86-year streak without winning the World Series?
 What the Red Sox have not done is win the division title for the last nine years.
 Like the Yankees, they have made significant changes in their rotation.
 At shortstop, the Red Sox have gone from Nomar Garciaparra to Orlando Cabrera to Edgar Renteria, and they should survive. A healthy Trot Nixon, who was limited to 48 games by back and leg injuries last season, frees Kevin Millar for full-time duty at first base.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Renteria, David Wells, Matt Clement, Wade Miller
KEY LOSSES -- Pedro Martinez, Derek Lowe, Cabrera, Pokey Reese
KEY TO SEASON -- At 41 going on 42 next month, Wells has to fill the Martinez void, beginning with his opening-day start at Yankee Stadium.

BALTIMORE ORIOLES
Lee Mazzilli, 2nd season
Last season: 78-84, 3rd place
The Orioles are so loaded offensively they do not have a ready spot for David Newhan, who batted .400 for much of last season and wound up at .311 in 95 games. Instead, they plan to use him in center field and at third base as much as they can. He may even spell Sammy Sosa in right field, if Sosa ever needs someone to spell him. Sosa is the new (not corked) bat in the lineup, making the Orioles the first team to have two 500-home-run players: Sosa (574) and Rafael Palmeiro (551).
 The team's chances of improvement, however, depend more on their pitchers, including Erik Bedard (6-10 last season), Daniel Cabrera (12-8) and Rodrigo Lopez (14-9). The biggest improvement has to come from Sidney Ponson (11-15), who gained greater notoriety this off-season for punching a judge on a beach in his native Aruba.

KEY ADDITION -- Sosa
KEY LOSS -- Jerry Hairston Jr.
KEY TO SEASON -- They have to ignore that they are in the same division as the Yankees and the Red Sox and not let themselves be intimidated by the fact that they are.

TORONTO BLUE JAYS
John Gibbons, 2nd season
Last season: 67-94, 5th place
A huge step backward is what the Blue Jays took last year. Just when they thought they were making progress toward the level that brought them two consecutive World Series titles in the early 1990's, they tumbled badly, gaining 19 fewer victories than in 2003.
 Worse, they let the Devil Rays get out of last place for the first time in their seven-year existence. Now they are the ones who have to climb out of the cellar. They could go a long way toward that goal if Vernon Wells regains his punch.
 Last season, Wells plunged to 23 home runs from 33, and to 67 runs batted in from 117. His bat will be needed, especially with Carlos Delgado gone.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Corey Koskie, Shea Hillenbrand
KEY LOSS -- Delgado
KEY TO SEASON -- They have switched their third baseman to first base (Eric Hinske) and a starting pitcher to the closer's role (Miguel Batista), but they will need some changed performances to start making progress again.

TAMPA BAY DEVIL RAYS
Lou Piniella, 3rd season
Last season: 70-91, 4th place
They had a Champagne toast on the last day of last season, because their victory over Detroit that day gave them 70 in a season for the first time. Their challenge this year will be to win at least that many.
 It could not have been a good omen to have two players they signed as free agents, Roberto Alomar and Danny Bautista, retire recently on the same day. Clubs sign free agents to help them win, not to retire. They also signed the veteran pitcher Hideo Nomo, but he is not likely to help, either.
 In addition, center fielder Rocco Baldelli is expected to miss half the season with a knee injury, and Alex Sanchez will replace him. The Devil Rays may see brighter days ahead, but they are probably seeing mirages.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Travis Lee, Alex Gonzalez
KEY LOSSES -- Tino Martinez, Jose Cruz Jr.
KEY TO SEASON -- The Devil Rays might not have the Blue Jays to sneak past this year, so they may need some managerial magic.

A.L. CENTRAL

MINNESOTA TWINS
Ron Gardenhire, 4th season
Last season: 92-70, first place
If his team cooperates, Ron Gardenhire can become the first manager to finish in first place in each of his first four seasons. The Twins have had a way of doing things the way Gardenhire has wanted. Tom Kelly, his predecessor, taught him well.
 Gardenhire's biggest job this year will be replacing the left side of his infield, with Corey Koskie and Cristian Guzman having left as free agents. But if the replacements do as well as the Twins' closer, Joe Nathan, did last year (44 saves) in replacing Eddie Guardado (86 saves his last two years with the Twins), the team should be in good shape.
 They will also be in good shape if Johan Santana duplicates his Cy Young award season (20-6, league-low 2.61 E.R.A., league-high 265 strikeouts).

KEY ADDITION -- Jason Bartlett
KEY LOSSES -- Koskie, Guzman
KEY TO SEASON -- They had their catcher, Joe Mauer, for only 29 starts last season, and his presence could help make up for whatever loss they suffer on the left side of the infield.

CLEVELAND INDIANS
Eric Wedge, 3rd season
Last season: 80-82, 3rd place
On Aug. 15 last year, the Indians were in second place, a game out of first. Their season might as well have ended then and there. They lost 27 of the remaining 44 games, and their season of surprise became another deflating experience.
 But the first 118 games demonstrated that the Indians were on their way back, and they will try to make it even further this year.
 They have fortified themselves by adding Aaron Boone at third base, Juan Gonzalez in a comeback year in right field and Kevin Millwood to the starting rotation. They have also improved their depth with Alex Cora as a utility infielder, after he started 122 games at second for the division-champion Dodgers.
 Casey Blake moves from third base to left field, and 22-year-old Jhonny Peralta replaces Omar Vizquel at shortstop.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Boone, Arthur Rhodes, Cora, Gonzalez, Millwood
KEY LOSSES -- Vizquel, Matt Lawton
KEY TO SEASON -- As they develop, the young Indians will keep pushing toward the top.

CHICAGO WHITE SOX
Ozzie Guillen, 2nd season
Last season: 83-79, 2nd place
Three consecutive second-place finishes have earned the White Sox nothing, so they have changed their approach. Even though they tied the Yankees for most home runs in the league last season, they decided to add speed and base stealing to the team, which meant trading Carlos Lee for Scott Podsednik.
 Podsednik, the major league leader with 70 stolen bases last season, will be the leadoff hitter. He and Jermaine Dye replace Lee and Magglio Ordonez in the outfield.
 The White Sox also have a new Japanese second baseman, Tadahito Iguchi, to go with their Japanese closer, Shingo Takatsu, and a second Cuban starting pitcher, Orlando Hernandez, whom they signed as a free agent, to go with Jose Contreras.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Dye, Podsednik, Hernandez, A. J. Pierzynski, Iguchi
KEY LOSSES -- Lee, Jose Valentin, Ordonez
KEY TO SEASON -- A quick recovery by Frank Thomas from a foot injury would enable him to join Paul Konerko in driving in runs.

DETROIT TIGERS
Alan Trammell, 3rd season
Last season: 72-90, 4th place
If the Tigers have as big a won-loss swing this year as they had last year, they will finish with a 101-61 record. That's highly unlikely, but so was the Tigers' improvement last season. They finished 20 games out of first place, compared with 47 games out the previous season.
 Ivan Rodriguez was the team's major addition for last season. The Tigers, who had not previously spent much money, added Magglio Ordonez for this season, despite his surgically repaired left knee, which frightened off other teams.
 In addition to surprising expenditures, the Tigers made a surprising move in spring training when they released their center fielder, Alex Sanchez, who batted .322 last season. Craig Monroe, who has replaced him, led the league's outfielders last season with 11 errors and had the lowest fielding percentage, .960.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Ordonez, Troy Percival
KEY LOSS -- Eric Munson
KEY TO SEASON -- At the rate the Tigers are going, signing one major free agent a year, they should contend in about 10 years.

KANSAS CITY ROYALS
Tony Pea, 4th season
Last season: 58-104, 5th place
If the Royals have as big a won-loss swing this year as they had last year, they will finish with a 33-129 record. That is not going to happen, but the Royals had a hugely disappointing reversal from 2003, when they were the league's surprise team on the positive side. The combined difference in the Royals' and Tigers' records over the two seasons? Fifty-four games.
 The Royals played last season with a pitching staff crippled by injuries. Not surprising, it was the league's worst. Unable to do what the Yankees did to reinvent their staff, the Royals signed Jose Lima, who had a 13-5 record with the Dodgers.
 There is not much experience backing the pitching. Third baseman Mark Teahen is a rookie, and when he is taken into account with the outfield and the catcher, the Royals have five players in their lineup with a total of five and a third years of major league experience.

KEY ADDITION -- Lima
KEY LOSSES -- Joe Randa, Benito Santiago
KEY TO SEASON -- The inexperienced have to become experienced quickly.

A.L. WEST

ANGELS OF ANAHEIM
Mike Scioscia, 6th season
Last season: 92-70, first place
Although they may have an identity crisis, the Angels of Anaheim or Los Angeles or wherever they say they reside are a good team, good enough to win a second successive division title.
 They have made some changes, other than to their name, opting to go with younger players at two positions. The rookie Dallas McPherson was expected to replace Troy Glaus at third base, but he has been injured and will start the season in the minors. Francisco Rodriguez, who will be the closer in place of Troy Percival, is ready for his role. Last season, he struck out 123 batters in 84 innings and had a 1.82 E.R.A.
 In another change, the Angels let David Eckstein go and signed Orlando Cabrera play shortstop, where he played for Boston in the World Series. Steve Finley, a young 40, is the new center fielder.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Finley, Cabrera
KEY LOSSES -- Percival, Eckstein, Jose Guillen
KEY TO SEASON -- Unless they become lost thinking they really do play in Los Angeles, they should win without having to do anything spectacular.

OAKLAND ATHLETICS
Ken Macha, 3rd year
Last season: 91-71, 2nd place
The Big Three pitchers who fueled the team's pennant-contending status the past several seasons are down to the Big One. Only Barry Zito remains; Tim Hudson is in Atlanta, and Mark Mulder in St. Louis. In their places are Joe Blanton and Danny Haren. Will they fuel the next cycle of contending?
 Blanton will join right fielder Nick Swisher, son of the former major league catcher Steve Swisher, in trying to succeed Oakland shortstop Bobby Crosby as the American League rookie of the year. Another rookie is 36-year-old Keiichi Yabu, who pitched in the Japanese major leagues for 11 years.
 While they were shedding pitchers for economic reasons, the A's added to their payroll by obtaining Jason Kendall to catch the remaining pitchers. Another newcomer is outfielder Charles Thomas, who as a rookie was a major factor in Atlanta's latest first-place finish.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Kendall, Haren, Dan Meyer
KEY LOSSES -- Hudson, Mulder, Jermaine Dye, Damian Miller
KEY TO SEASON -- If the young pitchers deliver, the A's could compete for first.

TEXAS RANGERS
Buck Showalter, 3rd season
Last season: 89-73, 3rd place
After four consecutive last-place finishes, the Rangers surprised the division by contending for first place. With six weeks to go last season, they were only a half-game out of first. But a 20-21 finish spoiled any chance they had of pulling off a major upset. The Rangers nevertheless improved their record by 18 games.
 The pitching staff, which had been dreadful, has made the biggest improvement. The starting rotation is not exactly filled with household names, though Kenny Rogers (18-9 last season) is known well enough. Right behind Rogers is Ryan Drese (14-10), a late bloomer whom Cleveland gave up on. He will be 29 on opening day.
 Offensively, the Ranger's strength remains in the infield, with Mark Teixeira (38 homers, 112 R.B.I.), Alfonso Soriano (28, 91), Michael Young (22, 99) and Hank Blalock (32, 110).

KEY ADDITION -- Richard Hidalgo
KEY LOSS -- Brian Jordan
KEY TO SEASON -- The pitching has to hold up again for another run at the division title.

SEATTLE MARINERS
Mike Hargrove, first season
Last season: 63-99, 4th place
Mike Hargrove is a veteran manager, with 13 years in Cleveland and Baltimore, and he is the only new manager in the league this season. He takes over a team that finished 26 games behind the team immediately above it, the greatest distance between any two adjacent teams in the majors last season.
 To bolster the league's weakest offense, the Mariners signed two lusty-hitting free agents, Adrian Beltre and Richie Sexson. While a shoulder injury limited Sexson to 23 games with Arizona, Beltre had a belated breakthrough year in his seventh season with the Dodgers. He batted .334, hit a major-league-high 48 home runs and drove in 121 runs, all career highs.
 Both hitters will be in position to drive in Ichiro Suzuki, who last season set a major league record with 262 hits. Gone from the lineup is Edgar Martinez, the excellent designated hitter, who has retired with a .312 average in his 16-year career.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Beltre, Sexson, Pokey Reese
KEY LOSS -- Martinez
KEY TO SEASON -- They need more than Sexson and Beltre to regain respectability.

HEADLINE: Easy Money or Risky Business?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
FOR some people, the only way to afford a house is to rent out all or part of it. The extra income, of course, helps offset carrying costs like the mortgage, taxes and insurance.
 But while rentals can bring in extra money, they can also create headaches, particularly for owners who sidestep local laws. That might include adding an illegal apartment or overselling shares of a beach house. 
 ''All I can say is, 'Don't do it,''' said Mary Ann Hallenborg, a landlord-tenant lawyer in Manhattan and the author of ''The New York Landlord's Law Book'' (Nolo, 2003). Those who are caught, she says, face hefty penalties, and they may have little legal recourse in resolving tenant disputes.
 In New York City, for example, illegal apartment conversions can result in thousands of dollars in fines and, in rare instances, jail time. The initial maximum penalty is $2,500, plus a $50-a-day fine for each illegal unit, up to 45 days, and owners may also have to dismantle the apartments.
 And in Southampton, on Long Island, violating regulations that prohibit house shares and limit rentals to five or fewer unrelated people could bring fines of up to $8,000 on a first offense. 
 Building officials maintain that illegal rentals can pose safety hazards because they often circumvent fire or building codes, and they may breach zoning ordinances that limit the number of occupants in a building and its usage, to control neighborhood noise and traffic. Yet many homeowners are willing to take the chance. Why not, they might ask, when the chances of getting caught in some communities are usually slim? 
 ''It's one of those things where everyone seems to look the other way,'' said Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, who specializes in Hamptons properties. ''It's an economic issue -- the shops, restaurants and bars are setting up for all these crowds, and there aren't many hotels, so where do these people stay?''
 In the Hamptons and other beach communities, ''there are code enforcers that are supposed to go around and check,'' Ms. Saatchi said, referring to occupancy levels. ''But it's interesting that most work Monday through Friday and most of the crowds come on Saturdays and Sundays.'' (In Southampton, at least, enforcers do work seven days a week, according to Stephen Frano, the town's code-enforcement officer.)
 Illegal rentals seem to have been tolerated mainly because they satisfy a need for affordable places to vacation or live, particularly in expensive suburbs where the apartment stock is low. In boroughs like Queens and Staten Island it is very common to find ''illegal threes,'' or legitimate two-family houses that have an illegal third apartment, typically in a basement or attic.
 But while many owners might avoid the radar screens of local building-code inspectors, they could still encounter other potentially serious conflicts, legal experts say. 
 What will they do, for instance, if they need to evict a tenant who has stopped paying rent? Landlords might be reluctant about going through the proper channels in housing court for fear of drawing attention to an illegal rental, and in some cases they may not be allowed to evict anyway.
 Landlords instead may have to file an ''ejectment action'' in civil or state courts, ''which is a long, slow and expensive process,'' Ms. Hallenborg said. And they might not be able to recover unpaid rent either, she added. ''If you're in certain parts of New York City, courts have held pretty consistently that no rent may be recovered when the law is violated,'' she said. 
 There are insurance issues to consider. Some carriers might balk at paying claims, or even void a policy, if they find out that an insured building has an illegal apartment. 
 Problems can also arise when it's time for the owner to sell. ''I just had a closing that was held up because the sellers did not have a certificate of occupancy for a two-family, even though it was being sold as one,'' said Neil Garfinkel, a real estate lawyer based in Manhattan. ''They had to get a new certificate of occupancy.''
 Still, even homeowners who follow the letter of the law can occasionally run into trouble. ''Their tenants might make changes that are in violation of building or fire codes,'' Ms. Hallenborg said. ''They might erect floor-to-ceiling walls to add a room.'' 
 Michael Daly, a vice president for operations at Corcoran, though, knows of one owner who wasn't too upset by the changes made to his beach house in the Hamptons.
 A high-profile tenant ''rearranged the furniture and redecorated the house, without contacting the landlord,'' he said. ''Everything, including drapes and carpet and linens, had been changed. They stored the old stuff in the basement, and when they moved, they left everything. It was kind of nice.''

LENGTH: 1276 words

HEADLINE: The Virtue of Chic With the Value Of Cheap

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
SOUTH KOREA'S automakers have made steady gains with American customers by selling low-price vehicles packed with features and supported by long warranties. Now they are adding some styling pizazz to the mix, which includes levels of refinement approaching that of well-regarded Japanese-brand cars.
 Check out the Kia Spectra 5, a sporty new hatchback. While the last-generation Spectra came only as a frumpy small sedan, Kia has thoroughly revamped the line for 2005 and added this five-passenger ''five door'' model -- like many competitors, Kia counts the rear hatch as a door. 
 While hatchbacks have never been big sellers in the American market, their numbers are growing. The Spectra 5 wades into a pool already brimming with similarly configured cars: Ford Focus ZX5, Pontiac Vibe, Scion xB, Suzuki Reno, Toyota Matrix and the hatchback version of the hot-selling Mazda 3. Hyundai, Kia's corporate cousin, has its own sporty hatch, the Elantra GT. 
 Kia expects 30 percent of Spectra buyers to choose the hatchback. But even the sedan is more distinctive now, thanks to a complete redesign and re-engineering that relegates the unimpressive old Spectra to the backlot of automotive history. 
 The sedan now has an arched roof. A sharp crease along the sides gives the illusion of a wedge shape. The top-line sedan, the SX (there are also LX and EX versions) looks the sportiest, with a black mesh grille, fog lights and a rear spoiler.
 All Spectra 5's come with trim similar to the SX sedans', but these hatchbacks have an even bolder look inspired by the import-tuner crowd. The influence of these young customizers has spread from Los Angeles across the country and around the world.
 The Spectra sedan's wheelbase is two inches longer now, and the car is roomier. Its trunk, at 12.2 cubic feet, is also larger. 
 The Spectra 5 is six inches shorter than the sedan, but while it is more stubby, there is 18.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seat. When that seat is completely folded -- it is split, so you can leave part of it up for a passenger -- capacity expands to an impressive 52.8 cubic feet. 
 I took the Spectra 5 on a five-day family vacation in California, and the space behind the back seat was adequate for our luggage (though, in truth, the three of us packed light). Another passenger or two, or a bit more baggage, would have been too much. As it was, the cargo bay was stuffed so full that the rear shelf jutted upward.
 While Americans have been slow to embrace the hatchback -- in contrast to the Europeans and Japanese -- I've long been a fan of this practical, versatile body style. We found the car particularly easy to load and unload at hotels from Santa Monica to Newport Beach to Venice. 
 At a fancy private club in Newport Beach, the Spectra 5 caught the eye of a valet attendant who spends his days shuttling luxury cars from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Lexus. Without prompting, he admired the silver Spectra 5's sporty lines and refined interior. He was more impressed when I told him that this particular car carried a price around $16,000.
 Spectra sedans are $13,160 and up. The Spectra 5 starts at $15,455, and there are relatively few options.
 Indeed, the Spectra 5 served as a comfy home for our California trip. Like the exterior, the cabin gives the impression that the Spectra is a far more expensive car -- and a significant step up for a small Kia. The dashboard, for instance, is covered with a large expanse of a higher quality plastic than is found in many economy cars. There are relatively few separate panels, and thus fairly few seams; the lines that were evident fit snugly like puzzle pieces. 
 Other touches, like the plastic trim around the stereo and climate controls in the center of the dash looked like a reasonable facsimile of a metallic finish. There are metal pedals, shared with the SX sedan; large round gauges; classy fabric on the seats and door panels; and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.
 The seats proved comfortable on jaunts that often ended up taking a couple of hours. The various cup holders and molded storage bins proved useful for the many beverages and maps required for the trip.
 The surprises didn't end there; the front-drive car was much more fun to drive than I had expected. All Spectras share their architecture with the Hyundai Elantra. The Elantra GT is Hyundai's sporty equivalent of the Spectra 5. 
 Like the Elantra, the Spectras are powered by a new 2-liter 4-cylinder engine. With sophisticated variable valve timing, just like the engines in a Toyota or Honda, it makes 138 horsepower. While no racecar, the Spectra 5 was peppy enough, especially with a five-speed manual transmission. I was able to zip in and out of tight openings on congested California freeways.
 The Spectra 5 looks like an ideal canvas for the young import-tuners, who could probably squeeze more power out of the engine. In fact, Kia itself is playing around with ways to soup up the Spectra 5 with things like a supercharger.
 The Spectra 5, like the SX sedan, comes with a sport-tuned suspension for more responsive handling. I gave the car a mild workout on the Pacific Coast Highway and along twisting mountain roads around Malibu. As the driver, I was constantly entertained even as my two teenage passengers rode in comfort. 
 Still, as we cruised the jammed Santa Monica Freeway, where traffic often screeches to a halt with little warning, I recalled the Kia's poor initial performance in crash tests. While the Spectra sedan earned mostly four stars (out of five) in ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it did poorly in a front-impact test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It was the first sedan since 2001 to score so low in the test by this group, which is affiliated with the insurance industry.
 Stung by the results, Kia worked to make improvements, and it revised the driver's air bag. Kia then had the test done again at its own expense, and the Spectra's rating edged up to ''acceptable'' from ''poor.'' 
 The new air bag is on Spectras made since January; cars built earlier will not be retrofitted. If you are shopping for a Spectra, check the car's assembly history.
 To Kia's credit, it made air bags a priority to an extent almost unprecedented in small, inexpensive cars. All Spectras come with six bags, including seat-mounted side bags and head-protection curtains, which are considered highly effective in side impacts. 
 It's too bad, however, that Kia forces you to pay extra for antilock brakes, even on the top models. While an antilock system is available on the EX, SX and Spectra 5, it isn't even offered on the base LX.
 Traction control is not available on any Spectra. Nor is all-wheel drive offered, in contrast to the Vibe and Matrix.
 While Kia now offers a dash of style, it hasn't forgotten the real reasons its sales have been rising: good value and economical operation.
 After five days on California roads, I didn't need to fill the tank until we were headed to the airport. The Spectra 5 is rated at 25 miles per gallon in town and 33 on the highway, roughly in the middle of its class.
 After years near the bottom of quality surveys, Kia has surged higher in the Initial Quality Surveys by J.D. Power & Associates. All Kias come with a limited powertrain warranty of 10 years or 100,000 miles.
 With that warranty, low prices and lots of features, Kia has moved beyond its bottom-feeder image to become a credible choice for value-conscious consumers. And the Spectra 5 adds some surprising new ingredients: a sporty flair and jazzy styling.

HEADLINE: Well, at Least He Liked Our Cars

BYLINE: By MARC D. CHARNEY

 BODY:
HERE'S a challenge: Try to read the mind of Adolf Hitler. During World War II, the Office of Strategic Services did that, using the psychological insights available at the time to build a profile that was posted online last month by the Cornell University Law Library (www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/donovan/hitler/). It speculated that Hitler's bent for cruelty and mass murder stemmed from self-loathing, and it predicted that one likely end to his life would be suicide in a bunker. 
 It also suggested that if the Allies could capture Hitler alive, they should secretly film him and then make the sound track public so the world could hear his rantings. 
 Hitler, it turns out, had already done that work for them, in a way. He had a series of conversations and musings transcribed for history. They survived the war and were published in English in 1953 and re-issued in 2000 by Enigma Books as ''Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations.'' A sampling of what he had to say about America hints at what the O.S.S. thought the world should hear. MARC D. CHARNEY
 On Jan. 7, 1942, Hitler offered a view of his new enemy:
 I don't see much future for the Americans. In my view, it's a decayed country. And they have their racial problem, and the problem of social inequalities. Those were what caused the downfall of Rome, and yet Rome was a solid edifice that stood for something. Moreover, the Romans were inspired by great ideas. Nothing of the sort in England today. As for the Americans, that kind of thing is nonexistent. That's why, in spite of everything, I like an Englishman a thousand times better than an American.
 America's economy alternately repelled and intrigued Hitler. On Oct. 13, 1941, he had opined:
 America can be paid only in gold. A commerce based on the exchange of products is not possible with America, for America suffers from a surplus of raw materials and a plethora of manufactured goods. This gold which the Americans receive in exchange for the labor they supply, they hide it away in their strong-rooms -- and they imagine the world will yield to this policy born in the smoky brain of a Jewish thinker! The result is their 13 million unemployed.
 On April 9, 1942, he played the expert on producton:
 In the economic field we can learn much from the United States. The motor industry of the United States, by standardization of types and mass production, has reduced the cost of a motor car to such an extent that every workman over there can afford to keep and run a car. Our own procedure has been exactly the reverse. We are constantly bringing out new models and modifying and improving existing ones. The result is that we have to produce an immense number and variety of spare parts, for the parts of a different model of the same make of car are never interchangeable. Nothing like this occurs in America.
 On Aug. 1, 1942, it was back to scorn:
 It is very difficult to argue with Americans. They immediately shout: ''Say, take a look at what our workers earn!'' True, but let us take a look at the shady side as well. The industrial worker earns his $80; but the man who is not in industry gets absolutely nothing. At one time they had no less than 13 million unemployed. I grant you that our standard of life is lower. But the German Reich has 270 opera houses -- a standard of cultural existence of which they over there have no conception. They have clothes, food, cars and a badly constructed house -- but with a refrigerator! This sort of thing does not impress us.
 Speaking of opera houses, he had had something else to say on April 22, 1942, evidently based on misinformation. (A spokesman for the Met says it was open through the war, when American opera stars rose in international stature): 
 It is reported that the Metropolitan Opera House in New York is to be closed; but the reasons given for its closing are certainly false. The Americans do not lack money; what they lack is the artists required to maintain the activities of the greatest of their lyrical theaters. One requires but little knowledge to know that the most famous operas are all of either German, Italian or French origin, and that among the artists who perform them the Germans and the Italians are the most celebrated. Deprived of the services of the artists from these two countries, the management has preferred to close its doors rather than expose the inadequacy of American artists. Our newspapers must not miss this opportunity! Copious comment should be made on this illuminating pointer to the cultural standard of the United States.

HEADLINE: Help Wanted: China Finds Itself With a Labor Shortage

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and DAVID BARBOZA; Jim Yardley reported from Ningxiang, Shenzhen and Guangdong for this article, and David Barboza from the Yangtze Delta region and Guangdong.

DATELINE: NINGXIANG, China 

 BODY:
The pipeline that pours young, eager workers into China's manufacturing juggernaut begins in the country's interior at vocational schools like Hunan Top Software. 
 So it is here in Ningxiang, a 10-hour drive from the factories on the southern coast, that clues can be found to a problem once thought inconceivable: The world's most populous nation, which has powered its stunning economic rise with a cheap and supposedly bottomless pool of migrant labor, is experiencing shortages of about two million workers in Guangdong and Fujian, the two provinces at the heart of China's export-driven economy.
 For Wu Dongshan, the job placement coordinator at Hunan Top, the most obvious sign of change is that factory recruiters now come to him, a reversal from three years ago, when he would make the long drive to Guangdong with busloads of students desperate for work.
 ''We were begging the factories to hire our students,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We had too many students and not enough jobs.'' 
 No one thinks China is running out of workers. But young migrant workers coveted by factories are gaining bargaining power and many are choosing to leave the low pay and often miserable conditions in Guangdong. In a nondemocratic China, it is the equivalent of ''voting with their feet.''
 March is one of the most important hiring months for China's factories, yet some analysts believe that the current shortfalls are the beginning of a long-term trend that is already bringing wage pressures and could eventually erode China's position as the world's dominant low-cost producer. 
 ''It's not the end of the great China manufacturing story,'' said Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia-Pacific economist for UBS. ''But you're no longer going to be talking about China having labor so radically cheap that it will capture all the investment flows. This is an opening for Vietnam, it's an opening for India and Cambodia.''
 The shift, which experts say will happen gradually, began last year and is a result of two decades of strict family planning, which has made China one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world. 
 ''The number of people in the labor force is going to be going down for the next 15 years,'' said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. ''This is a shift in demographics that is really good, not just for salaries but for work conditions.''
 China remains a country where migrant workers are routinely exploited. But after a decade of stagnant wages, these workers are showing more willingness to demand their rights. Last year, factory workers rioted and held strikes in Guangdong. Other workers just left. 
 They can do that because economic growth in other regions has created increasing competition for workers. Many are leaving Guangdong for the rival Yangtze River Delta region near Shanghai, where many factories offer higher salaries. Others are starting to find work in larger cities in interior provinces. Some are simply returning to the farm. 
 ''If we go to work in Guangdong, we work hard all year round but we can't save much money,'' said Tang Xiaoliang, a migrant worker who toiled in Guangdong factories but has returned to his village near Hunan Top. ''The pay is too low. Whoever pays higher, I will go there.''
 The choices made by workers like Mr. Tang can influence the world's global trading network, because every decision about factory building, jobs and wages in China can alter the price of a toy at Toys R Us or socks at Wal-Mart.
 Here in Ningxiang, a growing city in Hunan Province, workers began migrating south to Guangdong and the surrounding Pearl River Delta for jobs in the 1980's. At the Hunan Top Software vocational school, a recruiter from one of Guangdong's biggest electronics plants visited in December and signed 197 students up for jobs. But right now, it is unclear how many will go.
 For many of the teenage students, who start working as young as 16, migrating to Guangdong often begins as a great adventure, a chance for farmers' children to see the outside world. But students like Ruan Xihua, 17, have not decided if they will take the promised job. Ms. Ruan is a tiny, cheery young woman whose parents were among the first generation of migrant workers to go to Guangdong in the 1980's.
 ''They told me it was pretty hard,'' she said. ''They told me they wanted me to study hard.''
 Ms. Ruan is also an only child who says she wants to find work closer to home in case she needs to care for her parents.
 ''Most of these families have only one child because of family planning,'' Mr. Wu said. ''They don't want their child to be far away from home.''
 That is one reason that Hunan's fast-growing provincial capital, Changsha, is beginning to siphon some workers back from Guangdong. Zu Xian, 22, quit a factory job in Guangdong because the high cost of living prevented her from saving money. She now matches her old factory wage by selling cosmetics at a new shopping mall in Changsha, a job that allows her far more free time and far less stress.
 ''Many people come back,'' she said. ''They had stayed for too long and didn't have a better future. It's boring work. And there is not time to study or improve yourself.''
 Changsha is far from the only urban center competing with Guangdong for labor. Many workers are going to the booming Yangtze River Delta region, a hotbed of entrepreneurship powered by thousands of textile, electronics, software and automobile manufacturers.
 Economists say the Yangtze Delta region, which encompasses coastal Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, as well as Shanghai, is already beginning to rival Guangdong and the Pearl River Delta for manufacturing supremacy in China. Factory life can be bleak in the Yangtze Delta, but many manufacturers are raising pay and improving conditions.
 At Zhongce Rubber, one of China's largest tire makers with about 5,000 employees, the company has begun construction of a new factory building. It will have free or subsidized food and housing for workers. The company also has raised the average worker's salary to $150 a month -- above what most factories pay before overtime in Guangdong.
 ''Our company is doing very well, so we have to pay better,'' said Jiang Sheng Nian, a manager. ''We feel that increasing salaries are inevitable.''
 Guo Ren, a rosy-cheeked 21-year-old woman from rural Anhui Province who now works at the tire company, first worked in an electronics factory in the city of Dongguan, in Guangdong. She earned about $50 a month, making chips that operate computer mouses, and lived in cramped dorms with strict curfews because of rising crime rates. 
 ''I left Dongguan because it wasn't very safe and the living standards were not high,'' said Ms. Guo, who now earns close to $150 a month doing odd jobs at Zhongce.
 Despite its problems, Guangdong is still a manufacturing powerhouse. In Guangdong and Fujian, the combined shortfall represents about 10 percent of the total migrant work force in those provinces. 
 Even so, the local authorities are taking action. Officials in different Guangdong cities, as well as the adjacent special economic zone of Shenzhen, are competing with one another to raise their local minimum wage. In early March, Shenzhen announced that it would raise its minimum to $83 a month from $74.
 Factory operators, who have been experiencing worker shortages for more than six months, are also worried. Some withheld wages from migrant workers who went home for the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to ensure they returned by March. In early March at the Sanhe Employment Center, a job fair in the manufacturing city of Baoan, billboards were filled with leaflets advertising thousands of openings at local factories.
 ''Some companies can't find workers for days,'' said Li Biyang, a recruiter at the job fair, who said smaller factories faced the worst problems. ''Many small factories have bad management and bad working conditions. They aren't attentive to workers.''
 But many of the larger factories are scarcely better. Sheng Kehua, 22, plans to quit her job at a sprawling electronics factory in Baoan at the end of March. She works six days a week, 11 hours a day and earns, with overtime, about $118 a month. She lives in company dorm with 13 other workers.
 ''The boss always says we will try to work on that,'' Ms. Sheng said of requests for improvements. ''But every time, nothing happens.''
 Factories covet young, female workers like Ms. Sheng because they are considered better at assembly line work and more docile than young men. In the past, these workers were largely cut off from the outside world, but now they use text messages or e-mail to check with friends at other factories about wages and treatment.
 ''I checked the Internet and learned that the pay level in Shanghai is better than here,'' Ms. Sheng said. Of the 30 workers who arrived with her three years ago, only 7 or 8 remain at the factory.
 Zhao Weinan, who heads an association of Taiwanese-owned manufacturers in Dongguan, said factories once were very picky, setting age limits for new hires and often prohibiting workers from being married. 
 ''In the old days, a company would just put a poster up, and you needed security to stop people from pouring in,'' Mr. Zhao said. ''Now, you can post 100 notices and not find enough people.''
 He said Guangdong manufacturers operated on thin profit margins and could not raise salaries too high. ''If you raise salary, you raise production costs,'' he said.
 And if wages keep rising, he said, some companies could face a fate familiar to many manufacturers in the United States -- they would have to move to a country with cheaper workers.

HEADLINE: Pity the Billionaires

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST. 
Daniel Akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THIS year's Forbes list of the world's billionaires is out, and as usual, the news is bad. You didn't make it. Neither did I. 
 But you may have imagined that you did. You may have fantasized about what it would be like to have multiple homes, to cruise around on your yacht and spend time counting your cash. If you are in business, you may even derive some tepid comfort from knowing that the club isn't closed. Indeed, the overall number of billionaires found by Forbes was 691 this time around, up from 587 the previous year. In other words, there's hope. 
 But even if billionaire status never arrives, allow me to set your yearnings at ease. Do not envy these people. For most of the superrich, the benefits of each additional dollar of wealth reached the vanishing point long ago. I can't speak from experience, of course, but in all likelihood, having billions does not offer significant advantages over having mere millions and it imposes the disadvantage of some major burdens. The focus on billionaires obscures a sad fallacy, one embodied for most of us not so much in the assets of Bill Gates -- still at the top of the Forbes list -- as in the lure of the lottery.
 The prospect of big lottery prizes typically sets off a ticket-buying frenzy among throngs of people who variously hope to quit their boring jobs, pay their debts and secure their children's future by winning. But their behavior makes little sense, except to the extent that they are buying entertainment. For most of them, a scant million or two would solve almost all the problems that a billion would. Sensible lottery players seek the more favorable odds of winning a smaller but still transformative prize instead of lining up for an infinitesimally small chance of winning a meaninglessly gigantic sum that offers few marginal benefits.
 People make this kind of mistake all the time. That humans are so strikingly bad at weighing risks and rewards is one of the great paradoxes of evolution, and it makes you wonder how we outlasted the mastodons.
 The lottery fallacy is sad because so many more of us could become millionaires, as was amply demonstrated by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko in their fascinating book, ''The Millionaire Next Door.'' They found that inheritances or even extended educations aren't necessary; the main requirement, given time and a decent income, is thrift. 
 Becoming a millionaire offers a measure of security, as well as access to better health care and schools. Consider that each $1 million in capital invested in a conservative mix of stocks and bonds would comfortably throw off something like the average annual household income -- about $44,000. While a net worth of $1 million would put you in the top 7 percent of American households, you should not assume that it will make you deliriously happy; the weak connection between money and happiness is well established, at least for those of us already fortunate enough to be living a standard middle-class lifestyle.
 Billions of dollars, on the other hand, would distort your life in so many ways that they just aren't worth it. Billionaires often worry about their personal safety and that of their families. They may also worry about whether people really like them or their money, about how to avoid producing hopelessly spoiled or feckless children and about their own potential for psychologically destructive ''maximizing'' behavior. ''Maximizers'' search compulsively for the best of everything, with perennial disappointment a main result.
 If there are good reasons to become a billionaire, they are largely altruistic. Making all that money means that you are probably providing something that people need or want -- a good thing in its own right. The capital you have accumulated should result in jobs, innovation and economic growth, even as your tax payments underwrite services for the rest of society. If you like, you can create a foundation to direct the earnings of your capital to good works. You can even give all the money away.
 All in all, billionaires are useful to society, and assuming they didn't become rich by nefarious means, we should thank them for taking the trouble. It's a dirty job, after all, but somebody's got to do it.

HEADLINE: In Any Language, Manhattan's Hot

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
The dollar is hyperventilating, mortgage rates are still attractively low and international buyers -- drawn by outsized real estate gains as well as the city's burnished image of livability -- are barreling straight for Manhattan.
 But it's not exactly a takeover. Yet. 
 ''I find it slightly exaggerated that everyone's jumping across the ocean with their wallets open,'' said Patricia Warburg Cliff, a senior vice president and director of European sales at the Corcoran Group. ''Everybody thinks Manhattan is going to be taken over by them. It isn't really that everybody from Europe is on a direct flight to New York. But yes, there is a lot more of this than a year or two ago. In terms of actual buyers, maybe 10 to 15 percent more.'' 
 Remarkably little data exists to quantify the trend. According to HomeBridge Mortgage Bankers in New York, which specializes in mega-jumbo mortgages, about 25 percent more loans are going to international buyers so far this year, with pieds-a-terre gaining ground and straight investments holding steadier. 
 Whatever its exact dimensions, the wave of interest from overseas has cast a decidedly lopsided shadow over the map of Manhattan real estate. It is shaped as much by the practical constraints imposed on a noncitizen (condo not co-op, move-in not fixer-upper) as well as the preconceptions of buyers who may have experienced New York primarily from the berths of their Midtown hotel rooms, in the pages of celebrity publications or through ''Sex and the City'' syndications. 
 Foreigners' abridged views of New York play out most noticeably in their choice of neighborhood. Many consider the Upper East and Upper West Sides little more than becalmed back lots too divorced from the city's commerce and entertainment, with the areas' schools and playgrounds of little value to someone in residence only a couple of months a year. 
 Midtown, on the other hand, is hot. 
 ''I really liked the 50's and 60's the best,'' said Helen Cannon-Brookes, an Australian empty-nester who, along with her husband, Michael, recently settled -- pending approval of the condo board -- on a 33rd-floor two-bedroom pied-a-terre at Trump World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza, in the upper 40's. They found the apartment with the help of Holly S. Hunt, an agent at Halstead Property. The blocks in Midtown East ''had more of a city feel about them,'' she said. ''You could go around the corner for a cappuccino. Once you got into the 70's, I found that it's more one residential block after another.''
 Another fan of Midtown is Daniel Amouyal, 63, a French citizen working with his agent, Charlie Attias of Corcoran, to buy four to six apartments in the Orion, a condominium development under construction at 350 West 42nd Street. The 60-story luxury building in Hell's Kitchen -- where apartments range from $435,000 to $490,000 for an alcove studio and start at $1.65 million for a three-bedroom -- will share a block with the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Mr. Amouyal plans to combine two or more of the units into a three-bedroom pied-a-terre for himself, his wife, Martine, and three teenagers, and for possible use as off-campus housing if his children attend college here. The other apartments will be rented out as investments.
 In a recent conversation from his home in Tahiti, Mr. Amouyal, a building contractor, said that along with the cheaper-than-uptown preconstruction price point, he viewed the building's proximity to the bus terminal and Times Square as an asset along with its central Manhattan location. He said he was confident that the building would appreciate at the same rate as other properties around the city. 
 But other overseas buyers are attuned to the nuances of status conveyed by a particular building or neighborhood. For this group, ''the address speaks louder than the space,'' said Rowena Villaruel, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
 Denied entrance into the many co-op buildings lining Central Park West and Fifth Avenue, the status-conscious international buyer is likely to stalk the white-hot 59th Street corridor. With bookends on the west of the Time Warner Center and on the east of One Beacon Court, a perfume-counter sneeze from Bloomingdale's, the area includes Central Park South and teems with full-service condominiums, iconic views of the park and recognizable addresses.
 ''Central Park South is a city in itself,'' said Marcos G. Cohen, a senior vice president at Douglas Elliman. With last year's opening of the shops at Time Warner Center, ''everything you need is there.''
 Mark Menendes, a 32-year-old investor from Madrid, is buying a part-time residence at Trump International Hotel and Tower, at Columbus Circle. ''I'm buying location, location, location,'' he said.
 Mr. Menendes found the one-bedroom, 700-square-foot furnished unit last September with the help of Douglas Russell, a vice president and director at Brown Harris Stevens, paying in the mid-$600,000's for the privilege of living in the apartment up to six months a year. The rest of the time, the abode will be made available as a hotel room. 
 The proceeds, which Mr. Menendes estimates at 5 percent to 6 percent return per year, will accrue toward the apartment's carrying costs. Mr. Menendes added that he expects the dollar to regain its standing against the euro. ''I know that it will end up reversing itself,'' he said. ''When it gets to one-one, I'll make 30 percent appreciation.''
 Some foreign buyers have enthusiastically embraced the marketers' notion that Central Park South is more a state of mind than a street. Garry Burke, an Irish businessman in his late-40's, said he is considering an investment in Windsor Park, formerly known as the Windsor Hotel, at 100 West 58th Street, a block south of Central Park. Preconstruction prices in the building range from $1,500 to $1,800 a square foot, according to Mr. Burke's agent, Max Dobens of Douglas Elliman. Calling the building ''very attractive because of its location between the Essex House and the Plaza,'' Mr. Burke added: ''It's on the park, near restaurants, close to the museums. It's got pretty much everything going for it in terms of what's going on around it.''
 Other international apartment hunters echo his sentiments. For the first time since the residences at Time Warner Center went on the market in the fall of 2001, the number of overseas buyers equaled domestic buyers in 2004, according to Susan M. deFranca, president of Related Residential Sales. 
 The redevelopers of the Plaza Hotel are preparing for a similar wave. ''We have a long list of Europeans, South Americans and Australians who want to get into the Plaza,'' said Barbara Evans-Butler, a vice president at the real estate brokerage firm Stribling & Associates, which is marketing the Plaza redevelopment. ''A lot of people, especially 40 and over, want some of that Old World charm but also all the services and amenities.''
 That may be true for some foreign buyers, but plenty of others -- surrounded by Old World charm all their lives -- eschew it on the shores of the New World. ''I'm a very contemporary person when it comes to decoration and so on, and I was really depressed in Paris with those old buildings,'' said Carola Weisz, 56, an Argentine who seven years ago moved to New York by way of Paris. She and her husband, Claudio, 58, bought a new condominium with the help of Beverly H. Feingold, a vice president at Halstead. 
 Sometimes, the presence or absence of bold-faced names can influence others in their choice of dwelling. 
 ''Overseas, they read the tabloids or the glamour magazines,'' said Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Douglas Elliman whose clients include many South Americans. She said that a wealthy male socialite told her: ''I cannot tell you the areas but I'll tell you the buildings where I want to live. Where Nicole Kidman lives, where Beyonce just bought an apartment, Penelope Cruz, Ricky Martin.'' 
 Ms. Teplitzky said she answered: ''Well, you just mentioned four people who bought in four different areas. Kidman bought in the Meier building in the meatpacking district, Cruz at the Chelsea Mercantile, Beyonce at Beacon Court, Ricky Martin at Time Warner.'' She showed her client each building, Ms. Teplitsky said, and he is now assessing whether the meatpacking district's trendiness may prove ephemeral, especially measured against the established neighborhood encompassing Time Warner Center and One Beacon Court.
 Besides Midtown and the 59th Street corridor, downtown is said to be the third major magnet for international buyers. 
 Among them are the usual suspects, 20- to 30-something buyers without children who ''want that whole New York story, either a loft or something in the West Village,'' said Trina Cooper, an agent at Corcoran, whose youngish clients hail from France, England and Ireland.
 But increasingly, another demographic is gravitating below 14th Street.
 ''You expect young people to be interested in downtown,'' said Ms. Evans-Butler of Stribling. ''For me it's really quite interesting to see people in their 50's who want to be downtown not so much because of nightlife but because of culture life and because it's the new New York.'' She added: ''People who used to wear suits all their lives, they want to come into New York and do all the culture things and have the lifestyle that is more 21st-century downtown. And so you had them buying into things like Richard Meier buildings, completely different from anything you would have in Europe.''
 Of course, there's good-different, and there's bad-different. For overseas buyers navigating the already treacherous terrain of Manhattan's real estate, certain distinctions fall into the latter category. 
 One of the first and hardest lessons swallowed by international shoppers is that co-ops, which make up around two-thirds of the available housing stock, are effectively off limits. Boards turn a notoriously dour eye on applications bearing the slightest whiff of investment-related intent. They also tend to balk at liquid assets located overseas and will not allow investments to be made in a corporate name, as many foreign buyers prefer to do for financial and privacy reasons. 
 ''The difference between co-ops and condos is the big, big, big issue,'' Ms. Feingold of Halstead said. 
 With co-ops out of the picture, condos are seeing a glut of foreigners. ''We just sold the Lumiere on West 53rd between Eighth and Ninth,'' said Michael Shvo, president of the Shvo Group, which markets and sells luxury condominium developments. ''We probably sold 30 to 35 percent to foreigners. It was 0 to 5 percent a year and a half ago.'' 
 The developers he works with are taking notice. ''The main thing we're doing to accommodate them is concierge service,'' Mr. Shvo said, explaining that talks are in the works to hire an international concierge service in developments at 20 Pine Street, Bryant Park Tower and another slated for 19th Street and 10th Avenue in Chelsea. A concierge would make restaurant reservations, book airline tickets, stock refrigerators and hire baby sitters, among other services desired by part-time foreign residents.
 In addition, some of the apartments are being tweaked to convey the feel of a hotel suite. ''We're really trying to give people an experience that even though it's their home, they're away on vacation,'' Mr. Shvo said. Some bathrooms will have bidets, he said, and kitchens will feature a more minimalist, European approach, employing discreetly sized appliances and other finishes that ''make it not pop out so much as a kitchen but more as a piece of furniture.'' 
 He added that in the Chelsea building, an effort is under way to put studio apartments next door to one-bedrooms, to enable easy combinations and endear the units to international buyers accustomed to reserving adjoining suites in a hotel. 
 Pricey apartments are often paired with pricey common charges, which can be a shock to the equilibrium of the international buyer. Carrying charges in Europe are around $300 a month, said Ms. Cliff of Corcoran. ''Here they're $3,000 a month. If you're only using an apartment three months in a year, that's a big chunk of carrying charges.''
 Nancy Candib, a vice president at Brown Harris Stevens, said, ''They have to be very wealthy where it doesn't matter and they appreciate the services, or buy a town house, or go to Chelsea and downtown where a lot of the condos don't have doormen and charges can be much less.'' 
 Pure investors -- those seeking income from tenants -- can usually cover the carrying charges with rental income. Others, like Mr. Menendes of Madrid, are turning to the condo-hotel. 
 Overseas buyers also report being surprised by the bad condition of some of the apartments they view. ''You see apartments which are really in terrible, terrible, terrible shape,'' said Ms. Weisz, the Argentine who relocated to New York seven years ago. ''A very important issue if you are a newcomer to no matter where is that you find an apartment where you can really move in.'' 
 And then there's the cultural quicksand of negotiation. ''In no other place in the world does anybody want to know anything but is the bank going to give you a mortgage and are you willing to pay my price,'' said Ms. Feingold of Halstead. 
 ''They're used to negotiating more than we are as a culture,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens. In a market where low ball equals foul ball, ''they learn very quickly they've got to pay up,'' he said. 
 As for bidding wars, while foreigners are said to be more willing to participate than in years past, ''You're talking about second residences, and sometimes people don't want to fight for second residences,'' said Mr. Cohen of Douglas Elliman. ''It's a luxury they can afford to wait for.'' 
 Or not. ''It's always a new chapter in a foreigner's life to have an apartment here,'' he observed. ''Sometimes they come out of divorce. Sometimes they are widows. In some countries in South America, a woman over 45 is done. New York is very receptive, especially to middle age, especially for romance.'' He added: ''It's the best place in the world for finding romance and finding a second chance in life.''

HEADLINE: Its Name Is a Mouthful, So Just Call It a Rate Shield

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN

 BODY:
AFTER months of false alerts, longer-term interest rates may finally be moving up in earnest. If the trend continues, fixed-income investors who have not prepared will be taught an ugly lesson: as yields rise, prices fall and the value of a bond portfolio declines. 
 But there are ways to minimize the pain. The most common moves are to sell longer-term bonds and to hold cash or shorter-term securities, which won't be hurt as badly as their cousins with longer maturities. Some portfolio managers also use futures contracts to hedge against rate increases. 
 But professionals are also using a less known way to cushion a bond portfolio: by buying premium callable bonds. 
 The strategy may be daunting for individual investors acting on their own. First, the name itself is a mouthful. Here is a translation: The bonds are called premium because their coupons and their prices are higher than current market levels. They are callable because their issuer can redeem them before the bonds mature. These features give the bonds some advantages, as well as some quirks that can trip up the unwary.
 But the advantages are prized right now because these bonds -- often found in the municipal bond market -- tend to be resistant to some of the usual ill effects of rising interest rates. For this reason, they are often called cushion bonds. 
 In fact, managers of intermediate and long-term municipal bond funds have been buying premium callable bonds in big dollops for the last two years, said Eric Jacobson, senior analyst at Morningstar. 
 One manager with a big position in these bonds is Joseph P. Deane, who oversees $19 billion in municipal bond funds for Smith Barney Asset Management in New York and says he believes that interest rates will keep climbing. Mr. Deane has been selling securities that are sensitive to rising rates since early 2004, raising cash, buying futures contracts that provide a hedge against rate increases -- and buying premium callable bonds.
 ''Most of the bonds left in our portfolios are premium callable bonds,'' he said. ''These are very defensive pieces of paper.'' 
 The defensive characteristics of such bonds are found primarily in two features. One is that their coupons -- higher than those of comparable bonds -- put cash into investors' hands faster. That lessens the bonds' vulnerability to interest rate changes.
 And the fact that the bonds are callable also gives them some defensive properties, at least for a while. As long as a bond's coupon is above current market rates, its price will be based on its call date, not its maturity date. This gives the bond the lower interest rate sensitivity of a bond with a shorter maturity. 
 That is because a premium callable bond, under these circumstances, is likely to be called by its issuer as soon as the terms of the bond permit. After all, a new bond, with a lower yield, will be cheaper for the issuer than the premium bond. 
 ''The nice thing about premium callable bonds is they combine the higher yields of long-term bonds with the interest rate sensitivity of intermediate bonds,'' said James M. Murphy, manager of the T. Rowe Price Tax-Free High Yield fund. ''As long as they are priced at a premium, you get the best of both worlds.''
 But there is a pitfall, and it can be fairly steep. If interest rates rise high enough so that the bond's coupon no longer is higher than the market's, the bond's value can plummet. Its price will then be based not on its call but rather its final maturity date. (That is because it wouldn't be in the interest of a bond's issuer to call a bond with a low coupon; new bonds would be more expensive for the issuer.) 
 ''When these bonds get close to par is when you start getting big swings in interest rate sensitivity,'' said Mr. Jacobson at Morningstar. ''Some managers go out of their way to stay away from these situations.''
 David Fare, co-manager with Mr. Deane of the Smith Barney Managed Municipals fund, says he is prepared to handle this problem for bonds in the fund's portfolio. ''The cushion is built-in only until prevailing interest rates reach the coupon value of the bond,'' he said. ''But, we can manage that risk. As a bond nears trading to its coupon, we'll sell it and buy another premium bond that still has a cushion in it.'' 
 That requires close attention to the portfolio and to shifts in the market -- which may be difficult for nonprofessionals. ''The idea is to come up with a solution to a rising interest rate environment,'' he said. ''We're trying to insulate the market value of our portfolio while continuing to provide people with tax-free income.''
 Another risk in buying callable bonds at a premium is that the bond may be called at par shortly after purchase. That can leave investors with a loss. New York City is in the process of redeeming at par $426 million in muni bonds that had been bought by some investors at premiums last year. 
 ''Anytime you're paying a premium for a bond, you should have a very specific understanding as to what type of call protection you're getting,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''If you're going to pay a premium, you need to know it will not be called unexpectedly.'' 
 Some individual investors balk at paying extra cash for a premium bond, but the fatter coupons ultimately should make up for the higher initial outlay, said Christopher Genovese, first vice president at Fixed Income Securities L.P. in Melville, N.Y., which provides bond portfolio analysis and recommendations to financial advisers. 
 THE best way to evaluate a bond, Mr. Jacobson, said, is to compare its yield to call and yield to maturity with other, similar bonds. These calculations require some work -- they are available from financial advisers and on bond information Web sites -- and they take into account what the investor paid for the bond and its expected income stream. 
 ''You have to decide whether the defensive characteristics are worth the initially lower yield,'' said Paul Disdier, manager of the Dreyfus Municipal Bond fund, which holds premium callable bonds. 
 Given the complexities of these bonds and the trouble of evaluating them, many individual investors may be better off leaving bond buying to a professional -- a financial adviser, a mutual fund manager or both. 
 Still, given the prevalence of premium callable bonds in the muni bond market as well as the benefits, it pays to be up to speed on their nuances, Mr. Murphy said.
 ''It's fine to pay a premium for a bond; the yield will be roughly comparable'' to a bond selling at par or a slight discount, he said. ''But, if you need to sell the bond,'' he added, ''the premium will give you better protection in a rising rate environment.''

HEADLINE: Worries Galore Keep Investors on the Sidelines

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
It was an uneventful week for the stock market, with two of the major averages inching downward and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index managing a slight gain.
 Worries about inflation, spurred by soaring oil prices, prevented the market from gaining much traction. 
A report by the Institute for Supply Management, which found that raw material prices had risen in March, added to investor concerns. 
 For the week, Hewlett-Packard, which announced the appointment of a new chief executive, gained 9.6 percent, the best performance in the Dow Jones industrial average. The American International Group, the insurer that has now acknowledged improper accounting, lost 8.4 percent for the week, the worst performance among the 30 Dow stocks, amid concerns about investigations into the company's accounting practices. 
 For the week, the Dow declined by 38.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,404.30. The S.& P. 500 gained 1.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,172.92. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,984.81. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.45 percent from 4.60 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: It's a Flat World, After All

BYLINE: By Thomas L. Friedman. 
Thomas L. Friedman is the author of ''The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century,'' to be published this week by Farrar, Straus & Giroux and from which this article is adapted. His column appears on the Op-Ed page of The Times, and his television documentary ''Does Europe Hate Us?'' will be shown on the Discovery Channel on April 7 at 8 p.m.

 BODY:
In 1492 Christopher Columbus set sail for India, going west. He had the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. He never did find India, but he called the people he met ''Indians'' and came home and reported to his king and queen: ''The world is round.'' I set off for India 512 years later. I knew just which direction I was going. I went east. I had Lufthansa business class, and I came home and reported only to my wife and only in a whisper: ''The world is flat.''
 And therein lies a tale of technology and geoeconomics that is fundamentally reshaping our lives -- much, much more quickly than many people realize. It all happened while we were sleeping, or rather while we were focused on 9/11, the dot-com bust and Enron -- which even prompted some to wonder whether globalization was over. Actually, just the opposite was true, which is why it's time to wake up and prepare ourselves for this flat world, because others already are, and there is no time to waste. 
 I wish I could say I saw it all coming. Alas, I encountered the flattening of the world quite by accident. It was in late February of last year, and I was visiting the Indian high-tech capital, Bangalore, 
 working on a documentary for the Discovery Times channel about outsourcing. In short order, I interviewed Indian entrepreneurs who wanted to prepare my taxes from Bangalore, read my X-rays from Bangalore, trace my lost luggage from Bangalore and write my new software from Bangalore. The longer I was there, the more upset I became -- upset at the realization that while I had been off covering the 9/11 wars, globalization had entered a whole new phase, and I had missed it. I guess the eureka moment came on a visit to the campus of Infosys Technologies, one of the crown jewels of the Indian outsourcing and software industry. Nandan Nilekani, the Infosys C.E.O., was showing me his global video-conference room, pointing with pride to a wall-size flat-screen TV, which he said was the biggest in Asia. Infosys, he explained, could hold a virtual meeting of the key players from its entire global supply chain for any project at any time on that supersize screen. So its American designers could be on the screen speaking with their Indian software writers and their Asian manufacturers all at once. That's what globalization is all about today, Nilekani said. Above the screen there were eight clocks that pretty well summed up the Infosys workday: 24/7/365. The clocks were labeled U.S. West, U.S. East, G.M.T., India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia.
 ''Outsourcing is just one dimension of a much more fundamental thing happening today in the world,'' Nilekani explained. ''What happened over the last years is that there was a massive investment in technology, especially in the bubble era, when hundreds of millions of dollars were invested in putting broadband connectivity around the world, undersea cables, all those things.'' At the same time, he added, computers became cheaper and dispersed all over the world, and there was an explosion of e-mail software, search engines like Google and proprietary software that can chop up any piece of work and send one part to Boston, one part to Bangalore and one part to Beijing, making it easy for anyone to do remote development. When all of these things suddenly came together around 2000, Nilekani said, they ''created a platform where intellectual work, intellectual capital, could be delivered from anywhere. It could be disaggregated, delivered, distributed, produced and put back together again -- and this gave a whole new degree of freedom to the way we do work, especially work of an intellectual nature. And what you are seeing in Bangalore today is really the culmination of all these things coming together.''
 At one point, summing up the implications of all this, Nilekani uttered a phrase that rang in my ear. He said to me, ''Tom, the playing field is being leveled.'' He meant that countries like India were now able to compete equally for global knowledge work as never before -- and that America had better get ready for this. As I left the Infosys campus that evening and bounced along the potholed road back to Bangalore, I kept chewing on that phrase: ''The playing field is being leveled.''
 ''What Nandan is saying,'' I thought, ''is that the playing field is being flattened. Flattened? Flattened? My God, he's telling me the world is flat!''
 Here I was in Bangalore -- more than 500 years after Columbus sailed over the horizon, looking for a shorter route to India using the rudimentary navigational technologies of his day, and returned safely to prove definitively that the world was round -- and one of India's smartest engineers, trained at his country's top technical institute and backed by the most modern technologies of his day, was telling me that the world was flat, as flat as that screen on which he can host a meeting of his whole global supply chain. Even more interesting, he was citing this development as a new milestone in human progress and a great opportunity for India and the world -- the fact that we had made our world flat! 
 This has been building for a long time. Globalization 1.0 (1492 to 1800) shrank the world from a size large to a size medium, and the dynamic force in that era was countries globalizing for resources and imperial conquest. Globalization 2.0 (1800 to 2000) shrank the world from a size medium to a size small, and it was spearheaded by companies globalizing for markets and labor. Globalization 3.0 (which started around 2000) is shrinking the world from a size small to a size tiny and flattening the playing field at the same time. And while the dynamic force in Globalization 1.0 was countries globalizing and the dynamic force in Globalization 2.0 was companies globalizing, the dynamic force in Globalization 3.0 -- the thing that gives it its unique character -- is individuals and small groups globalizing. Individuals must, and can, now ask: where do I fit into the global competition and opportunities of the day, and how can I, on my own, collaborate with others globally? But Globalization 3.0 not only differs from the previous eras in how it is shrinking and flattening the world and in how it is empowering individuals. It is also different in that Globalization 1.0 and 2.0 were driven primarily by European and American companies and countries. But going forward, this will be less and less true. Globalization 3.0 is not only going to be driven more by individuals but also by a much more diverse -- non-Western, nonwhite -- group of individuals. In Globalization 3.0, you are going to see every color of the human rainbow take part.
 ''Today, the most profound thing to me is the fact that a 14-year-old in Romania or Bangalore or the Soviet Union or Vietnam has all the information, all the tools, all the software easily available to apply knowledge however they want,'' said Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape and creator of the first commercial Internet browser. ''That is why I am sure the next Napster is going to come out of left field. As bioscience becomes more computational and less about wet labs and as all the genomic data becomes easily available on the Internet, at some point you will be able to design vaccines on your laptop.''
 Andreessen is touching on the most exciting part of Globalization 3.0 and the flattening of the world: the fact that we are now in the process of connecting all the knowledge pools in the world together. We've tasted some of the downsides of that in the way that Osama bin Laden has connected terrorist knowledge pools together through his Qaeda network, not to mention the work of teenage hackers spinning off more and more lethal computer viruses that affect us all. But the upside is that by connecting all these knowledge pools we are on the cusp of an incredible new era of innovation, an era that will be driven from left field and right field, from West and East and from North and South. Only 30 years ago, if you had a choice of being born a B student in Boston or a genius in Bangalore or Beijing, you probably would have chosen Boston, because a genius in Beijing or Bangalore could not really take advantage of his or her talent. They could not plug and play globally. Not anymore. Not when the world is flat, and anyone with smarts, access to Google and a cheap wireless laptop can join the innovation fray.
 When the world is flat, you can innovate without having to emigrate. This is going to get interesting. We are about to see creative destruction on steroids.
How did the world get flattened, and how did it happen so fast?
 It was a result of 10 events and forces that all came together during the 1990's and converged right around the year 2000. Let me go through them briefly. The first event was 11/9. That's right -- not 9/11, but 11/9. Nov. 9, 1989, is the day the Berlin Wall came down, which was critically important because it allowed us to think of the world as a single space. ''The Berlin Wall was not only a symbol of keeping people inside Germany; it was a way of preventing a kind of global view of our future,'' the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen said. And the wall went down just as the windows went up -- the breakthrough Microsoft Windows 3.0 operating system, which helped to flatten the playing field even more by creating a global computer interface, shipped six months after the wall fell.
 The second key date was 8/9. Aug. 9, 1995, is the day Netscape went public, which did two important things. First, it brought the Internet alive by giving us the browser to display images and data stored on Web sites. Second, the Netscape stock offering triggered the dot-com boom, which triggered the dot-com bubble, which triggered the massive overinvestment of billions of dollars in fiber-optic telecommunications cable. That overinvestment, by companies like Global Crossing, resulted in the willy-nilly creation of a global undersea-underground fiber network, which in turn drove down the cost of transmitting voices, data and images to practically zero, which in turn accidentally made Boston, Bangalore and Beijing next-door neighbors overnight. In sum, what the Netscape revolution did was bring people-to-people connectivity to a whole new level. Suddenly more people could connect with more other people from more different places in more different ways than ever before. 
 No country accidentally benefited more from the Netscape moment than India. ''India had no resources and no infrastructure,'' said Dinakar Singh, one of the most respected hedge-fund managers on Wall Street, whose parents earned doctoral degrees in biochemistry from the University of Delhi before emigrating to America. ''It produced people with quality and by quantity. But many of them rotted on the docks of India like vegetables. Only a relative few could get on ships and get out. Not anymore, because we built this ocean crosser, called fiber-optic cable. For decades you had to leave India to be a professional. Now you can plug into the world from India. You don't have to go to Yale and go to work for Goldman Sachs.'' India could never have afforded to pay for the bandwidth to connect brainy India with high-tech America, so American shareholders paid for it. Yes, crazy overinvestment can be good. The overinvestment in railroads turned out to be a great boon for the American economy. ''But the railroad overinvestment was confined to your own country and so, too, were the benefits,'' Singh said. In the case of the digital railroads, ''it was the foreigners who benefited.'' India got a free ride.
 The first time this became apparent was when thousands of Indian engineers were enlisted to fix the Y2K -- the year 2000 -- computer bugs for companies from all over the world. (Y2K should be a national holiday in India. Call it ''Indian Interdependence Day,'' says Michael Mandelbaum, a foreign-policy analyst at Johns Hopkins.) The fact that the Y2K work could be outsourced to Indians was made possible by the first two flatteners, along with a third, which I call ''workflow.'' Workflow is shorthand for all the software applications, standards and electronic transmission pipes, like middleware, that connected all those computers and fiber-optic cable. To put it another way, if the Netscape moment connected people to people like never before, what the workflow revolution did was connect applications to applications so that people all over the world could work together in manipulating and shaping words, data and images on computers like never before. 
 Indeed, this breakthrough in people-to-people and application-to-application connectivity produced, in short order, six more flatteners -- six new ways in which individuals and companies could collaborate on work and share knowledge. One was ''outsourcing.'' When my software applications could connect seamlessly with all of your applications, it meant that all kinds of work -- from accounting to software-writing -- could be digitized, disaggregated and shifted to any place in the world where it could be done better and cheaper. The second was ''offshoring.'' I send my whole factory from Canton, Ohio, to Canton, China. The third was ''open-sourcing.'' I write the next operating system, Linux, using engineers collaborating together online and working for free. The fourth was ''insourcing.'' I let a company like UPS come inside my company and take over my whole logistics operation -- everything from filling my orders online to delivering my goods to repairing them for customers when they break. (People have no idea what UPS really does today. You'd be amazed!). The fifth was ''supply-chaining.'' This is Wal-Mart's specialty. I create a global supply chain down to the last atom of efficiency so that if I sell an item in Arkansas, another is immediately made in China. (If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be China's eighth-largest trading partner.) The last new form of collaboration I call ''informing'' -- this is Google, Yahoo and MSN Search, which now allow anyone to collaborate with, and mine, unlimited data all by themselves.
 So the first three flatteners created the new platform for collaboration, and the next six are the new forms of collaboration that flattened the world even more. The 10th flattener I call ''the steroids,'' and these are wireless access and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). What the steroids do is turbocharge all these new forms of collaboration, so you can now do any one of them, from anywhere, with any device.
 The world got flat when all 10 of these flatteners converged around the year 2000. This created a global, Web-enabled playing field that allows for multiple forms of collaboration on research and work in real time, without regard to geography, distance or, in the near future, even language. ''It is the creation of this platform, with these unique attributes, that is the truly important sustainable breakthrough that made what you call the flattening of the world possible,'' said Craig Mundie, the chief technical officer of Microsoft.
 No, not everyone has access yet to this platform, but it is open now to more people in more places on more days in more ways than anything like it in history. Wherever you look today -- whether it is the world of journalism, with bloggers bringing down Dan Rather; the world of software, with the Linux code writers working in online forums for free to challenge Microsoft; or the world of business, where Indian and Chinese innovators are competing against and working with some of the most advanced Western multinationals -- hierarchies are being flattened and value is being created less and less within vertical silos and more and more through horizontal collaboration within companies, between companies and among individuals. 
 Do you recall ''the IT revolution'' that the business press has been pushing for the last 20 years? Sorry to tell you this, but that was just the prologue. The last 20 years were about forging, sharpening and distributing all the new tools to collaborate and connect. Now the real information revolution is about to begin as all the complementarities among these collaborative tools start to converge. One of those who first called this moment by its real name was Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O., who in 2004 began to declare in her public speeches that the dot-com boom and bust were just ''the end of the beginning.'' The last 25 years in technology, Fiorina said, have just been ''the warm-up act.'' Now we are going into the main event, she said, ''and by the main event, I mean an era in which technology will truly transform every aspect of business, of government, of society, of life.''
As if this flattening wasn't enough, another convergence coincidentally occurred during the 1990's that was equally important. Some three billion people who were out of the game walked, and often ran, onto the playing field. I am talking about the people of China, India, Russia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Central Asia. Their economies and political systems all opened up during the course of the 1990's so that their people were increasingly free to join the free market. And when did these three billion people converge with the new playing field and the new business processes? Right when it was being flattened, right when millions of them could compete and collaborate more equally, more horizontally and with cheaper and more readily available tools. Indeed, thanks to the flattening of the world, many of these new entrants didn't even have to leave home to participate. Thanks to the 10 flatteners, the playing field came to them!
 It is this convergence -- of new players, on a new playing field, developing new processes for horizontal collaboration -- that I believe is the most important force shaping global economics and politics in the early 21st century. Sure, not all three billion can collaborate and compete. In fact, for most people the world is not yet flat at all. But even if we're talking about only 10 percent, that's 300 million people -- about twice the size of the American work force. And be advised: the Indians and Chinese are not racing us to the bottom. They are racing us to the top. What China's leaders really want is that the next generation of underwear and airplane wings not just be ''made in China'' but also be ''designed in China.'' And that is where things are heading. So in 30 years we will have gone from ''sold in China'' to ''made in China'' to ''designed in China'' to ''dreamed up in China'' -- or from China as collaborator with the worldwide manufacturers on nothing to China as a low-cost, high-quality, hyperefficient collaborator with worldwide manufacturers on everything. Ditto India. Said Craig Barrett, the C.E.O. of Intel, ''You don't bring three billion people into the world economy overnight without huge consequences, especially from three societies'' -- like India, China and Russia -- ''with rich educational heritages.''
 That is why there is nothing that guarantees that Americans or Western Europeans will continue leading the way. These new players are stepping onto the playing field legacy free, meaning that many of them were so far behind that they can leap right into the new technologies without having to worry about all the sunken costs of old systems. It means that they can move very fast to adopt new, state-of-the-art technologies, which is why there are already more cellphones in use in China today than there are people in America.
 If you want to appreciate the sort of challenge we are facing, let me share with you two conversations. One was with some of the Microsoft officials who were involved in setting up Microsoft's research center in Beijing, Microsoft Research Asia, which opened in 1998 -- after Microsoft sent teams to Chinese universities to administer I.Q. tests in order to recruit the best brains from China's 1.3 billion people. Out of the 2,000 top Chinese engineering and science students tested, Microsoft hired 20. They have a saying at Microsoft about their Asia center, which captures the intensity of competition it takes to win a job there and explains why it is already the most productive research team at Microsoft: ''Remember, in China, when you are one in a million, there are 1,300 other people just like you.''
 The other is a conversation I had with Rajesh Rao, a young Indian entrepreneur who started an electronic-game company from Bangalore, which today owns the rights to Charlie Chaplin's image for mobile computer games. ''We can't relax,'' Rao said. ''I think in the case of the United States that is what happened a bit. Please look at me: I am from India. We have been at a very different level before in terms of technology and business. But once we saw we had an infrastructure that made the world a small place, we promptly tried to make the best use of it. We saw there were so many things we could do. We went ahead, and today what we are seeing is a result of that. There is no time to rest. That is gone. There are dozens of people who are doing the same thing you are doing, and they are trying to do it better. It is like water in a tray: you shake it, and it will find the path of least resistance. That is what is going to happen to so many jobs -- they will go to that corner of the world where there is the least resistance and the most opportunity. If there is a skilled person in Timbuktu, he will get work if he knows how to access the rest of the world, which is quite easy today. You can make a Web site and have an e-mail address and you are up and running. And if you are able to demonstrate your work, using the same infrastructure, and if people are comfortable giving work to you and if you are diligent and clean in your transactions, then you are in business.'' 
 Instead of complaining about outsourcing, Rao said, Americans and Western Europeans would ''be better off thinking about how you can raise your bar and raise yourselves into doing something better. Americans have consistently led in innovation over the last century. Americans whining -- we have never seen that before.''
Rao is right. And it is time we got focused. As a person who grew up during the cold war, I'll always remember driving down the highway and listening to the radio, when suddenly the music would stop and a grim-voiced announcer would come on the air and say: ''This is a test. This station is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.'' And then there would be a 20-second high-pitched siren sound. Fortunately, we never had to live through a moment in the cold war when the announcer came on and said, ''This is a not a test.''
 That, however, is exactly what I want to say here: ''This is not a test.''
 The long-term opportunities and challenges that the flattening of the world puts before the United States are profound. Therefore, our ability to get by doing things the way we've been doing them -- which is to say not always enriching our secret sauce -- will not suffice any more. ''For a country as wealthy we are, it is amazing how little we are doing to enhance our natural competitiveness,'' says Dinakar Singh, the Indian-American hedge-fund manager. ''We are in a world that has a system that now allows convergence among many billions of people, and we had better step back and figure out what it means. It would be a nice coincidence if all the things that were true before were still true now, but there are quite a few things you actually need to do differently. You need to have a much more thoughtful national discussion.'' 
 If this moment has any parallel in recent American history, it is the height of the cold war, around 1957, when the Soviet Union leapt ahead of America in the space race by putting up the Sputnik satellite. The main challenge then came from those who wanted to put up walls; the main challenge to America today comes from the fact that all the walls are being taken down and many other people can now compete and collaborate with us much more directly. The main challenge in that world was from those practicing extreme Communism, namely Russia, China and North Korea. The main challenge to America today is from those practicing extreme capitalism, namely China, India and South Korea. The main objective in that era was building a strong state, and the main objective in this era is building strong individuals.
 Meeting the challenges of flatism requires as comprehensive, energetic and focused a response as did meeting the challenge of Communism. It requires a president who can summon the nation to work harder, get smarter, attract more young women and men to science and engineering and build the broadband infrastructure, portable pensions and health care that will help every American become more employable in an age in which no one can guarantee you lifetime employment.
 We have been slow to rise to the challenge of flatism, in contrast to Communism, maybe because flatism doesn't involve ICBM missiles aimed at our cities. Indeed, the hot line, which used to connect the Kremlin with the White House, has been replaced by the help line, which connects everyone in America to call centers in Bangalore. While the other end of the hot line might have had Leonid Brezhnev threatening nuclear war, the other end of the help line just has a soft voice eager to help you sort out your AOL bill or collaborate with you on a new piece of software. No, that voice has none of the menace of Nikita Khrushchev pounding a shoe on the table at the United Nations, and it has none of the sinister snarl of the bad guys in ''From Russia With Love.'' No, that voice on the help line just has a friendly Indian lilt that masks any sense of threat or challenge. It simply says: ''Hello, my name is Rajiv. Can I help you?''
 No, Rajiv, actually you can't. When it comes to responding to the challenges of the flat world, there is no help line we can call. We have to dig into ourselves. We in America have all the basic economic and educational tools to do that. But we have not been improving those tools as much as we should. That is why we are in what Shirley Ann Jackson, the 2004 president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, calls a ''quiet crisis'' -- one that is slowly eating away at America's scientific and engineering base. 
 ''If left unchecked,'' said Jackson, the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in physics from M.I.T., ''this could challenge our pre-eminence and capacity to innovate.'' And it is our ability to constantly innovate new products, services and companies that has been the source of America's horn of plenty and steadily widening middle class for the last two centuries. This quiet crisis is a product of three gaps now plaguing American society. The first is an ''ambition gap.'' Compared with the young, energetic Indians and Chinese, too many Americans have gotten too lazy. As David Rothkopf, a former official in the Clinton Commerce Department, puts it, ''The real entitlement we need to get rid of is our sense of entitlement.'' Second, we have a serious numbers gap building. We are not producing enough engineers and scientists. We used to make up for that by importing them from India and China, but in a flat world, where people can now stay home and compete with us, and in a post-9/11 world, where we are insanely keeping out many of the first-round intellectual draft choices in the world for exaggerated security reasons, we can no longer cover the gap. That's a key reason companies are looking abroad. The numbers are not here. And finally we are developing an education gap. Here is the dirty little secret that no C.E.O. wants to tell you: they are not just outsourcing to save on salary. They are doing it because they can often get better-skilled and more productive people than their American workers. 
 These are some of the reasons that Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, warned the governors' conference in a Feb. 26 speech that American high-school education is ''obsolete.'' As Gates put it: ''When I compare our high schools to what I see when I'm traveling abroad, I am terrified for our work force of tomorrow. In math and science, our fourth graders are among the top students in the world. By eighth grade, they're in the middle of the pack. By 12th grade, U.S. students are scoring near the bottom of all industrialized nations. . . . The percentage of a population with a college degree is important, but so are sheer numbers. In 2001, India graduated almost a million more students from college than the United States did. China graduates twice as many students with bachelor's degrees as the U.S., and they have six times as many graduates majoring in engineering. In the international competition to have the biggest and best supply of knowledge workers, America is falling behind.''
 We need to get going immediately. It takes 15 years to train a good engineer, because, ladies and gentlemen, this really is rocket science. So parents, throw away the Game Boy, turn off the television and get your kids to work. There is no sugar-coating this: in a flat world, every individual is going to have to run a little faster if he or she wants to advance his or her standard of living. When I was growing up, my parents used to say to me, ''Tom, finish your dinner -- people in China are starving.'' But after sailing to the edges of the flat world for a year, I am now telling my own daughters, ''Girls, finish your homework -- people in China and India are starving for your jobs.'' 
 I repeat, this is not a test. This is the beginning of a crisis that won't remain quiet for long. And as the Stanford economist Paul Romer so rightly says, ''A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.''

HEADLINE: Our Lady of Lawson

BYLINE: By Pico Iyer. 
Pico Iyer has written numerous travel books. ''Sun After Dark,'' a collection of essays, will be published in paperback this month.

 BODY:
To live in Japan without eating Japanese food seems an advanced kind of heresy. My sushi-loving friends in California regard me as a lost cause; my housemates in Japan simply shrug and see this as ultimate confirmation -- me dragging at some lasagna in a plastic box while they gobble down dried fish -- that I belong to an alien species. I grew up in England, I tell them, on boarding-school food, no less; I like Japan at some level deeper than the visible (or edible). They look away and try not to scream.
 Yet the habit that has won me complete excommunication on both sides of the world is my readiness to eat (twice a day) from Lawson, my tiny local convenience store in Nara, the old Japanese capital. A convenience store speaks to many of us of all that is questionable in modern Japan: a soulless, synthetic, one-size-fits-all lifestyle that the efficiency-loving country has perfected to the nth degree. It marks, most would say, the end of family, tradition and community as well as the advent of a homogenized future that has many people running for ''slow food.'' 
 The convenience store is a model of Japan in miniature: the triumph of function over fuss and of ease over embarrassment. Just as you can buy whiskey, eggs, pornography and even (it is said) women's underwear in vending machines, so you can all but live in convenience stores. I pay my phone bills and send my packages through the local branch of the national Lawson chain (named after the defunct American Lawson); I buy my bus cards there and tickets for Neil Young concerts. I make the convenience store my de facto office, lingering by the photocopier for hours on end and then faxing an article, say, to New York. Yet the first law of Japan, even in Lawson, is that nothing is what it seems, and that you can find all the cultures of the world here, made Japanese and strange. Here, in the four thin aisles of my local store, are the McVitie's digestives of my youth -- turned into bite-size afterthoughts. Here are Milky Bar chocolates, converted into bullet-size pellets. Here are Mentos in shades of lime and grape, cans of ''Strawberry Milk Tea'' and the Smarties I used to collect as a boy, refashioned as ''Marble Chocolate.'' Were Marcel Proust to come to Lawson, he would find his madeleines daily but made smaller, sweeter and mnemonically new.
 It's common to hear that Japan has created a promiscuous anthology of the world's best styles. And the convenience store is the center of this. Tubs of Earl Grey ice cream, sticks of mangosteen chewing gum, green-tea-flavored KitKat bars: they're all here in abundance (though, in fashion-victimized Japan, no sooner have I developed a fondness for KissMint chewing gum ''for Etiquette'' than it has been supplanted by ice creams in the shape of watermelon slices). And even the smallest chocolate bar comes with an English-language inscription that, in the Japanese way, makes no sense whatsoever, yet confers on everything the perfume of an enigmatic fairy tale: ''A lovely and tiny twig,'' says my box of Koeda chocolates, ''is a heroine's treasured chocolate born in the forest.''
 In modern Japan, the convenience store is taken to be the spiritual home of the boys in hip-hop shorts and the girls with shocking yellow hair and artificial tans, who try with their every move -- eating in the street, squatting on the sidewalk -- to show that they take their cues from 50 Cent and not Mrs. Suzuki. The door of my local Lawson has badges to denote police surveillance, and where the great 20th-century novelist Junichiro Tanizaki praised shadows (nuance, ambiguity, the lure of the half-seen) as the essence of the Japan he loved, Lawson speaks for a new fluorescent, posthuman -- even anti-Japanese -- future. And yet, in the 12 years I've lived on and off in my mock-California suburb, the one person who has come to embody for me all the care for detail and solicitude I love in Japan is, in fact, the lady at the cash register in Lawson. Small, short-haired and perpetually harried, Hirata-san races to the back of the store to fetch coupons for me that will give me 10 cents off my ''Moisture Dessert.'' She bows to the local gangster who leaves his Bentley running and comes in the store with his high-heeled moll to claim some litchi-flavored strangeness. When occasionally I don't show up for six or seven hours, she sends, through my housemates, a bag of French fries to revive me.
 The Japanese are so good at keeping up appearances that few signs are ever evident of the series of recent recessions. But over the years, I have seen poor Mrs. Hirata's husband (the store's manager) open his doors around the clock and take the graveyard shift himself. The place started to stock tequila-sunrise cocktails in a can, and little bottles of wine. Soon even the Hiratas' two high-school-age sons were being pressed into service (unpaid, I'm sure).
 It's no easier to understand Japan in Western terms than it is to eat noodles with a knife and fork. Yet it has been evident to me for some time that the crush of the anonymous world lies out in the temple-filled streets; the heart of the familiarity, the communal sense of neighborhood, the simple kindness that brought me to Japan, lies in the convenience store.
 Early last year, writing an article on paradise, I surmised that my modest neighborhood could be improved only by the addition of a cinema, but given the laws of human longing and limitation, such an arrival would probably mean the end of my favorite convenience store. Be careful of what you write. Days before my article came out, a sign appeared on my local Lawson, announcing it was going out of business. Almost everyone in the neighborhood was shaken, but no one knew what to do. (How to express your gratitude to a convenience store?) We'd watched the owners' sons grow up while their parents served up bags of chicken nuggets in three spicy flavors.
 I went home, found a set of elegant bowls I'd bought in case of a sudden need for a wedding present and returned to the store. They were being transferred to a far-off shop in the countryside, Mrs. Hirata said; she feared for her kids. She was even afraid of going out there herself. Then I handed over the box, and she realized why I had come. She began to waver for a moment, then turned away from me and put a calzone in the microwave. A true Japanese to the end, she wanted to protect me from her tears.

HEADLINE: A Brisk Trade in Noodles, Wonton and Job Seekers

BYLINE: By CINDY CHANG

 BODY:
The Chinese restaurants on Eldridge Street just below Canal do a brisk lunchtime business with their fish-ball soup, duck noodles and dumplings laced with leeks. But the commodity exchanged most in this part of Chinatown is labor. Employment agencies line the narrow block, and even the one shoe store doubles as a jobs center. 
 Lacking English signs to mark them, the Eldridge Street agencies are impenetrable to non-Chinese speakers. Yet they supply Chinese restaurants throughout the Eastern United States with a limitless stream of cheap labor. An immigrant can walk into an agency on Eldridge Street one day, and board a bus bound for a job in Ohio or Minnesota the next. 
 ''One of the things that's probably true is that the Chinese restaurant in your community or your suburb -- there's a chance that person working there got their job in Chinatown,'' said Robert Weber, director of the Rebuild Chinatown Initiative, an economic development project. Since the Chinatown economy slowed after Sept. 11, many more of the listings have been for out-of-state jobs. 
 Simultaneous conversations, in the Fuzhou dialect and occasionally in Mandarin, filled a small area of one agency on a recent morning as job seekers negotiated first with a clerk and then by phone with the restaurant owner. At most agencies, employers pay nothing to list a position, but job applicants are charged $30 for a successful match. 
 Zunqing Chen, a 30-year-old from Fuzhou, emerged from the Xing Dao (Star Island) Employment Agency one morning with a job as a deep-fry cook. He would leave for upstate New York the next day. ''I don't really like it in America,'' said Mr. Chen, who expected to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week, frying spare ribs and egg rolls in a steamy kitchen. ''Life is really, really difficult here.'' 
 His new job, like most of those listed on Eldridge Street, would pay about $2,000 a month. Room and board is included, but health benefits usually are not. 
 The system functions so efficiently, without resumes or face-to-face interviews, because there is so much similarity among both the jobs and the job seekers, who are mostly non-English-speaking immigrants from Fuzhou with few marketable skills.
 ''You're too picky,'' a clerk at Xing Dao admonished a young man who was still empty-handed after interviews with restaurants in Virginia and North Carolina. 
 ''If there are too many people in the kitchen,'' the young man said as he headed off to try his luck at another agency, ''you can't learn as much.'' CINDY CHANG

HEADLINE: Goodbye to All That

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
AT the end of this month, the Plaza Hotel will close its fabled doors so that its new owner, Elad Properties, can begin the process of converting the bulk of its rooms into condominiums and renting out new stores. Although much of the plan remains hazy, the prospect of a construction crew stomping through the Plaza's ornate entrance has provoked a cascade of personal, sepia-tinted recollections among anxious New Yorkers. As with most treasured places, it is not just the architecture and decor that people so prize, but the memories that were born there.
 The new plans for the Plaza have awakened recollections of the fate of the old Pennsylvania Station, the 1910 McKim, Mead & White masterpiece, the razing of which in 1963 ultimately led to the creation of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 In the 40 years since its founding, the commission has designated 1,119 individual landmarks and 83 historic districts, protecting about 23,000 fine buildings that would otherwise have been vulnerable to demolition. Among them is the Plaza Hotel itself, whose exterior, but not interior, was given landmark protection in 1969. 
 But in a city all but synonymous with change and growth, there will always be, rightly or wrongly, some loss of cherished buildings. In some cases, these structures possess the ability to transport us to a different, earlier incarnation of New York and, inevitably, a different version of ourselves. 
 Here are a baker's dozen of such places -- all in Manhattan, which has suffered the greatest loss of architectural treasures -- that are forever etched in the city's collective memory. All have disappeared since the demise of Penn Station, and most were subjects of controversy at the time of their destruction. They are just a sample of what has vanished. 
 Taken together, these lost buildings and rooms form a kind of ghost city, an island of memory that hovers above the real, evolving Manhattan. It is a shadow New York that once was and might have continued to be, had the economic and political forces that shape the city been different. It is also the only New York that is a perfect New York, for as Marcel Proust wrote in ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' ''the true paradises are the paradises we have lost.'' 

BROKAW MANSIONS
79th Street and Fifth Avenue
1890-1965, 1905-1965, 1911-1965
 Built by a clothier named Isaac Vail Brokaw, this cluster of mansions provided a grand architectural anchor for the important corner across from the Central Park Transverse. Unabashedly extravagant, the parent castle was modeled in part on a Loire Valley chateau, while the adjacent building to the north, one of a matching pair constructed by Brokaw for two sons, was flamboyantly Gothic. The mansion to the east was more restrained and classical.
 The lamentations over the razing of the mansions strengthened the growing preservation movement that the loss of Pennsylvania Station had catalyzed. "The outcry was undoubtedly what at last induced the mayor to sign the law giving the Landmarks Commission legal powers," the architect Nathan Silver wrote in "Lost New York," his compendium of vanished city structures.

OLD METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE
Broadway and 40th Street
1883-1967
 In "The Age of Innocence," a novel of New York society set in the 1870's, Edith Wharton wrote that "there was already talk of the erection, in remote metropolitan distances 'above the Forties,' of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendor with those of the great European capitals."
 Indeed, when the blocklong Italian Renaissance style Metropolitan Opera House was opened in 1883, The New York Times fretted that the auditorium was "on a scale of possibly too great magnitude" and that its lavish interior would "dazzle the eyes." That interior, which was subsequently redesigned by Carrere and Hastings, architects of the New York Public Library, featured an elite set of boxes in an area known as the Diamond Horseshoe, which was occupied by Astors, Vanderbilts and other millionaire patrons.
 Anticipating its move to the planned Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera gave its last performance at the Old Met in 1966.

THE SINGER BUILDING
Broadway and Liberty Street
1908-1967
 When the gracious, 41-story Singer Building pierced the sky above Lower Broadway with its Beaux-Arts, lantern-topped tower in 1908, it was the world's tallest building -- until it was eclipsed by the Metropolitan Life Tower just 18 months later. The Singer's tower occupied only a quarter of its lot, elegantly expressing the belief of its architect, Ernest Flagg, that skyscrapers should be set back, so that "we should soon have a city of towers instead of a city of dismal ravines."
 Demolition of the building began in 1967 to make way for One Liberty Plaza. At the time, it was the tallest building ever demolished.

ASTOR HOTEL
Broadway and 44th Street
1904-1968
 For sheer, unflinching grandeur, it was hard to top the Renaissance-style Astor Hotel in Times Square. The lobby had a 21-foot-high colonnade of marble and gold, while at its rear, encircled by an ornate gallery, stood the "orangerie," a reproduction of an Italian tropical garden.
 As the Great White Way flourished, the Astor became the strip's most popular meeting place, its famous circular bar always populated with actors trading gossip. Cole Porter gave the locale a knowing wink with his lyrics "Have you heard that Mimsie Starr. . . just got pinched in the Astor bar?"

LEWISOHN STADIUM
136th Street and Convent Avenue
1915-1973
 From 1918 to 1966, thousands of New Yorkers poured into this colonnaded Greco-Roman amphitheater for summer open-air concerts -- classical, jazz and more -- that cost as little as 25 cents.
 One person who remembers those events is Claudette Law, from the Pelham Parkway area in the Bronx. In the 1950's, she used to take the subway with her small son each Independence Day to watch Louis Armstrong play at the stadium, a performance that was always followed by fireworks. "I remember Louis coming out," said Ms. Law, 72, "and his wife got up once and told us his birthday was really on the first 'but we always celebrate it on the Fourth' and he was always here to celebrate it."
 She added: "He was quite picturesque himself. He had his white handkerchief, and he'd just be waving it around."
 But she is unsentimental about the loss of the stadium. "I was born in Harlem Hospital, and the building I was born in and every building I lived in before this one is gone," Ms. Law said.
 "You can't go around missing things," she added, laughing. "Otherwise, you'll be still sitting here, missing."

ALL ANGELS' CHURCH
West End Avenue at 81st Street
1890 -1979
 The neo-Gothic exterior of All Angels' Episcopal Church was well regarded, but its interior was spectacular. Among its treasures was a two-anda- half-story Tiffany window and a pulpit ringed with limestone angels that wrapped around the banister and paraded toward the top. There, a carved wooden angel leaned out and blew his trumpet into the center of the sanctuary.
 "What I would do in midweek would be to get the drums out and play them in the sanctuary," said Paul Johnson, who was a member of the church's music group in the 1970's.
 "No one else was using the sanctuary at the time and so my practicing didn't bother anyone,'' he added. "There was a wonderful effect in the afternoon, when the setting sun, the afternoon sun, would hit the Tiffany window, which was on the northwest corner, and so it bathed the whole back end of the church in this very golden light, because there's a lot of gold and gray-blue in that window. Of course you had oak pews, and you had the red carpeting, so all of that was made more golden out of the light.
 "That's one of my very special memories; that's just me being alone in the sanctuary."

BILTMORE HOTEL
43rd Street and Madison Avenue
1913-1981
 Constructed by New York Central Railroad as an accessory to Grand Central Terminal across the street, the Biltmore appealed to lovers for decades. Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald honeymooned there so boisterously that they were asked to leave, and the Biltmore's solid bronze clock was a popular meeting place for amorous couples.
 When Holden Caulfield showed up in the lobby for a date in J.D. Salinger's 1951 novel, "The Catcher in the Rye," he was struck by the crowd of young women. "I was way early when I got there," he recounted, "so I just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls. A lot of schools were home for vacation already, and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up. Girls with their legs crossed, girls with their legs not crossed, girls with terrific legs, girls with lousy legs, girls that looked like swell girls."

HELEN HAYES THEATER
46th Street near Broadway
1911-1982
 When the theater opened, under the name Folies- Bergere, its vibrant terra cotta facade of gold, turquoise and old ivory instantly made it "the brightest, most eye-catching theater along the Rialto," Nicholas van Hoogstraten wrote in his 1991 book, "Lost Broadway Theaters."
 For seven decades, generations of theatergoers strode under its marquee to see luminaries like Bela Lugosi in "Dracula" and Audrey Hepburn in "Gigi." But in 1982, the Helen Hayes -- it had been renamed in 1955 to honor the doyenne of the American stage -- it was razed along with two other vintage Broadway theaters, the Morosco and the Bijou, both from 1917, to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.
 The Helen Hayes and the Morosco conveyed a sense of occasion that avid theatergoers find lacking in newer auditoriums. "Theater architecture generally was designed so that the show would begin before the curtain went up," said Joseph Rosenberg, who conducts theater-oriented tours in the city. "It's like walking into a church. You walk into a church, and you get certain feelings and certain warmth and certain expectations of what's going to follow."
 The Little Theater, on 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes Theater in 1983, a year after the original was razed.

LUCHOW'S
14th Street and Irving Place
1882-1982
 For 100 years, the German baroque interior of Luchow's was as stuffed as a sausage casing with oompah music, gemtlichkeit and the smell of sauerbraten. The distinguished but eclectic clientele included Diamond Jim Brady, H.L. Mencken and Enrico Caruso. Ascap, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, was formed in the restaurant in 1914, and Gus Kahn is said to have composed the lyrics to "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" on a Luchow's tablecloth.
 "A fragrance, delicate, but not weak, and slightly male, rides the air," is how the artist Ludwig Bemelmans described the atmosphere in his introduction to "Luchow's German Cookbook" in 1952. "It composes itself of the aromas of solid cooking, of roast geese and ducks... Through it is wafted the bouquet of good wines, and above this hangs the blue cloud of the smoke of rare cigars. This obscures the stag and moose heads that are part of the dcor, along with samples of the ironmonger's art."
 After the restaurant vacated the building in 1982 for a short-lived stint near Times Square, preservationists fought to save the structure, but it was razed in 1995 after a fire.

MOUNT NEBOH SYNAGOGUE
79th Street near Columbus Avenue
1928-1984
 The synagogue was an imposing six-story structure with Byzantine influences, but for those who loved the place, the attachment was more personal and cultural than architectural. "Mount Neboh is not the Taj Mahal, and nobody says it is," Alan Towers, a neighborhood resident, told The Westsider, a local newspaper, in 1981. "I think it's unorthodox, it's odd, but so is the whole Upper West Side. In the East 60's, they would think it's an eyesore. We think it's the crown jewel of the street."
 In the mid-80's, the building was razed and replaced with an apartment house.

SMALLS' PARADISE
Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 135th Street
1925-1986
 Smalls', a rollicking 1,500-seat Jazz Age nightclub, was famous for elaborate floor shows, stride piano and performances by the likes of Fats Waller and Willie (The Lion) Smith. While some notable Harlem Renaissance nightspots, like the Cotton Club, admitted only white patrons, Smalls' welcomed both blacks and whites, who were served by singing waiters on roller skates serving Chinese food.
 Vacant from 1986, Smalls' three-story building was topped with three new stories and reopened last year as a public school, which shares the structure with an International House of Pancakes.
 "What's been lost," said Michael Henry Adams, a Harlem architectural historian, "is the actual physical space where the Suzy Q dance was created in the 1940's, the actual physical space where waiters delivered trays of drinks while dancing the Charleston or on roller skates, and the actual floor that they did it on."

MARINE GRILL
34th Street at Herald Square
1912-1990
 Tucked into the basement of the McAlpin Hotel, the grill was a vast, kaleidoscopically ornamented terra cotta grotto. Multicolor ceramic embellishments flowed up the thick columns and across the vaults of its ceiling, and maritime murals lined the room.
 "Even the radiator grills were punctuated with beautiful ornament of ceramic," recalled Susan Tunick, president of the Friends of Terra Cotta, and the murals, she added, were "absolutely thrilling."
 "You could see Wall Street; you could see early schooners," she said. "It went all the way up to the phenomenal steam liners, the big ocean voyage cruise ships."
 While leading a walking tour in 1990, Ms. Tunick stumbled across evidence that the Marine Grill was being demolished. "There was a huge Dumpster outside the back of the McAlpin, filled with the room," she recalled. "It was really horrible."
 After its demolition, the once splendid grotto became a storage room for the Gap. Ms. Tunick and others managed to salvage a few of the maritime murals, six of which are on display in the Fulton Street Broadway- Nassau subway station.

DVORAK HOUSE
17th Street near Second Avenue
1852-1991
 Antonin Dvorak, the Czechoslovak composer, lived with his family in this nondescript brick row house from 1892 to 1895, during which time he composed "From the New World," his most famous symphony. "We live four minutes from my school in a very pleasant house," Dvorak wrote to a friend in Prague shortly after moving to New York. "Mr. Steinway sent me a piano, free, so we have one good piece of furniture in the parlor. The rent is $80 a month, a lot for us, but a normal price here."
 In 1991 the Dvorak house was designated a city landmark on historical and cultural grounds, but the designation was overturned by the City Council, and the house's owner, Beth Israel Medical Center, demolished it to make way for an AIDS hospice.

Reviving a Church In Poor Condition
 What does an Episcopal church in Brooklyn have in common with the Great Wall of China? 
 In 2002, a global preservation group put both on its list of the world's 100 most endangered ''monuments of world culture'' -- sites that the group, the World Monuments Fund, based in New York, says are of ''great beauty and importance'' but are deteriorating or are threatened by demolition or abuse. 
 Deterioration is the cited problem for the 158-year-old Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, a Gothic Revival gem at Montague and Clinton Streets in Brooklyn Heights. The federal government has designated the church a National Historic Landmark. 
 Conditions were so bad at St. Ann that it was closed for much of 2001 because its officials feared the building had become a safety hazard. These days, the roof urgently needs major work to keep rainwater from seeping in and damaging the church's magnificent interior, or scarring its renowned stained-glass windows, which have been restored over the last 25 years at a cost of several million dollars. Also, much of the church's brownstone facade is crumbling.
 Physical decline has not been the church's only problem. The congregation has sharply shrunk in recent years. And in 1995 a battle erupted over a theatrical and concert group that was then housed at the church and had raised millions of dollars in restoration funds. The group clashed with the rector and diocesan officials, who sought to evict it, while the church's lay leaders opposed the eviction, which was thwarted.
 Nowadays, though, the atmosphere is calm at St. Ann, permitting church officials to focus on reinforcing the edifice and rebuilding the congregation, the Rev. Angela V. Askew, the priest in charge, and Claudia Barber, a warden, said last week.
 In fact, the congregation is growing again, they said. Mother Askew said the congregation now numbered 74 families and individual members, up from about 45 in 2003. This is still well below a high of 200 during the 1970's and 80's, she said, but she expressed optimism that the growth would continue.
 ''All the mainstream Protestant churches started to slide'' in the 1990's, she said. But some former St. Ann parishioners have said the membership plunge there was accelerated by the clash over the theater group, the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts, which itself departed in 2000 amid continuing disputes with the diocese.
 Mother Askew said the church was now raising money for renovations from other sources. Of $500,000 needed for the roof repairs, for example, $375,000 has been committed so far in private donations and a historic preservation grant from the state, she said.
 But financial numbers are not the only measure of St. Ann's staying power, according to Ms. Barber. ''We believe we have a mission to serve in the community,'' she said. 

Mayor Is Planning To Renew Market
 And on another revival front:
 In October 2003, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced plans to bring back La Marqueta, once a widely known market in East Harlem that had dwindled to nearly nothing. From the 1930's to the 80's, 200 or more vendors vibrantly filled five blocks of buildings under the Park Avenue railroad tracks from 111th to 116th Streets; today, six vendors struggle to survive in the single shabby, little-frequented building still open.
 The city and the federal government have committed nearly $3 million for the revival, and ''we're working with several banks'' and other potential financing sources for the $18 million more needed to rebuild a five-block market, said Elizabeth Colon, executive director of the nonprofit East Harlem Business Capital Corporation. The city named the corporation to carry out the project. 
 A spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, Janel Patterson, said, ''We feel the project is moving along and they have gotten sufficient commitments of funding and tenant interest.''

HEADLINE: An Early Advocate of Stock Options Debunks Himself

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FIFTEEN years ago, Michael C. Jensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, wrote a paper with Kevin J. Murphy, then a professor at the University of Rochester, that trumpeted some pretty radical ideas for the time. Compensation systems, they posited, prompted chief executives to add revenue, not to increase profit, pay dividends or otherwise reward long-suffering shareholders. Their suggestion was to make stock options a big component of top management's pay, ensuring that they do well only if shareholders do well. ''It seemed a way to tie managers tighter to the mast,'' Professor Jensen recalled recently.
 Of course, it turned out to be anything but. In far too many cases, stock options tempted managers to pick strategies, schedule deals and investments, even juggle the numbers, so that the company looked best when it came time to exercise those options. 
 So in 2001, Mr. Jensen, by then a professor emeritus, debunked his own theories in another paper, this time castigating the profusion of stock options in executive pay. 
 Mr. Jensen, now 65, is still not done with the subject. He has written a book about the issue, tentatively titled ''C.E.O. Pay and What to Do About It,'' that the Harvard Business School Press has scheduled for publication next winter. In a telephone interview from his home in Sarasota, Fla., he expounded on his past and current thoughts.

Q. What made you interested in executive compensation in the first place?

A. All through the 70's and 80's, systems that rewarded bad things and punished good ones arose like moss on trees. Compensation committees rewarded executives for acting like bureaucrats, for growing the size of the company, even if they destroyed products and businesses and market value in the process. That's what led to the conglomerate craze and takeover premiums of the 60's -- and why it took the raiders and buyout specialists to sort it all out in the 70's.

Q. So chief executives weren't earning their pay?

A. It's not that I thought C.E.O.'s were overpaid; in fact, I felt they were underpaid in relation to lawyers and other professionals. But it seemed they were paid in the wrong way, independent of whether market value increased or decreased on their watch. Stock options seemed the best way to create an automatic relationship between the reward to the shareholder and the reward to the decision maker.

Q. After you proposed this in the Harvard Business Review, the use of stock options grew rapidly. But then you soured on the idea. Why?

A. Compensation committees wrongly looked at options as free, and awarded too many to too many people. It diluted the stock. And most stock option programs still rewarded management for building the empire, not the actual value. There was no penalty for investing in projects that did not return the cost of capital. When those projects pumped up the stock, management got a big win -- but the shareholders would have still done better if the money had been paid out in dividends.

Q. Lots of companies are switching away from stock options to outright grants of restricted stock. Does that solve the problem?

A. No. Say I offer you $1 million in restricted stock -- even if you think the stock will go down 10 percent, you're still getting $900,000, and you're happy as a clam. I'd be handing over a large amount of wealth, yet penalizing executives only slightly for the decline in the value of the stock.

Q. So the maximum stock price is the holy grail?

A. Absolutely not. Warren Buffett says he worries as much when one of his companies becomes overvalued as undervalued. I agree. Overvalued equity is managerial heroin -- it feels really great when you start out; you're feted on television; investment bankers vie to float new issues.
 But it doesn't take long before the elation and ecstasy turn into enormous pain. The market starts demanding increased earnings and revenues, and the managers begin to say: ''Holy Moley! How are we going to generate the returns?'' They look for legal loopholes in the accounting, and when those don't work, even basically honest people move around the corner to outright fraud.
 If they hold a lot of stock or options themselves, it is like pouring gasoline on a fire. They fudge the numbers and hope they can sell the stock or exercise the options before anything hits the fan.

Q. Are you suggesting that executives be rewarded for driving down the price of the stock?

A. I'm saying they should be rewarded for being honest. A C.E.O. should be able to tell investors, ''Listen, this company isn't worth its $70 billion market cap; it's really worth $30 billion, and here's why.''
 But the board would fire that executive immediately. I guess it has to be preventative -- if executives would present the market with realistic numbers rather than overoptimistic expectations, the stock price would stay realistic. But I admit, we scholars don't yet know the real answer to how to make this happen.

Q. But then, does it really make sense to judge executives entirely by market value? Why not reward them for setting, and meeting, stretch targets for, say, revenue or profits?

A. It's too easy to game the target-setting process. Nobody has an incentive to provide accurate data or to worry about the company as a whole.
 I knew a beverage company manager who deliberately underforecast how much product he could sell during holiday season; the company believed him and cut back on production. It lost a fortune in missed sales, but he got a huge bonus for exceeding his estimates.
 I also knew some executives at an equipment company who shipped their product unassembled, so they could book the revenue in a particular quarter. The company spent a fortune on labor to assemble the product in the customer's warehouse. Profits suffered, but the executives got their bonuses.

Q. O.K., then let's stick with the idea of rewarding executives for creating market value. But is it time to abandon stock options and grants, and just link bonuses to stock price?

A. Not at all. A correctly designed option, adjusted for the cost of capital minus the dividends, would not pay off unless an executive really created incremental value. That means executives only get paid if shareholders are in the money, too.
 And even better, why not give executives a chance to bet on their own strategies? Let them put their own money into projects they recommend. Or at least make them pay for stock options. If the stock is selling at $100, make them pay $10 for an option they can exercise at $90. That way they at least have a downside.
 That also gets to the question of repricing stock options when share prices fall. With most stock plans, that just gives management a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose situation. But it would be O.K. to offer to sell them more options at a lower strike price.

Q. What about indexing options to peer companies? Is it fair to penalize management when an entire industry is out of favor with investors?

A. Yes, it is fair. When you say, ''I'll measure your performance relative to your peers in the industry,'' you remove the incentive to get the company in the right industry. Do you really want executives to say, ''I don't care if we're in a declining industry; I'll get my bonus if we're the best.''? With that kind of thinking, I.B.M. might have stayed in the typewriter business instead of moving into computers.

Q. Reformers want companies to expense options, or to let shareholders approve pay packages. How much of a difference will these changes make?

A. When boards stop thinking options are free, there'll be fewer options granted, and to fewer people. When companies were forced to recognize the present value of pension obligations and long-term health care provisions, they cut back on those plans.

Q. Does a company's compensation system weigh heavily when you are picking stocks to buy?

A. Hypothetically, it would. But I sold virtually everything I could in March of 2000, and I've continued to sell the illiquid holdings as they became freed up. I got out pretty much whole, and I've never gone back in.


CORRECTION-DATE: April 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with the special report on executive pay, about those who collected the most in one year during the last 25 years, referred incorrectly to one of them, Alfred Lerner, who got $195 million from MBNA for 2002. He died that year; he did not retire. His son, Randy, now owns and runs the Cleveland Browns, the National Football League expansion franchise that Mr. Lerner bought in 1998.

But some have been more extraordinary than others. Here are the executives who took home the biggest amounts in one year during the last 25 years, and an indicator of how companies performed over the three years ending with the year of their big payout. Company performance is measured by total return to shareholders, including any capital gain or loss in the stock and any dividends. Not surprisingly, most of the big payouts came at the height of the recent stock market bubble. In most cases, the payouts were large because the executives cashed in options from more than one year.

HEADLINE: Where Setting Up Shop Just Got a Little Pricier

BYLINE: By Colin Moynihan. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
OSCAR ACOSTA had every intention of renewing the $950-a-month lease for his Lower East Side flower shop last spring. After all, the business, the Clinton Flower Shop, had been on the same block since it opened in 1951. 
 But Mr. Acosta's landlord had other plans. He wanted to rent the storefront that housed the flower shop together with an adjacent one in the same Clinton Street building, creating a much bigger space for a tenant with much deeper pockets. 
 ''Ideally, we'd like to get a restaurant in there,'' the landlord, Peter Polow Jr., said recently. He envisions renting the larger space, about 3,000 square feet, for $12,000 a month, but so far he has found no takers.
 Mr. Polow is not the only Lower Manhattan landlord looking to increase profits by leasing to restaurants and bars, whose liquor licenses help push their earnings, and the rent they can usually afford, well above that of the bodegas, dry cleaners, hardware stores and other neighborhood shops they are replacing. 
 About a dozen bars and restaurants have opened on the two-block stretch of Clinton Street between East Houston and Rivington Streets over the last five years, filling storefronts once occupied by businesses with more modest profits. ''Ever since the bars and restaurants have moved in, the landlords see an opportunity to get more money,'' said Mr. Acosta, who took over the shop in the late 80's. 
 The influx of new places has not been universally welcomed. Some longtime residents say that as bars and restaurants replace mom-and-pop stores, something of value is being lost. 
 And while the recent arrivals may draw affluent patrons from across the city, some who live above the new bars and restaurants say that many of the places that have opened up are out of their price range. 
 ''Some people have no problem spending $100 for dinner,'' said Alice Arnold, the president of the Clinton Street Block Association. ''But others have a hard time coming up with $100 for rent.''
 The eyeglasses store that used to be on Clinton Street between East Houston and Rivington Streets is gone. So is the store that sold wedding dresses and the one that sold paper party supplies. All were replaced by bars and restaurants. 
 At 50 Clinton Street, the San Miguel grocery is now WD50, where a cod entree goes for $28 and lamb loin for $30. Today, within the two blocks, there are nine bars or restaurants with full liquor licenses and six others that sell wine or beer. 
 Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3, which covers Clinton Street, said the issue of liquor licenses was one of the most divisive in the neighborhood. She said the profusion of bars and restaurants had created an imbalance.
 ''If a city planner designed a neighborhood, he would not put 15 bars on two blocks,'' she said of the businesses licensed to sell alcohol. 
 A year ago, Community Board 3 wrote a resolution opposing all new liquor licenses on several blocks, including the stretch of Clinton Street. The State Liquor Authority, however, has the discretion to issue licenses despite board decisions.
 State regulations bar granting a liquor license to an applicant seeking to open a business within 500 feet of three establishments that already have one, unless additional licenses are deemed to be beneficial to the public. Alexandra Militano, chairwoman of the State Liquor Authority committee at Community Board 3, said the agency's definition of a public benefit was unclear. 
 Kimberly Morello, a spokeswoman for the State Liquor Authority, would not comment on Clinton Street, but said the agency considered each license individually and weighed ''all points of view.'' 
 Ms. Arnold, of the Clinton Street Block Association, says the street has undergone significant changes since she moved there in 1993. ''It's become a destination street,'' she said. 
 As for Mr. Acosta, he moved around the corner into a Stanton Street storefront, where he now pays $1,750 a month. But even though his rent has nearly doubled, he is thankful that his business has survived.
 ''I feel lucky to be here at all,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Just a Few Pinstripes Can Make a Place Look Rich

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
It was the ranking that gave Randolph Peers pause. Earlier this year, Mr. Peers, vice president of economic development at the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, was updating the borough's labor market survey and noticed that in 2002 Brooklyn had clocked in with the lowest average annual wage of all five boroughs. 
 Most striking, he thought, was that Brooklyn's annual average of $32,882 was $3,000 less than the average wage for the Bronx, even though the Bronx had, and still has, fewer jobs and a higher unemployment rate. (This January, the rate was 8 percent, compared with 6.7 percent in Brooklyn.)
 Perplexed, Mr. Peers brought in some colleagues, and in examining the numbers more closely, they discovered the reason for the discrepancy. ''The Bronx has a lot less jobs,'' Mr. Peers said. ''But if 10 of them are Yankees making $50 million a year, that's going to affect the average wage.''
 Indeed, in the subcategory of Arts, Entertainment and Recreation in the New York State Labor Department's data from 2002, the average wage paid in Brooklyn was $25,287, compared with an astounding $79, 425 in the Bronx, more even than Manhattan's average of $50,911. (The total jobs in that subcategory were 3,178 in Brooklyn, 2,705 in the Bronx and 54,446 in Manhattan; the figures were similar in 2003; data from 2004 have not yet been released.) 
 Although corporate tax filings are private, ''We know the Yankee payroll is large,'' said James Brown, a labor market analyst with the department. ''And regardless of where they issue the checks from, its employee wages are considered Bronx wages.'' In 2002, the average wage for a Yankee player was $4.9 million, according to the Major League Baseball Players Association. 
 For officials at the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, this realization amounted to one more reason to bring the Nets basketball franchise to their borough. ''George Steinbrenner pays well,'' Mr. Peers conceded. Maybe, he mused, Bruce Ratner would, too, someday. JENNIFER BLEYER

HEADLINE: A Taste of Home For Americans Living in Asia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

 BODY:
FOR the expatriate family in Asia, hemmed in by language barriers and concrete high-rises, the island of Saipan offers soothing beach therapy and a quick America fix. 
 Without the jet lag of a Pacific crossing, you can fly direct from Seoul, Tokyo, Osaka, Shanghai or Hong Kong for a long weekend on the capital of the Northern Marianas, a 15-island, American possession. At 1,460 miles south of Tokyo, Saipan is far closer to China and Japan than it is to Hawaii. And with a weak dollar, a vacation in this western toehold of the American economy is a pleasing respite for families on a budget. 
 Americans first charged into Saipan in June 1944, coming ashore in a costly invasion that blasted away most traces of the island's past as a 19th-century Spanish colony and a 20th-century Japanese garrison. Today, the main site of the invasion -- a lagoon and beach at Chalan Kanoa on the west coast of the island -- is filled with windsurfers and sand castle builders staying at the sprawling Pacific Islands Club. 
 Most American visitors take refuge in an enclave resort like the P.I.C., as it is widely known. But venturing outside the walls, they discover other family diversions -- like dirt biking in the jungle or snorkeling through clouds of colorful fish.
 But evidence of the island's past is everywhere and should not be shortchanged. For instance, you'll find a monument to the American marines in a grove of palm trees near the P.I.C.'s volleyball court. This Memorial Day weekend, Saipan will open one of the largest Pacific War museums outside of Hawaii, a tribute to the 1944 battle when the United States attacked Japanese troops on this 46.5-square-mile island (roughly twice the size of Manhattan) with over 500 ships, 2,000 planes and 125,000 soldiers. 
 To get around, you can use the shuttle buses that run a north-south loop between hotels up and down Saipan's west side every half hour from about 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. for just $3 a day. But to explore the island's natural areas, it is best to rent a car, which starts at around $60 a day.

RAIN OR SHINE
 While Saipan offers year-round temperatures around 81 degrees, rain can sweep in at any time. Beginning this June, a rainy day will be a good excuse to visit the new World War II visitors center in Garapan village, where, among other things, you'll be able to walk through a limestone cave, listening to the drip-drip of water while Chamorro islander figurines talk worriedly in recorded voices about the bombing outside. 
 The $5.4 million museum, which will have free admission, is set in the 133-acre American Memorial Park, where children can run around more green space than they might see in a week in Tokyo or Seoul. Information is available at (670) 234-7207 and on the Web at www.nps.gov/amme. 
 Many visitors only notice the moldy buildings and poker halls that give the island a rusty, third world edge. But driving north along the beach road, visitors will find that this second-rate mark of man slowly softens. Most of the northern third of the island is covered by jungle. 
 At the Mariana Resort and Spa, Marianas Trekking offers a bike trip, with beach barbecue lunch and pool privileges at the resort for $75 for everyone over 12. The trek starts atop Suicide Cliff, a scenic overlook where hundreds of Japanese families jumped to their deaths rather than submit to capture by American soldiers. 
 Rolling down smooth, largely empty park roads, cyclists pass cool forests; shaded cow pastures; Banzai Cliffs, a series of rock faces pockmarked by naval shells; and the rusting guns and minitanks of the Last Command Post. Besieged at this bunker, Yoshitsugo Saito, the Japanese commander, committed hara-kiri.
 The trek took us to the Grotto, where a pool of aquamarine water is cupped in dark volcanic rock. Down a forest trail small branches whacked helmets. Then we stopped near a limestone cave where diehard Japanese soldiers hid out for months after Japan's surrender. At the mouth of the cave, there are Japanese-era beer bottles. Deeper inside, there are white objects. Real bones, the guide said. 
 The free hotel pickup and return is a boon since taxi drivers seem to use meters from Tokyo. Information: (670) 323-7743; www.marianastrekking.com.

SPLASH
 A day trip to Managaha Island, in a lagoon on the island's western side, is a must for all ages. You can cross the lagoon astride a bouncing, yellow banana boat pulled by a motorboat, or fly overhead strapped into a parasail. 
 On the island, you can stroll white beaches, inspect Japanese fortifications half lost under vegetation, and in a forest clearing, find a painted statue of a chief who first led the northern migration of his people here from the Caroline Islands. After snorkeling across a shallow reef, warmth comes with a bowl of beef curry on fat udon noodles for $12 at the Coral Garden Restaurant. 
 B-Sea Sunsports has packages to the island with free pickup and return to hotels: parasailing is $65, and $40 ages 6 to 11; snorkel and fins rental is $5; motorboat transport to and from the island, including the banana boat ride (for ages 6 and up) is $50, and $45 for a child. Information: (670) 233-7268 or (670) 233-2732, and www.b-sea.com.

THE BIG NIGHT OUT
 The SandCastle Dinner Theater, in the Hyatt Regency Saipan, offers a fast-paced Las Vegas-style magic show featuring tigers, beautiful women sawed in half, a comedian who can turn a $1 bill into a 10,000-yen note, and Anthony Reed, a master illusionist who amazingly escapes from a padlocked chest filled with water. Parents need not fear: the outfits are not skimpier than those around the hotel swimming pool. 
 The three-course dinner features a steak or lobster for adults ($95) and soup burger and fries for children ($40). Reservations: (670) 233-8585; www.sandcastlesaipan.com.

FINGER FOOD
 After the constant sticker shock of Tokyo, it was refreshing to enter the Subway restaurant on Paseo de las Marianas, one of three Subways on Saipan and feed Dad and three teenage boys for $17.98. 
 A more sophisticated option is A.J. Restaurant on Beach Road, next to Susupe Beach Park. A full dinner for three, with drinks and tip, was $100. Specialties include penne pesto and tenderloin steaks; kids like the pizzas and the outside dining terrace. Information: (670) 234-9022.

WHERE TO STAY
 The Pacific Islands Club, a sprawling 295-room resort on the sheltered west side of the island, offers a water park with wave machines, water aerobics and water slides. Basic rooms range from $170 to $250 a night, depending on season. Information: (670) 234-2042, www.pacificislandsclub.com. 
 In the same price range, the 325-room Hyatt offers Camp Hyatt, for kids 3 to 12. It is ideal for parents who want to try more serious water sports, like windsurfing, or indulge in such grown-up activities as shopping at DFS Galleria, a nearby complex of duty-free stores. Information: (670) 234-1234; www.hyatt.com.

HEADLINE: Kyrgyzstan's Shining Hour Ticks Away and Turns Out To Be a Plain, Old Coup

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, April 2 

 BODY:
A malaise is settling over this country as the uprising a week ago begins to look less like a democratically inspired revolution and more like a garden-variety coup, with a handful of seasoned politicians vying for the spoils of the ousted government.
 ''Let's not pretend that what happened here was democratic,'' said Edil Baisalov, one of the country's best-known democracy advocates, speaking to clearly disheartened students beneath huge Soviet-era portraits of Lenin, Marx and Engels in the auditorium of what has been the American University since 1997.
 Mr. Baisalov bemoaned what he said Kyrgyzstan lost out on when the presidential palace was stormed and President Askar Akayev fled: the kind of cathartic national experience that he witnessed in Ukraine as its Orange Revolution unfolded. That was a slow-building, well-organized event that took two months to reach a successful conclusion. 
 ''What Ukraine went through was very important to their democratic development,'' he said. ''We didn't have that great emotional experience of civic education.''
 Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous country of astonishing beauty, has few resources to exploit beyond a gold mine and the headwaters that irrigate fertile valleys in neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Though it is host to both American and Russian air bases, it is of no great strategic importance. The West's main interest in Kyrgyzstan seems to lie in its potential to set a diplomatic example for the region.
 The West has poured tens of millions of dollars into the country to help it develop democratic institutions and a civil society. When the popular uprising began in February, Western governments championed what they saw as a democratic revolution that might inspire similar movements in other post-Soviet Central Asian states.
 But as it seems to be turning out, the Kyrgyz experience could have a chilling effect on political freedoms in the region at least equal to its inspiration of pro-democracy activists. The squabbling that came out of the country's ''revolution'' reveals a clearly visible fracture dividing northerners from southerners, and many less obvious fissures fragmenting those groups even more. People who have won a measure of influence, meanwhile, are appointing family and friends to jobs in keeping with Kyrgyzstan's age-old tribal customs.
 Kyrgyzstan's political analysts say that some good is still likely to emerge. They say the country's future leaders have been put on notice that popular political movements are possible and that the mechanisms to make them happen are in place.
 But such an outcome is far from the hopes that drove the uprising. It started as separate revolts in the country's southern provinces, where clans of politicians disqualified from the recent parliamentary elections occupied government buildings. The discontent spread to other parts of the country as the flawed elections unfolded, and opposition politicians in the north channeled the upset into a national movement.
 Mamatkazy Kaparov, 26, a law student at Kyrgyzstan's National University in Bishkek, helped found KelKel, a student movement modeled on the Serbian Otpor youth movement, which contributed to Slobodan Milosevic's fall. The Kyrgyz students picked yellow as their color and lemons as their symbol after a popular student magazine. For them, this was meant to have been their Lemon Revolution. 
 But their dream of a camera-ready peaceful revolution was overtaken by events. Thugs attacked the crowds, prompting rock-throwing demonstrators to turn on the unarmed security forces guarding the capital's presidential compound. The guards fled, the rock throwers broke inside, and the president fled, all in a matter of a few hours. Not even the students' yellow had time to catch on: some protesters wore pink. 
 Now Mr. Kaparov and his associates, sidelined by the professional politicians who quickly took over, seem frustrated by the betrayal of their democratic ideals.
 ''We're working for the rule of law and a constitutional foundation because people are too unpredictable,'' he said, wearing a traditional white felt hat and a yellow ribbon around his neck at KelKel's headquarters.
 Meanwhile, business leaders say a second wave of looting has begun following the two nights of vandalism and theft that characterized the government takeover last week. But this one is less visible and at a higher level, they say, as people associated with the new government wrest control of businesses, just as the Akayev family once did.
 Nurbek Turdukolov, who remains deputy minister of transport and communication, is part of a group of young, educated business leaders and intellectuals who want to shift the roiled nation's focus from personalities to policies. 
 ''There are no platforms, no ideas, no strategy,'' he said, and added that the opposition and the ousted government operated no differently than the patronage system of the Soviet era. Mr. Turdukolov has declared himself a presidential candidate. 
 By most analyses, power is split between two factions, one led by the acting president and presidential candidate, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, the other by the former security chief, Felix Kulov, who announced his candidacy on Friday. Mr. Bakiyev represents the south and is allied with the judiciary; Mr. Kulov represents the north and is allied with the Parliament.
 Mr. Turdukolov is under no illusions about his chances for immediate success in Kyrgyzstan's deeply tribal culture -- the word Kyrgyz means ''40 clans'' -- but ''we want to create alternatives,'' he said. ''There is no real alternative now.''
 Meanwhile, there are active pro-democracy movements in several neighboring Central Asian states, but none has the kind of charismatic leader that Georgia or Ukraine needed to galvanize the public.
 ''The forces that create such uprisings can really only be nurtured in states where there is some political space,'' said Nadia M. Diuk, Eurasia director at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington. Such space, she said, does exist in Kyrgyzstan and, to some extent, in Kazakhstan, in contrast to Turkmenistan. 
 Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurat Niyazov, has declared himself president for life, and Uzbekistan's leader, Islam Karimov, has already used two national referendums to extend his term, which now runs until the end of 2007. Opposition parties have not been allowed to register in either country, neither of which has much tolerance for dissent.
 Tajikistan is a little freer, but it, too, has begun tightening what little slack it gave for political activism. And because of the civil war that left tens of thousands of people dead in the 1990's, the people are reluctant to risk more chaos.
 The only place in Central Asia where a popular pro-democracy movement has any real chance, analysts say, is Kazakhstan, a ''semiauthoritarian'' state like Kyrgyzstan that will hold presidential elections next year. The country's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has held his job since 1990 and is widely expected to seek another term.
 But unlike Kyrgyzstan, where poverty and frustration over the country's meager economy played a critical role in motivating protesters, Kazakhstan has oil and gas revenues that support a broader, more complacent middle class. The wealth also means that the governing elite have more at stake and are likely to fight harder than Mr. Akayev if challenged.
 Still, Ms. Diuk said that as governments cracked down, they often forced civic groups that were not normally political into active opposition. ''There are some groups who will always be in the opposition, but many who are in the middle unless they are pushed,'' she said, ''and then the government gets more trouble than they've bargained for.''

HEADLINE: They're Moving Out

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, Rachel Meek of Poquott and Brian Carrillo of East Setauket were living in their parents' homes. Having dated for a year and a half, they hoped to share an apartment on the Island and started looking at one-bedroom rentals nearby. 
 ''The prices were just outrageous,'' recalled Mr. Carrillo, 29. ''If we rented, 80 percent of our salary would go to rent.''
 During a vacation in Florida in the Tampa Bay area, they decided to scout out apartments. 
 ''We looked at Florida as something that was definitely doable,'' said Mr. Carrillo, who had lost his job in the quality-assurance department when the telecommunications company he worked for in Lake Grove went out of business. ''We both felt the change was due, and we could do better.''
 They picked Lakeland, between Tampa and Orlando, where they thought jobs would be the most numerous. Their two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in a complex with a pool, tennis and basketball courts, a fitness center and a clubhouse rented for $625 a month, about half the price they would have paid for a cramped one-bedroom on the Island. 
 Within a week Mr. Carrillo found a job in marketing. Ms. Meek, now 28, was hired as a probation officer. A year and a half later they bought a house for $140,000. 
 The couple's decision to move off the Island in search of a better life and more-affordable housing was hardly unique. According to the Long Island Index 2005, a study sponsored by the Garden City-based Rauch Foundation, 64 percent of Long Islanders said that they thought about leaving and moving to an area with lower property taxes and housing costs; 71 percent said that they worried that the high cost of housing would force relatives to move away. 
 ''The high cost of living, the high cost of housing and high taxes'' are the top three reasons young people are leaving, said Carrie Gallagher, the report's project director. ''It's unaffordable for them.'' 
 Options are also few for retirees and workers earning modest incomes. The number of rental units on the Island is the lowest in the nation per capita, the report said. 
 From 1990 to 2000, 20 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds left Long Island, a rate five times the national average. And 27 percent of the 805 Long Islanders surveyed by telephone said they were very likely to move out of their county in the next five years. 
 The Carrillos married in June 2003. That November they sold their first home and moved to Land O' Lakes, north of Tampa. Last fall, Ms. Carrillo got a job teaching at an elementary school, and Mr. Carrillo was promoted to sales territory manager for a plumbing components company.
 ''We bought a spanking brand-new house that would have been about $500,000 in New York for about $175,000 here,'' Mr. Carrillo said, describing their two-story, three-bedroom Mediterranean with an office and a two-car garage. Their property taxes are $2,100 a year, compared with the $8,000 his mother pays back home in East Setauket. 
 ''We came down here with nothing, and we haven't looked back,'' he said. 
 The exodus is not just among the young. Retirees and baby boomers who aged along with post-World War II suburbia are also opting off the Island. 
 While some say they miss the beaches, the proximity to the city, their friends and family, they note that the Island has developed too many wrinkles: traffic congestion has worsened, commuting takes longer, open space is disappearing. 

Slowing the Pace
 Regrets seem to be few among expatriate Long Islanders. Living seems finer in parts north, south and west.
 ''We did love Long Island, we just love Vermont that much more,'' said Barbara Lettenberger, 49. Last July, she and her husband, Lewis, 48, moved from Northport. They got $575,000 for the house they bought in 1989 for $185,000, and set up their vacation chalet in a resort community in Londonderry, Vt., for full-time living. 
 ''We were comfortable in this area, where it's a little less of a hustle-bustle atmosphere,'' Ms. Lettenberger said by telephone. 
 She said they had started thinking about making a change after Sept. 11. Mr. Lettenberger's job as a salesman for an awning company was stressful, and Ms. Lettenberger said her job as an office manager in Holbrook ''wasn't a career-type job that I enjoyed.'' In Vermont she landed a job 26 miles away in Manchester, working for the sourcing department at Orvis, the catalog and retail company. 
 ''Time-wise it takes about 30 minutes, but my commute, I look at the mountains,'' she said. ''I don't look at taillights. I don't look at cement walls on the side of the expressway.''
 Mr. Lettenberger started a property-management business for vacation homeowners. On the Island, he woke up five to six times a night, worrying about his job. Since he moved, he sleeps through the night.
 ''Here you can be a member of a golf club, a country club, and have it be less pricey and less crowded and have the same amenities offered to you,'' Ms. Lettenberger said. ''You are in the mountains with beautiful scenery all around. It's a quality way of life that we enjoy.'' 
 While salaries are lower, the cost of living is also lower, Ms. Lettenberger said. Fresh eggs are available at the farm up the road for $1.59 a dozen, and there is no sales tax on clothing. But going to BJ's Wholesale Club or the Home Depot entails a ride of 45 minutes to an hour, with far fewer shopping choices than on the Island. 
 Nor is it quite so easy to go out to eat. ''We have some very nice restaurants up here, but living in the country, everything is 20 miles away,'' Ms. Lettenberger said. ''In Northport, we had restaurants we could walk to in less than a mile.''
 Ms. Lettenberger said she missed the shore and browsing the boutiques in Huntington and Northport. She thinks about the Island a lot and is planning a three- or four-day visit. ''My family is still there,'' she said. ''We both have a lot of ties there.''
 Still, she said, leaving was the right decision. ''Long Island is a wonderful place to live and raise a family, and it was time for us to move on,'' Ms. Lettenberger said. ''We wanted to be up here and settle back a little bit.''

Reducing Taxes
 Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business group, said retirees and older baby boomers were trying to take advantage of peak home prices by moving to areas where the cost of living is lower. 
 ''Many who are leaving the area would prefer to stay here but can't afford to stay here,'' Dr. Kamer said. 
 Last September, after Don Brown retired from his dry-cleaning business, he and his wife, Janet, sold their house in Dix Hills and moved to Broadbrook, Conn., near Hartford, close to their daughter Laura O'Donnell.
 ''We really couldn't afford to stay on Long Island because of our taxes,'' Ms. Brown said. The annual property tax bill was $5,600. ''We knew it was going up,'' she added. ''If you are trying to live on your Social Security and pensions, it's hard.''
 Ms. Brown, 65, said they searched for a condominium or a town house on the Island, but prices were close to $500,000, about what they could get for their house. ''We went all the way out to the Hamptons, and we found a place out there that started at $395,000,'' she said. ''By the time we would have it so we could live in it, it was over $400,000. So we were back where we started.''
 Ms. O'Donnell, their daughter, searched the Hartford area and found a town house that fit her parents' needs.
 ''It was $163,000,'' Ms. Brown said, describing the two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath home with a full basement. Maintenance runs $145 a month. Property taxes are $2,000. 
 Ms. Brown said moving was difficult. She misses her friends and her sisters and seeing her three grandchildren in West Islip every day.
 ''But I have grandchildren here, and that takes away the sting,'' said Ms. Brown, who has four in Connecticut. When she gets lonely, Ms. Brown makes the two-and-a-half-hour drive back to the Island and stays with her daughter Terri Doerler in West Islip. 
 ''I miss the beach,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I used to walk on the boardwalk all the time, and we would go to Robert Moses and walk over there. I don't miss the traffic.''
 With the money they are saving on living expenses, the Browns plan to visit their three other daughters and seven other grandchildren in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
 ''We are freer and can afford to go and visit the other ones, which makes life nicer, too,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I take just the money I saved on taxes, and I can fly everywhere I want to go. When I lived on Long Island, I couldn't afford to go.''

Fitting In
 Wanting to move to a less expensive place, Beth and Marc Stewart put their home in Springs on the market last July. 
 ''The house we were in was nothing fantastic, but our mortgage was enormous,'' said Ms. Stewart, 36. The 1,300-square-foot ranch on a half acre fetched $595,000, double what they paid four and a half years earlier.
 In March, the Stewarts moved to a rental in Asheville, N.C., and quickly put a deposit on a 1925 brick bungalow. It cost $350,000. The property taxes are $2,600, half of what they paid in East Hampton. ''We did make out like bandits,'' Ms. Stewart said. 
 Even the beauty of the East End was not enough to keep the Stewarts there. ''Our quality of life was starting to decline,'' she said. ''Although we were making fairly good money, we were having trouble enjoying ourselves. We were just feeding the beast.''
 Going out to dinner usually cost at least $100, she said. Unless they wanted to shop for clothes in expensive boutiques, they had to travel to Riverhead. 
 ''We are thinking about starting a family, and the values in the Hamptons didn't match our values around raising a family,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''We were looking for a deeper value system. We don't want our kids to grow up expecting that they are going to have a BMW.''
 Ms. Stewart worked from home and in Asheville, she has kept her job as vice president for sales at a small skin care company in East Hampton. Mr. Stewart, 40, left his mortgage banking job in Southampton and has two offers: one as a banker, the other with a construction company. 
 ''My salary was great,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''It was no problem for us to live on one salary here. Our cost of living has decreased 35 percent.''
 Ms. Stewart said she immediately felt a sense of community in Asheville. 
 ''There is a lot of warmth here,'' she said, adding that she likes the area's shopping, restaurants, arts programs and urban feel as well as its slower pace and more relaxed environment. ''In the Hamptons we felt more excluded, money-wise. It's really cliquey in the Hamptons. If you don't have the right shoes and the right watch, you can feel a little self-conscious in certain places.'' 
 Ms. Stewart said she missed the ocean but loved the mountains and the opportunities for hiking and biking. 
 And they feel as if they fit. ''We finally feel like driving a Volvo is something special,'' she said. ''It's not a parade of Range Rovers and BMW's everywhere you go. We are finally fish of a reasonable size in this town.''

Leaving Gangs Behind
 Sherry Glatzer, 45, was born on Long Island and spent her childhood in Hauppauge. Twenty years ago, she moved to Huntington Station. But the safe, family-friendly Island of her childhood seems to have vanished, she said. 
 ''We had a crack house up the street from us, and I didn't consider where we lived a bad neighborhood,'' Ms. Glatzer said. ''Years ago when I grew up, nobody locked a door. You didn't have to. Nobody needed a key. Now I can't let my kids play out in front of the house unless I watch them. The crime is ridiculous.''
 In early March, Ms. Glatzer quit her six-figure job as a vice president of a financial services company on Wall Street. With her husband, Charles, 47, a photographer, and her 11-year-old daughter Haley, Ms. Glatzer settled in Hendersonville, N.C., outside Asheville, where her father, Ed Young, had relocated from Medford in 2003. 
 ''It's sad what is happening up there,'' Ms. Glatzer said in a telephone interview. ''I feel like I was forced to leave.'' 
 Ms. Glatzer said that when they lived in Huntington Station, she worried about sending Haley to Walt Whitman High School. 
 ''The gang violence there has gotten out of control,'' she said. ''It'll only be a few years until they put the metal detectors on the doors.''
 The lower cost of living was a bonus. For the $1,300 a month they paid in rent in Huntington Station, Ms. Glatzer said, the family bought a 3,000-square-foot house on half an acre in a subdivision backing up to several hundred acres of protected open space, on a mountain ridge in a top-rated school district. Property taxes: $1,200 a year. 
 Besides, the pace was slower. 
 ''The Northeast is always foot-on-the-floor-gas-pedal speed with whatever they do,'' Ms. Glatzer said. ''Not that it's a snail's pace down here, but at least you can slow down and catch your breath.''
 Though he plans to return to the Island to lead photographic workshops on ospreys this summer, Mr. Glatzer said taking clients on photographic trips to other parts of the country had made him aware of the possibilities of living elsewhere. 
 ''The problem on Long Island is everyone gets caught up in keeping up with the Joneses,'' he said. ''I look out the window, and I see God's country instead of my neighbors.'' 
 Mr. Glatzer said he had booked photographic assignments in North Carolina and was confident his income would not drop.
 ''I am taking what I made up there and bringing it down here, and I am ahead of the game,'' he said. ''Why not move someplace where my dollar goes further and I am surrounded by beauty instead of cars and smog?''

Cashing Out
 For some who have built up equity in their homes, the sky-high real estate market has made it seem to be a good time to sell and move away.
 Lawrence Paul Finn, the director of corporate services and relocation at Coach Realtors in Northport, said that last year his firm helped 200 families relocate, including about 45 to Florida and others to Virginia and North and South Carolina. 
 ''Their homes have appreciated so much the last six to seven years, they have acquired hundreds of thousands in equity,'' he said. ''They are cashing out. It only makes sense.''
 Liz Wallace, a broker at Century 21 Sherlock Homes in Rockville Centre, said many Long Islanders were choosing the active lives and different values that Nevada offers. Tony and May Martucci bought their house in Rockville Centre in 1974. Wanting to cash out and retire, they sold it in July 2003, fetching nearly a half-million dollars. Their new home in Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas, cost $263,000.
 ''Real estate was so high on Long Island, it was a little bit obscene,'' Mr. Martucci said by telephone. ''It's much cheaper to live here.''
 Mr. Martucci, 60, said he paid more than $8,000 in taxes on a modest Cape Cod in Rockville Centre that measured less than 1,500 square feet. Their new house has 2,600 square feet, three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a swimming pool and a hot tub. Taxes are $2,200. The house sits on a 100-by-170-foot lot in the foothills; their Rockville Centre house occupied a flat 60-by-100 lot.
 ''We overlook everything,'' Mr. Martucci said, describing his view of Spring Mountain, Red Rock Canyon and snowcapped mountains. ''Las Vegas offered us a beautiful climate. July and August it gets to be 110, but it's only two months.'' 
 The Martuccis first visited Las Vegas on their honeymoon 31 years ago and had returned a few times a year ever since. Mr. Martucci said he enjoys the gambling and entertainment. ''The Strip is like a version of Manhattan,'' he said, ticking off the New York restaurants like Il Mulino, Le Cirque and the Palm that have Las Vegas branches. ''We are there in 10 minutes.'' 
 Besides, they are living better for less. Nevada has no state income tax. 
 Working from home, Mrs. Martucci, 57, kept her job at an Oceanside travel agency. Her biggest concern about moving to Nevada was being far from the beach. She frequented Jones Beach and Long Beach and kept a cabana at the Sands, a beach club in Lido Beach, for many years.
 ''I miss it a lot, but we have an in-ground pool with a spa in our home,'' she said. ''Missing the ocean is minute compared to the trade-off. You don't have to put up with the bridges, the tolls, the traffic. The L.I.E., I don't miss that one iota. It's just an easier way of life.''
 With a clubhouse, boccie, bowling teams and two golf courses in her Henderson neighborhood, she said, it was also friendlier. ''I know more of my neighbors here than I did in 31 years in New York,'' she said. 
 Now they drive three and a half hours to beaches in Santa Barbara and Malibu, Calif., or an hour to Lake Mead. ''My wife gets her water fix there,'' Mr. Martucci said. 

Looking Back
 Others can't totally let go. 
 Robert Carman, 75, a tugboat operator and fourth-generation fisherman, has deep roots on the Island. Carman Street in Freeport was named for his grandfather Will Carman, who in 1920 bought the Selnada, a 90-passenger party boat that sailed out of Woodcleft Canal for decades. His father, Mort, was a rumrunner during Prohibition.
 But Mr. Carman and his wife, Lois, a retired teacher, are pulling up stakes. As each area became more densely populated, the Carmans moved from Freeport to Smithtown and then, 12 years ago, to Hampton Bays. Six years ago, they bought a house in Stuart, Fla., and became snowbirds. Then six months ago they sold their East End home and moved to Florida full time.
 ''I would have liked to spend my whole life on Long Island, but my family came down here,'' Mr. Carman said. 
 His daughter, Laura Gregory, looking for less expensive living and a nicer climate for her children, left Mount Sinai for a job as a nurse in Florida about a dozen years ago; a son, Roger, moved to Florida around the same time and went into yacht sales. Another son, Will, recently sold his home in Montauk and is preparing to move to Florida this month to work as a boat mechanic. 
 ''He was the lobsterman, and there are no more lobstermen,'' Mr. Carman said. ''He fishes a little bit, and he clams a little bit, and he has four children and he can't survive on Long Island.'' 
 Mr. Carman said he held on to both houses as long as he could. When he had to choose, the Island lost out. ''Taxes were too high,'' he said. ''They were creeping up every year.'' 
 In Florida, he said, the restaurants are cheaper. But he misses being able to cook Long Island clams.
 ''I used to rake them or tread them myself right out in Hampton Bays,'' Mr. Carman said. 
 He weighed the trade-off: the fishing in Florida is superb, activities for older people are plentiful, and the balmy winters are easy. His grandchildren can play outdoors year round. The ball fields are pristine and landscaped with palm trees and flowers. 
 ''They were playing in a potato field,'' he said, referring to Long Island. ''It was a little dumpy field.''
 When he's not fishing, Mr. Carman serves as captain of a private yacht, ferrying it from Florida to Long Island. But as the weather warms, he yearns to return to the Island full time.
 ''Long Island is paradise in the summertime,'' said Mr. Carman, who hopes to rent a house on the East End. ''I wouldn't want to be anyplace else. I will be back.''

HEADLINE: Cosmetic Surgery Central

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
EVERY morning when she looked in the mirror, June Fisher, a personal trainer from Bellmore, was dismayed. Her eyes were drooping and asymmetrical, and her jowls sagged. She looked tired. 
 ''I didn't photograph well,'' she said. ''Everything was hanging.''
 Her face seemed worn, but at 52, she felt much younger than she looked. 
 When her son, Matthew, 27, announced his plans to be married in May, Ms. Fisher decided it was time to do something. 
 Ms. Fisher headed to what may be the Island's own fountain of youth. At a comfortably elegant mahogany- and marble-trimmed office on Northern Boulevard in Great Neck, Ms. Fisher went to see Dr. Lyle S. Leipziger, the chief of the division of plastic surgery at North Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center. The surgery he performed smoothed her brow, tucked her chin, contoured her eyelids and lifted her face. 
 ''I look like me, refreshed,'' Ms. Fisher said the other day. She gleefully compared her face, three months after the operation, with a photograph of herself at age 28.
 ''I don't think you can put an age on it,'' she said, hinting that she was ready to have a breast lift and liposuction on her belly. ''It's how you perceive yourself and how you feel when you are out there.''
 Ensconced along Northern Boulevard in the northwestern sliver of the Gold Coast are 26 board-certified plastic surgeons, more than in the entire state of Iowa, ready to rejuvenate faces and bodies with lifts, nips and tucks.
 Adding to the flock of turn-the-clock-back specialists are 17 dermatologists, who may offer anti-aging laser treatments, hair transplantation and varicose vein removal. Another two dozen ear, nose and throat specialists may plump lips, straighten noses and lift brows. Several of the offices have their own operating and recovery rooms. 
 ''It's become the Park Avenue of Long Island, especially with the Americana's Madison Avenue shops down the street,'' Dr. Leipziger said. ''There used to be a perception that there was better medicine in Manhattan, and that's definitely not the case any longer. Many top doctors choose to practice on Long Island.'' 
 Dr. Alan Gold, 58, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Great Neck, began his career in plastic surgery in 1978 in Mineola and later, Garden City, in an office founded in 1948 by two doctors who had practiced in Manhattan. 
 ''They were told they were absolutely insane because no one would ever either live on Long Island because it was so provincial at that time and certainly no one would ever go to Long Island for plastic surgery,'' Dr. Gold said. 
 But in the 1990's, fancy office buildings began to pop up along Northern Boulevard. In 1999, Dr. Gold left the plastic surgery group he was managing in Garden City and pumped more than a half-million dollars into his own high-end aesthetic plastic surgery office with a private surgical suite on Northern Boulevard that looks like ''Extreme Makeover'' meets Versailles. 
 ''It is not uncommon in my practice is to see patients who have seen physicians in Manhattan and myself in consultation,'' Dr. Gold said. 
 According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the number of surgical and nonsurgical cosmetic procedures in the United States increased by 44 percent last year to a total of nearly 11.9 million. Botox injections were the most frequently performed procedures; liposuction was the No.1 surgical procedure. 
 To meet the demand, Dr. Leipziger sees 25 to 30 patients on the days he has office hours and operates two or three days a week. ''My own practice has definitely increased each year over the last five years,'' said Dr. Leipziger, 45. ''It's definitely more than I would have anticipated.'' 
 While the majority of his practice is aesthetic plastic surgery, he is also a cranio-facial specialist and performs reconstructive surgery. He said that when he started 13 years ago, reconstructive surgery constituted 75 percent of his practice; now 75 to 80 percent is cosmetic surgery. 
 ''People want to look as good on the outside as they feel on the inside,'' he said. ''Fifty is the new 40, and 40 is the new 30.'' 
 In the mid-1990's, Jeannette Sabatelli, a retired bank vice president from Garden City, went to Dr. Joseph Feinberg for a mini face lift. When her son was married last year, she had an extra nip and tuck to tighten her face. A month ago, she went back to his office for a shot of Botox in her forehead. 
 ''It builds your self-esteem,'' Ms. Sabatelli said. ''You take a woman that's 60 that looks like me and another woman that's 60 and doesn't take care of herself, she looks like my grandmother, and I am not going to look like that.''
 When Dr. Feinberg, 57, opened his plastic surgery practice on Northern Boulevard in Manhasset 25 years ago, most of the office buildings on Spinney Hill didn't exist. At the time, Dr. Feinberg also had an office on Park Avenue.
 ''In my practice a lot of people that were going to the city 10 or 15 years ago are not going to the city anymore,'' Dr. Feinberg said.
 He estimated that 60 to 70 percent of his patients come from the North Shore; others come from Manhattan, Connecticut, New Jersey or fly in from the Dominican Republic.
 ''It's not like people go to their internist,'' Dr. Feinberg said. ''It's a much wider range.''
 Initially his practice was mainly reconstructive. Now it is 75 to 80 percent cosmetic. 
 ''I don't have to sell the surgery,'' Dr. Feinberg said. ''I spend most of my time telling them what they can't do.''
 Dr. Feinberg said the swell in the number of plastic surgeons on the North Shore ''followed the economic demographics.''
 ''People go where the money is in terms of cosmetic surgery,'' he said. 
 But some of the increasing popularity of plastic surgery may be because it is more accepted. 
 Dr. Gold says cosmetic surgery, which is not covered by health insurance, is no longer limited to wealthy patients. ''It is within reach of your average middle-income patient,'' he said. ''It is just a matter of where they decide to put their money. Instead of a vacation, they will have their nose done.''
 For three years, Lisa Kontogiannis, 29, of Brookville, a mortgage banker and the owner of a television and radio production company, kept putting on weight until she wore size 24. Then after going through a divorce, she lost 120 pounds. 
 ''No matter how much exercise I did, my body wouldn't go back to the way it was before,'' Ms. Kontogiannis said. Two years ago she went to Dr. Leipziger for a body lift. She went in a size 14 and after a 360-degree abdominoplasty -- in other words, a huge tummy tuck -- she came out a size 8.
 ''I'm like a completely different person,'' she said. ''I haven't changed mentally or emotionally but as a physical appearance. I enjoy getting dressed for work. I'm happy with the way clothes look on me. No matter what I did I couldn't hide that bulging.''
 Wendy Shapiro, 49, the mother of three children from Great Neck, had an eye lift three years ago after breast reconstruction. She visits Dr. Leipziger's office every four months for Botox injections in her forehead and Restylane shots from the sides of her nose to her mouth. Ms. Shapiro also goes to a cosmetic dermatologist monthly for glycolic peels to remove the fine lines from her face. 
 ''It's called fighting the inevitable,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ''When you start to see the effects of the aging, at least you can soften it and still be youthful-looking.''
 Ms. Shapiro said most of her friends were undergoing some sort of cosmetic procedures. ''Some don't want to say anything, but we all can't look this good after a certain age without doing something,'' she said. ''At this age, you have older parents, and you have young kids, so you are sandwiched in between the two, and you see what's around the corner, and it's a little depressing. You want to keep that youthful glow as long as you can.''
 Ms. Shapiro said her cosmetic treatments weren't simply an indulgence. ''It is costly, but for me it is a necessity, mentally,'' she said. 
 Dr. Leipziger said there was nothing wrong with vanity in moderation. ''Cosmetic concerns are not frivolous and self-indulgent if they create a problem for the patient,'' he said. 
 Perhaps no patient is more self-conscious than a teenage girl, and plastic surgeons are seeing more of them every year.
 Alana Gross of Great Neck is 15 and didn't like the bump on her nose. After consulting with a plastic surgeon on Park Avenue, Alana went to Dr. Gold for an $8,500 nose job. The rhinoplasty would smooth her profile and narrow the point and bridge of her nose, Dr. Gold said. 
 ''I will feel better about myself,'' Alana said shortly before the surgery began. She smiled as she lay down on the operating table. ''I won't be as self-conscious when I am seen from the side,'' she said.
 On Tuesday, the bandages were removed. ''She looks great,'' said her mother, Betty Gross, who underwent similar surgery 30 years ago.

HEADLINE: Your Town Is Not the Worst Place on Earth to Buy Groceries

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
PUSHING a shopping cart through the parking lot of a Waldbaum's on East Broadway in Long Beach, Christopher Swanson said staples cost more in Long Beach than elsewhere on the Island. ''And gas costs more here, too,'' he said, rolling his eyes.
 His answer was typical. Ask a Long Islander about the cost of a visit to the supermarket or gas station, and chances are the answer will be an indignant claim that prices are higher in the respondent's hometown than they are anywhere else on the Island or, for that matter, anywhere else in the galaxy. 
 Another popular notion is that supermarkets and gas stations charge higher prices in more-affluent or isolated communities than those in poorer or more densely populated areas. 
 A March 22 price comparison in nine communities across Nassau and Suffolk counties found no correlation between supermarket prices and local income levels. Though it did show that consumers in some neighborhoods pay more for some popular grocery items than in others, no pattern emerged. But the survey found that the highest price for a gallon of unleaded regular was exactly where it would be expected to be: in the Hamptons.
 The total cost, before taxes, of a grocery cart of 20 typical items at the Waldbaum's where Mr. Swanson said he frequently shops was $74.04, roughly in the middle of the stores surveyed, which ranged from $79.23 at a Pathmark on Sunrise Highway in Holbrook down to $66.91 at a Super Stop & Shop on Fulton Avenue in Hempstead.
 Same for gasoline. A Mobil station at the intersection of Long Beach Road and East Park Avenue in Long Beach was charging $2.199 for a gallon of unleaded gas that day, close to average for the nine stations polled around the Island.
 ''Prices are definitely higher here,'' said Susan Marchese, a chiropractor who lives in East Hampton. ''I certainly see a difference when I shop just a little bit west.'' Loading groceries into her car at the Waldbaum's on Newtown Lane in East Hampton, she said she sometimes shops near her office in Southampton or in Riverhead because she thought the prices are lower there.
 But that same typical cart of groceries cost $72.37 in East Hampton, $6.86 less than in Holbrook, which is far less affluent, and just 59 cents more than at a Waldbaum's on Route 58 in blue-collar Riverhead.
 Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said there's a reason shoppers think prices are higher close to home. They tend to shop nearby when buying staples; as inflation drives up prices all across the Island -- about 4.5 percent over the past year -- they falsely assume it's happening just in their own neighborhood, Dr. Kamer said.
 She said that chain supermarkets, such as King Kullen, Waldbaum's and Pathmark, tend to operate on profit margins as tight as 0.5 percent, so their shelf prices are often a matter of corporate policy. Three of the nine markets sampled on March 22 were part of the Waldbaum's chain; they had the same prices for 11 of the 20 items. She said other factors include the level of competition from nearby markets and the neighborhood's purchasing power.
 While a few shoppers in the locations surveyed said they shrug off the cost of visiting their neighborhood supermarket and gas station as simply the price of convenience, others described a labor-intensive hunt for bargains that involves perusing the Sunday papers for sales, clipping coupons, comparison shopping, driving far from home and buying in bulk at discount warehouses.
 Mary Herrmann, who lives in Greenport and was shopping with her daughter, Angela Jacobi, at the King Kullen on Main Road in Cutchogue, contended that grocery prices on the North Fork are higher by half than those in western Suffolk. But the market-basket price at the Cutchogue King Kullen was $72.21, which means the Cutchogue King Kullen is doing better than Mary Herrmann thinks. It was $1.24 cheaper than the Islandwide average, which was $73.45. 
 Ms. Jacobi said she shops at BJ's, a discount warehouse in Riverhead, for bulk items such as diapers. Her mother said she had little need and not enough storage space for a case of paper towels whose bulk approaches that of a Volkswagen.
 Still, Ms. Jacobi acknowledged, the extra half-hour drive to Riverhead eats up in gas some of her savings on groceries. To try to make up for it, she buys gas in Riverhead, too, where she claimed prices tend to run 10 to 13 cents cheaper. ''I have a feeling that I'm not saving anything in the long run,'' she said, sighing deeply.
 In fact, a Gas-N-Go station on Main Road in Cutchogue was charging $2.159 for a gallon of regular unleaded gas, just two cents more than at an Empire Station on Route 58 in Riverhead.
 Among the gas stations surveyed, the highest price was at a Getty station on North Main Street in East Hampton, where a gallon of regular went for $2.459 on March 22. On the same day, the Garden City-based Automobile Club of New York calculated that the average price for regular on Long Island was $2.128 and the national average was $2.095.
 At eight other stations scattered around Nassau and Suffolk, the prices ranged downward from $2.199. Finding a bargain would have meant driving a long distance, and burning gas in the process, for many Long Islanders; an Amoco station on Straight Path in Wyandanch displayed the lowest price, $2.049 per gallon.
 Robert Sinclair, the spokesman for the Automobile Club, said he was not surprised at the broad disparity between the Hamptons and points west. Gasoline arrives in New York by barge and is often trucked the length of Long Island; the longer the road trip, the higher the price, he said.
 ''Then there's the idea of zone pricing, where prices are based on a number of factors, like the affluence of the community and proximity to major roadways,'' he said. For example, he said, prices tend to be higher on Long Island Expressway service roads, which border some of the Island's poorer communities.
 But a Mobil station on the service road of Sunrise Highway, near the Sun-Vet Mall in Holbrook, was charging $2.179 a gallon. On the same day, that was 2 cents less than at a Gulf station on South Street in downtown Oyster Bay, a far less heavily traveled route.
 ''We've found that a wide range of factors contribute to the diversity in gas prices, but it's still interesting how stations of the same brand within a quarter-mile of each other will have an 8- or 10-cent difference,'' Mr. Sinclair said.
 Kathryn Odessa, director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association, based in Melville, said station owners tell her that their prices are determined largely by what oil companies charge them, and the oil companies tell her that they do rely on zone pricing.
 ''It costs more to deliver to the Hamptons than to Wyandanch,'' she said. ''But in other cases, the prices seem to make no sense at all. It looks like some stations are in a zone all by themselves and it becomes really hard to determine why they charge more.''
 The Automobile Club, which tracks gas prices and motoring trends, recently released the results of a survey on rising gas prices. Asked whether they were planning to alter their driving habits to save money, 43 percent of drivers said they already had.
 ''That was in marked contrast to a survey we did a couple of years ago where consumers said prices would have to hit $3 a gallon for some concessions to be made,'' he said.
 While topping off his meticulously clean 2003 Nissan Xterra with premium gasoline, Evaristo Fuentes said he often comparison shops during the three-mile commute from his job in Garden City to his home in Hempstead. On March 22, a Tuesday, he refueled at a BP station on Clinton Street near his home because it advertised a 5-cent ''Super Tuesday'' discount. After the discount, premium was selling that day for $2.249.
 Asked whether he thought gas and grocery prices in his neighborhood had risen too high, he just shrugged. ''I have to go to work,'' he said. ''I have to eat.''

HEADLINE: An Infusion of Energy in Yale's Backyard

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DOWNTOWN New Haven has been transformed over the last five years from Yale's mundane backyard into a vibrant neighborhood of shops, theaters and restaurants. In 1999, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. decided to take a chance on energizing the city's stagnant economy by capitalizing on its theaters, symphony orchestras, art galleries, ballet company, museums and the presence and participation of the university. But it needed new, attractive housing and an infusion of businesses and shops.
 With $30 million in seed money from the state, the city began restoring housing stock. Developers took notice and largely financed the more than 1,300 apartments and condominiums built downtown to date. Some are new construction, and many are reconfigured from office and industrial buildings, resulting in a preponderance of rental units. Condo conversions are beginning to take place. Yale has spawned 40 biotechnology firms and invested $100 million in upgrading retail and commercial properties adjacent to its campus. Entrepreneurs were encouraged to do the rest. 
 Today, a population of more than 5,000 inhabits the roughly 50 square blocks of downtown New Haven (excluding Yale students and including the four-square-block New Haven Green). With median two-bedroom condo prices at around $280,000 and median two-bedroom rents at $995, the current catchphrase is, ''If you can't afford New York, come to New Haven.'' 
 But the newest and best condos and apartments start in the high $300,000 range, rents start at $1,200, and prices are being pushed higher by a vacancy rate under 5 percent and by multiple bids. 
 Weekend foot traffic is heavy on Temple, Crown, Chapel, and College Streets, with shoppers, diners, theatergoers and museumgoers. It is possible to dine out downtown for 123 evenings without a repeat visit at restaurants catering to the tastes of a polyglot population.
 Lauren Fikslim, an account executive for Clear Channel Radio, took a one-bedroom apartment at 65 Dwight Street last June after graduating from Quinnipiac University. ''I love it,'' she said. ''There are lots of Yale grads here. It's such a friendly community; it's a Melrose Place. The building is like a small campus, with gardens and places to sit.'' She pays $950 a month for 650 square feet.
 Nelly Odenwaelder, a senior vice president at H. Pearce Real Estate, said Ms. Fikslim is typical of the influx of young singles, but she noted: ''We're seeing foreign populations growing by leaps and bounds. It's partly because of Yale -- we have so many people from all parts of the world either attending the university or working for it. We're also seeing more professionals looking to live closer to where they work and socialize, and there's a good proportion of older people moving in.''
 Hank and Sharon Putsch (pronounced like Dutch) recently sold their house on the river in Old Saybrook. ''It was beautiful but kind of boring,'' Mrs. Putsch said. ''We really need the energy of the city.'' They are both artists and arts administrators ''in our 60's and 70's,'' she said. ''We couldn't afford New York so we came to New Haven.'' They bought a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath town house at Audubon Court on Audubon Street for $290,000, ''reduced from $350,000 because it had been occupied previously by two Yale football players,'' she said. 
 Other attractions on Audubon Street are the Educational Center for the Arts, the Creative Arts Workshop, the New Haven Symphony Orchestra headquarters, the Arts Council of Greater New Haven, the New Haven Ballet and the Neighborhood Music School. The New Haven Symphony Orchestra and a star-studded roster of musicians from opera, the concert stage and jazz appear regularly at Yale's Woolsey Hall and Sprague Hall. 
 Independent of Yale, the Shubert Theater, where Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals of the 40's and 50's had their tryouts, now houses Broadway shows on tour. Foreign and independent films are shown at the York Square Cinema, and the new five-screen Criterion shows first-run movies. There are 10 bookstores to browse, 31 nonchain clothing stores and 14 grocers and specialty food stores. No one seems to miss a supermarket. 
 Gateway Community College will be moving downtown from Sargent Drive and North Haven, occupying two blocks on Church Street where Malley's department store once stood and where a Macy's store is slated for demolition. The Long Wharf regional theater will also be moving from Sargent Drive off Interstate 95 to Orange Street, close to the restaurant district. Completion of the two projects will take about five years. 
 Some 19th and early 20th century homes are being privately restored, reviving charming old mini-neighborhoods. Dr. Linda Jarvin, a research psychologist at Yale, and her husband, Marco Lubrano, both in their early 30's, lived in New Haven in 1998. ''I hated it,'' she said. ''It was different from what I was used to. There was nothing to do. We moved to New York although I was still working at Yale, but New Haven really started to change, and I realized that my quality of life would be so much better if I lived here.''
 Last summer they bought a four-story brownstone row house on Court Street for $340,000, and spent $100,000 more on renovations. 
 ''New single-family houses are not being built and those that are left are hard to come by,'' said Vincent Engingro, owner-broker at Coldwell Banker. ''Many of them have become two- and three-family Victorians and colonials that used to sell based on the rental income. Now buyers are paying over the asking price with multiple bids.'' 
 Mr. Engingro is marketing new 1,400-square-foot lofts in former industrial buildings with huge windows, open floor plans, hardwood floors and one or two bathrooms, renting for $1,400 to $1,600 a month. 
 A studio is available for $1,245 at the Eli, an elegant conversion of the former Southern New England Telephone Building on Church Street, where one-bedroom apartments are $1,495 and $1,600, and three-bedrooms are $3,320. Every apartment has cherry cabinets, 10-foot ceilings, cast-iron bathtubs and a washer and dryer. Other apartments at the Liberty on Temple Street rent for $855 to $1,265, and the Residence on the Green charges $1,000 to $1,750. 
 While downtown attracts singles and couples, there are also families with children who can choose Timothy Dwight School, a downtown neighborhood school for kindergarten to Grade 4, or one of the magnet schools. Three are downtown. Of the city's 49 public schools; 20 are magnet elementary, middle or high schools, where students enroll according to their special interests, aptitudes and ability to learn. Thirty percent of the city's 21,000 children attend magnet schools along with 1,200 students from 24 other towns, resulting in lots of busing.
 Each magnet school features a particular discipline or educational philosophy, combining intensive study in the area of choice -- such as technology or leadership -- combined with a core curriculum. For all 12 high schools in the city, SAT scores of 415 verbal and 402 math are about 100 points below Connecticut and national scores, partly because of the 50 languages spoken. 
 The full-time Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School has a college preparatory academic program and advanced placement combined with a full array of performing, literary and visual arts. All magnet schools operate in partnership with Yale, Southern Connecticut State University, other colleges in the area, various arts organizations, hospitals, banks, theaters or other sources of hands-on learning. 
 A number of architects, including Cesar Pelli, are involved in the city's $1.2 billion construction and renovation program for all public schools. Mr. Pelli was dean of the Yale School of Architecture from 1977 to 1985, and continues to keep offices of on the second floor of 1056 Chapel Street in downtown New Haven. 
 He is designing a new Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School, a magnet school, to be relocated from Orange Street to College Street downtown. He is better known for the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, Canary Wharf in London and the World Financial Center in Manhattan.

What Not to Miss
 Downtown New Haven may have 123 places to eat, but caffeAdulis, at 228 College Street, is the only one serving Eritrean cuisine. Some dishes, served on soft sourdough plates without utensils, are named after Yale professors.

HEADLINE: Dollar's Rise Doesn't Lift All Boats

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE recent surge in oil prices and interest rates has tripped up more than the American stock market. 
 Emerging stock markets jumped 22.5 percent last year in dollar terms and were up 8.6 percent this year through Feb. 28. But by the end of the first quarter that gain had been trimmed to just 1.2 percent. 
 Since Feb. 9, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has jumped almost half a percentage point from its 2005 low, to 4.45 percent. And the price of crude oil has risen 26 percent, to a record $57.27 a barrel.
 American investors owning emerging-market stocks have been hurt by the decline in the value of the stocks and by the rebound of the dollar, especially last month. In March, the dollar rose in value against 16 of the 26 currencies represented in the Morgan Stanley Capital International emerging-market index, including a 7.4 percent surge against the South African rand and a 6.8 percent rise against the Polish zloty.
 The dollar's climb, which reduces the value of investments abroad when they are brought back home, cut the overall gains for Americans in emerging markets by half. In local currencies, the M.S.C.I. emerging-market index is up 2.4 percent through March, compared with the 1.2 percent gain in dollar terms.
 The big emerging-market losers were in the M.S.C.I. region called Europe, Middle East and Africa. As a region, it was down 1 percent in dollar terms through March, compared with a positive 4.4 percent return in local currencies. That was a rude awakening for Americans who were betting on a bonus from a weakening dollar.
 South African stocks had the biggest swing in returns, with the market up 1.7 percent in rands and down 7.9 percent in dollars. In Poland, the swing was from a gain of 4.7 percent to a loss of 0.2 percent.
 Not all European emerging markets did poorly. In Hungary, the local return was a spectacular 17.1 percent, although that was trimmed by a stronger dollar to 11.3 percent. In dollar terms, the Czech Republic rose 11.1 percent and Russia 4.9 percent. 
 Asian emerging markets also performed well, partly because the dollar fell against some currencies. In local currencies, the average gain was 1.4 percent; in dollar terms it was 2.1 percent. The weaker dollar contributed to gains of 9.7 percent in South Korea and 8.6 percent in the Philippines. It trimmed the loss in Taiwan to 3.4 percent.
 The decline since February in emerging markets has sent investors to the exits. In the two weeks ended Wednesday, total net outflow from mutual funds investing in emerging-market stocks was $562 million, the biggest drain on these funds since last May, according to AMG Data Services.
 Last year, the M.S.C.I. emerging market index dropped 20.4 percent from April 12 to May 19. During the last four weeks of that sell-off, $1.93 billion poured out of these funds. The index rebounded from that loss by Nov 12. But investors missed a lot of the rally because only $1.96 billion had flowed back into emerging-market stock funds by the week ended Nov. 17.

DATA WATCH -- No major economic reports are scheduled this week..

HEADLINE: The Murakami Method

BYLINE: By Arthur Lubow. 
Arthur Lubow, a contributing writer for the magazine, last wrote about Beck.

 BODY:
At the Mori Arts Center, which is perched atop a skyscraper in the glittering Roppongi Hills development in Tokyo, I recently visited a museum show, ''Universal Symbol of the Brand,'' that displayed (to quote its catalog) ''the fascinating development of the history and endeavors of Louis Vuitton, the brand that is not only incredibly popular in Japan but also beloved throughout the world.'' A sequence of galleries exhibiting luggage and handbags proceeded to a large advertising photograph of the actress Uma Thurman and smaller shots of runway models, all wearing Vuitton fashions. What drew me to the show, however, were two bags in the variation of the Vuitton pattern that the Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami developed with the company in 2003. The brightly colored Murakami line has been phenomenally successful, with sales reported to be in the vicinity of $300 million. Murakami's handbags were presented along with two small paneled screens painted in the same patterns that appear on the bags. 
 The handbags in the museum exhibition were hardly Murakami's only contribution to the Roppongi Hills complex of glass-and-steel towers. Cute cartoonlike characters that he had created as branding elements for the center -- Barney-like brontosaurs, droopy-eared rabbits and smiling aliens -- grinned down on me from pennants and from express buses to Roppongi Hills. In the same development, at a large Vuitton store, new handbags in a cherry design by Murakami would soon be introduced, along with a couple of the artist's sculptures of a red, smiling cherry. Last year at another Vuitton shop in Tokyo, Murakami displayed a large fiberglass sculpture and a four-panel screen painted in his LV monogram design.
 So, in Tokyo, an art museum was displaying luggage, a luggage shop was exhibiting art, an artist had developed a branding campaign -- and nobody thought anything out of the ordinary. If you want to understand why Murakami's art feels so dizzyingly up to date, this leveling of status grades among art, advertising and merchandise at Roppongi Hills is a good place to start. When I asked Tomio Koyama, Murakami's dealer in Tokyo, why he hadn't shown the monogram work in his gallery, he explained, ''In Japan, a gallery has no meaning, and a Louis Vuitton shop is a more powerful place to see something.'' The Tokyo art critic Noi Sawaragi, who was a crucial early supporter of Murakami and a peer, told me that I was imposing distinctions that no Japanese would make. ''This back and forth doesn't seem unnatural to us,'' he said. ''We have had a long history of museums with department stores as a venue. It was thanks to the Seibu Museum, which no longer exists on the 12th floor of the Seibu department store, that I developed my knowledge of contemporary art. I saw Marcel Duchamp, Malevich and Man Ray in depth for the first time in that museum. I think it is the same for everyone of my generation. Downstairs you find dresses, bags and shoes, but on the 12th floor you find art.'' Indeed, it is one of Murakami's dearly held tenets that demarcations between fine art and popular merchandise are completely un-Japanese. The Japanese language didn't even have a word for ''fine art'' in 1868, when Japan embraced the West in the Meiji Restoration; only afterward did the country import this foreign ''art'' notion and create a vocabulary for it. The blurring of high and low remains characteristic of Japanese society.
 In his own career, Murakami has moved frictionlessly among his multiple roles as artist, curator, theorist, product designer, businessman and celebrity. Ever since a Chicago collector paid $567,500 at auction in 2003 for his fiberglass sculpture of a long-legged waitress, Murakami, now 43, has held the price record for a work by a contemporary Japanese artist. Meanwhile, his monumental sculptures and silk-screened balloons of original cartoon characters, displayed in 2001 at Grand Central Terminal and in 2003 at Rockefeller Center, have made him conspicuous in New York. More than anyone else, he has put modern Japan on the map of the contemporary art world. ''He's a phenomenon, that's for sure,'' said Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. ''I think that his work embodies some interests that extend far beyond Japan. It's a blend of fantasy and apocalypse and innocence. It's all the disparate elements combined that speak to the moment. And it's the way that he's worked as much as the work itself -- in the public realm with public sculpture, huge editions of objects, merchandising, working collaboratively. It's a very ambitious and far-ranging project.''
 While best known as an artist, Murakami may be even more interesting as a thinker. Five years ago he elaborated a theory under the clever rubric ''Superflat,'' linking the flat picture planes of traditional Japanese paintings to the lack of any distinction between high and low in Japanese culture. On stylistic grounds he grouped together some traditional artists of the Edo period (1603-1868) with the creators of modern-day animated films, arguing that there were important formal similarities in the flatness of their work. Now, having analyzed Japanese pop culture aesthetically, he is turning his scrutiny to the function that superflatness might be serving in contemporary Japanese society. As the curator of an exhibition, ''Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture,'' which opens this week at the Japan Society in New York, he surveys the geeky movement, known as otaku, that revolves around animated movies (anime), comic books (manga) and sexually suggestive figure models -- and arrives at a provocative conclusion. Murakami maintains that respectable Japanese artists largely ignored the horrors of World War II and the humiliations of the postwar occupation, relinquishing the subjects to the otaku, who transported these tough realities into the realm of cartoon fantasy. In childlike animated forms, anguished truths were stripped of their historical context // a flattening process that conveniently released both the artist and the viewer from grappling with the contradictions of Japan's wartime experience as predator and victim and postwar status as economic rival of, and political subordinate to, the United States.
 Flat, colorful and rootless, the images of this popular subculture - the blank-faced Hello Kitty, the mutant monster Godzilla, the giant alien Ultraman, the cat-shaped guardian robot Doraemon -- line up in no particular order, like icons on a computer screen. This cavalcade of weightless images in turn reverberates with contemporary viewers worldwide: anime and manga have become global signifiers of cool. Historically, to be sure, Japan is unique. Until a century and a half ago it was a society shut off from most of the world, and then, with gigantic gulps, it absorbed and adapted whatever it wanted, mostly from Europe, in an accelerated binge. The orgy ended with the catastrophe of World War II, after which Japan once again slammed the door on the past and started fresh with new, mostly American models. The grab-bag appropriation, inexact simulation and accelerated speed that characterize this process no longer appear peculiarly Japanese. They feel now. We live in an age when distinctions are arbitrary, originality is devalued, hierarchies are discredited and authenticity seems meaningless. Barely 40 years ago, Pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein caused a transgressive stir by adopting commercial imagery from newspaper advertisements and comic strips as the subjects of paintings to hang in art galleries. How daring that was, and how dated it is. We are surrounded today by too many images to source or rank. While it would be fatuous to say that we are all Japanese now, we are surely all living in Murakami's world.
At 8:50 every weekday morning, unless he is not in Tokyo, Murakami leads the staff of his art studio, Kaikai Kiki Company Ltd., in a round of calisthenics. Then the employees go off to their various jobs: refining sketches on the computer, daubing paint meticulously onto paintings and sculptures, fielding requests for commercial tie-ins or press interviews with their boss, negotiating licenses and other business contracts or coordinating with the branch office in Brooklyn. Warhol famously called his studio in Manhattan ''the Factory,'' but that was a joke; although silk-screened images of flowers and Brillo boxes did flow out of it, the silver-walled, amphetamine-pumped clubhouse -- with its entertainments, intrigues and exquisite costumes -- resembled an 18th-century court in Versailles more than it did an auto plant. Yet it's no joke to call Kaikai Kiki a factory. Murakami's 60 employees punch in with computerized timecards, and the company has training manuals for new hires. The hours are regular -- and long. One daily ritual is the question-and-answer period, in which staff members book a slot of specified duration to ask the chief a question; when I attended, 14 had requested interviews, typically of two minutes each.
 The Kaikai Kiki factory complex is situated in a drab suburban district an hour from central Tokyo. One of the little buildings, without toilet or bath, is Murakami's home, in which a sleeping bag serves as a bed. Next to the shed that houses Murakami is an even smaller one that houses potted cactuses. Hybridizing cactus from seed is Murakami's hobby, one for which he has little time. Apparently he has no time for romantic or family attachments, either. ''He makes art and sleeps,'' said Dana Friis-Hansen, executive director of the Austin Museum of Art in Texas and co-curator of a 1998 Murakami exhibition at Bard College in New York. ''Some curators are really frustrated, because he'll ask for and usually get the right to sleep in the gallery while he is setting up. He'll bring assistants and sleeping bags, and they'll cook noodles there.''
 The son of a taxi driver and a housewife, Murakami grew up in Tokyo, then attended Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music, the country's most prestigious arts institution. He holds a Ph.D. in nihonga -- the refined hybrid of European and traditional Japanese painting that was invented in the late 19th century. Nihonga, in which traditional resins and pigments are employed to render likenesses of bouquets and landscapes, is a rarefied branch of present-day Japanese art. All the time he was practicing it, Murakami said, he wished instead that he had the talent to draw the manga and anime of otaku culture.
 The word ''otaku'' is usually translated as ''geek'' or ''nerd,'' but its more precise meaning is steeped in the particularities of Japanese society and language. Literally, the word means ''your household.'' It is a way to refer to another person in conversation without implying either superior or lesser social status. Employed by postwar Japanese housewives, the usage was adopted by the fans -- all right, call them geeks -- who became obsessed with the minutiae of a particular bit of popular culture. Isolated in their individual homes, these youths shared a passion for the television programming -- ''Astro Boy,'' ''Ultraman'' and so forth -- that expanded rapidly in the 1960's. They organized around their fetishistic fascinations to form otaku subcultures, whose members come together periodically in large conventions to discuss, exhibit and trade the objects of their highly focused affections.
 The typical otaku is a young male, and some of the manga and the plastic figures are explicitly sexual, often blatantly pedophiliac; even when they aren't, the otaku tends to relate to his collection, with caresses and ministrations, as to a girlfriend -- if he had a girlfriend. (A Web-site message board heavily frequented by otaku was known as ''The number of years I have not had a girlfriend is the same as my age.'') In its defiance of the mores of proper Japanese society, otaku culture was disreputable from the outset. It became much more so following a notorious criminal case in 1989, when an otaku named Tsutomu Miyazaki was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of four preadolescent girls. ''When Miyazaki's room was revealed to the public, the mass media announced that it was otaku space,'' Murakami once told an interviewer. ''However, it was just like my room. Actually, my mother was very surprised to see his room and said: 'His room is like yours. Are you O.K.?' Of course, I was O.K. In fact, all of my friends' rooms were similar to his, too.'' Murakami added that Miyazaki was only ''different from us'' because he ''videotaped dead bodies of little girls he killed.''
 When the administrators of the Japan Society in New York asked Murakami if he would like to curate an exhibition in their gallery, he resolved to undertake an exploration of the origins of otaku culture, a subject that, he said, is sketchily understood even in Japan. In many of the classic manga and anime stories, the plot revolves around a bomb or radiation device that devastates Tokyo. ''I thought, Why does otaku culture so many times have an explosion that looks like an atomic bomb?'' he told me, as we sat at the counter of an elegant sushi bar in Tokyo. ''I was trying to find out why otaku people are always repeating the same scene and why I was so interested in it myself.'' And there was a related question that intrigued him: ''Why do Japanese people hate otaku culture?'' He concluded that otaku raised ''a mirror'' to a reality that the larger culture preferred to ignore. Like many other Japanese intellectuals of his generation, he deplores both his country's militarist past and what he sees as its acquiescent present. ''Otaku culture is handicapped reality,'' Murakami said. ''We have to realize we are handicapped, and we don't want to realize it. We know the U.S. is our father. We thought we were children, but we are handicapped people. We need help.''
 The crystallizing moment for Murakami arrived when he came up with a name for the show. In October, Alexandra Munroe, director of the Japan Society Gallery, was pressing him for an exhibition title and offered a suggestion. ''She gave us 'Japanese Pop Culture Explosion,' a really long title,'' he recalled. ''I hate that.'' Many Americans know that the atomic bombs that dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nicknamed, respectively, ''Little Boy'' and ''Fat Man.'' But few remember the testimony that Gen. Douglas MacArthur gave to a Senate committee in 1951 upon completing a tour of more than five years as Supreme Commander of the Allied powers in Japan. MacArthur stated that at the time of the war, when ''measured by the standards of modern civilization,'' the Japanese people were ''like a boy of 12.'' The remark ignited headlines across Japan, with furious resentment superseding the tributes that had hailed MacArthur's departure. For a show on otaku culture that would demonstrate how Japanese artists responded to their nation's wartime suffering and postwar subordination, Murakami realized that the title ''Little Boy'' was perfect. As he told me this story, he sugarcoated the underlying anger and bitterness, as he does so often both in his conversation and his art, with a joke. ''Little Boy and Fat Man -- now both things are true exactly of the Japanese people,'' he said, patting his potbelly and ordering an extra helping of sushi.
At the beginning of his career, Murakami appeared to be content with the lot of most successful contemporary artists: to create work that is admired by critics and desired by wealthy collectors but leaves the general public baffled or hostile. He was constructing conceptual pieces similar to the art being made in the West. Among those early works, which began attracting attention in the early 90's, was ''Polyrhythm,'' a seven-foot-high slab of yellow resin, minimalist in form, on which many toy United States infantry soldiers climb. Another colossal piece, which he titled ''Sea Breeze'' after a men's fragrance, was fabricated of steel plates that open automatically to reveal, like figures in a shrine, a ring of high-intensity floodlights. Probably his most talked-about youthful work was the 1991 ''Randoseru Project.'' For it, he collected hides of endangered or exotic species -- whale, hippopotamus, cobra and so on -- and had them brightly dyed and fabricated into the distinctive book bags, called randoseru, that Japanese schoolchildren have carried on their backs over the last century. Koyama, his Tokyo dealer, who has known Murakami since their university days, recalls that the project began with Murakami's desire to construct an object out of whale skin at a time when Japan, controversially, refused to join an international ban on commercial whaling. Someone suggested the shape of the randoseru. Behind its cuteness, the bag has bellicose overtones: it was adopted by the Japanese in the late 19th century on a Western military model. Murakami has kept an impish distance from the elaborate commentary the work inspired from critics. '''Randoseru,' my early work, got a really good reaction from the art scene,'' he told me. ''But I hate that reaction. It looks like political art, but I am just joking.''
 In 1994, with a fellowship from the Manhattan-based Asian Cultural Council, Murakami came to live in New York. During that year he started to re-emphasize his Japaneseness. Upon returning home he began to create objects that looked as if they were applying for admittance to the otaku world even as he also tried to cast an unfamiliar critical spotlight on this insular subculture.
 For two years, Murakami researched the concept and execution of ''Miss Ko2'' (pronounced ''ko-ko''), the sculpture that would eventually fascinate Western collectors and set a record at Christie's New York. Collaborating with the designers at Kaiyodo, the pre-eminent manufacturer of figures in Japan, he designed a high-breasted, stiletto-heeled, vapidly smiling blonde in a skimpy waitress uniform. Made of fiberglass, ''Miss Ko2'' is six feet tall, commanding attention in an art gallery but arousing anxious displeasure among otaku, who like their figures small and submissive.
 Murakami provoked the otaku again in 1997 with his next figure, which he titled ''Hiropon,'' after a popular recreational drug in postwar Japan. His idea was that the erotic pretty-girl figures known as bishojo were addictive for the otaku who collected them. Once again he made his figure big (seven feet high), but this time she was anything but vapid. Inspired by a magazine cover he had seen while attending a comic-book otaku gathering, of a bare-breasted woman with a nipple shaped like a penis, he designed a nude (although, in keeping with otaku preferences, one lacking genitalia or pubic hair) who is squeezing from her gargantuan breasts and oversize nipples a stream of milk that swirls behind her like a jump rope. The following year he created a male companion piece, ''My Lonesome Cowboy,'' of a masturbating naked man whose ejaculation floats lasso-style in front of him. Both ''Hiropon'' and ''My Lonesome Cowboy'' have the big eyes and grins that are found on popular children's anime and manga characters like Astro Boy (the Japanese name is Mighty Atom) and Sailor Moon. While otaku people generally ignored the ''Cowboy'' figure, they loathed ''Hiropon.'' '''Hiropon' is like a satire, and these figures are the object of affection for otaku people,'' said Masahiko Asano, an otaku expert whom Murakami has enlisted as a consultant. ''Once Mr. Murakami asked me why his characters cannot be the object of affection. I said: 'When you see Miss Ko2, can you masturbate to her? If not, it can't be.' He said, 'No, I couldn't do that.'''
 In 1999, at an otaku festival, Murakami released ''Second Mission Project Ko2,'' a three-piece sculptural installation that depicts a favorite otaku theme -- a young woman morphing into an airplane. Triumphantly, it was praised by both art critics and otaku. In hindsight, however, this work was a coda. Murakami's sculptures of sexually charged figures, difficult for viewers and expensive for fabricators, form a discrete chapter in his artistic career and his infatuation with otaku. Although this work may be the most interesting he has yet produced, he was dissatisfied. He wanted his characters to be objects of affection. He was a pop artist who longed to be popular.
If you were to draw a map of Japanese popular culture (a map like one from the Magellan era, grossly oversimplified but still useful), you might say that male-oriented otaku culture lies at one pole and that the female domain of kawaii (cuteness) is situated at the other. In the mid-90's, Murakami set sail from otaku toward kawaii. Even while he was investigating otaku model figures, he was already researching cute cartoon characters. Such characters, of course, had been a mainstay of Pop Art in the United States since the early 60's. Warhol used images of Mickey Mouse. Lichtenstein raided the funny pages. Murakami, however, did something else. He created his own characters.
 His first, Mr. DOB, got his name from an abbreviation of a nonsensical phrase that alluded to many things // a popular television entertainer, a sexual innuendo, the indigenous Ainu people and who knows what else. The phrase also translates, more or less, as ''Why? Why?'' Since this could serve as Murakami's motto, it was a good choice for a character who became his alter ego. Initially, the DOB character resembled Mickey, but over time he evolved, first turning toothy and fierce, then becoming terribly cute -- kawaii. ''In 1994, Mr. DOB had an ironic content,'' said the critic Midori Matsui. ''It became something different later on -- almost like Murakami's own house brand. He was always interested in competing with popular art on a real popular level. The things he did up to 'S.M.P. Ko2' were way too intellectual for his purpose. He wanted to become his own industry.'' 
 With his customary devotion to research, Murakami analyzed the principles of kawaii. ''I found a system for what is a cute character,'' he said. On a whiteboard at Kaikai Kiki, he drew me a circle with the top half blank and the bottom half containing two dots for eyes and a smiling mouth. ''In the kawaii system, this scale is very important,'' he said. Over the last decade, Murakami has released numerous cute characters: among them, Mr. Pointy, smiling flowers, colorful mushrooms and the good and bad toddlers Kaikai and Kiki. Emblematic of his reorientation from confrontation to cuteness, he changed the name of his studio in 2001 from the Hiropon Factory to Kaikai Kiki. He said he hopes to expand his audience by making animated films with his characters, and he has already opened a six-person animation facility in Tokyo and leased space in Los Angeles. (He plans to include an animated film in a midcareer retrospective of his work, to be held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2007.)
 The apotheosis of kawaii culture is Hello Kitty, the big-eyed, beribboned, expressionless pussycat character that stokes a billion-dollar-a-year business for the Sanrio company. Created in 1974, the Kitty character took off in 1985, first in Japan and then internationally. When I asked Matsui how she accounted for Kitty's popularity, she practically shrieked in response: ''Because I think humanism is dead! Because people are weak and scared.'' In a more measured tone, she added: ''It's easy to accept Kitty because it's so dumb and expressionless. It doesn't demand that you make any reference.''
 For an authoritative view, I paid a call at Sanrio on Yuko Yamaguchi, who has been the chief designer of Hello Kitty for 25 years. With long hennaed hair and wearing brown artificial-leather pants, she didn't look the least bit kawaii herself. When she discussed the enduring popularity of Kitty, she was all business. Hoping to gauge how far Murakami has gone in his quest for wide popularity, I asked her to rate Kaikai, the sweeter, rabbit-costumed half of the Kaikai Kiki toddlers, on the kawaii meter. She was troubled by Kaikai's smiling mouth. ''In most Sanrio characters, we don't express an emotion through the mouth,'' she said. ''With Kitty, you don't even see a mouth.'' She credited this mouthlessness for much of Kitty's popularity. ''When someone feels blue or depressed, they may want the character to sympathize with their feeling or to get angry with them or to offer encouragement,'' she said. ''Without a clear expression of the mouth, this is possible. It can be interpreted in different ways.''
 Murakami understands the infantilism that underlies the Hello Kitty phenomenon. Like otaku culture, kawaii culture for him is an expression of Japan's postwar impotence. (In a photograph with the strapping General MacArthur, the diminutive, once divine Emperor Hirohito looked very kawaii.) However, Murakami is also designing characters that for those unacquainted with his analysis seem simply -- and irresistibly -- kawaii. It's a delicate balancing act, reaching a mass audience while maintaining a critical distance. ''I created Mr. DOB for a really serious reason, but girls would say, 'Oh, cute,''' he told me. ''Japanese don't like serious art. But if I can transform cute characters into serious art, they will love my piece.'' The early DOB's were often distorted and belligerent or combined with jagged lines and distressed surfaces that alluded to traditional Japanese painting. More recently, they seem simply cute.
 The appearance of Murakami's DOB coincided with the emerging popularity of Yoshitomo Nara, the other Japanese artist of Murakami's generation who has found great favor in the West. Like Murakami, Nara was drawing cute cartoonlike figures, but more sincerely. His characters were children who might be sputtering obscenities or brandishing weapons but retained a look of adorable purity. At first it seemed that Nara, like Murakami, was offering a critique of the character culture while profiting from it. However, while it is still uncertain whether Murakami can walk this tightrope, the Nara enterprise appears to have relinquished any pretense of critical detachment. The artist himself, with his well-advertised love of punk music and a popular Web site, attracts a rock star's following. The openings of his shows are attended by flocks of admiring female fans, who are known as Nara girls. Koyama, who is Nara's dealer as well as Murakami's, said: ''People feel they can enter his painting, and they feel very close to him. Takashi's paintings have a distance, very cool. Takashi is speaking to a public in an official way. Nara is talking to the neighbors.''
At heart, Murakami is a detached observer. It was in that role that he elucidated his ''Superflat'' theory // in a 2000 catalog essay for an exhibition by that name that he curated in Japan and then took the next year to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show exuberantly jumbled an extreme range of Japanese art products, from 18th-century Edo screens to erotic plastic figurines of schoolgirls, all to illustrate Murakami's argument. With great cleverness and convincing specificity, he took the well-known absence of any native division in Japan between fine art and craft and linked it to the visual characteristics of traditional Japanese artwork -- particularly the patterned surfaces and lack of spatial perspective. Both socioculturally and aesthetically, Japanese art was flat, which made it superflat. In Murakami's view, the multifocal composition of a group of roosters on an 18th-century gold-leafed screen requires a viewer's eye to dart here and there, without providing a comfortable place to rest. In the same way, there is no pecking order in Japanese tradition whereby an original outranks a well-made copy or a work of art in a gallery is more precious than a piece of merchandise in a shop. The time-honored Japanese worldview, in other words, closely resembles the postmodern one, in which sensations and images rain down incessantly and you have no choice but to take it all in as it comes.
 In his artwork, Murakami has applied the ''Superflat'' theory most strictly in his recent paintings of the Vuitton monogram. On canvas panels of different sizes, with black or white backgrounds, his studio meticulously reproduces his designs for Vuitton. When the fashion designer Marc Jacobs, who, as artistic director of Vuitton, commissioned Murakami to reconceive the monogram, saw the paintings at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York, he was, unsurprisingly, pleased. ''Anything like that I love, when things go back and forth, chicken and egg,'' he told me. ''Does art imitate life or life imitate art?'' But some art-world people grumbled. Painting one panel in the monogram pattern could be seen as a comment on the similarity between artistic and commercial production; churning out many of them compressed the artistic and commercial to an uncomfortable degree. ''He took a few kidney punches on it,'' said Tim Blum, his Los Angeles dealer. ''The bag thing was interesting -- the show was something else. A lot of people really hated the show. Highly schooled people, who look carefully at Murakami, think, This is weird -- what's he doing? That project was the perfect endpoint for the arc of that part of his career. He became superflat.''
 Murakami perceives the hostile critical response to the monogram paintings, but he trusts his own instincts. When I first met him in New York in November, he invited me to watch his inspection of nine monogram paintings at his satellite studio in a converted cinder-block garage in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (He keeps the studio to avoid shipping fees on work for the American market.) As usual, Murakami deprecated his own technical skills. Unlike Nara, for example, he no longer applies his hand to his own work. He is a conceptual artist. Yet even though the painting is performed by studio assistants, Murakami exerts tight quality control. That day he was especially on the lookout for panels in which the paint had been applied more thickly on the background than on the motifs, a problem that had been recurring mysteriously in the Williamsburg plant. A smooth surface without visible brushstrokes is characteristic of both nihonga painting and factory production. It is also a feature of Murakami's art.
 He estimated that he had made 60 or 70 monograms and would stop at about 100. He added that he had done approximately 100 DOB's and 60 mushrooms. ''Just like with Warhol soup cans or Marilyns, if there is a need in the market, I can put them out,'' he said. ''The gallerists worry that if there are too many, the value will go down and their auction prices will be low. But I don't think so. If there is a demand, I will keep making them.''
 When the subject of the monogram paintings came up again in Tokyo, he elaborated on his motivations. He said the paintings allowed him to transform work for hire into his own art. As precedent, he mentioned an appropriationist piece that the American artist Jeff Koons did, in which he put his own frame on a poster of a basketball star. He also cited the ''dollar paintings'' that Warhol composed by pasting down real dollar bills. He admires the naked transparency of these artists' cashing in on their reputations to make money. ''My concept is, anytime we do the honest thing, we get the win,'' Murakami said. ''People find it very difficult to find their honest desire. Andy Warhol did that. I love his diary: pay the driver two weeks, the coffee is too sweet, the weather is cold. It's a life. Warhol is a master artist for me because he was a really honest person.'' 
In addition to being a factory, Kaikai Kiki, as the curator Dana Friis-Hansen said, is ''a home for wayward artists.'' Murakami surrounds himself with young people and enthusiastically promotes their careers. He looks for artists who are quirky or obsessive. Although as a theorist he subscribes to the Japanese deprecation of originality, as a curator he knows that the appearance of originality is a selling point. If Kaikai Kiki artists go on to have their own shows in the West, he takes a 10 percent commission (from the gallery's share of the sales, not the artist's). But commercial profit is a secondary motivation. ''He wants to become a schoolmaster,'' the critic Midori Matsui said. ''I think he is a very lonely person, and he needs to create his own family.'' Once Murakami tried to establish a school. ''Like a very small school, a terakoya school, in the Edo era -- one teacher with 10 students, very close,'' Murakami said. ''It sounds very sentimental. I wanted that school.'' He said that a young woman in the class developed a stalker's crush on him, forcing him to abandon his dream. In a less structured way, however, his tutelage continues.
 Like most Kaikai Kiki employees, Chinatsu Ban, Murakami's secretary, studied art in college. When she met him, she was selling cellphones to earn a living while painting in her spare time. She would send him invitations to her exhibitions, and he would offer encouraging replies. Eventually he asked her to join a group show he curated of young female Japanese artists. Two years ago he offered her a position at Kaikai Kiki.
 Along with several other Kaikai Kiki artists, Ban will be included in the ''Little Boy'' exhibition. She paints mostly elephants that are extremely kawaii. Tom Eccles, director of New York City's Public Art Fund, who helped organize Murakami's past installation at Rockefeller Center, was looking for a sculpture to place at the southeast entrance to Central Park in conjunction with the Japan Society show. ''Tom Eccles was really interested in a cute character,'' Murakami told me. ''So I said to Chinatsu, 'Do you want to do that?' She said, 'Sure, why not?'''
 Which is how, on a February morning, Ban came to be standing alongside a nine-foot-tall elephant sculpture in a chilly fabrication facility in suburban Tokyo.
 ''Great,'' she said approvingly to the manager of the plant. They were both waiting for Murakami to arrive.
 ''What is it made of?'' I asked Ban. She went to ask the manager.
 ''FRB, a kind of fiberglass,'' she reported.
 ''What does it weigh?'' I wondered. She once again sought out the manager.
 ''Five hundred kilos.'' At more than half a ton, that was a respectable weight for an elephant.
 Murakami, once he arrived, scrutinized the sculpture more critically. He observed it from all angles, indicating to the manager different bulges and hollows that needed smoothing. Mainly, though, he discussed with the manager whether there might be a way to divide the sculpture before it was shipped. He had recently discovered that flying a piece this bulky to New York would cost about $75,000. On top of that, the cost of fabrication -- including the painting, which was still to be done -- added another $125,000.
 ''It was a mistake,'' he told me. ''With the Japan Society, everything loses money.'' Eccles had committed about $75,000 to Kaikai Kiki for the sculpture. ''That's already big money for a young artist,'' Murakami said. Kaikai Kiki is helping to underwrite the Japan Society show, a long-term investment with at best a delayed payoff.
 Still, this New York event will be an opportunity to showcase the talents of several of Murakami's acolytes. The exhibition includes work by one of his earliest volunteers, Masakatsu Iwamoto, a 35-year-old man with dyed-blond hair and a dark mustache who calls himself ''Mr.'' As a paid staff member, Mr. now administers the Geisai, a semiannual competition for Japanese artists that Murakami has staged since 2000; in his creative free time, Mr. has a very otaku-like interest in barely pubescent girls, which Murakami has encouraged him to express in his art. Chiho Aoshima, 30, who administers the design department at Kaikai Kiki, uses Illustrator software to compose fantasies that typically place girls in luridly colored natural settings. Aoshima is having a one-woman show in late May in Los Angeles at Blum & Poe; thanks to the Public Art Fund, at the time of ''Little Boy'' she will display a huge wallpaperlike mural, printed by ink jets onto vinyl, in the Union Square subway station in Lower Manhattan. Arguably the most talented of the Kaikai Kiki younger set is Aya Takano, 29, a former volunteer who now lives in Kyoto. Her cartoonlike androgynous forms recall the Vienna Secession and Surrealism as well as her lifelong devotion to science fiction. Whatever their abilities, all of these artists owe their positions in the limelight to Murakami. ''They can exist as artists only within the context of what Murakami has devised as a stage, like 'Superflat' or 'Little Boy,''' the critic Sawaragi said.
 An aspiring artist who especially interests Murakami is Mahomi Kunikata, a chubby, bashful woman who looks younger than her 25 years. ''Any time I am looking for a Kaikai Kiki artist, I am looking for an original artist that is hidden,'' he said. ''Mahomi, if she wants to create new manga or painting, she has to go back to her history: 'My older brother is dead, and my younger brother is psychologically ill and screaming. I want to escape from here, but I am very fat and I cannot escape.' She cannot organize herself -- how to escape, how to create something.'' Murakami is gratified by the progress she has made in the five years he has known her. ''She can open her heart and now do her art,'' he said. It is characteristic of his deep-rooted ambivalence that Murakami is drawn to Kunikata's original and repellent take on kawaii culture when his own art is becoming kawaii in a simpler way.
 Hardly fat, Kunikata nevertheless thinks she is overweight. And, as Murakami indicates, she has a troubled family background. At her suggestion, we met for our talk at a cake cafe in Yokohama, near the camera store where she works as a greeter. Unable to decide what to eat, she ordered slices of two kinds of strawberry shortcake, which she quickly consumed while I browsed through notebooks of her pencil-drawn manga.
 In the first one, I opened to a drawing of very kawaii dogs -- kawaii, that is, except for the fact that they were killing and eating children. I turned the page and saw graphic depictions of naked girls being sexually violated.
 Kunikata looked up from her cake. ''I'm very embarrassed,'' she said. ''Don't open it wide. People are eating.''
 More discreetly, I flipped past a drawing of a girl with bleeding arm stumps to find more girls, sometimes bound, frequently confronted by boys with huge erections. I saw a puzzling one of a girl, a boy and a strange cat. I asked about the cat.
 ''The cat is dead,'' she said. ''It's Valentine's Day.'' I knew that in Japan on Valentine's Day, women and girls give chocolates to males they are fond of. ''The girl killed the cat,'' Kunikata continued, ''and made a chocolate fondue from the cat and gave it to the boy.'' I nodded and kept turning, not having anything in particular to inquire about the pictures of boys performing oral sex on tied-up girls and girls being forced into fellatio with very well endowed boys.
 Reaching into her backpack, she showed me her recent work. On the backs of plastic models of sushi, the kind that are seen in restaurant windows, she had painted likenesses of slim, sexy girls.
 I could see why Murakami loves Kunikata's art. It reveals the fear and anger that lie just beneath the surface of the kawaii culture -- or, to adopt the metaphor of superflat, the feelings that are embedded right on the surface, for those who look closely and knowledgeably. The manner in which Kunikata's eating obsession seeps into every aspect of her art also reminded me of how, in Murakami's view, the atom-bomb trauma permeates his country's culture. The pictures of Japan's past destruction are transposed into a catastrophic science-fiction future, and the country's childlike relationship to the United States is embraced in a celebration of the kawaii (a word derived from kawaiiso, meaning ''pitiful'' or ''pathetic''). A similar thing occurs in another fraught area: sexual relations between young men and women. The otaku portrayals of sexuality -- fixated on compliant, air-brushed schoolgirls -- are divorced from emotional reality, even from physical reality. This neutering of real life was epitomized by the enthusiastic reaction of Japanese children of Murakami's generation to the animated versions of atomic explosions and fire-bombings they watched on TV. One reason these kids cheered the demolition of Tokyo is that it was accomplished by a wizard: the most influential special-effects designer of the day, Eiji Tsuburaya, who learned his craft as a propagandist during World War II, preparing a rousing and convincing recreation of the (unfilmed) Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After the war, Tsuburaya redirected his talents -- and his agents of destruction -- into Godzilla, Ultraman, Rodan and Mothra. The imagery retained its stirring power. The context was secondary.
 Anime and manga are inexact copies of Mickey Mouse, Betty Boop and other American cartoon characters, modified for Japanese taste and (at the time they were developed) for the limitations of Japanese technology. The Japanese have always had a genius for these adaptations. Murakami is a great admirer of the Kano School, a dynasty of painters who catered to the shoguns for almost four centuries by taking the principles of Chinese art (like prominent brushstrokes and ink monochrome) and Japanizing them. The Kano School centered on the successive generations of the Kano family, supplemented by talented students who were adopted and then allowed to take the Kano name. It is another model for Kaikai Kiki. (Indeed, the phrase ''kaikai kiki,'' which means ''brave, strong and sensitive,'' was borrowed from a critic in the late 17th century who used it to describe the paintings of Eitoku Kano.) One of Murakami's favorite artworks is a screen depicting an old plum tree that was painted for a temple in Kyoto by Sansetsu Kano in the 17th century and is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In his ''Superflat'' essay, Murakami pointed to similarities between the spiky lines in Sansetsu's eccentric masterpiece and the designs of the leading anime artist Yoshinori Kanada. At about the same time, he produced a few paintings of his own in this style. Aside from his appreciation of the work, Murakami admires the way the Kano School perpetuated itself. He would like to start a line of comparable longevity. ''How did the Kano School survive 300 years or more?'' he once said to me. ''Japanese culture doesn't need to create an original something. A school is O.K. A little difference is great. Kakai Kiki School is O.K. -- Mr. and Chiho and Chinatsu.''
 At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there is currently a small show centered on the Kano School. I walked through it not long ago with its curator, Miyeko Murase, a leading scholar of Japanese art. ''I'm sure the Kano artists felt they were upholding the principles of Chinese painting,'' she explained. ''But to sell, they had to accommodate Japanese tastes. That went first of all to the introduction of color. By the time Sansetsu painted the old plum trees, the distortion and almost Cubist sense of form was possible because there was that breadth allowed in the Kano School.'' Along with their love of color, the Japanese preferred decorative patterning over Chinese naturalism. And they had a longstanding fondness for narrative. The word ''manga'' in its current usage was popularized by the great 19th-century artist Hokusai to describe his illustrated, often comical, narratives. But the form by another name goes back much further. At the beginning of the exhibition, Murase showed me an early-14th-century hand scroll, known as an emaki, that vividly depicted an unfolding battle. ''This is the first example we know of an illustrated literature that dealt with the love between an older monk and a younger monk,'' she said. ''It's part of a genre of stories of homosexual love between monks that was popular at the time. In this relationship, the love causes a war.'' With minimal alteration, the Met could repackage this emaki and sell it in a manga shop in Tokyo today.
 Of course, many of the esoteric otaku references in Murakami's art are lost on Western observers. But he isn't sure it matters all that much if Westerners lack the background to recognize them. ''In the 70's, Japanese culture loved American rock 'n' roll,'' he noted by way of analogy. ''Eagles' 'Hotel California,' we cannot really understand, but 'Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, Hotel California! Oh, yeah, I understand.''' Still, he emphasized, ''if the audience is really interested, they have to learn everything.'' It may be that Americans feel they understand Murakami without conducting research because he is reacting to a hyperstimulated and decontextualized Japan that looks a lot like their own society. For unique historical reasons, the Japanese arrived earlier at an ahistorical worldview. Sawaragi compares the manner in which the Japanese have dealt with political reality in the postwar years to the capsule toys, known as gachapon, that can be purchased for a dollar or two from vending machines. ''War or history have come to be sealed inside the anime or manga world,'' he said. ''It is a sterilized, innocent, purified experience, defined by putting everything war-related inside a capsule.'' The battle planes and atomic monsters reside in the gachapon machine in cute, tiny images. Sanitized, they pop out, one after another, in no particular order.

''Sea Breeze'' This huge piece is made of steel plates that open to reveal, like figures in a shrine, a ring of floodlights.
''727'' The panels and painting technique of this early DOB (the ''D'' and ''B'' are ears, the ''O'' the face) allude to traditional Japanese forms.
''And Then, and Then and Then and Then and Then (Blue)'': Although Murakami was making Macy's-parade-like DOB balloons at the time, this is a painting that only looks like a balloon.
''Miss Ko2'' Neither small nor submissive, this figure displeased the otaku.
''Milk'' Inspired by the forms in Edo painting and one of Murakami's favorite animators.
''DOB in the Strange Forest (Red DOB)'' In this room-size sculpture, in which mushrooms look like trees, DOB has morphed from fierce to lovable.

THE NATIONAL LEAGUE team capsules were written by Murray Chass. Teams are listed in the predicted order of finish.

N.L. EAST

ATLANTA BRAVES
Bobby Cox, 16th season
Last season: 96-66, first place
Thirteen was not unlucky. Will 14 be?
 The Braves, expected by some nonbelievers to fall short of another division title, moved into first place a week after the All-Star Game last season and steadily built their lead until it reached 10 1/2 games on Sept. 24, the day they clinched their unprecedented 13th straight.
 For a run at No. 14, the Braves have armed themselves with two new starting pitchers, well, one new, Tim Hudson, and one old, John Smoltz. Instead of trading for a second new starter, they acquired a closer, Dan Kolb, and returned Smoltz from the bullpen to the role in which he had a 157-113 record in 12 seasons.
 Two outfield newcomers/veterans, Brian Jordan and Raul Mondesi, also figure to be critical to the extension of the team's championship run.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Hudson, Kolb, Jordan, Mondesi
KEY LOSSES -- J. D. Drew, Russ Ortiz, Jaret Wright
KEY TO SEASON -- They need to recapture the pitching-dominant days of Maddux-Glavine-Smoltz to extend the streak.

FLORIDA MARLINS
Jack McKeon, 3rd season
Last season: 83-79, 3rd place
Carlos Delgado, the free-agent slugger, said he chose the Marlins over the Mets because he thought they had a better chance of getting to the World Series. Now, he will get his chance to put his performance where his mouth is.
 Winners of two World Series in the past eight years, the Marlins have a strong lineup with Delgado, Miguel Cabrera, Juan Pierre and Mike Lowell. They also have a potentially potent pitching rotation.
 At closer, however, they have a question mark in Guillermo Mota, who has to show he can at least duplicate the 47 saves that Armando Benitez produced last season.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Delgado, Al Leiter
KEY LOSSES -- Carl Pavano, Benitez
KEY TO SEASON -- A. J. Burnett, Josh Beckett and Dontrelle Willis have to take charge and pull Leiter along in a show of pitching force.

METS
Willie Randolph, first season
Last season: 71-91, 4th place
Willie Randolph has lived a charmed baseball life. In his first three seasons as the Yankees' second baseman, he was in the World Series. In 6 of his 11 seasons as a Yankees coach, he went to the World Series. Now he is on his own, a rookie manager with the Mets, and he will find out if he can transfer that magic to his new team.
 General Manager Omar Minaya has supplied Randolph with the type of talent the Mets have not had for years. Pedro Martinez, the new ace of the pitching staff, and Carlos Beltran, the new star of the lineup, give the Mets credibility. It would help if they could provide victories, too.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Martinez, Beltran, Doug Mientkiewicz
KEY LOSSES -- Al Leiter, Richard Hidalgo
KEY TO SEASON -- Their pitchers and young infielders have to produce if the Mets are to avoid the failures of the 1992 and 2002 teams that also had an influx of supposedly star players.

PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES
Charlie Manuel, first year
Last season: 86-76, 2nd place
The Phillies did not win the division title last year, when many people thought they should. So what will they do this year, when most people do not think they will? Maybe finish with the same 86-76 record they have had each of the past two seasons.
 If Pat Burrell and Mike Lieberthal do not generate more offense, the Phillies may not even do that well. In five seasons, Lieberthal has not come close to his 1999 production of 31 homers and 96 R.B.I. Burrell, in two seasons, has not approached his 2002 output of 37 homers and 116 R.B.I.
 Lusty hitting from Burrell, Lieberthal and Jim Thome could be the antidote to the Phillies' failures, but that is apparently easier said than done.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Jon Lieber, Kenny Lofton
KEY LOSSES -- Eric Milton, Kevin Millwood
KEY TO SEASON -- They proved they could not respond well enough to Larry Bowa's intense style of managing, but chances are, Manuel's more relaxed manner will not turn the trick, either.

WASHINGTON NATIONALS
Frank Robinson, 4th year
Last season: 67-95, 5th place
Road warriors no longer, the Nationals cannot use their nomadic existence as an excuse. Not that they looked for excuses; when they played in Montreal, the Expos did a scrappy job trying to overcome the elements that worked against them. One of those elements, the lack of independent ownership, still hovers over their heads.
 Jim Bowden, the new general manager, has done what he could, signing two veteran free agents for the left side of the infield, Vinny Castilla and Cristian Guzman. But when Bowden tried to trade for Sammy Sosa, he could not get approval from the team's owner, Major League Baseball, to increase the payroll, and Sosa went to Baltimore.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Castilla, Guzman, Jose Guillen
KEY LOSSES -- Juan Rivera
KEY TO SEASON -- Until they get a new owner with some money to spend, the Nationals will struggle in what has become a tough division.

N.L. CENTRAL

ST. LOUIS CARDINALS
Tony La Russa, 10th season
Last season: 105-57, first place
Contending teams are supposed to be strong up the middle, but the Cardinals lost nearly their entire middle. Catcher Mike Matheny, shortstop Edgar Renteria and second baseman Tony Womack are gone. Yadier Molina (one of three catching Molinas in the majors), David Eckstein and Mark Grudzielanek have replaced them.
 The incumbent Cardinals will try to overcome the embarrassment of winning the most games in the majors last season, then being swept in the World Series. They should again win a lot of games with their potent lineup, which includes Scott Rolen, Jim Edmonds, Larry Walker and Albert Pujols, the only player to hit at least 30 home runs in each of his first four seasons.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Mark Mulder, Eckstein, Grudzielanek
KEY LOSSES -- Matheny, Renteria, Womack, Woody Williams
KEY TO SEASON -- The pitchers, led by Mulder, just need to do their part for the Cardinals to repeat.

CHICAGO CUBS
Dusty Baker, 3rd season
Last season: 89-73, 3rd place
Just as they did a year ago, the Cubs begin the season ominously, with their top two pitchers, Kerry Wood (shoulder bursitis) and Mark Prior (ulnar nerve inflammation), trying to overcome ailments. In addition, Joe Borowski, their closer, is out with a broken arm. He missed the last four months of last season with a shoulder ailment.
 The Cubs and their fans will not have Sammy Sosa to kick around, but they will not have his potent bat in the lineup, either. Jeromy Burnitz can be productive, but not like Sosa at his bulked-up best. The departures of Sosa and Moises Alou, in fact, leave the Cubs without 31 percent of their home run production and 25 percent of their R.B.I. output.

KEY ADDITION -- Burnitz
KEY LOSSES -- Sosa, Alou, Mark Grudzielanek, Matt Clement
KEY TO SEASON -- If Wood and Prior cannot stay healthy, the Cubs can take the summer off and watch Sammy on television.

CINCINNATI REDS
Dave Miley, 3rd season
Last season: 76-86, 4th place
The miserly Reds executed a shocking move during the winter: they outbid the Yankees for Eric Milton, a left-handed pitcher. The Yankees offered $18 million for three years, the Reds' $25.5 million for three, and Milton is now a member of the Reds rotation. The Reds also signed Joe Randa and Rich Aurilia for the left side of their infield, with Aurilia replacing the venerable Barry Larkin at shortstop after 18 years.
 The most critical development, though, is the return of Ken Griffey Jr. to sound health, a condition the Reds hope he maintains after four years of season-shortening injuries. They would like to see Griffey add significantly to his career total of 501 hone runs.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Milton, Ramon Ortiz, Randa, Aurilia
KEY LOSS -- Larkin
KEY TO SEASON -- If they get a full season from Griffey and some decent pitching, they could cause some trouble in the division.

HOUSTON ASTROS
Phil Garner, 2nd season
Last season: 92-70, wild card
After nine consecutive losing seasons in Milwaukee and Detroit, and an 0-6 start that got him fired from the Tigers in the 10th season, Phil Garner steered the Astros into the playoffs last season as a midseason replacement. Let's see him do it again after the departures of Carlos Beltran and Jeff Kent.
 Maybe he will. The Astros still have Roy Oswalt, the National League's only 20-game winner, and Roger Clemens, who picked up an unprecedented seventh Cy Young award. And maybe Andy Pettitte will be over his elbow problems and pitch the entire season.
 The departures of Kent and Beltran, and Lance Berkman's knee injury, though, have caused some confusion. Garner spent most of spring training deciding whether to leave Craig Biggio in left field or return him to second base.

KEY ADDITIONS -- None
KEY LOSSES -- Beltran, Kent
KEY TO SEASON -- They will go as far as Clemens & Co. take them.

PITTSBURGH PIRATES
Lloyd McClendon, 5th season
Last season: 72-89, 5th place
The low-revenue Pirates have systematically shed their high-priced players or those who could become high-priced: Brian Giles, Aramis Ramirez, Jason Kendall. If the latest trade, for Kendall, turns out as well as the Giles deal, they could look good.
 For Giles, the Pirates received left fielder Jason Bay, who was the National League rookie of the year last season, and Oliver Perez, whose 2.98 E.R.A. matched Roger Clemens's E.R.A. For Kendall, the Pirates received pitcher Mark Redman, who will start, and Arthur Rhodes, whom they traded for Matt Lawton, who is now their starting right fielder.
 Redman and Lawton do not figure to be as spectacular as Perez and Bay, but they add a veteran presence, which the Pirates need.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Benito Santiago, Lawton, Redman
KEY LOSS -- Kendall
KEY TO SEASON -- They have to ignore their payroll status and play in spite of it.

MILWAUKEE BREWERS
Ned Yost, 3rd season
Last season: 67-94, 6th place
Under new ownership for the first time since 1970, when Bud Selig and his partners imported the Seattle Pilots to Milwaukee, the Brewers, like the Pirates, take an unenviable string of 12 consecutive losing seasons into this season. Thirteen is inevitable for both.
 Lacking power -- they tied for last in the league in home runs last season -- the Brewers traded the major leagues' leading base stealer, Scott Podsednik, for Carlos Lee, who hit 31 homers each of the past two seasons. They also traded their closer, Dan Kolb, for a young starter, Jose Capellan. The Kolb deal left them with an inexperienced closer, Mike Adams. Also inexperienced is the rookie shortstop J. J. Hardy.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Lee, Damian Miller
KEY LOSSES -- Podsednik, Kolb
KEY TO SEASON -- They have to hope their trades work out as well as the Richie Sexson deal a year ago, which brought them the right side of their infield and starting pitcher Chris Capuano.

N.L. WEST

SAN DIEGO PADRES
Bruce Bochy, 11th season
Last season: 87-75, 3rd place
With a month left last season, the Padres were in a virtual three-way tie for the National League wild-card spot with the Giants and the Cubs. None of the three teams won it; the Astros did. The Padres lost 16 of their final 32 games. They should do better this season.
 They made few significant changes, substituting Woody Williams for David Wells in the rotation and Dave Roberts for Jay Payton in center field. But Roberts and Williams were on the teams that played in the World Series last year, and maybe that experience will rub off on the Padres.
 Maybe the Padres' biggest change will be in how they finish the season.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Williams, Roberts
KEY LOSSES -- Wells, Payton
KEY TO SEASON -- If the pitchers can raise their level of success a notch, the Padres could make a run at the division title.

SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS
Felipe Alou, 3rd season
Last season: 91-71, 2nd place
This is not the old man and the sea, unless Felipe Alou were to plunge into McCovey Cove for one of Barry Bonds's home runs. Yet Alou, the major leagues' second-oldest manager, has the major's oldest team. Before the season is a month old, the eight starting position players will average 35 years old. With Bonds, who is rehabilitating after knee surgery, the average would be 36.
 But age brings with it experience, and that experience could put the Giants atop the division. Demonstrating they are not afraid of age, the Giants signed Moises Alou, the manager's 38-year-old son, and Omar Vizquel, who will turn 38 later this month. Except for Marquis Grissom, who is a week older than Vizquel, they are older than everybody on the team except the 40-year-old Bonds.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Moises Alou, Vizquel, Armando Benitez, Mike Matheny
KEY LOSSES -- A. J. Pierzynski, Dustan Mohr, Dave Burba
KEY TO SEASON -- The Giants' place in the standings could be determined by when Bonds returns from his knee rehabilitation and what he does after he returns.

LOS ANGELES DODGERS
Jim Tracy, 5th season
Last season: 93-69, first place
The Dodgers were so busy shuffling their roster over the winter that you would think they had finished in last place, not first, last season. Four of the eight everyday starters are new, as are two starting pitchers. Some of the decisions were economic, a problem the Dodgers had seldom faced.
 The result is a very different team from the one that won the team's first division title in nine years. Pitching has long been a Dodgers strength, but they are filling out this season's rotation with Derek Lowe, who after a sluggish season was the winning pitcher in each of Boston's three series-winning victories last October, and Scott Erickson, a reclamation project, who last season pitched briefly (six starts) and poorly (6.67 E.R.A.) for the Mets and Texas.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Jeff Kent, J. D. Drew, Jason Phillips, Lowe
KEY LOSSES -- Adrian Beltre, Shawn Green, Steve Finley, Alex Cora, Jose Lima, Kazuhisa Ishii
KEY TO SEASON -- Jim Tracy has to assemble the new players and the old and somehow try to repeat what he did last year.

ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS
Bob Melvin, first season
Last season: 51-111, 5th place
After losing 111 games, the most in the major leagues last season and the most in the National League since the 1965 Mets lost 112, the Diamondbacks did not have much choice but to rip it all up and start over. That is why they will have four new starters in the rotation and six new starters in the lineup.
 Brandon Webb is the lone returning starting pitcher -- even Randy Johnson is gone -- and Luis Gonzalez and Chad Tracy are the only returning everyday starters.
 Fittingly, they have a new manager, Bob Melvin, to deal with the newness. Melvin replaced Wally Backman, who was fired after four days because he had not disclosed personal incidents in his past. Backman had replaced Al Pedrique, who replaced Bob Brenly just before midseason.

KEY ADDITIONS -- Troy Glaus, Shawn Green, Jose Cruz Jr., Craig Counsell, Royce Clayton, Javier Vazquez, Russ Ortiz, Shawn Estes
KEY LOSSES -- Johnson, Richie Sexson, Danny Bautista, Shea Hillenbrand
KEY TO SEASON -- If they do not take too long to get to know one another, the new Diamondbacks may find an old way of winning.

COLORADO ROCKIES
Clint Hurdle, 4th season
Last season: 68-94, 4th place
The Rockies are regressing. Their .420 winning percentage last season was their worst since the .414 in the franchise's first year, 1993. They will try to improve without their two most productive hitters, Vinny Castilla and Jeromy Burnitz. Castilla and Burnitz, who left as free agents, accounted for 36 percent of the team's home runs and 30 percent of the R.B.I.
 Garrett Atkins, a rookie, replaces Castilla at third base, and Brad Hawpe, another rookie, could wind up replacing Burnitz in right field, although Dustan Mohr is scheduled to start there. With Clint Barmes, the rookie shortstop, and the other starters J. D. Closser, Matt Holliday and Aaron Miles having only a year in the majors or less, the Rockies look as if they are starting over.

KEY ADDITION -- Mohr
KEY LOSSES -- Castilla, Burnitz, Royce Clayton, Shawn Estes
KEY TO SEASON -- They will have to swim fast to keep their heads above water.

PERSON: Pope John Paul II

HEADLINE: Pope John Paul II, Church Shepherd And a Catalyst for World Change

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
On the night of Oct. 16, 1978, a vast, impatient throng in floodlit St. Peter's Square cheered wildly as white smoke curled from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signaling the election of a new pope. A long wait had ended, but the enthusiasm was somewhat premature.
 Cardinal Pericle Felici emerged minutes later to introduce Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland, the first non-Italian pope since 1523. But even he had trouble pronouncing the name -- voy-TEE-wah. Hardly anyone, it seemed, knew who he was. Murmurs and questions rippled through the predominantly Roman crowd.
 Then a powerfully built man with slightly stooped shoulders and a small smile on his angular face stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Cheers faded into silence. The crowd waited. 
 He stood at the balcony rail, looking out, a Polish stranger in the fresh white robes of the pope. And there were tears in his eyes as he began to speak.
 ''I have come,'' he said in lightly accented Italian, ''from a faraway country -- far away, but always so close in the communion of faith.''
 There were scattered cheers, and they grew louder as he went on.
 ''I do not know whether I can express myself in your -- in our -- Italian language,'' he said, pausing.
 The crowd roared appreciatively, and the laughter swelled into resounding cheers.
 ''If I make mistakes,'' he added, beaming suddenly, ''you will correct me.''
 Tumult erupted.
 The cheers went on and on, and then grew into rhythmic waves that broke on the basilica facade and echoed across the square in a thundering crescendo:
 ''Viva il Papa!
 ''Viva il Papa!
 ''Viva il Papa!''

A Pope of a Different Sort
 It was an extraordinary beginning. But almost from the start, it was evident to many of the world's Roman Catholics, and to multitudes of non-Catholics as well, that this was to be an extraordinary papacy, one that would captivate much of humanity by sheer force of personality and reshape the church with a heroic vision of a combative, disciplined Catholicism.
 It was to be the longest and most luminous pontificate of the 20th century, the second longest in the history of the church, a 26-year era that would witness sweeping political changes around the world, the growth of the Roman Catholic Church to more than a billion baptized members from 750 million, and the beginning of Christianity's Third Millennium.
 The man who would call himself John Paul II was not the traditional papal figure, compassionate and loving but ascetic and remote behind the high walls and the elaborate ceremony of the Vatican. Here was a different kind of pope: complex, schooled in confrontation, theologically intransigent but deftly politic, full of wit and daring, energy and physically expressive love.
 More than outgoing, he was all-embracing -- a bear-hugging, larger-than-life man of action who had climbed mountains, performed in plays, written books and seen war, and he was determined from the start to make the world his parish and go out and minister to its troubles and see to its spiritual needs.
 Compared with other popes, he did not create many new programs and he sought to clarify and enforce Catholic ideas rather than to reshape or expand them. He was, if anything, more traditional than his namesake predecessors, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul I.
 But he saw himself primarily as a spiritual figure who transcended geographical and ideological boundaries, and he saw it as his mission to deliver a clear set of Catholic ideas and to foster peace and human dignity through the power of faith and the practical efforts of well-meaning nations.
 At the dawn of the millennium and in the twilight of his papacy, he also saw it as his duty to issue a daring, unprecedented apology for the errors of his church and individual Catholics over the last 2,000 years, a catalog of sins that included episodes of religious and cultural intolerance and of historic injustices against Jews, women, indigenous peoples, immigrants and the poor.
 While he did not cite specific misdeeds, his apology set out a framework that theologians said appeared to encompass the Crusades, the Inquisition, the burning of heretics and forced conversions of American Indians, Africans and others. The church's response to the Holocaust was not specified, but the apology was dedicated to a ''confession of sins against the people of Israel.''
 And there were other acknowledgements -- notably one in 1998 for the failure of many Catholics to help Jews in the Holocaust, and another in 2002 to the victims of sexual abuse by priests in a scandal that engulfed the church in America with cases of pedophilia and accusations of cover-ups by bishops and other members of the church hierarchy.
 The traumatic scandal, in which scores of priests were accused of molesting children, some repeatedly over many years, led to criminal charges, the removal of many priests and avalanches of lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements. It also challenged the moral authority of the church in America and threatened to taint the final years of a papacy whose signet had been human dignity.
 John Paul's extraordinary effort to cleanse his church's conscience, along with his global travels, his challenges to human rights violations around the world, his attacks on the economic injustices of capitalism and his steadfast resistance to changes in church teachings on birth control, priestly celibacy, the ordination of women and other issues were among the fundamental traits of his pontificate.
 But they were not the only legacies by which history would judge John Paul. Along with the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the pope played a major role in the collapse of Soviet and European Communism, instilling the adversaries of Communist governments in Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe with confidence that their cause would outlast the repression of their rulers.
 His very election boosted the spirit of believers in Eastern Europe, for whom the appeal ''Be not afraid!'' -- repeated three times during the sermon he preached at his installation on Oct. 22, 1978 -- had a special meaning.
 In June 1979, millions turned out for the pope's first visit to his native Poland, masses of people acting independently of the Communist government and gaining a liberating sense of their own autonomy. In retrospect, the visit was widely seen as a detonator of the Solidarity labor movement's challenge to Poland's Communist government in 1980 and ultimately of the changes that swept the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe a decade later.
 Traveling widely -- through Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia -- the pope electrified vast crowds with a populist blend of showmanship, evangelism and impassioned appeals for human rights, peace, disarmament and justice for the poor and the oppressed.
 On that first papal visit to Poland, he scolded the officially atheistic Communist government for treating people ''merely as a means of production.''
 He went to Brazil and chastised the military junta in power. ''Violence,'' he said, ''kills what it intends to create.''
 He went to Ireland and confronted zealots of the Irish Republican Army and their Protestant foes: ''On my knees I beg you to turn away from the path of violence and to return to the ways of peace.''
 He went to Japan and mourned: ''To remember Hiroshima is to abhor nuclear war. To remember Hiroshima is to commit oneself to peace.''
 He went to Auschwitz and asked, ''How far can cruelty go?''
 And he went to the United Nations in New York and spoke to world leaders of peace for ''all the men and women living on this planet.''

An Intensely Physical Presence
 People everywhere found the pope's presence intensely physical. Not content to wave from a passing limousine, this man with the ruddy face and glowing eyes would jump out and plunge into the crowds, hugging, kissing, grasping and talking to people; singing, smiling, winking and reaching out with his quarry-worker hands to touch and bless them.
 Chiefs of protocol winced. Security men were horrified, fearing the kind of attack in which he was shot in St. Peter's Square in 1981. Aides of all kinds grew exhausted trying to keep up with him. But he was determined to take his message from St. Peter's around the globe.
 Over the quarter century of his papacy, the pope traveled to 129 countries on 104 trips abroad. He visited and revisited Poland and made many trips through other European lands. Again and again he journeyed to Asia, South America, Central America and Africa. He made five papal visits to the mainland United States: triumphant multicity tours in 1979 and 1987, a meeting with President Bill Clinton in Denver in 1993, a tour in October 1995 that took him to New York, New Jersey and Baltimore, and a final visit, in 1999, to St. Louis.
 He did not go to China or Russia, though he expressed a wish to visit both, and he met President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at the Vatican in February 1998, shortly after journeying to Cuba. In 1993, he went to the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and visited Albania, Europe's poorest land, where he urged the newly non-Communist nation to nurture its long-suppressed religious freedom. He also visited several former Soviet republics -- Kazakhstan and Armenia after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America, and Azerbaijan in 2002.
 China's Communist leaders, seeing religion as a means of political dissent, never agreed to legalize Roman Catholicism, and let Catholics worship only in an official Patriotic Church. The Vatican made overtures to Beijing in the 1990's, but did not thaw a relationship frozen over many issues, including the Vatican's recognition of Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province.
 Throughout his papacy, John Paul expressed a hope of journeying to the Holy Land, to visit the sites where Jesus lived and died and to lend his moral authority to the quest for peace in one of the world's most troubled regions. The political and logistical problems seemed insuperable until the millennium.
 Then in March 2000, he made one of his most dramatic trips, a six-day valedictory journey to Jordan, Israel and Palestinian-held territories that saw the 79-year-old pope, frail with infirmities, step nimbly through the political and religious minefields of the Middle East, a capstone of his papal travels.
 Respectful dissent was voiced by some who greeted the pope on his trips. Occasionally there were demonstrations, even some protests that turned violent. But many Vatican officials and Catholic leaders who at first had been skeptical of his travels came to see them as valuable and successful.
 Others believed the trips were not the best way to reach people in a world saturated with electronic stimuli and entertainment extravaganzas. Spectacular trips, some theologians argued, left no lasting results; they chided the pope, calling his travels the religious equivalent of rock concerts that failed to offer something transcendent.
 And while many Catholic leaders said the trips had lifted the church spiritually and financially, there were complaints about the costs. The 1987 trip to the United States, for example, cost $20 million -- all but $2 million of it raised by nine dioceses he visited -- and some critics said the money could be better used to aid the homeless or hard-pressed parochial schools.
 Yet as the journeys mounted, it became clear to many Catholic thinkers that the travels were not mere visits to a sprawling flock, but had become a central feature of his papacy: the forceful, global reassertion of Roman Catholic orthodoxy through a new sacramental exercise using jet planes, television and a remarkable stage presence.
 In the last year, the pope was forced to curtail his travels as the burdens of age and illness -- the trembling hands and slurred speech, the inability to walk or hold his head up, and other manifest frailties of Parkinson's disease -- grew increasingly heavy. He took two relatively short trips abroad last year, to Switzerland in June and to the shrine of Lourdes in France in August.
 He continued to meet world leaders and to address major issues. He received Vice President Dick Cheney in January 2004 and met President Bush in June, using the occasions to reiterate his unhappiness over the American-led invasion of Iraq and the continuing fighting there, and he appealed for a speedy restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.
 The pope was also touched last year by a controversy over whether he had endorsed Mel Gibson's film ''The Passion of the Christ.'' The movie's promoters claimed that the pope, after a preview, had said, ''It is as it was.'' But his secretary denied there had been any appraisal. It seemed likely that the pope had been drawn into the unwitting service of a film many Jewish and Christian leaders feared could rekindle claims that Jews were collectively responsible for the Crucifixion. 
 Besides the pope's limited time away from the Vatican, there were increasing signs recently that his papacy was drawing to a close. He was hospitalized for nine days in early February for treatment of breathing difficulties and influenza, and for the first time as pope he was unable to preside over Ash Wednesday services marking the start of Lent. He was hospitalized again after suffering a respiratory relapse, and underwent a tracheotomy to allow him to breathe.
 There were voices of concern that the pope's illness might create a vacuum of leadership for the church, and talk of a possible resignation. While four popes had resigned, the last was St. Celestine V, who abdicated five months after his election in 1294 at the age of 79. Vatican officials said John Paul was unlikely to step down, especially because one of his strongest messages -- respect for human dignity at all stages of life, from the womb to the frailties of old age -- had at last come full circle to encompass him.
 In addition to his global travels, the pope asserted his mission in traditional ways as well, by appointments of like-minded cardinals and bishops around the world -- in September 2003 he elevated 31 new cardinals, bringing to about 120 the number at that time who would be eligible to vote in the election of the next pope -- and by papal teachings that upheld the church's condemnation of birth control, its exclusion of women from the priesthood, its requirement of celibacy for priests in the Latin rite and its suspicion of revolutionary social movements.

A Pope's Instructions
 Over the span of his papacy -- and serving in many ways to define it -- John Paul issued 14 encyclicals, or papal instructions, dealing with a wide range of topics: social and economic issues, war, the meaning of morality, doctrinal questions, faith and reason and other matters.
 In 1979, his first encyclical, the 24,000-word ''Redemptor Hominis,'' or ''Redeemer of Man,'' expressed the core of his conviction: that caring for human life springs from the love of Christ. It also warned that mankind was living in an era of growing fear and weapons of war that raised the specter of ''unimaginable self-destruction.'' 
 Other encyclicals included three statements on economic justice. In 1981, ''Laborem Exercens'' (''On Human Work'') emphasized the social character of labor and the active role of the laborer in completing the task of divine creation; it opposed government control over economies, but seemed to favor collective ownership and management by workers, a kind of democratic socialism.
 ''Sollicitudo Rei Socialis'' (''On Social Concerns''), in 1988, drew an unsparing picture of desperation in poor nations and pockets of deprivation in affluent societies. It blamed the East-West conflict for distorting economic development, criticizing ''liberal capitalism'' and ''Marxist collectivism.'' And it introduced a ''right of economic initiative.'' The church had upheld private property rights in the 19th century, then had gradually acknowledged society's right to regulate property. But the pope's phrase appeared to signal a new respect for innovative, entrepreneurial forces.
 ''Centesimus Annus'' (''The Hundredth Year''), issued in 1991 to mark the centenary of the first major papal statement on social and economic conflicts, analyzed Communism's fall and the economic issues it posed for Eastern Europe. It recognized superior dynamism in market economies over statist ones, but said Communism's failure should not blind capitalist societies to ''quasi-servitude'' in poor nations or the ''idolatry of the market'' in rich ones.
 A 1993 encyclical, ''Veritatis Splendor'' (''The Splendor of Truth''), was a statement of moral theory intended to encourage reflection and discussion. It did not list rights and wrongs, but discussed conscience, reason and freedom, and argued that morality rested on basic truths about human nature and the world, not on individual choice or social consensus.
 In 1995, ''Evangelium Vitae'' (''Gospel of Life'') denounced abortion and euthanasia as ''crimes which no human law can claim to legitimize.'' The pope also urged Catholics to oppose secular laws that violate what he called the fundamental right to life, and he reaffirmed the church's condemnation of contraception, experiments with human embryos and the death penalty.
 John Paul's 13th encyclical, ''Fides et Ratio'' (''Faith and Reason''), perhaps his most personal, marked his 20th anniversary as pope in 1998. Crystallizing a lifetime of philosophical and theological thought, it amplified upon the historic church position that faith and reason are both requisite in the search for truth, and it rejected various modern philosophical trends, including post-Enlightenment rationalism, Marxism and nihilism.
 His 14th and last encyclical, in 2003, was a stern reminder that divorced Catholics who remarry cannot receive communion.
 The pope's conservative views were not hard to trace. Coming as he had from a country where the church was under siege by a totalitarian government, he had found it necessary to reassert tenets of his faith and aggressively confront secular creeds competing with the church for the loyalties of the people.
 To many Catholic leaders, particularly in the Vatican, the church at large was under similar siege when he became pope. The reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's, which revolutionized the church by taking a more accepting attitude toward modernization after centuries of isolation from, and even hostility to, contemporary thought, had not halted the tide of secularization in the church's traditional heartland, Western Europe.
 Indeed, the cultural tumult of the 60's had only reinforced the appeal of revolutionary Marxism, the sexual revolution and other challenges to Catholic tradition. Many theologians, who viewed Pope Paul VI's tenure as a period of drift and uncertainty, regarded the moral authority of the church, and of the papacy, as being in decline.
 John Paul agreed that much of the church was in disarray, its long stability shaken by secularization and permissiveness. In principle, he supported the reforms of Vatican II, and often emphasized the ''collegial'' principle under which the church is governed jointly by the pope and its bishops. But he was convinced that his personal authority was the key, that through his own highly visible, international leadership, he could clarify the principles and invoke the discipline he regarded as necessary to unify and reinvigorate the church.
 But he did not rely on personal charisma alone to carry out what some called his ''restoration.'' In 1983, he approved a revised Code of Canon Law to replace the code promulgated in 1917 and rendered out of date by many of Vatican II's reforms. In 1992, he also approved a new ''universal catechism'' to guide church leaders around the world in presentations of Catholic beliefs. Both documents set firm limits on what were seen as ambiguities and invitations to further change in the documents of Vatican II.
 To remove what he called lingering doubts, in May 1994 he reaffirmed church doctrine that women could not be ordained as priests and said the matter was not even open to debate. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees church teaching, went further in 1995 by declaring that the doctrine of ordaining only men as priests was ''infallibly'' taught -- a designation reserved for teaching on faith and morals that is considered irreversible, free from error and requiring full assent from the faithful.
 The pope carried these church views onto the world's stage. In 1994, as 180 countries planned a United Nations conference in Cairo on the potentially catastrophic population explosion projected for the 21st century, he orchestrated a campaign against draft proposals favoring abortion rights, contraception and other measures endorsed by feminists and population experts.
 The campaign -- the Vatican's most concerted in years on international policy and the pope's most heartfelt since his crusade against Communism -- put a heavy strain on his relationship with President Clinton, who favored safe legalized abortion and efforts to stabilize a global population that experts said could grow to 8.5 billion from 5.7 billion in 35 years.
 The Cairo conference adopted a strong declaration endorsing family planning and giving women more control over their lives to help stabilize populations. But the Vatican shaped the language so that it did not enshrine any universal right to abortion and excluded abortion as a means of family planning.
 In 1995, the pope appeared to be at pains to stress his support for women's rights. He credited the women's movement with positive achievements and offered an apology for injustices against women in the name of the church. But Vatican comments on the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, signaled no major changes in church teaching that portrayed women as mothers, educators and mainstays of the family.
 In a key appointment, John Paul placed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger at the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. A theologian who had campaigned for the openness introduced by Vatican II, Cardinal Ratzinger shared the fear that the church was fragmenting and the belief that the innovations of Vatican II had to be channeled and disciplined.
 With Cardinal Ratzinger giving a new luster and militancy to papal authority and to the conservative theology that had long prevailed in Vatican offices, John Paul's administration took a form that some regarded as a throwback to the monarchical papacies of the 19th century.
 Dissident Catholic theologians were dismissed or excommunicated. Liberal cardinals and bishops were replaced. And in 1998, the pope changed canon law to put many passionately discussed issues, including euthanasia and the ordination of women, beyond the realm of debate for the faithful. He also made it almost impossible for groups like the National Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States to make statements of doctrine or public policy that diverged from the Vatican. In the same vein, in 2003, under the pope's orders, the Vatican admonished all Roman Catholic lawmakers to oppose legalization of same-sex marriage and adoptions by gays and lesbians. In January this year, the pope unequivocally condemned gay marriage.
 Over the years, there were protests, petitions and other acts of dissent, especially in America and Europe, in response to the hard-line stances of the pope. In some countries, church attendance declined, and there were defections by priests. Predominantly Catholic Ireland voted to remove its constitutional ban on divorce, and 1.5 million Catholics in Germany signed petitions calling for the ordination of women. Italy, 84 percent Catholic, was a living protest in the 1990's: it had Europe's lowest birthrate, a sign of popular disdain for prohibitions on artificial birth control.

Crisis and Change
 No one doubted the power of John Paul's voice or the depth of the feelings he evoked. But his personal popularity aside, many Catholics -- especially in America and Western Europe -- were distressed by his unswerving opposition to change, even in the face of crisis. The depth of distress was never more profound than in the priest-pedophile scandals in America, which broke in 2002 after decades of predatory abuse and suffering hidden by out-of-court settlements with victims and a revolving door of treatment and new assignments for offending priests.
 The scandals exploded in January after disclosures that Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston had for years sent the Rev. John J. Geoghan Jr. from parish to parish, despite accusations of serial pedophilia. He was eventually accused of molesting 130 children and sentenced in one case to 9 to 10 years in prison. In August 2003, the defrocked Mr. Geoghan was strangled by an inmate at a Massachusetts prison.
 Cardinal Law, under pressure, gave prosecutors the names of 80 priests accused of sexual abuse over the decades, although the Massachusetts attorney general eventually reported that at least 789 children and probably more than 1,000 had been sexually abused by 250 priests and other church workers in the Boston Archdiocese since 1940.
 Within weeks of the disclosures, bishops across the country began a purge, removing scores of accused priests and turning names, dates and details over to prosecutors. Emboldened, hundreds of victims made accusations, many of them decades old and unprosecutable under statutes of limitations. But some criminal cases were prosecuted and hundreds of civil suits were filed. Facing enormous settlements and financial crises, some dioceses had to sell property.
 Polls showed growing disaffection among Catholics, and for months the pope and the Vatican remained aloof. But in April 2002, after the American bishops asked for guidance, the pope summoned America's cardinals to Rome for a conference on the scandals. It produced no sweeping changes. 
 The pope acknowledged the suffering and offered an expression of concern that was taken by many to be an apology. Calling the abuse criminal and ''an appalling sin in the eyes of God,'' he said, ''To the victims and their families wherever they may be, I express my profound sense of solidarity and concern.''
 But he sent conflicting signals on a proposed zero-tolerance policy, saying there was no place in the priesthood for those who abused minors, but then suggesting that some offenders might warrant a second chance. 
 ''We cannot forget the power of Christian conversion, that radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God, which reaches to the depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary change,'' he said.
 American cardinals proposed removing some priests who abused minors, but drew a distinction between serial predators and those who were ''not notorious.'' The ambiguity was unresolved, even after American bishops, meeting in Dallas in June, voted overwhelmingly for a policy that called for the removal of any priest who had ever sexually abused a minor, and for increased cooperation with law-enforcement and a national lay board to monitor progress.
 Instead of approving the policies, however, the Vatican voiced reservations, saying the bishops had gone too far in eschewing a statute of limitations, in broadly defining child sexual abuse and in requiring that all sex abuse claims be reported to the police. The Vatican said some of the remedies might violate canon laws that protect the rights of priests, and it recommended further ''reflection'' by a commission partly controlled by Vatican emissaries.
 Cardinal Law, after nearly a year of protests and abuse lawsuits with $100 million in claims that threatened his archdiocese with bankruptcy, resigned as archbishop of Boston in December 2002. He was succeeded in July 2003 by Bishop Sean P. O'Malley, a Franciscan friar who swiftly met with some abuse victims and began trying to heal the wounds with financial settlements and a new tone of open dialogue. Last year, the pope chose Cardinal Law to head St. Mary Major Basilica in Rome. 
 Aside from the sex scandals, many American Catholics said the church and the pope were out of touch. Women, blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, and even some priests and nuns urged him to be more sensitive to their needs. He usually voiced sympathy, but urged the supplicants to remain faithful to church teachings, which were not altered.
 The result was a restoration of strong centralized authority in the pope. While that strength endeared him and the church to many, it repelled others who believed that the future of Roman Catholicism lay in greater diversity and flexibility, dispersal of power and adaptability in a swiftly changing world.

Jews and Palestinians
 The pope's relations with Jews were both troubled and pathbreaking. More than any modern pope, John Paul moved boldly to end the estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of individual Catholics to act against the Holocaust, the first to call anti-Semitism a sin ''against God and man,'' and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy Land.
 Jews were often dismayed with his decisions and pronouncements. But he established diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel and set the course of Catholic-Jewish relations on a high plane of engagement and warmth, in contrast to the distance and frigidity of earlier eras.
 His 1982 meeting at the Vatican with Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was met with blistering criticism from the government of Israel and from Jews around the world. The pope said afterward that he only wanted to foster peace in the Middle East. And he would not be deterred: he met Mr. Arafat eight more times.
 The Vatican supported peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians, but debate over the status of Jerusalem was a continuous sore point: Israel saw the city as its ''united and eternal'' capital, while the Vatican pressed for its recognition as a city holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.
 Long troubled by the failure of Pope Pius XII to condemn publicly the killing of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War II, leaders of Jewish groups were outraged at John Paul's Vatican meeting in 1987 with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria, who had served in a German Army unit implicated in the deportation of Jews in Greece.
 The pope wrote an apostolic letter in 1989 evoking Christian sorrow over the Holocaust, and in 1998 -- a decade after promising to do so -- issued a historic document, ''We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah,'' which apologized for the failure of many Catholics to protect Jews in the Holocaust.
 While the Vatican viewed the document as groundbreaking, many Jewish groups rejected it because it praised Pius XII's ''quiet diplomacy'' and did not cite his failure to speak out against the Holocaust. The church held that Pius had personally helped to save thousands of Jews, but did not publicly criticize the Nazis for fear that even more Jews as well as Catholics might be killed.
 Even after John Paul delivered the most sweeping apology ever made by a pope -- a public act of repentance for the errors and misdeeds of Catholics over the last 2,000 years that was woven into the liturgy of a Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica on March 12, 2000 -- Jewish critics were quick to note that he had not specifically mentioned the church's behavior during the Holocaust.
 Leading Jews constantly scrutinized papal statements and often decried phrases in which they detected rebukes of Jews for rejecting Christianity or suggestions that Judaism's validity was exhausted with the coming of Jesus.
 Papal aides said the criticisms had stung the pope, who spoke often of a common Christian-Jewish biblical heritage and made other overtures to Jews. In 1985, he met Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel at the Vatican, and in 1986 made the first recorded visit by a pope to a synagogue, entering Rome's Central Synagogue and, to ringing applause, hailing Jews as ''our elder brothers.''
 The wounds were reopened from time to time. Jews were outraged when nuns set up a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1984. Polish Catholic leaders said it would be relocated by 1989. But the deadline passed, Jewish protesters entered the grounds, and Cardinal Josef Glemp of Warsaw denounced them in a way that sounded anti-Semitic. The convent was finally closed in 1993 by a papal order.
 In 1990, Jewish and Catholic leaders met in Prague and pledged to combat outbreaks of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Eastern Europe. The pope endorsed a call for Christian ''repentance'' for anti-Semitism made by Archbishop Edward I. Cassidy, head of the Vatican office for relations with Jews, and John Paul's standing with many Jews had been restored by 1992, when a group was formed to study diplomatic relations.

Ties With Israel
 After 17 months of talks, the Vatican and Israel formally recognized one another with diplomatic accords in December 1993, and six months later, in June 1994, the Holy See and Jerusalem established full diplomatic relations with an exchange of ambassadors. It was a political and religious milestone.
 But within months, the relationship was troubled anew. In August 1994, John Paul conferred a papal knighthood on Mr. Waldheim, citing his peace efforts as United Nations secretary general from 1972 to 1980. Israeli and other Jewish leaders were outraged that the pope had honored a man who had served with Nazi units that massacred civilians, executed prisoners and deported Jews in the Balkans. Mr. Waldheim disavowed any war crimes, but the Justice Department called his denials unconvincing and after 1987 barred him from the United States.
 Another painful issue for Jews -- a cross erected at Auschwitz to commemorate the pope's 1979 visit -- arose on a trip to his homeland in 1999, when Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, approached him on a receiving line and introduced himself as a survivor of the death camp. ''I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,'' the rabbi said. ''I ask Mr. Pope to give a call to his people to also take this cross away from the camp.''
 If the pope was offended, he gave no sign, listening patiently and replying quietly. But a papal spokesman later called the cross a ''local issue'' and not a Vatican concern. 
 Jewish criticism of the pope was vociferous again when he beatified -- and in 1998 canonized -- a German convert from Judaism, Edith Stein, who became a Carmelite nun and was gassed by the Nazis at Auschwitz in 1942. While she was declared a saint as a Christian martyr, many Jews, including her relatives, insisted that she had been killed because of her Jewish background.
 The pope acknowledged as much, but failed to mollify critics, who were also incensed by his beatification of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, the archbishop of Zagreb during World War II, when a Nazi puppet regime ruled Croatia and 700,000 Serbs, Jews and others were sent to death camps.
 When John Paul finally made a six-day journey to the Holy Land in March 2000, it was widely seen as a personal triumph and high point of his reign -- a poignant blend of sacred and secular gestures delicately balanced in a land revered by all the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
 There had never been an official papal visit to the Holy Land, though Paul VI had made an informal trip there in 1964, staying only 12 hours and pointedly never referring to Israel. (John Paul, as Karol Wojtyla, the archbishop of Krakow, had visited Jerusalem in 1963.)
 John Paul made his long-awaited pilgrimage amid heavy security, traveling first to Mount Nebo in Jordan, where the Bible says Moses first looked out over the Promised Land, and on to Amman and the Jordan River site where Jesus is said to have been baptized.
 In Tel Aviv, President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak received the pope as one of the most important visitors in Israel's history, and his presence in Jerusalem later was hailed by Israeli leaders as nothing less than a Christian affirmation of the Jewish right to a homeland.
 For Palestinian leaders, his presence was also a symbolic triumph. He went to Mr. Arafat's home in Bethlehem and to a squalid Palestinian refugee camp. Mr. Arafat called his visit a ringing endorsement of Palestinian nationalist aspirations and a recognition of Palestinian suffering under Israeli rule.
 In gestures to Israel's tiny Christian populations that were also moving personal experiences, the pope visited sites venerated as those of Jesus' birth, Last Supper, Crucifixion, burial and Resurrection. He also met the Greek Orthodox patriarch and leaders of the Maronite Christians, Armenian Catholics, Melchites and Chaldeans.
 In Jerusalem, he saw the Ashkenazic and Sephardic chief rabbis, and went to Al Aksa Mosque to meet Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the city's chief Islamic cleric. He went to the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, and, following the custom of Jewish visitors, placed a note in a crevice, a plea for reconciliation that was the theme of his pilgrimage. At Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, he paid homage to the six million victims of Nazi persecution.

Politics and Religion
 Closer to home, the pope often found himself at odds with Italians. Many were harshly critical of him for leading a campaign in 1981 to repeal Italy's liberal abortion law. The voters upheld abortion rights, and many resented what they called his interference. 
 In 1985, the Italian government and the Vatican signed an historic concordat disestablishing Roman Catholicism as the state religion; the pope said it showed church respect for Italy's independence, although he reserved the right to speak out on national issues. In 2002, John Paul became the first pope to visit the Italian Parliament, and used the occasion to call for the enactment of policies to encourage and support larger Italian families.
 He was also criticized inside and outside the church for his opposition to ''liberation theology,'' a school of thought originating in Latin America but influential elsewhere too. Blending biblical themes with Marxist and sometimes Leninist economic analyses, it was an underlying justification for the Catholic clergy's involvement in political struggles for justice for the poor in Latin America and other parts of the third world.
 For years, John Paul tried to draw a delicate boundary between religious and political involvement, saying that concern for social justice was the rightful function of the Catholic clergy but that outright political action violated the calling of nuns and priests. Class struggle, he said, could not be the church's solution to social injustice.
 In Latin America particularly, the clergy's resistance to the noninvolvement doctrine was strong. The Rev. Leonardo Boff of Brazil, a movement leader, was silenced by Rome for a year; in 1992 he resigned from the priesthood to protest Vatican restrictions on writings by the clergy and members of religious orders.
 Another champion of liberation theology, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected president of Haiti, denounced the Vatican in 1992 for recognizing military leaders who had deposed him in 1991. Since 1982, when he became a priest, Father Aristide had excoriated the Haitian church for what he called its complicity with brutal dictatorships. He left the priesthood after being returned to power by United States forces in 1994, and was overthrown last year amid violent protests and charges of corruption.
 Even some members of the Curia, the Vatican's central administration, were disenchanted with the pope. Speaking behind cloaks of anonymity, some contended that he was a poor administrator, neglected necessary paperwork, spent too much time traveling and was too much the showman. Some Vatican prelates said that in private he was somber, serious, enigmatic, sometimes quixotic, a man who hid his feelings and did not say much.
 Critics said he devoted too much attention to Poland and Eastern Europe and not enough to Western Europe early in his papacy. But his refusal to accept the Iron Curtain contributed forcefully to Communism's fall, and in later years he generally supported European political and cultural unification. He also made religious reconciliation a major concern.
 There were grand ecumenical gestures. Besides his visit to the synagogue in Rome, he embraced the archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral in England in 1982 and prayed with another archbishop of Canterbury at the Vatican in 1996. In 2003, he met another Anglican archbishop, Rowan Williams, at the Vatican, and warned him against the ordination of gay priests, a matter that had deeply divided Anglicans. The Church of Rome and the Church of England studied ways to end a 450-year rift, but nothing came of it.
 The pope also made overtures to Eastern Orthodoxy. In May 1999, he visited Bucharest, Romania, and prayed with Patriarch Teoctist; it was the first papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in nearly a thousand years. The schism that had kept Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christians apart since 1054 was not ended, but the visit was an ecumenical waymark.
 Six months later, the pope visited Georgia, in the Caucasus, another mainly Orthodox country. He was greeted warmly by President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who also helped prod Communism's fall, but his reception by Georgian Orthodox Church leaders was guarded.
 On the same trip, his last of the millennium, the pope went to India, where Christians, a tiny fraction of the population, had been the target of beatings, killings and other persecution. He met Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious leaders, but won no support for his plea for toleration of his church's hope to evangelize Asia. 
 He undertook other interfaith dialogues. In 1983, he joined a Lutheran service and praised Martin Luther on the 500th birthday of the Reformation's leader. But no major agreements or ecclesiastical changes emerged from those contacts, and most theologians said John Paul, for all his good will toward other faiths, had not substantially advanced the ecumenical cause.

An Astonishing Succession
 He was a poet, a playwright, the author of many books and hundreds of articles, a philosopher, a formidable debater, an actor, an athlete with a passion for skiing, swimming and mountain climbing, a professor of social ethics and a linguist fluent in seven languages and skilled in a dozen. But at the time of his election as 264th bishop of Rome, the pope was almost unknown outside the church hierarchy and his native Poland, where he had been a priest since 1946, the archbishop of Krakow since 1964 and a cardinal since 1967.
 There had never been a Slavic pope. The last pontificate of a non-Italian -- that of Adrian VI, a Dutchman from Utrecht -- had ended 455 years earlier, in the era of Luther's rebellion in Germany. There had been 45 Italians on the throne of St. Peter since then.
 After the death of Pope Paul VI on Aug. 6, 1978, a majority of the College of Cardinals -- the body that elects the pope -- agreed that his successor should be an Italian but not connected with the Curia. On Aug. 26, the college elected Cardinal Albino Luciani, patriarch of Venice, who assumed the name John Paul I, combining those of his immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI, an expression of continuity he intended to preserve.
 But John Paul I died a month later, on Sept. 28, and the cardinals returned for a new conclave starting Oct. 14. Predictions were that the successor would again be an Italian. But a rift developed among Italian cardinals, the largest national group in the college, and forced a compromise.
 Conservatives had rallied to Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, archbishop of Genoa, a champion of orthodoxy and a candidate in every conclave since the death of Pius XII in 1958. Most moderates wanted Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, archbishop of Florence and an aide to Paul VI. In early balloting, neither came close to the required two-thirds plus one -- 75 of 111 participants -- and a search for a compromise candidate ensued.
 The name of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland was raised by Cardinal John Krol, the Polish-American archbishop of Philadelphia, and by Cardinal Franz Konig, archbishop of Vienna, and prelates from West Germany.
 Cardinal Wojtyla was an attractive candidate, theologically orthodox yet a man of personal dynamism and proven political skills who could reach out to Eastern Europe and the peoples of Communist nations and the third world, one who could be a spokesman for peace, disarmament and justice in the world.
 He had been a tough opponent of the Nazis, the Marxists and the Stalinists in Poland and was emerging as a bold voice within the church. He was also physically vigorous and only 58, 10 years younger than most popes elected in this century, and he could be expected to have a long pontificate.
 His election, on the eighth ballot, met with almost universal astonishment outside the Sistine Chapel. But among Poland's 31 million Catholics, 92 percent of the population, and among millions of Americans of Polish descent, it was an occasion for pride and celebration that went on for days.
 The new pope quickly set to work to put his stamp on the papacy. There were clues to its character in his earliest pronouncements. Addressing crowds on the night of his election, he twice invoked the name of the Virgin Mary and vowed total trust in her, a signal of doctrinal conservatism that would be a hallmark of his reign.
 His greeting, ''Praised be Jesus Christ'' -- an ancient earthy phrase used by Polish peasants and others in deeply Catholic rural areas of Europe, but one having an archaic ring in cosmopolitan Rome -- was a sign that whatever lofty locutions were to come, his papacy would be rooted in his own humble origins.
 Accordingly, he put decorum aside and stripped daily life in the Vatican of many of its ceremonial frills. He eschewed the papal pronoun ''we'' in favor of ''I'' and did away with the pomp of a traditional triple-crown investiture, substituting an outdoor inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square that was attended by 100,000 people and seen on television around the world.
 Ignoring the usual papal preoccupation with the Curia's bureaucracy, he made it known that not all Vatican administrators would keep their jobs. In an early move to pre-empt opposition, he received the intransigent traditionalist French prelate, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who had been suspended two years earlier. The archbishop was excommunicated before he died.
 The pope also received Andrei A. Gromyko, the Soviet foreign minister, and asserted that dialogue with the Communist nations was the ''only way to ease'' mutual problems. And he met the leaders of various world Jewish organizations and called for ''a fraternal dialogue and fruitful cooperation.''

Outdoorsman and Athlete
 The new pope had been an athlete and outdoorsman all his life, a soccer player, backpacker, camper, boater and long-distance runner, and he looked it. He was solidly built and vigorous, with a bullish neck and strong, stooped shoulders that hinted of his youth as a laborer and factory worker. He moved with a deliberate, confident step, a graceful man for his size.
 He was 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. His graying, once blondish hair was close-cropped, and his eyes were dark and deeply expressive, sometimes wide with mirth, sometimes narrowed to slits of concentration. His hands were fascinating: big, creased, workman's hands that swept the air in gestures of mildness or came together, poised to pray.
 He did not smoke, but he liked a glass of wine with meals. He wrote many of his own speeches and other pronouncements longhand. While for some it shattered an old-fashioned papal image, he liked to chat, to joke and to laugh heartily. He loved to swim and refused to give it up, so he had a pool built at the summer palace at Castel Gandolfo. Word that the pope was taking daily dips caused no little stir and delighted cartoonists, who pictured him in the water with a miter on his head. When a high-ranking prelate suggested that the pool must have been expensive, the pope quipped, ''Holding another conclave to elect a new pope would cost even more.''
 He had traveled widely as a cardinal, visiting the United States in 1969 and 1976, Australia and Polynesia in 1973 and most of the countries of Europe on regular pilgrimages from Poland to Rome, and he resolved early to continue his sojourns as pope. His command of languages -- including Polish, Latin, Italian, French, German, Spanish and English -- was an enormous advantage, allowing him to speak directly to people nearly everywhere, from podiums and in the streets. In January 1979, his first trip outside Italy as pope was to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, where millions heard him voice concern for the oppressed. He also rejected notions of Christ as a political or revolutionary figure, called the church's mission religious and not social or political, and added, ''The church wishes to stay free with regard to the competing systems.''

A Fateful Visit
 His first journey to Poland, in June 1979, proved to be one of his most important trips. There was no way to know at the time, but the visit was, many historians say, the beginning of the end for Communism in the Soviet sphere -- proof for all that the raw power of government could not overcome the power of faith.
 It began just after the 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Stanislaus, Poland's patron saint, and it exposed weaknesses in the Polish Communist government, which had long sought to extinguish fires of Catholicism.
 The government first rejected a visit. Then, trying to limit the impact, it restricted his itinerary, muted advance publicity and refused to let workers take time off. But all that made no difference. From the moment he arrived and knelt to kiss the Polish earth until his tearful departure nine days later, his homecoming was a succession of thundering triumphs.
 From Warsaw to Auschwitz to Krakow, in 36 public appearances, he clasped old friends in headlocks, sang hymns and folk songs with his people, offered Masses for throngs that stretched across hillsides, and without directly attacking the government repeatedly challenged its authority. ''Christ cannot be kept out of the history of man in any part of the globe,'' he told vast crowds in Warsaw. ''The exclusion of Christ from the history of man is an act against man.''
 Coal miners, housewives, university students, young people in blue jeans -- 13 million people of every age and description -- turned out to see him. They strewed his way with flowers, they sobbed joyously, and they broke into chants like football fans: ''We want God! We want God! We want God!''
 In Gniezno after an open-air Mass for 100,000 young people, the pope joined in singing popular songs. In Czestochowa, 500,000 pilgrims fell to their knees when he reconsecrated the nation to Mary, ''queen of Poland.'' At Auschwitz, where a million people, mostly Jews, had been killed by the Nazis, he spoke of this place ''built on hatred and contempt for man in the name of an insane ideology.'' Referring to a dedication in Hebrew for victims, he declared: ''It is not permissible for anyone to pass by this inscription with indifference.''
 Months later, the pope's role as a moral leader was reinforced by a journey to Ireland and the United States. He was eager to confront sectarian strife in Ulster, the erosion of the Irish church to secularization, and in the United States a church caught in turbulent debate over birth control, abortion, the role of women in the ministry and other issues.
 His outdoor Mass in Dublin drew 1.2 million people. In Drogheda, near the border of Northern Ireland, he begged Catholics, Protestants and especially the militant Irish Republican Army to ''turn away from the path of violence.''
 In the United States, with 50 million Roman Catholics, he was a dramatic new figure in a world that seemed to lack outstanding leaders. Visiting six cities and rural Iowa in seven days, he captured national attention continuously, his every word and gesture televised and chronicled in the press. Vast crowds lined his routes, attended his masses, heard his homilies and joined the spectacles. At each stop -- in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Des Moines, Chicago and Washington -- virtual holidays were declared, and public officials outdid each other with receptions of staggering magnitude.
 For two whirlwind days, he dominated life in New York City. He addressed the United Nations, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, offered Mass at Yankee Stadium and engaged in a playful dialogue with young people rallying at Madison Square Garden. He visited a church in Harlem, rode in a rain-soaked ticker-tape parade on lower Broadway and addressed crowds at Battery Park and Shea Stadium.
 He often waded into enormous, friendly crowds, hugging and kissing people, saluting neighborhoods and church groups. At the Battery in a pouring rain, he said: ''I address a special word to the leaders of the Jewish community, whose presence here honors me greatly. Shalom! Peace be with you.''
 There were protests. In Washington, Sister Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, surprised the pope in introducing him to an audience of nuns by saying, ''The church must regard the possibility of women being included in all the ministries of the church.''
 And when he had gone, questions remained: Was the pope inflexible? Did he recognize deep frustrations of Catholics who disagreed with church teaching on sexual matters, the roles of women and the clergy? Was there even room for discussion?

An Assassination Attempt
 John Paul's life as a robust, traveling teacher-pope appeared to have been altered on May 13, 1981, when a 23-year-old Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, shot him as he rode in an open car before 10,000 people in St. Peter's Square. Bystanders seized the gunman as the pope's car sped away to Gemelli Hospital. Shot in the abdomen, right arm and left hand, he underwent five hours of surgery, and part of an intestine was removed.
 Investigators searching Mr. Agca's past learned that he was a murderer who had escaped from a Turkish prison in 1979 and had ties to a neo-Nazi group, the Gray Wolves. But no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the pope was found. Mr. Agca was tried by the Italian authorities and sentenced to life in prison.
 The assailant later said the shooting was a Soviet-inspired plot involving Bulgarian and Turkish agents, and investigators uncovered tantalizing details that seemed to support some of his assertions. But an Italian court in 1986 found the evidence ambiguous and acquitted three Bulgarians and three Turks of conspiracy in the case. A link between the attack and the Bulgarian government was often asserted, but never proved.
 The pope publicly forgave Mr. Agca, and in 1999 the Vatican endorsed clemency. In 2000, the Italian government pardoned Mr. Agca, who was extradited to Turkey and began serving a 10-year term for the murder of a newspaper editor in 1979.
 On May 13, 2000, exactly 19 years after the shooting, the Vatican disclosed that a vision of the attempt on the pope's life was the so-called third secret of Fatima, the last of three prophecies revealed to three Portuguese shepherd children by an apparition of the Virgin on May 13, 1917, at Fatima, Portugal.
 Fatima historians say the first secret prophesied the end of World War I and the coming of World War II, while the second supposedly predicted the spread and collapse of Communism and the resurgence of Christianity in Russia. The third, written and sent to Rome by one of the three recipients, Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, who became a Carmelite nun, was kept secret by five popes.
 Fascination over the secret spawned conspiracy theories and doomsday cults, with conjectures ranging from a Catholic schism with rival papacies to nuclear annihilation. Devotees of apocalypse were deflated by the Vatican explanation. The pope did not comment, though he always credited the Virgin of Fatima with sparing his life in the shooting.

Health, Good and Bad
 Despite the seriousness of his wounds, the pope recovered, and in the years that followed, his old vigor returned, his health was strikingly good, and he was laid low by nothing worse than influenza until July 1992, when was hospitalized for a stomach problem. It turned out to be serious. Doctors excised a tumor the size of an orange from his colon and removed his gallbladder. The tumor was in an early stage of malignancy, but no chemotherapy or other treatment was deemed necessary, and he was traveling again within three months.
 In November 1993, there was another flutter of concern when the pope tripped on the hem of his robe and fell as he descended three steps from his throne to greet visitors at the Vatican. He suffered a fractured and dislocated right shoulder, which had to be encased in a soft cast.
 Five months later, in April 1994, he fell as he climbed from a bathtub in his Vatican apartment, fracturing and dislocating his right thighbone. Surgeons replaced part of the bone near the hip socket with metal alloys.
 The pope fell again in 1999 on a trip to Poland, suffering a head cut that required three stitches. By then, he had grown frail and had difficulty walking, even with a cane. There were other symptoms: trembling in his left hand and slurred speech that made it hard to understand his words. Privately, officials said he had Parkinson's disease and crippling arthritis; the Vatican did not confirm the diagnoses, but there was no doubt about them.
 By 2002, the symptoms had profoundly worsened: he could not walk without aid, his hands shook so much he could not hold his speeches, and his speech was so slurred he was almost impossible to understand. In 2003, he traveled to Spain, Croatia, Bosnia, Poland and Slovakia, but sometimes garbled words and let aides finish his speeches.
 During his convalescences -- from the shooting, the tumor operation and the falls -- some Vatican officials privately expressed hope that he would be forced to settle down, travel less and get more involved in the problems of running the church. But John Paul, who hated to be coddled and sometimes brushed off aides who tried to help him, was determined to continue his busy life.

A Traveling Papacy
 Six months after the 1981 shooting, he ventured to Umbria, in central Italy, and was soon planning new travels. In 1982 he visited 12 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, and by 1983 was traveling as widely as ever. Over the next few years he went back to Africa, Europe, South America, the Caribbean and the Far East, often to third-world countries, where the church was flourishing.
 While he went to Africa a dozen times, he refused for years to visit South Africa because of its apartheid racial policies. But after Pretoria's peaceful transition to a non-racial Democracy, he went to Johannesburg in 1995, met President Nelson Mandela and praised the reconciliation.
 In 1986, the pope took a particularly long and exotic journey: two weeks and 30,000 miles to Bangladesh, Singapore, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. He was greeted by women in saris dancing to the rhythms of sitars, aborigines in loincloths and painted faces, spear-toting tribesmen who rubbed noses with him, and bare-breasted Papuan women fluttering in traditional grass skirts.
 Later that year in Calcutta, India, where countless thousands slept in streets or mud huts, he went to Mother Teresa's hospice; four people died on the day of his visit. The pope was at a loss for words as he carried food among the wasted bodies. After nine days in India, he spoke of birth control guardedly and did not criticize India's government, which advocated contraception in the face of a growing population and widespread poverty.
 The pope's second trip to the United States, in September 1987, included stops in Miami, Columbia, S.C., New Orleans, San Antonio, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Monterey, Calif., San Francisco and Detroit. He met the nation's 300 Catholic bishops in Los Angeles, and was asked to understand the attitudes of Americans.
 In June 1993, he addressed for the first time what many American Catholics regarded as a crisis in the making: reports of sexual abuse by priests of children and teen-agers. In a letter to American bishops, he expressed sorrow for the victims and over demoralization inflicted on the church.
 He returned to the United States in August 1993, stopping first in Jamaica and Mexico. In four days in Denver, he met President Clinton, joined 150,000 Catholics from 70 nations at a World Youth Day festival and denounced abortion and violence. But it was the enthusiasm for the pope -- the chanting, roaring stuff of football games or rock concerts -- that made the headlines.
 A month later, the pope made his first trip to the Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which had been Soviet republics from 1940 to 1991. The collapse of the Soviet yoke had exposed again the tangle of nationalistic, ethnic and religious rivalries from the Baltic to the Black Sea. And while the pope called for reconciliation, his visit seemed to underscore the harsh reality that mere good will could not resolve ancient bitter enmities.
 In 1994, he canceled a visit to Sarajevo; Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, said his safety could not be guaranteed. But he took his call for an end to fratricidal war to Zagreb, Croatia. The pope in 1995 seemed ubiquitous: in Asia and Oceania in January (four million people attended his outdoor Mass in Manila), in the Czech Republic and Poland in May, in Belgium in June, in Slovakia in July, in Africa in September and the United States in October.
 His fourth journey to America, a five-day trip, took him back to New York, and for the first time to New Jersey and Maryland. As if making up for a canceled 1994 visit with an exhausting schedule, he saw Mr. Clinton, recited vespers in Newark, addressed the United Nations on its 50th anniversary and celebrated Masses at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands, Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens, Central Park in Manhattan and Camden Yards in Baltimore.
 Despite his growing frailty -- the slow step, the stooped shoulders, the persistent shaking hand -- the pope, always a workaholic, continued his travels: in 1996 to Venezuela, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Tunisia, Germany, Hungary and France; in 1997 to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Lebanon, Poland, France and Brazil; and in 1998 to Cuba, Nigeria and Austria.
 In Cuba, with President Fidel Castro at his side, the pope appealed for human rights, urged the release of political prisoners and, without citing America's 37-year economic embargo, said such sanctions hurt the needy. Months later, Cuba freed 300 political prisoners and Mr. Clinton eased restrictions on aid, direct flights to Cuba and money sent to relatives by Cuban-Americans.
 The pope made his fifth and last trip to the United States in January 1999. After four days in Mexico, where he challenged entrenched corruption and voiced support for the poor, he went to St. Louis, his only stop, and met briefly again with Mr. Clinton, who was facing impeachment at the time, and with Rosa Parks, the heroine of the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott. To 100,000 people, he decried the death penalty, which was favored by many American Catholics, and homelessness and the spread of gangs, drugs and sexual abuse.
 In 1999, he went back to a liberated Poland for 13 nostalgic days. Greeted everywhere by huge, ecstatic crowds acutely aware of his place in national and world history, he prayed at the graves of his parents near Krakow, visited his hometown, Wadowice, and beatified 108 Poles killed by the Nazis. He made his final trip to his homeland in August 2002, an emotional farewell in which he asked people to pray for him.

Challenges and Controversy
 While the pope's travels were the most visible aspects of his papacy, his less spectacular pronouncements and actions were no less important and often much more controversial.
 In 1980, he caused a stir by ordering the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Jesuit priest who represented a Massachusetts district in Congress, not to seek re-election. Father Drinan complied, but ambiguity clouded the episode. The pope had often called politics and the priesthood incompatible, but it was not clear why Father Drinan had been singled out. Some suggested he had been made an example because many Jesuits were involved in third-world political struggles.
 At a Synod of Bishops in Rome that year, many Western prelates openly chafed at what they saw as the pope's inflexiblity on divorce, abortion and artificial birth control. Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco cited studies showing that 76.5 percent of American Catholic women used contraceptives and that only 29 percent of American priests believed it was immoral. Other prelates argued that Catholics who used contraceptives could not be dismissed as ''obdurate, ignorant'' people. But the ripples of unrest produced no doctrinal changes.
 Indeed, stronger challenges were met with sterner measures. In 1986, the Rev. Charles E. Curran, a theologian who had dissented on birth control and other sexual questions, was stripped by the Vatican of his right to teach at the Catholic University of America after he refused to retract his views.
 On other ethical questions, he warned of dangers he said were posed by organ transplants, genetic experiments, artificial insemination, birth and fertility controls, and new drugs. On another matter, he conceded -- 350 years after the fact -- that the church had been wrong to persecute Galileo for saying the earth circles the sun, not the other way around. Seeking to rectify an infamous case of dogma over reason, the pope in 1992 said the astronomer-physicist should not have been forced in 1633, under threat of death, to recant his discoveries.
 In 1996, the pope also acknowledged that the human body might not have been the immediate creation of God, but was the product of evolution, which he called ''more than just a hypothesis.'' The church had never condemned Darwin, but had warned that his ideas played into the hands of materialists and atheists.
 While confronting external church problems, John Paul also moved within by changing its hierarchy. His appointments of John J. O'Connor and his successor, Edward M. Egan, as archbishop in New York; Bernard F. Law as archbishop in Boston; and Francis E. George to replace Cardinal Joseph Bernardin as archbishop in Chicago drew the liberal American church back to more conservative ground.
 He further internationalized the Sacred College of Cardinals, which for centuries had a disproportionate number of Italians, by appointing many new cardinals from the third world. In 1994, he appointed 30 cardinals from 24 nations, bringing to 62 the number of nations represented; he appointed 22 more cardinals in 1998, 42 more in 2001 and 31 more in 2003.
 The pope had a good relationship with the administration of President Ronald Reagan, which opened an embassy to the Holy See in 1984. But he rebuffed its claim that he backed its Central America policies, including aid to the rebels known as contras who fought the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The pope held that Central American nations should work out their own problems. 
 His posture toward the two Bush administrations and the Clinton administration was cordial, but strained by the pope's opposition to the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Mr. Clinton's support of abortion rights and the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
 Similarly, the pope often urged peace in the Middle East and said he looked with sympathy on Israelis and Palestinians, whose traditions, he said, ''should be granted equal respect.'' But his appeals never proposed concrete solutions to their age-old problems.
 Poland was an exception to his balanced, above-the-fray pronouncements. In 1980, he sang a Polish patriotic hymn in St. Peter's Square and vowed, ''We in Rome are united with our countrymen in Poland.'' He often voiced support for the outlawed Solidarity union, calling it a model for human rights struggles.
 To laymen who opposed autocratic regimes, the pope usually urged restraint, and to warring rebels he pleaded for a farewell to arms. In Peru, he urged the guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement to follow ''the roads of dialogue and not those of violence.''
 The pope also issued emotional appeals to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and President George H.W. Bush before the 1991 attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait. In 2003, he urged that the United Nations take the lead in countering Mr. Hussein. While papal statements often sounded antiwar, he denied that he favored a pacifist rejection of all warfare, noting that states had a right to defend themselves.
 With the collapse of Soviet Communism, John Paul's long crusade against its political and economic tyrannies seemed to be over. But he was still troubled by what he saw as its unpalatable successors -- unbridled Western capitalism and Communism returning by stealth in Eastern Europe. And he seemed to have no special perspective on the friction between Islam and the West that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

A Promising Early Life
 Spiritually, Karol Jozef Wojtyla was never far from the land of his birth. He was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, 30 miles southwest of Krakow, the second of two children in a strict Catholic family. His mother, Emilia Kaczorowska Wojtyla, of Lithuanian descent, died when he was 9. His father, Karol Wojtyla, was a sergeant in the Polish Army's quartermaster corps.
 Young Karol was a good student in elementary and secondary schools, with a talent for languages and an interest in poetry, drama and literature. He also excelled in athletics, playing goalkeeper on his school soccer team, and in dramatics. He was popular with teachers and classmates, who called him Karolek (Little Charles) or Lolek.
 His family was not well off. An old school employee recalled that ''Karolek always wore blue trousers that had clearly been cut from his father's discarded uniforms.'' When he was 18, his father, who had retired with a small pension, moved the family from Wadowice to Krakow. Karol's brother, Edmund, a doctor, died before the outbreak of World War II.
 After high school, Karol enrolled at Jagiellonian University in Krakow. But in 1939, the invading Nazis closed the university. His studies interrupted, he took a job in a stone quarry to help his ailing father make ends meet. Later, he found a laborer's job at the Solvay Chemical Works, where he helped organize a plant cafeteria.
 The factory job provided him with a work card that protected him from deportation to a labor camp in German-occupied Poland. His fellow workers remembered him as already deeply religious: he could often be seen praying during rest periods.
 Outside work, he fell in with other young intellectuals and, with a friend, founded an underground drama group, the Rhapsodic Theater. Its productions were staged in homes, with Karol playing leads before small audiences of students and artists. Some early friends said that acting was his first love and that they had been surprised to see him turn to the priesthood.
 He had a rich baritone voice and liked to sing popular songs at parties, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also wrote plays and poetry. One of his dramas, a morality play called ''The Goldsmith's Shop'' written under the pen name Andrzej Jawien, was translated into Italian and broadcast over Italian radio after the playwright became pope; it was also made into a 1987 film.
 His father's death in 1941 deeply distressed the young man. A close friend at the time was Jan Tyranowski, a tailor and a mystic who introduced him to the works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish Carmelite mystical monk. Later, the future pope would write a postgraduate thesis on St. John.
 There were reports that Karol Wojtyla was a member of the Polish resistance in World War II. Mieczyslaw Malinski, a friend who became a priest, scoffed at the accounts. He said that members of the underground had asked them both to join the fight against the Nazis, but that the two had declined. But Joseph L. Lichten, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in Rome, said that a Karol Wojtyla was active in a clandestine group that worked with the Christian Democratic movement Unia, which had a record of helping Jews, and that he had been put on a blacklist by the Germans.
 Whatever the case, there is no proof that the future pope did any fighting after leaving his factory job in 1942. What is known is that he studied for the priesthood clandestinely, taking underground Jagiellonian University courses and attending others at the Spiritual Seminary directed by Krakow's archbishop, Adam Stefan Sapieha, who became his patron. For the rest of the war, he lived in the basement of his patron's fortress-like palace.
 In that period, he had two serious injuries. Knocked down by a streetcar on Tyniecka Street, he suffered a fractured skull. Later, he was almost crushed by a runaway truck, an accident that left him stoop-shouldered.

A Priest and Prelate
 He was ordained a priest on Nov. 1, 1946. As the Communists took power in postwar Poland, Archbishop Sapieha urged his protege to continue postgraduate studies abroad. Father Wojtyla was sent to Rome, where he enrolled at the Angelicum, a college operated by the Dominican order.
 In two years he had earned a doctorate in philosophy, writing his thesis on ''Problems of the Faith According to St. John of the Cross.'' After traveling in France and Belgium, he returned home and was assigned by the archbishop as assistant pastor in a village parish in Niegowic, in southern Poland.
 A year later, he was sent back to Krakow as an assistant at St. Florian's Church and to continue his theological studies. In 1953, he earned a second doctorate, in moral theology, and qualified as an instructor. He first lectured on social ethics at the Spiritual Seminary in Krakow; a year later he won a chair in social ethics at Catholic University in Lublin. It was a post he would retain until he became pope.
 His reputation as a church intellectual grew rapidly, and in 1958 he was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Krakow under Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. At 38, he was the youngest member of the Polish church hierarchy. After the death of Archbishop Baziak in 1962, he was designated the acting archbishop, and on Jan. 13, 1964, Pope Paul VI made him archbishop of Krakow.
 During Vatican II, Archbishop Wojtyla addressed council fathers in Rome on eight occasions, was instrumental in the adoption of a declaration on religious liberty and was active in committee work. In his most notable council speech, he contended that the church could not lay claim to religious liberty without conceding it to others.
 ''It is not the church's task to teach unbelievers,'' he said. He warned against moralizing and authoritarian postures, saying the church should not ''cry over the lamentable state of the world'' or pretend that it had ''all the answers to all the problems in it.'' He impressed the cardinals as a practical philosopher and drew the attention of the pope.
 On June 26, 1967, Pope Paul VI elevated Archbishop Wojtyla to the College of Cardinals. At that time, Poland's Communist government regarded him as moderate and flexible, in contrast to Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the longtime patriarch of Warsaw, a hard-line anti-Communist.
 In later years, that perception was reversed. While Cardinal Wyszynski remained viscerally anti-Marxist, he began cooperating with the government on nonideological social and economic programs advantageous to the church and the Polish people. Cardinal Wojtyla, meantime, became a tough, vocal and eloquent opponent of the government, demanding increased freedoms in education, mass media and human rights and preaching Christian alternatives to Marxism.
 In 1969, Cardinal Wojtyla made his first trip to the United States, visiting Polish-American communities in 15 cities. ''Almost everywhere we went,'' said a priest who accompanied him, ''he laid aside his prepared remarks and spoke from the heart.''
 Cardinal Wojtyla returned to America in 1976, visiting 16 cities, including Cambridge, Mass., where Thomas E. Crooks, director of Harvard's summer school, recalled being ''floored by the sheer physical presence'' of the man. As Mr. Crooks remembered: ''He exuded such a combination of power and acceptance. He had this smile on his face and a look in his eye that said, 'You're wonderful. And I'm wonderful, too.' We had dinner with him later, and late that evening I told myself, 'This man ought to be pope.'''

A Literary Presence
 John Paul's literary output was prodigious. Besides his encyclicals, he was the author of at least seven books -- some bibliographies, counting his published commentaries, list as many as 11 -- and more than 300 articles and essays, most of them in scholarly journals.
 In the study of his archdiocesan residence on Franciszkanska Street in Krakow, a visitor in 1978 found 1,500 books on the shelves, including the works of ancient and modern philosophers, leaders of the church in Greek and Latin, and 20th-century avant-garde theologians, as well as volumes on many subjects in various languages. One of the few novels was ''The Shoes of the Fisherman,'' Morris West's 1963 tale of a pope from the Soviet Union.
 Books by the future pope included ''The Foundations of Renewal,'' a 1957 work on philosophical and moral subjects; ''Love and Responsibility,'' originally lectures on sex, marriage and birth control, which was published in 1962; and ''The Acting Person,'' a 1969 phenomenological treatise. His output as pope included ''Sign of Contradiction,'' a 1979 spiritual testament, and ''The Future of the Church,'' a study of Vatican II directives, which appeared in English in 1979.
 A collection of essays, ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'' was published in October 1994 in 21 languages in 35 countries -- in English by Alfred A. Knopf. Knopf's parent, Random House, paid a $9 million advance, and the book was on the best-seller lists in America for months. The pope donated the revenue to charity. A commercially published book by a sitting pope was unheard of in modern times. Experts say the last such publication, other than speeches, teaching documents and other official communications, was a 1748 work on diocesan synods by Pope Benedict XIV. 
 John Paul's last book, ''Memory and Identity,'' published this year, discussed freedom, patriotism and European integration. Last year, 25 European countries signed a constitution that does not mention the continent's Christian roots, despite the Vatican's repeated calls that it do so.
 He also wrote a great deal of poetry. A collection of his free verse was published by Random House in 1979 as ''Easter Vigil and Other Poems,'' and ''Roman Triptych -- Meditations,'' appeared in 2003. 
 One poem published in Krakow under the pen name Andrzej Jawien was titled ''The Rock.'' Written after a stroll in St. Peter's Square, it reads in translation:
 In this place our feet meet with earth from which so many walls and columns spring.
 If you don't get lost among them
 But go on finding oneness and meaning,
 It's because that very earth leads you.
 Here she not only bridges 
 The spaces of a Renaissance building
 But also vaults interiors within ourselves
 Who grow so very conscious of our weaknesses and failures.
 It's you, Peter. You want to serve as the substratum here for those who stagger
 Toward some unknown goal, to make them go where you would lead their feet
 So that spaces can be bridged through sight that helps thought to be born.
 You want to be the one to serve the feet, just as a rock serves the hoofs of sheep:
 The rock is also the substratum of this gigantic temple.
 The pasture is the cross.
 In his homeland, he also left a major monument to his faith and perseverance: the starkly modern Church of Our Lady, Queen of Poland, which rises at Nowa Huta, the new iron and steel center east of Krakow. While the authorities had long opposed the project in the Communist era, voluntary contributions were raised, and scarce building materials were scraped together. Somehow construction permits were obtained and volunteer workers took turns at the building site.
 It took more than a decade, but the project was dedicated in 1977. In a homily at the time, the future pope declared that men had a right to more than a job and a living wage.
 ''There are more profound rights of the human spirit that cannot be violated,'' he said. ''These are the rights of freedom of the human spirit, freedom of human conscience, freedom of belief and freedom of religion.''

HEADLINE: Does Gotham Need a Glamour Injection?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IN the most recent movie version of H.G. Wells's ''Time Machine,'' the character called the Time Traveler whisks himself to New York City in 2037, just as remnants of the Moon, destroyed by overdevelopment, plunge toward the Earth. Intimations of disaster were again heard in Manhattan last week, when the Jets were awarded waterfront property to build a combined football stadium and expanded Javits Convention Center that, its promoters say, will finally spur renewal on the West Side.
 Beyond the arcane cost-benefit analyses contained in hundreds of pages of competing bid documents and other assessments lie some even less tangible questions. Does any city, especially one that bills itself as the capital of the world, need to periodically replenish its prestige with building projects, the promise of a Super Bowl or the potential of luring the Olympics? Does New York City need another stadium; does Manhattan, where land is at a premium? Isn't Gotham already glamorous enough? 
 Yes, a project of this magnitude might loom far larger in Phoenix or Washington, D.C., but then again, as Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors' bureau, says, ''It keeps the 'New' in New York.'' 
 To which Mike Wallace, the director of the Gotham Center for New York City History, counters: ''This is an immense city. Our table rests on hundreds of legs and it could do without this one.''
 Losing a leg is easier to gauge. Remember the impact on Brooklyn, psychologically at least, when the Dodgers fled for California? Recall the blow to New York City's image when, during the 1977 World Series, a helicopter camera showed a fire raging in a borough being consumed by arson and Howard Cosell intoned: ''There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning''? (The memory is a reminder that Yankee Stadium couldn't by itself save the Bronx.) 
 And do intangibles loom larger since Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center, a symbol never much loved by New Yorkers until then, vanished in a horrific reminder of the vulnerability of even the imperial city?
 Nobody thinks the Hudson Yards on the West Side should left as is. But two more questions are likely to be debated in the months, or more, that the project is delayed or even defeated by legislators and litigants. 
 The first is whether, even before the customary cost overruns, the investment by the city and state of $300 million each to build a platform over the rail yards and a retractable stadium roof will justify itself through the tax revenues from new real estate development and commerce on the West Side. 
 The second is whether this project will spur development or deaden it. (Construction of the Javits Center had virtually no impact on urban renewal.) ''In terms of a stadium, the be-all and end-all isn't whether it ultimately pays for itself,'' says Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office. ''Typically, cities build stadiums because they want the excitement and amenities that teams bring,'' 
 Moreover, this project is not just a stadium. Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, says the combined stadium and convention center is unusual and that the city itself is unique, an argument that, in a sense, is self-fulfilling. 
 ''If all it were was a football stadium it would be a terrible idea,'' he said. ''The importance of it is that it fills up a huge gaping hole on the West Side which otherwise would be an impediment to development with a vibrant mixed-use building right away and it's largely paid for by the private sector.'' 
 Critics turn that case on its head. The Jets and the football Giants left New York years ago and the city survived. ''To the degree there has been a turnaround in tourism since 9/11, which is remarkable, there's no stadium here,'' says Mr. Wallace of the Gotham Center. ''I find it hard to imagine that anyone two or three years hence, unless some massacre takes place, will remember much about the 2012 Olympics in New York.'' 
 Michael Shapiro, who wrote ''The Last Good Season: Brooklyn, the Dodgers and Their Final Pennant Race Together,'' says a new Dodger Stadium would have been ''transformative'' a half-century ago, but adds: ''That's Brooklyn; it's not Manhattan.'' 
 History offers mixed lessons. The 1939-40 World's Fair in Queens paid off, as a global political and cultural statement, an affirmation of faith in the city's future and in the concrete legacy of improved parks and highways. (As Walter Lippmann wrote pointedly of the Futurama exhibit: ''G.M. has spent a small fortune to convince the American public that if it wishes to enjoy the full benefit of private enterprise in motor manufacturing, it will have to rebuild its cities and highways by public enterprise.'') 
 The 1964-65 fair at the same site was, by comparison, a bust. The bicentennial celebration and the Democratic National Convention in 1976 provided a timely boost to the city's spirits, but the Yankees game in which the world witnessed the Bronx burning came just one year later. 
 By 2037, will New Yorkers be hailing the visionaries who lobbied and arm-twisted for this project, and reveling in the parks and housing it built? Will the vibrancy and tax revenues from the Super Bowl in 2010 and the Olympics in 2012 affirm the supremacy of their city? Or will a hulking glass shoebox of a stadium loom forlornly over the waterfront while crime rates and other variables exert a greater influence, one way or another, on the future of the West Side? 
 As H.G. Wells might have said, only time will tell.

HEADLINE: Finding Up-to-Date Settings for Washers and Dryers

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
FORGET the fistful of quarters if you are planning to do your laundry at the Clean Rite Center on Eastern Parkway in East New York, Brooklyn. Traditional coin-operated washers and dryers have been replaced by those driven by prepaid plastic cards, similar to the MetroCards used on the subway and buses.
 Clean Rite is a privately owned company that is trying to replace traditional mom-and-pop laundries on side streets with a chain of large, brightly lit laundries with ample parking on major highways and intersections in the New York area and other states.
 It has 82 locations and is hoping to open 12 more in the city this year. Executives of the company say they would like to open as many as 30 by the end of next year, but say finding the right real estate is the major limitation on growth. 
 ''We have a store at 627 Fourth Avenue'' in Brooklyn, said John Sabino, the president of Clean Rite. ''We would like to have more along this road because the traffic is good and the demographics are good, but we can't find the right locations.''
 This is partly because of the nature of the area, which is largely filled with narrow low-rise housing, often with stores on the first floor. This makes it difficult to assemble a larger site.
 But it is also a result of Clean Rite's requirements, which are as fixed as the colors of the yellow and blue signs that it installs at all its locations. The sites have to be large enough to lease or build a 3,000-to-6,000-square-foot building with enough parking so that customers can easily unload their dirty clothes near the front door.
 Mr. Sabino and Alex Weiss, Clean Rite's chairman, describe the store they have built or are looking to develop as the next stage in what the industry's trade association calls ''retail self-service laundries.''
 In the past, Mr. Sabino said: ''The typical store had about 1,200 square feet of space, 15 washers and 15 dryers, unattended and open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. It was typically a second business for the owner, who would come in a few times a week to collect the money and fix machines.''
 Not only are Clean Rite's stores larger, with more machines of various sizes to accommodate small and large loads, they are open 24 hours a day, always have an employee on the premises and are equipped with restrooms and air-conditioning. The prepaid cards mean there is less cash on the premises. And the properties are monitored by a camera system that is linked to a regional headquarters, which can dispatch help if machines break or something else goes awry.
 The card system has several advantages, besides the obvious difficulties of having cash on hand, Mr. Weiss said. ''They are a wonderful tool for us,'' he said. ''We can do incremental pricing with them'' -- that is, prices can be pushed up a few pennies, rather than forcing customers to plunk in another quarter.
 ''We can do loyalty programs with them, and they help with the accounting,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''I don't think we could have done our expansion -- and we have national ambitions -- without the card system.''
 As a result of the card system and the layout of the buildings, ''customers feel safe in our stores,'' Mr. Weiss said, ''and we are becoming like other big box retailers.'' 
 Indeed, when they found a tree-filled lot at 1760 Eastern Parkway a few years ago, the box got even bigger. That store occupies 10,000 square feet and holds 200 washers and dryers. There is parking for 50 cars. ''This is a regional destination that people will drive three or four miles to come to,'' Mr. Sabino said. ''And on the weekend, the parking lot is full.''
 That is the nature of the laundry business. Although the stores are open 24/7, about 55 percent of all the cleaning and drying takes place on the weekend, from Friday evening to Sunday night.
 The operators of some facilities, particularly those that are individually owned, use the slow time to do other people's laundry, an operation called wash and fold. ''An individual operator might have a self service to wash and fold ration of 80-20, but our company is 98 percent self-service,'' Mr. Sabino said.
 Typically, laundries have flourished in relatively low-income areas where families do not have their own washers and dryers. For example, near the store on Eastern Parkway, average family income runs from the mid-$20,000's to $30,000 a year, Mr. Sabino said.
 But near the Fourth Avenue store in Brooklyn, the average family income is more than $70,000 a year.
 Clean Rite officials say they see opportunities in these higher-income areas because of the limited capacity of home washing equipment. ''People are time poor, particularly if both parents work,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''It could take seven or eight hours to do the laundry of a family with three kids. In our store, they could take seven washers and seven dryers and be done in two hours.''
 Clean Rite officials say they are trying to build a brand that is widely recognized and can be rolled out to start consolidating a fragmented industry with about 35,000 stores nationally and annual revenues of about $4 billion.
 In addition to its facilities in the five boroughs of New York, the company has operations in New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Georgia. Some of these stores were purchased from companies that had similar, but failed, plans for expansion.
 But the economies of scale in purchasing and distribution that lie behind the expansion of retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot may not apply to laundries, said Brian Wallace, president of the Coin Laundry Association, a major trade group.
 ''This is an industry with no inventory and no receivables, and there do not appear to be any economies of scale,'' he said. ''Everybody has the same main costs: rent, utilities and labor. And if you have to add district managers as you grow, that adds to labor costs.''
 But Clean Rite executives say they are not in the service business, but are retailers who sell time on machines. And they have an advantage over most other retailers: captive customers. The average laundry customer spends more than two hours on each visit and comes once a week, spending more than 100 hours a year in the store. Many laundry operators exploit this time to generate additional income by installing video games and convenience-store items. 
 But Clean Rite executives are thinking bigger. They see their type of store as the anchor for a small mall. While the machines do their work, customers will be able to do their shopping in nearby stores. ''We have bought land in Haddon Heights, N.J., near Philadelphia, and we are going to develop it into a shopping mall,'' Mr. Sabino said.

HEADLINE: Viva Los Regulators

 BODY:
We have seen one corporate chieftain after another, the likes of Bernard Ebbers of WorldCom and John Rigas of Adelphia, doing the perp walk recently through the morass of business scandals. Federal regulators are in striking distance of Maurice Greenberg of the American International Group, an icon of American business. And many shareholders of Enron are licking their lips in anticipation of the trials of its former chief executives, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling.
 So it's no surprise that these high-profile cases have spawned a backlash from Wall Street about overzealous prosecutors and federal regulations that have run amok. Some defenders of business have even gone so far as to suggest the conviction of Mr. Ebbers shows that America does not need the Sarbanes-Oxley law, passed in 2002 as a response to corporate fraud. 
 This makes no sense. The very fact that corporate chieftains are falling left and right shows that more needs to be done. These cases are symptoms of endemic business corruption, and this is no time to start talking about backtracking. 
 Interestingly, much of this talk about overzealous enforcement is brought on by the behavior of big business itself, yet another sign that corporate America still does not get it. Instead of self-policing their accounting practices, many companies appear to be focusing on issues of personal behavior by employees that are of little concern to shareholders or the public. This goes beyond the forced resignation of the chief executive of Boeing, Harry Stonecipher, for having a consensual affair with an employee. Early this year, Bank of America, which has paid nearly $1 billion in fines over the last year for various transgressions, fired a highly regarded bond analyst, Andrew Susser, for his stab at humor in a research report on the casino and lodging industry. On its cover, which carried the title ''Checking In,'' Mr. Susser's face was superimposed over the body of a woman in a cocktail party dress and heels who was being carried over the threshold by a man, as reported by Landon Thomas Jr. in The Times. This is sophomoric behavior, certainly, but not grounds for dismissal; at least it was not back in the days before the business sections of newspapers started reading like rap sheets.
 Instead of singling out low- and middle-level executives, big business would better spend its time going after the top-tier people for overstating earnings and sliding expenses around. After paying a $300 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it overstated advertising revenue, Time Warner did not dismiss the executives, including the chief financial officer, who approved the accounting. 
 What this shows is not that law enforcement is overzealous, but that upholding the public interest is still too much at the whim of individual officials. The decision by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, to take on the finance industry was a good thing, but the public should not have to depend on one individual's deciding to take up such a cause.
 Still, as long as we are in this pattern, it is a good sign that some of these eager officials are turning their attention from shareholder protection to consumer protection. Minnesota's attorney general recently sued two subsidiaries of the Capital One Financial Corporation, alleging that their supposed ''low'' and ''fixed'' interest rates on credit cards are actually neither. The suit alleges that for many consumers, the rates went up -- as high as 25.9 percent -- if they were just a day late in paying their bills. 
 That kind of action is what the American middle class -- on whose shoulders rests so much of the world economy -- needs.

HEADLINE: Stadium Clock Speeds Up In a New York Minute

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE New York minute is fabled for its brash double-time urgency. Wait till you see a quarter of a year whiz past in New York. 
 It is barely three months until the International Olympic Committee will choose the host city for the 2012 Summer Games. The Bloomberg administration is obsessed with turning the ignition on the bulldozers before the I.O.C. meets in Singapore on July 6, but lawyers from stadium opponents will take a knee and run out this clock better than any quarterback ever did. 
 It has been fascinating to watch the machinations on many sides of the West Side stadium issue. The Bloomberg administration has played on the fool's-gold appeal of the Olympics. The Dolan people? Well, you know what they are about.
 Maybe sports columnists are supposed to fall in line behind anything that sounds like gold medals and large crowds and tear-jerker stories about athletes who overcame terrible adversity. 
 But if you open your eyes and walk around Manhattan, you get the feeling there may be better things to do with our energy and space and time and money than build a looming stadium along the riverfront. The docile, appointed board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted, 14-0, on Thursday to accept the bid by the Jets to help finance a $2.2 billion hybrid stadium and indoor arena and convention center. 
 It was always about real estate in a borough where the average price of a dwelling has reached $1.17 million, up 11 percent in the most recent quarter. New Yorkers go crazy over a few extra cubic feet for their cat or their plants or their DVD's, or even the occasional human child existent in Midtown.
 This debate, by the way, is more than just about a place for the Jets to play their games. In a sane world, the Jets and the Giants would be forced, out of shame and economic good sense, to share the current Giants Stadium; nothing wrong with it, apparently, except it lacks luxury boxes where people can pretend they are in a fusion restaurant rather than at a football stadium. 
 If you really had to build a new stadium, put it in the Meadowlands or Flushing Meadows, but let's get one thing straight: anybody saying Shea Stadium could be converted into an Olympic/football/soccer stadium has obviously never been inside Shea, which was a dump in April 1964 and remains a dump today. 
 Maybe Shea's skeleton would make good scrap metal. Maybe. But thinking of it as a converted Olympic stadium is another form of fool's-gold. 
 Instead, the Bloomberg administration has gambled a great deal of credibility on a hybrid stadium on the West Side. The huge cost is due not only to the platform over the railroad tracks, but also because of the need for a gigantic structure that could support a retractable roof for the multiple purposes of an arena and an adjunct to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 And speaking of an indoor arena, here is where any possible widespread moral and political opposition to this boondoggle has failed, so far: Not only did the Bloomberg administration keep the project from a public referendum, but the most visible opposition came from the Dolans of Cablevision and Madison Square Garden fame. As the saying goes, with friends like these. 
 Even people not dependent on Cablevision can sense the arrogance and self-interest of this lot. They make it hard to exercise populist and common-sense instincts.
 The fun part of these stadium follies has been watching both the Bloomberg people and the Dolan people lurch into the housing business. The administration has been forced to seek real estate developers to pay lip service to affordable housing in Manhattan, whatever that means. 
 On the other side, the Dolans have sounded as if they spent their younger days reading the collected works of Jane Jacobs, the great urban thinker. One could almost picture the Battlin' Dolans, pere et fils, morphing into Jimmy Carter, a hammer in the loop of their baggy carpenter jeans, a few penny nails handy between their lips, erecting a regular Habitat for Humanity on the West Side. Nah.
 Speaking of construction, another great story line has been the enthusiasm of the building trade unions for this stadium. I guess there are no construction jobs in the building of apartments, schools and hospitals.
 The threatened stadium still looks like some bigger-is-better Soviet Union project of the late 40's. My own observation is that sports stadiums choke urban street life. I don't trust the trickle-down economics of the Bloomberg people. Don't trust the Dolans, either.
 I do trust the intrinsic wisdom of the New York minute, as we tick our way toward July 6, when the I.O.C. chooses Paris or one of the three other bidding cities, and reality sets in.

HEADLINE: Do Taxes Thwart Growth? Prove It

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
TAX reform, like a second marriage, is the triumph of hope over experience. The United States has just gone through the most sweeping tax cuts since the 1980's, but hardly anybody is satisfied. President Bush contends that we need still-lower taxes in order to prosper. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is suggesting a radical shift to a consumption tax. And the Republican Party has taken aim at the entire tax system. 
 At the heart of such antitax sentiment is this belief: Taxes are bad for the economy. And who would disagree, especially as April 15 nears? 
 There's just one problem, though. Despite the widespread notion that taxes harm the economy, no one has actually been able to back that up. It's not that taxes have no effect; they are a major part of the American economic system and affect planning and behavior in many ways. Taxes influence who wins and who loses in a competitive society. But over all, there is surprisingly little evidence that tax rates are an important factor in determining the nation's economic prosperity.
 In theory, the issue seems simple enough. According to basic economic principles, a tax can have a negative effect on behavior by reducing the incentive to do whatever is taxed. Impose a tax on wages, and people may decide to work less.
 That's the theory, anyway. In practice, how many Americans will work less if their taxes rise? With mortgage bills, college tuition and car payments looming, who can afford to work less? Relatively few have the option of cutting back without risking the loss of their jobs. 
 So just because taxes can discourage productive behavior doesn't mean that they do. Too many other factors are involved -- like social pressures, financial needs and a job market that isn't entirely flexible.
 And then there's the evidence. Over the last 30 years, economists have undertaken hundreds of studies to determine whether taxes hurt the economy. So far, they've turned up little to convict taxes of the charge. After reviewing the literature on the topic in 1993, two economists, William Easterly of New York University and Sergio Rebelo of Northwestern, concluded in a joint paper that ''the evidence that tax rates matter for growth is disturbingly fragile.''
 A leading tax specialist today, Joel B. Slemrod of the University of Michigan, would agree. He notes that in the 20th century, a rising tax burden in the United States and other developed countries went hand in hand with rising prosperity. 
 In the book ''Taxing Ourselves: A Citizen's Guide to the Debate Over Taxes,'' Professor Slemrod and Jon Bakija examine the relationship between the marginal income tax rate -- the rate imposed on additional income in a progressive tax system -- and productivity. After all, if you reduce the rate of taxation on income, people should work harder. But the opposite turned out to be true. Looking at the data from 1950 to 2002, the authors found that periods of strong productivity growth actually occurred when the top tax rates were the highest. And they showed that, on average, high-tax countries are the most affluent countries.
 That is not to suggest that high tax rates lead to growth. No economist will make that case, although many will say that some things financed by taxes, like education, research, health and infrastructure projects, can contribute to growth. But it does call into question why, if taxes are so bad for growth, their effect doesn't show up more prominently.
 Researchers have tried different approaches to answer this question. Instead of taking a macro view, they have examined the impact of individual taxes on the labor supply, saving and investment. But even in isolated cases, the evidence that taxes discourage growth can be thin.
 One important area of economic activity that does seem fairly responsive to tax rates is business investment. Some of that responsiveness may have more to do with changes in the timing of decisions than in shifts in the level of investment over the long haul. Consider the recent accelerated depreciation allowance. Economists noted a short-term uptick in spending in affected categories, but companies will ultimately need to see an increase in customer demand to continue investing.
 In the case of individual savings and work, economists are closer to a consensus. After study of the tax cuts of the Reagan years, most economists agree that taxes don't play a big part in how hard Americans work. While the study of savings is less precise, large effects from tax incentives haven't been measured. 
 That's worth recalling when considering proposals like a flat tax or a consumption tax. With so much energy focused on minimizing rates, it's important to keep in mind that taxes are not antithetical to prosperity. None of this should suggest that change is unnecessary. Current tax laws have real problems, including unreasonable complexity. 
 But reform based on a notion that taxes are bad for the economy is just that: a notion not backed by strong evidence. And the costs of ignoring experience in favor of hope can be high: mounting deficits, decaying infrastructure, inadequate investment in public education and research.
 So the next time that some proponent of tax reform promises king-size economic benefits, there's reason to be skeptical. Like a second marriage, a new tax system can't work miracles.

HEADLINE: From Scarsdale to Kabul, For a Fruitful Future

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

DATELINE: SCARSDALE 

 BODY:
FORMER rabbi, retired entrepreneur and father of two grown daughters, Bruce Freyer looks every inch the well-to-do Scarsdale grandfather.
 But that hasn't kept Mr. Freyer, 67, from pursuing his pet mission of regreening Afghanistan, one orchard at a time. He and his wife, Dana, co-founders of the nonprofit Global Partnership for Afghanistan, say their goal is to help farmers replant croplands, orchards, vineyards and forests so that they can become self-sufficient and not have to rely on poppy-growing for the drug trade. (To learn more about the organization, see gpfa.org.) 
 If that ambition seems idealistic in a profoundly damaged, remote country almost the size of Texas, consider the Freyers' motivation: memories of 40 years ago, when Ms. Freyer first became involved with the country, as an assistant to the Afghan representative to the United Nations.
 Parts of Afghanistan then ''were fertile, very green and lush,'' Ms. Freyer recalled. ''Everybody was well fed and had enough to eat. The babies were fat, and the children were chubby.''
 Today's Afghanistan, said her husband, who has visited three times since the project started, has no remaining electrical grid, no postal service, no land-line telephones, no sewers and no water system. The effects of the Soviet occupation in the 1980's and the American invasion four years ago -- added to a long period of drought -- have left hardly any trees standing.
 ''With the deforestation and the drought situation, trees become a very important part of a national development strategy for Afghanistan,'' said Patricia Rosenfield, an environmental economist with the Carnegie Corporation who is familiar with the partnership's work, 
 Ms. Freyer explained that trees from the country's many poplar forests were once used to build the ceiling beams, doors and window frames of most houses. ''Afghanistan used to be known as the orchard of Central Asia,'' she said, adding: ''Kabul was a city of gardens and trees, but it's a dust bowl now. Everyone is walking around coughing.''
 The Freyers inaugurated their group in 2001 on a small scale, but that has begun to change. Last month Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced the inauguration of the New York Partnership for a Green Afghanistan. With the Westchester-based group at its organizational heart, it is to consist of the State University of New York; Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; American Forests, a nonprofit conservation agency; and International Paper.
 The Freyers' love affair with Afghanistan fully blossomed during a six-week driving trip in 1972. Their 27,000-mile voyage in a powder-blue Volkswagen Beetle when began in Wolfsburg, Germany, and ended nine months later in Katmandu, Nepal.
 ''We had many Afghan friends from those days, and they came here as refugees,'' said Ms. Freyer, 60, now a partner specializing in international arbitration at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Manhattan.
 ''Over the 25 years of war, we shared their pain, and hardly dared to dream that they would be able to go back,'' she added. 
 Last year, the Global Partnership helped 69 farmers in the Guldara District, about 30 miles north of Kabul, to plant 50 fruit saplings each, including apples, pears, peaches and plums. Each farmer took out a loan of $129 for the trees, to be paid back over four years; the money will go to buy more trees in the future.
 The group also taught farmers to intercrop -- or plant tomatoes, wheat and potatoes between the trees -- so that they will have income during the two to three years it will take for the trees to bear fruit.
 The partnership's budget in 2004 was about $218,000; that amount will increase this year to about $350,000, according to Mr. Freyer. The expansion announced by Senator Clinton will mean added money, he said, though it is not yet clear how much. 
 ''A little bit of money goes so far there,'' Ms. Freyer said.
 Although most farmers in the original project area did not grow poppies, she added, many of those farther from Kabul have begun to rely on them. The partnership plans to move into those areas, so that farmers can substitute highly valued orchards and trees -- which eventually should provide a commensurate source of income. 
 Meanwhile, she said, although the American government is providing infrastructure aid, much more long-term assistance is needed for farmers whose crops will not yield immediate profits. ''It will take a long time for the country to rebuild,'' she added, not venturing to guess just how long. 
 To speed up harvesting of poplars -- Afghan varieties take nearly a decade to mature -- the partnership imported 450 faster-growing poplar cuttings from Oregon, with the help of a Vancouver forester, George Nercessian. 
 The group will plant 40,000 poplar cuttings in 2005 and help another 70 to 80 farmers plant a total of about 4,000 fruit trees, as well as helping the original group plant 3,500 new trees, Ms. Freyer said.
 The newly announced expansion will afford the group an extra 10,000 donated willow trees, as well as the advice of agricultural experts at SUNY and Cornell. 
 ''From April to October, the poplars grew from pencil-sized cuttings to 10-foot-tall saplings,'' Mr. Nercessian said. 
 ''What is unique is the enthusiasm of the Freyers, that's what I really admire,'' he concluded. ''They have no financial benefit from this, it's purely humanitarian and philanthropic.''

HEADLINE: River Rights and Wrongs 

BYLINE: By ALEX MATTHIESSEN. 
Alex Matthiessen is the Hudson Riverkeeper and executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental advocacy group.

DATELINE: Garrison 

 BODY:
AS the deadline approaches for public comment on the proposed redevelopment at the General Motors site in Sleepy Hollow, it is important to look at the project in the larger context of the past -- and future -- history of the Hudson River waterfront. 
 For nearly two centuries, New Yorkers have been largely cut off from the Hudson -- separated by rail lines and industrial activity along both shores. By the middle of the 20th century, the lack of public access didn't matter since the Hudson had become so polluted with sewage and dangerous chemicals that few had much interest in getting out on -- let alone in -- the river. 
 With the passage of the Clean Water Act and other federal statutes, concerned citizens and environmental organizations banded together and used the new laws to clean up the Hudson. With the restoration of the river nearly complete, people are returning to the Hudson in droves. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the economic renaissance of the Hudson River Valley over the last decade came about largely because the Hudson is clean again. People want to live and work on the river. They want to swim, fish, watch the return of the bald eagles, kayak and canoe in it. 
 But we are in danger of repeating our past mistakes and once again allowing ourselves to be severed from the Hudson, perhaps for the next century. As the waterfront opens up, developers are seeing dollar signs and rushing in to build huge developments, extracting as much profit as they can from these parcels of land. The colossal development slated for the former G.M. plant site in Sleepy Hollow is no exception. 
 G.M., along with a New Jersey developer called Roseland Property, has proposed the construction of Lighthouse Landing, a dense riverfront project with a 147-room hotel, 180,000 square feet of retail space, 50,200 square feet of office space and 1,562 residential units, which will add about 3,000 new residents to the village's population of 9,200. The developers boast that 30 percent of the 95-acre site will be devoted to open space, but most of it -- except for a sliver of parkland squeezed between the condominiums and the river -- is in a floodplain on the upland side of the railroad tracks, thus denying the public of a meaningful amount of space along the waterfront.
 There are many problems with the G.M. proposal related to traffic, sewage and storm water controls, schools and the possibility that the added burden on village services will overwhelm any tax revenue from the project, causing property taxes to increase.
 Yet, the biggest problem with the proposed development is that it violates a significant number of provisions in the village's local waterfront revitalization plan and local laws meant to support it. The plan's chief requirement is that any development on the G.M. site place a priority on ''water dependent use,'' like kayaking, boating, ferry landings and swimming. With nearly the entire site devoted to residential and retail development, the G.M. proposal fails that requirement. The village's waterfront advisory committee has concluded that the project is inconsistent with the waterfront plan. 
 Moreover, under New York's public trust doctrine, the state must protect the property west of the railroad tracks as public trust land and ensure that the public benefits from its use. Unfortunately, the development as proposed confers limited benefits on the public.
 The developers have no choice but to scrap their plans and sit down with Mayor Philip E. Zegarelli and interested parties to figure out how to move their project forward while complying with the law. At recent hearings, village residents offered a number of thoughtful suggestions for the site, including a cultural center, more affordable housing and expanded recreational opportunities. Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit environmental group and land trust, has proposed restoring part of the Pocantico River to its historic route through what is now the northwest corner of the G.M. site. These ideas and others warrant serious consideration.
 If the developers want to avoid years of delay, they should work with the community to devise a plan that dedicates a significant part of the waterfront to public uses. This would involve, at a minimum, substantially increasing river access and open space along the shore, including a buffer corridor between the development and Kingsland Point Park, and restoring wetland habitat. 
 What happens in Sleepy Hollow will dictate how the rest of the Hudson waterfront is developed in the next few years and will be a test of how we will treat the river -- and thus ourselves -- for the next century.

HEADLINE: Is Europe Trying to Restore The Old Trans-Atlantic Club?

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 1 

 BODY:
Who would have thought that Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Great Satan of the European imagination, Mr. Architect of the Iraq war, would sail more or less unscathed through what amounted to European Union confirmation hearings on his way to the presidency of the World Bank?
 It would be difficult to exaggerate the extent to which Mr. Wolfowitz's name has been invoked over the past two years in a Europe that loves to believe the worst about American goals and intentions -- most alarmingly that Washington is engaged in a sinister plot to dominate the world, a plot with Mr. Wolfowitz at its core. 
 In fact, surprising as it may be, the unopposed march of Mr. Wolfowitz to the World Bank -- he went to Brussels this week to meet with European Union officials even as France, Germany and other countries had endorsed him -- has been matched by other surprisingly easy Euro-American agreements on issues including China and the Middle East.
 The unaccustomed absence of prickliness and difficulty makes one wonder if Europe has, without saying so, made an important strategic decision. Faced over the past couple of years with two basic options -- to build Europe as a counterweight to American power, as President Jacques Chirac of France would like, or to restore the old trans-Atlantic club -- Europe has opted for restoration.
 So, by the way, has the United States, signaled by President Bush's pronouncement in his State of the Union and Inaugural addresses that Washington now sees the European Union as a partner. It was not that long ago that a debate was occurring in Washington about whether European integration was good or bad for the United States.
 But if everyone is avoiding friction these days, neither the Americans nor the Europeans are joining forces out of some resurrection of the cold war romance of common purpose, common values and common struggles against tyranny. The mood at least in Europe is pragmatic, emerging more from a sense of self-interest than sentimental attachment to the alliance. The relationship is being repaired in this sense in an atmosphere in which much of the European populace remains deeply distrustful of American aims and practices.
 ''Given the voting rights in the World Bank, it would have been impossible to force an alternative candidate down the throat of the American administration anyway,'' Reinhold Butikofer, the chairman of the Green Party in Germany, said. ''So why raise a useless struggle?''
 In fact, many German officials, and certainly the German news media, were initially shocked at the nomination of Mr. Wolfowitz, and the decision not to object publicly was born out of calculation, not affection.
 ''There might also be a new understanding in Europe that it wouldn't be that bad after all to have the real hard-core neocons in the positions that count,'' Mr. Butikofer continued. ''We didn't accomplish a lot by having Colin Powell, Europe's best friend in the administration, as secretary of state. But with Condoleezza Rice, who really has the ear of the president, we might face more problems to start with, but once we have talked and agreed with the secretary of state, we might have a deal with the administration, not just with the secretary of state.''
 Not long ago the list of Euro-American disagreements clearly dominated the discussion, whether the war on Iraq or the American rejection of the International Criminal Court, a favorite project of Europe. Now Europeans and Americans have agreed to give priority to the European diplomatic approach on Iran -- with the proviso that the Europeans join the United States in tougher measures if diplomacy does not work.
 On another issue, it seems virtually certain that the European Union will not lift its arms embargo on China, at least not for the next year or so, even though Mr. Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany favor ending the embargo. The question could come up again, but for now it seems a majority of Europeans, largely concerned about China as a human rights violator and possible aggressor in a war against Taiwan, are opposed to lifting an embargo, as is the United States.
 To have lifted the embargo moreover would have been a major gesture in the direction of what the French used to call multipolarity, involving a European superpower operating independently of the United States, forging a partnership with China that would have had the effect -- very much desired by China and by France -- of counterbalancing American power.
 Of course, the pragmatic impulse can push in more than one direction, and it is not difficult to imagine some circumstances where it could move toward a widening of the trans-Atlantic gulf again. There is the looming question, for example, of whether the two sides can agree on what to do if diplomacy fails in Iran, and the American side begins pushing for Security Council action, penalties and possibly military strikes, all of which Europe will viscerally oppose.
 ''I still think there's a possibility that that might be played in election campaigns,'' said Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a conservative member of the German Parliament. Mr. Guttenberg was raising the specter particularly that Mr. Schroder, who will be up for re-election next year, might revive some of the antiwar and anti-Bush administration talk that he used three years ago in the Iraq war debate, when he was narrowly re-elected.
 ''That temptation always exists,'' he said.
 Some analysts, looking at the United States, still believe that if a crisis point comes on Iran and the Americans feel they do not have European support, there will be a revival of unilateralism. That is to say, if confronted with a choice between going it alone or submitting to a European preference for more diplomacy, the Americans will choose to go it alone. In this sense, the emergence of better ties has a pragmatic element on the American side as well.
 ''On both sides, we need the same understanding of partnership,'' Mr. Guttenberg said. ''As soon as partnership becomes connected with the adjective selective, as in selective multilateralism, then it is problematic.''

HEADLINE: Stem Cell Research Is Worthy of Support

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Stem Cell Debate Hits Home,'' March 27: My wife underwent the transplant of a new set of lungs on Thanksgiving weekend after suffering from Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (a genetic disease that destroys the lungs) for many years. She waited four years for a transplant and now faces the rigors of potential rejection.
 Stem cell research has the potential of solving these vexing problems -- the scarcity of organs and the debilitating effects of anti-rejection drugs.
 We consider the potential of stem cell research a public health issue worthy of the State of Connecticut's support. Some believe that this science is evil given their religious beliefs. While we respect each individual's right to their particular views, can't we separate church and state, and give priority to the development of lifesaving treatments?
 We view this from the same perspective as Connecticut's early support of the aircraft industry. A hundred years ago, the Wright brothers ushered in a new era. Flight has done much to improve the human experience, while at the same time it has dramatically increased the ability to wage war on civilians from Guernica and Hiroshima to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Yet no one in Hartford is suggesting that the support of G.E.,Pratt & Whitney, Sikorsky and many others in the aircraft industry was wrong. In fact, the aircraft industry has been a bulwark of the state economy.
 We strongly urge that Connecticut legislators support the bill to approve $20 million that would help universities in the state to take a leading role in stem cell research. Such support would encourage the development of potential cures. Let us support the search for treatments for the millions of adults and children who live with intense suffering and face premature death. It also would encourage the development of the state's growing biotech industry, which could partner with the schools.

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Option

 BODY:
Time will tell, to use an old editorial dodge, whether Josh Rattner is a prophet or just a noodge. 
 Mr. Rattner pulled a driver from a burning gasoline truck last year, risking his life and earning an invitation to a ''Heroes Breakfast'' at the Hilton Rye Town last week. But when it came time to smile and accept his plaque, he pulled a Marlon Brando and refused it, saying he could not allow himself to be a public relations tool of one of the day's corporate sponsors, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, which owns the Indian Point power plant. Mr. Rattner says Indian Point is a menace that should be shut down. 
 Mr. Rattner, an electrical contractor from Irvington, thus fired an early shot in what promises to be a long and ferocious struggle over the relicensing of Indian Point, the Hudson Valley's vital energy resource or nuclear nightmare -- take your pick -- in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of Times Square.
 Already the environmentalists are out in force, firing away with news conferences and op-eds and calling in reinforcements from the hundreds of politicians and dozens of town and village boards that have called for the plant to be decommissioned. Besides traditional anxieties about meltdown, radioactive waste and the nuclear industry's wobbly economics, the enemies of Indian Point have a new trump card to play -- the fear of terrorism -- now that 9/11 has jolted people into taking long-shot possibilities seriously.
 Supporters of nuclear power have a trump card of their own: global warming, which looms as the environmental crisis of our age. This has prompted more than a few people in the green camp to argue that fossil fuel, not radiation, is the clear and present danger, and to embrace nuclear plants as a proven, readily available way to reduce carbon emissions and save the planet.
 This page has been largely agnostic about nuclear power in general and Indian Point in particular, though it has expressed serious reservations about security at the plant, which is badly placed in a densely populated region, where a mass evacuation in an emergency would be extremely difficult. We have called for greater fortifications and a competent security force at Indian Point, but have seen no immediate reason to shut it down.
 We hope the coming clashes will clarify what the region's residents think about whether to embrace or reject nuclear power along the Hudson. We hope further that this grappling will lay the groundwork for a much broader debate -- the kind of national discussion the Bush administration should be leading but is not, given that its energy policies amount to little more than an unwavering fixation on the maximal extraction and consumption of fossil fuels from anywhere and everywhere.
 It may seem early in Westchester --Indian Point's reactor licenses are not up for renewal until 2013. But Indian Point is one of the biggest nuclear controversies around, aside from the long struggle over burying waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, and thus is a prime opportunity to sort out our energy priorities, reassess our seemingly boundless appetite for cheap power and weigh our tolerance for risk -- not just in the region, but across the nation.

HEADLINE: Quickly Improving A Credit Rating

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
HOME buyers in search of a mortgage know that their credit history will play a key role in the outcome. And anyone who has tried to improve a credit score is probably aware that doing so can take months or years.
 But it is sometimes possible for a borrower to raise his credit score in just a few days, using a strategy known as rapid rescoring.
 ''I've had a fair amount of success using rapid rescoring for clients,'' said Oded Ben-Ami, a senior loan officer for Sterling National Mortgage in Great Neck, N.Y. ''And the couple of hundred dollars it costs is negligible compared with the benefits of getting a better interest rate, quicker approval and a higher maximum loan amount.'' 
 Mr. Ben-Ami said that when a borrower applies for a mortgage, the lender orders the borrower's credit score from a credit bureau. That score is based on information compiled by one or more of the three nationwide credit reporting services -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. (Since each service collects information independently, each could have different information on file.) 
 The score calculated by the bureau, known as the FICO score (for the Fair Isaac Corporation, which developed it), is then used to determine not only whether the individual qualifies for a particular loan but also the interest rate that will be charged.
 Since credit scores are so important, Mr. Ben-Ami said, it always makes sense to ensure that the information on a credit report is accurate.
 But if a borrower discovers errors, it can take months of back-and-forth correspondence between the borrower, the creditor and the credit reporting service to correct them for free. Since mortgages often have to be secured within 30 to 45 days, it is often impossible to change a score quickly enough. But with rapid rescoring, a score can be changed in days.
 Gerri Detweiler, a Sarasota, Fla., credit specialist and the author of ''The Ultimate Credit Handbook'' (Plume, 2003), said that with rapid rescoring, the loan officer, working with the lender's credit bureau -- which charges an extra fee -- can improve a credit score by considering new information. 
 Usually, she said, that is done by correcting erroneous information. If a report reflects a judgment that should not be there, and the borrower can offer written verification from the creditor who filed the judgment, the credit bureau can eliminate it.
 It is also possible, Ms. Detweiler said, that negative information is being carried long after it should have been removed. ''Collection agencies are notorious for reporting accounts for longer than they should be reported,'' she said, noting that accounts sent to a collection agency should be dropped after seven and a half years.
 Lenders and credit bureaus will also work with a borrower to find other ways to improve a score quickly. A major factor in the FICO score is how close a person is to his or her credit limit, she said, so it may be possible to increase a score by spreading existing debt over several accounts or paying down debt on an account near its limit.
 Ms. Detweiler said that since it costs anywhere from $30 to $120 to correct an individual item on a single credit report, it could cost several hundred dollars to correct multiple items on more than one report. ''But in terms of the ultimate cost of the loan,'' she said, ''that could be a small investment with a huge return.''
 Ryan Sjoblad, a spokesman for Fair Isaacs, said that if a borrower with a score of 674 qualified for a 7.82 percent mortgage, that borrower should be able to get a 6.13 percent rate with a 700 score. On a 30-year, $300,000 mortgage, the monthly payments would be $2,163 and $1,824 respectively. Over the life of the loan, the interest paid would be $478,806 and $356,569 respectively, a difference of $122,237.

HEADLINE: The 5-Cent Coke Goes the Way Of the Sarsaparilla

BYLINE: By JAMES LOMUSCIO

 BODY:
CHANGE is not something that comes quickly to Meeker's Hardware, a 122-year-old family-run business on White Street in Danbury.
 There's still that old register at the front desk. The well-worn wooden floor extends through a maze of aisles with seed and nail bins, barrels and rolls of barbed wire. The shelves are an eclectic mix of lighting fixtures and oil lanterns, cast iron pans and paint cans. And there are scores of 19th-century wooden drawers from which one of the Meekers will ferret out the right size bolt, screw or nut for a customer.
 But on a recent Friday, as the family dog, Alex, napped near the crank-up phonograph, Hal Meeker, the owner, talked about a coming change that surprised many longtime customers and worried his 87-year-old mother, Lucille Meeker. 
 The store, Mr. Meeker said, would finally stop selling 5-cent Cokes, and replace them with 10-cent Pepsis. ''I don't know what he's planning,'' Mrs. Meeker said.
 ''It will look nice, Ma,'' Mr. Meeker responded, referring to the 20-foot-by-10-foot Pepsi sign he plans to have painted outside on a brick wall of the building, next to the 26-foot-by-20-foot Coca-Cola advertisement that has been painted (and repainted) on the building since 1917. 
 ''Delicious Refreshing 5 cents Coca-Cola'' states the weathered sign framed by white and green lines.
 In Danbury, the advertisement is as much an institution as Meeker's Hardware, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Coca-Cola is one of the first images commuters spy as the Metro-North train pulls into the Danbury station. 
 Twenty-two years ago Meeker's began offering 5-cent Cokes in three-ounce cups from a small fountain in the store. Hundreds of people per week, Mr. Meeker said, have stepped in for nickel sodas (if nothing else) over the years, especially during the summer. 
 Customers help themselves to cups and drop nickels into a coffee can. ''As long as we hear a clink in the can, we don't care,'' said Keith Meeker, Mr. Meeker's 24-year-old son. ''We get pennies, and we even found a couple of stones in there from kids.'' 
 Money lost on soda sales has been well worth the good will, said Mr. Meeker, great-grandson of the store's founder. But when a Coca-Cola sales representative recently asked Mr. Meeker to install a more complex and expensive soda fountain, the store's 88-year-old relationship with Coke went flat.
 ''It wasn't my decision, it was theirs,'' Mr. Meeker said. ''Basically, they came and said they would no longer use premixed canisters, and they were going to a soda-in-a-bag system. And they wanted us to rent a new fountain system from them, and the cost was ridiculous. It would have cost us between 20 cents to a quarter to give Coke away for a nickel.'' 
 Harriet Tolve, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Elmsford, N.Y., said, ''The machinery he has to offer Coca-Colas for a nickel is antiquated because we don't offer premix.'' 
 So Mr. Meeker has been talking to James Roach, food service representative for the Pepsi Bottling Group headquartered in Somers, N.Y. The original Pepsi logo will soon be painted on the Meeker's building, but customers will feel the sting of inflation: This sign will say ''10 cents.'' 
 Mr. Roach said Pepsi is ''excited'' to be associated with Meeker's. ''When you come into Danbury and head down White Street, that Coke sign is the first thing you see,'' he said. ''It's a pretty prominent landmark. Now with the changeover, it will certainly be a shining spot in Danbury.''
 Mr. Roach stressed that there would be ''no rental at all for the fountain'' selling 10 cent sodas, though he has struck a deal with Mr. Meeker to put a cooler selling bottles in the store. Those beverages -- all Pepsi products including Aquafina water, Sierra Mist, Gatorade and Lipton iced teas -- will sell for $1.25.
 ''This is going to be a new era,'' Mr. Roach said. ''Coca-Cola was there for such a long time. So, we'll be there for another hundred years or more.''
 So there will not be any confusion as to which sign came first for future generations, Mr. Meeker said he plans to have a 2005 date painted next to the Pepsi advertisement upon its completion. Unwilling to lose to Pepsi, Ms. Tolve said a Coke sales representative has scheduled a meeting with Mr. Meeker to discuss putting in a cooler offering eight-ounce Cokes in classic bottles.
 ''He's really a hardware store, not a soda-pop luncheonette, and we thought, 'Why not try this?''' Ms. Tolve said. ''A cooler would complement the store. Deep down I think he really wants to offer both.'' 
 When asked about the planned meeting with Coca-Cola, Mr. Meeker responded, ''I'm willing to listen, but I'm still going with Pepsi.''
 Shep LaBree, a Danbury native who stopped in to buy a light switch, got news of the changeover as he stood at the counter. ''I'd rather see them stay with Coke, but change in inevitable,'' said Mr. LaBree, who as a small boy would come with his father to the store. 
 He called the years of 5-cent Cokes ''great, a little bonus for coming into a hardware store.'' 
 Ruth Hoggard of Danbury says she and her husband have been loyal customers for 20 years. But her relationship with the store goes back even longer.
 ''I remember coming in here when I was 5 years old with my dad,'' she said. ''We'd come all the way from Ridgefield to shop here.'' 
 She, too, bemoaned the passing of nickel Cokes. ''It's too bad because Meeker's has been doing it for years,'' she said. ''But I don't think it will change things much here. They'll still come in, and they'll get 10-cent Pepsis. It's not the 5-cent colas that sells Meeker's. It's the friendliness, the prices and the products.''
 Ms. Hoggard paused. ''It's Coca-Cola's loss,'' she said. Bart Gannon, owner of a Danbury garden center, got word of the switch to Pepsi as Keith Meeker handed him a bolt that Mr. Gannon needed for a snow scoop. 
 ''You're doubling your price?'' he quipped with feigned surprise. ''How much is this bolt going to cost me now, $14?'' 
 ''It's 38 cents,'' Keith Meeker fired back.
 ''I like Pepsi better than Coke anyway,'' said Mr. Gannon, who said he had worked at Meeker's Hardware part time when he was in college. ''It's the charm of the place. Good luck trying to find that in a big-box store.'' 
 The move to Pepsi also has Mr. Meeker planning some other subtle changes to the store, like reconfiguring the aisles to make the store look bigger.
 ''When I look back on the history of the store, each generation has adapted and grown rather than holding back,'' he said. ''We're going to be bigger, better and older.'' 
 As for customers who might not like having to pay double for a for a 10-cent Pepsi, Jean Hartell, a cashier at Meeker's for the past 15 years, put it this way.
 ''That's still a heck of a deal,'' she said. ''It comes out to only 40 cents for 12 ounces.''

HEADLINE: My Big Fat C.E.O. Paycheck

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
THE spectacle of once-respected corporate titans doing perp walks -- Martha Stewart, Bernard J. Ebbers, Richard M. Scrushy, the list seems endless -- has pretty well tarnished the title of chief executive. But it has done little, it seems, to scratch the gilt from the corner office.
 In fact, the boss enjoyed a hefty raise last year. The chief executives at 179 large companies that had filed proxies by last Tuesday -- and had not changed leaders since last year -- were paid about $9.84 million, on average, up 12 percent from 2003, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, the compensation consultants.
 Surely, chief executives must have done something spectacular to justify all that, right? Well, that's not so clear. The link between rising pay and performance remained muddy -- at best. 
 Profits and stock prices are up, but at many companies they seem to reflect an improving economy rather than managerial expertise. Regardless, the better numbers set off sizable incentive payouts for bosses.
 With investors still smarting from the bursting of the tech bubble, the swift rebound in executive pay is touching some nerves. ''The disconnect between pay and performance keeps getting worse,'' said Christianna Wood, senior investment officer for global equity at Calpers, the California pension fund. ''Investors were really mad when pay did not come down during the three-year bear market, and we are not happy now, when companies reward executives when the stock goes up $2.''
 Even when companies reported modest increases in executive pay, it was often because they shifted from stock options, which are listed as compensation as soon as they are doled out, to outright stock grants to be paid -- and accounted for -- down the road.
 Of course, corporations have been wrestling for decades with ways to link pay to performance, with little success. In the 1980's, they tried tying cash bonuses to rising sales or earnings, only to find that the payouts encouraged executives to make decisions that yielded short-term results -- and, often, longer-term disasters.
 In the 1990's, companies tried stock options, figuring that they would be the best way to tie the executives' fortunes to those of shareholders. Instead, they prompted some managers to time decisions to pump up the stock just when their options vested. Bonuses and options at Tyco and Enron, for example, did little to prevent widespread accounting frauds at either company.
 The secret to linking pay to performance remains elusive. Net income at Eli Lilly fell 29 percent and its return to shareholders dropped 17 percent last year, but its chief executive, Sidney Taurel, saw his pay go up 41 percent, to $12.5 million. 
 Similarly, Sanmina-SCI, the electronics contract manufacturer, has lost money in each of the last three years, and its shareholders' total return fell 27 percent last year, but the pay of its chief executive, Jure Sola, jumped to $15 million from $1.2 million in 2003. 
 SOME paychecks remained robust even if at first blush they looked reduced. Net income at Merck fell 15 percent last year, and total shareholder return dropped 28 percent. The summary compensation tables in the proxy show the pay of the chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin, dropping 39 percent, to $5.9 million from $9.6 million. 
 But Mr. Gilmartin may find it easy to recoup the perceived loss. He got far fewer options last year, but he is participating in a new long-term performance plan that will give him $2.7 million worth of shares next year if he meets earnings targets -- and double that amount if he exceeds them by a set amount. He gets the shares even if the stock price does not rise by a dime. And the payments won't show up until the 2007 proxy.
 Conversely, Apple Computer had a stellar 2004, yet Steven P. Jobs, its chief executive, was paid exactly $1 for his efforts. Why? Apple paid him in advance -- in 2003, it gave him $75 million worth of stock.
 Shareholders are not giving up on tying pay to performance. But now they seem less focused on how executives are paid and more concerned about exactly what they do to earn it.
 ''It's easy to manipulate stock price. It's even easier to manipulate earnings,'' said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, an investment research firm specializing in corporate governance. He, like others, is pressing companies to set pay based on measures that are harder to fudge, like return on capital employed.
 Directors, meanwhile, are spending more time scrutinizing auditor reports and management strategies, looking for just such fudging. And for that, they've been rewarded. Pearl Meyer's data show that average total compensation of directors at 200 large companies probably topped $200,000, up from an average of $176,000 the previous year.
 ''Directors are meeting more often, so their meeting fees are up,'' said Jannice L. Koors, a Pearl Meyer managing director, ''and there's clearly a sense that the liability they face, both personally and professionally, has increased, and thus warrants more pay.''
 Inflated pay for deflated performance has become ever more rankling to shareholders, many of whom are still scrambling to recoup the losses they suffered after the stock market imploded in 2000. 
 Few begrudge Daniel A. Carp, the chief executive of a newly revitalized Eastman Kodak, his $2,172,988 bonus this year, which brought his total compensation to about $4.4 million. But they are likely to squawk about the rich pay package -- $7 million in salary and bonus, 5 million options and nearly $27 million worth of restricted stock -- that Blockbuster awarded to John F. Antioco, its chief executive. After all, Blockbuster lost $1.25 billion last year.
 Pay inflation will not end soon because companies are afraid to lose talent, said Ira Kay, who runs the executive pay practice at the consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
 Still, companies are rethinking the different pieces that make up a pay package. Many, for example, are reigning in common safety nets for chief executives -- like contractual promises of huge severance if the company is acquired, or even if the C.E.O. is fired for incompetence.
 They are also increasingly trying to link pay packages -- most specifically, the size of bonuses, or the conditions attached to the vesting of restricted shares -- to actual corporate performance, particularly total return to shareholders. ''Finally, companies are focusing on the performance part of the pay-for-performance equation,'' Ms. Koors said.
 Examples are easy to find. When net income at Aramark, a food services company, slid 13 percent, total pay for Joseph Neubauer, its chairman and chief executive, fell 20 percent -- and his bonus shrank 47 percent. When net income at Unisys, the computer maker, plunged 85 percent last year, Lawrence A. Weinbach, then its C.E.O., got no bonus and saw his overall pay drop by 17 percent.
 An even starker example is the arrangement for John R. Alm, who became chief executive of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the soft-drink bottler, in January 2004. His contract stipulates that he will lose all his restricted stock if he is no longer at the company when his shares vest in five years. More significantly, he will forfeit all the shares if the stock price has not climbed 10 percent at vesting time, and he will lose half of them if it has not increased by 20 percent.
 Still, many shareholders are not satisfied. Reviewing C.E.O.'s pay -- and how company boards' compensation committees set it -- is at the top of the to-do list for many institutional investors and shareholder activist groups, now that they have succeeded in making companies more forthcoming about revenue, profits and other financial results.
 ''Whether compensation committees are effectively linking pay to performance is now a major corporate governance concern,'' said Martha L. Carter, a senior vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises big investors.
 Only one concern -- the proliferation of stock options -- has abated. A new regulatory requirement to expense options, combined with a sluggish stock market that made many of them valueless in 2000 through 2003, has caused a stampede away from options. Several compensation consultants say they expect that options will soon represent less than 30 percent of total compensation, down from more than 60 percent today.
 Not all alternatives are being warmly received. Shareholders decry plans that do not use ''hard'' measures of performance, such as total return to shareholders. For example, few are applauding Microsoft's two-year-old decision to grant restricted stock on the basis of customer satisfaction and market share, or Disney's plan to tie compensation to performance against the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
 Shareholders do want companies to adopt ''claw back'' provisions that force executives to repay bonuses paid for results that later must be restated, a situation that has kept Qwest, for one, in the news this year. 
 They are also resisting rich change-of-control clauses that provide windfalls to any C.E.O. whose company is acquired, even if that chief gets a high-ranking job at the new company. The $95 million or so that James M. Kilts will probably receive as a result of selling Gillette to Procter & Gamble is raising ire even among those who laud his performance as Gillette's leader. 
 They also decry ''pay for failure'' contracts that heap riches on dismissed chiefs. Carlton S. Fiorina, for instance, left Hewlett-Packard with a severance package that included $14 million in pay, a $7.38 million bonus and $21.1 million in additional compensation from restricted stock holdings and pension payments. 
 Shareholders complain about how difficult it is for outsiders to glean such things as the tax implications of deferring executive compensation or the worth of supplemental retirement plans and other forms of ''stealth compensation'' that do not readily leap off the proxy. ''The way the proxies are now, you can't really figure out how anyone, even Carly, got paid,'' Ms. Wood of Calpers said, referring to Ms. Fiorina.
 Ms. Carter of Institutional Shareholder Services concurred. ''Companies have simply got to do a better job of disclosing total pay packages, and how they play out in different scenarios, such as the C.E.O. being fired or the company being acquired,'' she said.
 In January, for the first time, institutional shareholders, led by Calpers, invited top compensation consultants to a meeting in New York to discuss their concerns -- and to persuade the consultants that they were part of the problem.
 A TOP complaint was that the consultants feed data to compensation committees piecemeal, reporting what other companies are offering in supplementary pensions one day, the trend on bonuses a few days later, the value of stock options a week after that. The directors, in turn, set the different components of their own chief executive's pay package in equally disjointed fashion.
 Consultants acknowledge the problem, and larger firms have begun to add up total compensation, both for peer-group companies and for the client's proposed pay package. ''They used to only ask us for information about direct pay, because they got data about benefits and perks from others,'' said Pearl Meyer, chairwoman of Pearl Meyer & Partners. ''But compensation committees are now taking a more holistic approach to executive pay, so we are now giving them all of the information.'' 
 Governance experts say the full board increasingly wants a better handle on compensation committee deliberations. Many directors fear that they will all be held accountable for egregious pay packages.
 ''The Dick Grasso situation has made a lot of directors more cognizant of the need to get the total picture, see how all the pieces -- the base salary, restricted stock, options, perks, retirement benefits -- add up,'' said Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance Alliance, a consulting firm in Westerville, Ohio.
 She was referring, of course, to the brouhaha that arose when directors at the New York Stock Exchange said they were ignorant of the full extent of the pay package they had approved for the exchange's former chairman, Richard A. Grasso.
 Several companies are voluntarily disclosing much more pay information to their shareholders. These companies have replaced what Ms. Koors called ''the standard proxy boilerplate'' -- a statement that pay was set competitively -- with fuller descriptions of how boards derived the packages they awarded.
 The proxy for Becton Dickinson, for example, included a summary table that laid out the value of total compensation. Honeywell's proxy listed the value of perks like legal fees and personal use of corporate planes and cars. Siebel Systems has promised investors that next year it will begin disclosing the operational and stock-price hurdles that management must scale for restricted shares to vest.
 ''The companies know that new disclosure rules are coming, so they want an 'attaboy' from shareholders for being ahead of the curve and doing it voluntarily,'' Ms. Koors said.
 Slowly but steadily, companies are responding to shareholders' clamor for pay packages to reward long-term thinking, too. This year's proxies show that companies increasingly insist that executives and directors hold about five times their pay in stock, thus making it harder for them to cash in on any short-term lift in the company's fortunes.
 Cardinal Health, for the first time, is requiring its chief executive to hold shares equal in value to five times his salary, and its directors to hold the equivalent in shares of four times their annual retainer. Cendant this year increased its ownership rule for its chief executive to six times salary, from five.
 ''Companies are basically saying to their chiefs, 'We want to keep you on the hook, to make sure that you are not benefiting from a short-term gain that is not sustainable,''' Ms. Koors said.
 EXECUTIVES who do not lead the company down a profitable path may find it harder to develop other ways to cash in. 
 Thomas J. Neff, the chairman of American operations at the executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart, says he has seen a move away from grants of restricted shares that automatically vest after three or five years. In their place, companies are giving shares that vest only if the company hits preset goals for book value, total return or other measures the board deems crucial to success.
 Mr. Neff says that fewer companies are agreeing to automatically vest all options or restricted shares if the chief leaves and that many now offer one or two years of compensation, maximum, upon departure, a sharp drop from the three to five years of pay that used to be routine. ''Boards are no longer routinely letting the C.E.O.'s lawyer draft the contract,'' he said.
 Several companies have clearly learned from past mistakes. The contract of L. Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco International called for an immediate payout of about $135 million if he was dismissed, and a retainer of $3.4 million annually for the rest of his life. His voluntary resignation released Tyco from the terms of the agreement, but directors clearly are cognizant of how expensive fulfilling the contract terms could have been. 
 Tyco's new severance policy limits compensation to twice the executive's base salary and bonuses at the time of termination. In a merger or change-of-control situation, departing executives would receive up to 2.99 times their base salary and bonus. And Tyco now awards stock options that are priced higher than the share price on the day of issue.
 Directors are less likely to clamp down on the pay of newly recruited bosses. Consider the package for C. John Wilder in his first year as the TXU Corporation's chief executive: $1 million in salary, a $16 million bonus and $37 million in long-term incentives. 
 Newcomers have boards at a negotiating disadvantage, compensation experts say. Because they took a gamble by switching jobs, most successfully insist on either a hefty sign-on bonus in cash and stock, or a soft landing -- that is, rich severance -- in case they fail.
 Both eventualities get shareholders' dander up, but experts say the boards have little choice. 
 ''You need to supercharge the offer,'' Mr. Neff said, ''to create an incentive for a person to come in.''

HEADLINE: The New Executive Bonanza: Retirement

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
WHEN Vance D. Coffman retired as chief executive of Lockheed Martin last August, the company wanted to show a little gratitude. So the board endowed a $1.5 million professorship at Iowa State University, Mr. Coffman's alma mater, to honor his steady leadership over 37 years. It also agreed to foot the bill for various expenses, like his country club membership and use of company aircraft, until he steps down as chairman this month at the age of 61.
 Those perks, however, are pocket change compared with the pension that Lockheed, the military contractor, bestowed upon Mr. Coffman a few weeks ago: a $31.5 million lump-sum payment. 
 Everyone knows that chief executives are paid huge amounts of money while they are working. Less known is just how much they make in retirement. At many of America's biggest corporations, it is not uncommon for retired executives who were paid tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars during their tenures to receive $1 million or more in pension benefits every year -- for as long as they live. 
 Some will take home much more. Henry A. McKinnell Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, will be paid about $6.5 million a year after he retires, according to the company's annual proxy statement filed last month. Lee R. Raymond, Exxon Mobil's chief executive, can expect $5.9 million a year.
 At a time when millions of American workers have seen their pension plans pared back or shut down, and millions more are being asked to bear the risk of managing their own retirement savings, departing chief executives are making out better than ever. A total of 113 chief executives can anticipate retirement benefits worth more than $1 million a year; at least 31 may get twice that amount, or more.
 Those findings are based on a review of the 2004 proxy statements of 500 large companies done for Sunday Business by the Corporate Library, an independent corporate-governance research firm. More than two-thirds of those companies -- 339 -- have separate retirement plans for executives only. These special plans, called supplemental executive retirement plans, or SERP's, usually offer better benefits than traditional pension plans and are sometimes guaranteed regardless of the fate of the company itself. And these executive pension plans are often in addition to the subsidized 401(k) and defined-benefit plans available to other employees. 
 Unlike a chief executive's salary or stock options, the cost of these executive pension plans is rarely laid out for shareholders. Instead, the information is usually so deep in a company's regulatory filings that it is difficult to find, let alone calculate. Critics call it ''stealth wealth'' or ''camouflage compensation.'' Many ordinary investors don't have a clue about its cost.
 ''The fact is, we don't have good economic reasons for channeling dollars for this form,'' said Lucian A. Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor and co-author with Jesse Fried of a recent book, ''Pay Without Performance.'' ''There is a clear benefit in terms of making the amount of pay less transparent.''
 As Michael Kenser, an executive compensation consultant at Deloitte & Touche, put it: ''If you wanted to deliver extra compensation and you wanted to do it below the radar screen, you did it through the SERP.''
 WHETHER or not the goal is to hide extra compensation, though, the amounts can be large. Consider Mr. McKinnell, 62, the chief executive of Pfizer and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives from prominent companies. If he steps down from Pfizer in three years, as expected, his supplementary pension benefits have an estimated lump-sum value of $80 million, Professor Bebchuk said. The typical executive retirement plan is based on average salary and bonus, as well as years of service; Pfizer's plan is based on certain long-term incentive awards and grants of restricted stock, too.
 Of course, it's hard to decipher that from information in the proxy. But when those performance payouts and one-time awards of restricted stock are treated as annual pay, they greatly inflate the value of the pension. Without them, Mr. McKinnell would be entitled to only about $37 million in retirement.
 ''It goes against the logic of why a retirement plan is there at all,'' said Shekhar Purohit, an executive compensation consultant at the Delves Group in Chicago. ''A retirement plan helps replace income. It's not wealth-creation replacement.''
 Pfizer's compensation committee discontinued the practice of counting long-term incentives and restricted stock at the end of 2000; the company no longer found it appropriate, a company spokesman said. Nonetheless, veteran Pfizer employees, including Mr. McKinnell, still fall under the company's old rules.
 Certainly, compensation consultants say, chief executives are entitled to maintain their standard of living in retirement. In most cases, Social Security benefits and regular retirement plans would cover only a small fraction of their pay. That is one reason that supplementary retirement benefits have become such an important tool for recruiting a new executive in midcareer.
 But many of the companies that offer supplementary plans are the same ones that pay executives so handsomely. William W. McGuire of the UnitedHealth Group took home more than $210 million in salary, bonus and stock-options gains in five years; Edward E. Whitacre Jr. of SBC Communications made nearly $104 million in the last decade. Each can expect retirement benefits worth more than $5 million a year.
 ''Given their compensation during their working life, it would seem that they, even more than the rest of us, would be able to provide for their retirement by deferring their income into savings,'' said Paul Hodgson, an executive compensation analyst at the Corporate Library, in Portland, Me. 
 UnitedHealth declined to comment. An SBC spokeswoman said Mr. Whitacre's pension reflects his long service and accomplishments.
 The Corporate Library's analysis of executives' retirement benefits assumes that an executive's recent earnings remain the same. Because pay generally increases later in one's career, as do the years of service, it is likely that those benefits could be worth more. 
 Based on the latest available proxy information, at least eight executives are eligible to retire with annual benefits worth $3 million or more. They include Reuben Mark of Colgate-Palmolive, Robert L. Nardelli of Home Depot, Samuel J. Palmisano of I.B.M. and Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America. I.B.M. and Bank of America have recently been sued by workers over changes to their employee pension plans.
 Not every chief executive can expect a pension quite that large. Of the 339 who will receive most of their retirement income from a supplementary employee retirement plan, roughly a quarter will become eligible for an annual pension worth $367,000 or less. 
 About a third of the 500 surveyed companies said senior managers were eligible to participate only in a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), the same as any other employee. Those include many companies in the technology sector, like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and eBay, that have generously compensated top executives with stock options; those three offer no special executive retirement plans at all. 
 ''We are by nature a very egalitarian company,'' said Hani Durzy, an eBay spokesman. ''By and large, the benefits available to executives, while not the same amounts, are the same type available to everyone else.''
 Forty years ago, most corporate pension plans worked that way. Upon retirement, everybody from the lowest-paid worker to the highest-paid manager was covered by a pension that would provide guaranteed benefits. Typically, those were half the employee's final average salary for the rest of his or her life.
 But in 1974, Congress passed legislation that required companies to adequately fund pensions they promised their employees, and to keep executive pensions roughly proportional to what the rank and file received, if they wanted a tax deduction for the plan. Congress had hoped to discourage companies from giving executives exorbitant retirement amounts. 
 Instead, the new rules encouraged companies to set up separate plans for their workers and their top executives, letting the employee plan keep its tax deduction -- but opening the way for executives to ask for more in their supplemental plans, which did not qualify for the deduction. And because these nonqualified benefits did not have to be granted to all employees, it was easy for boards to allow bonuses and sometimes stock options and other incentives to creep into pension calculations.
 As executive compensation soared in the 1980's and 1990's, so did such payouts. More companies started offering them, and because disclosure was so poor, the amounts went largely unchecked.
 Only recently, amid fallout from the $139.5 million retirement package of Richard A. Grasso, the former New York Stock Exchange chairman, have boards started tallying all elements of a pay package.
 ''Compensation committees want to look at SERP's now because of the Grasso effect,'' said Ira T. Kay, an executive compensation consultant at Watson Wyatt in New York. ''It used to be nonexistent. Now I have roughly half my companies doing it.''
 The results are often so startling, other compensation advisers say, that they have invented a term -- the ''holy cow'' moment -- to describe the look on directors' faces when they discover the payouts.
 ''Things pile up and it creeps up on you, and boom, there it goes: holy cow!'' said Michael S. Melbinger, a compensation lawyer at Winston & Strawn in Chicago who advises many boards. ''You don't realize when so many things, when added up, produce an outrageous total.
 ''There have been a lot of holy cow moments during this year's proxy season from compensation committees,'' he added. ''Sometimes, they even use more colorful language.''
 Some of the surprises come from tweaks that may not initially appear to have significant costs. The employment contract of Franklin D. Raines, the Fannie Mae chief executive who was ousted last year, stipulated that his entire $1.4 million annual pension could be passed down to his wife, if she survives him. That provision alone accounts for $5 million of the pension's estimated value of about $25 million, Professor Bebchuk said.
 At some companies, executives are allowed to retire at 60 rather than 65, or they are credited with more time at the company than they actually serve. Each of these tweaks can add considerably to an executive's lifelong retirement benefit.
 E. Linn Draper Jr., the chief executive of the American Electric Power Company, was awarded 36 years pension credit when he stepped down in February 2004, which was enough time to almost triple the value of his annual pension, to about $850,000. Problem is, Mr. Draper had been a company employee for only 12 years.
 A company spokesman said that awarding extra credit for years served is consistent with industry practice and necessary for recruitment and retention.
 STILL, changes are afoot. United Airlines, which has said it must terminate its defined-benefit plan for regular employees if it is to emerge from bankruptcy, recently ended its special plan for executives. Nonetheless, the $4.5 million worth of retirement benefits for Glenn F. Tilton, UAL's chairman and chief executive, who was ineligible for the main executive plan, has remained safe in a special, fully funded trust. And Bank of America has stopped contributing to its supplementary plan for most executives, though Mr. Lewis, its chief executive, will still receive at least a $3.5 million pension.
 Since at least last fall, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing its disclosure policies related to SERP's, though it has set no timetable for deciding whether to rewrite the rules. Some shareholder rights advocates, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Council of Institutional Investors, are not waiting; they have placed the issue high on their corporate governance agendas. In anticipation, several companies, like the credit card giant MBNA, have added tables to their proxies that make identifying the cost of an executive's retirement benefits as easy as finding his salary or bonus.
 But for now, the retirement years for many of today's executives look like they will be as green as they are golden. Consider Mr. Coffman, the Lockheed Martin chief executive. Should his $31.5 million nest egg become depleted, he has another source of income to fall back on: Under the company's ordinary retirement plan, he is eligible to receive $87,187 a year.

HEADLINE: Iraq's Dislocated Minorities Struggle in Urban Enclaves

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BASRA, Iraq 

 BODY:
Adel Abdul Imam al-Helfi sat on the floor of his dim 12-by-18-foot hovel in a dangerous district in downtown Basra, trying to explain what it was like to live in a kind of enclave that has sprouted up all over the country since the invasion two years ago.
 Mr. Imam, once a resident of a remote rural swamp, rushed here with hundreds of his tribal kin after Saddam Hussein's government fell, searching for opportunity and jobs. Instead, he said quietly, they found a place worse than any he had ever known. His fellow tribesman Radi Taqi al-Helfi called up an expression used for someone with a terminal illness, ''We are semi-dead.''
 The great dislocations unleashed by the invasion have created poor, dangerous and often ethnically homogenous urban enclaves on a scale not seen here before. Other areas, like parts of Baghdad's central Baab Sharqi district, had been impoverished before the invasion after years of sanctions, but it became infested with serious crime only after Mr. Hussein's police state collapsed and was replaced by weak security or none at all. 
 Before the invasion, said Col. Faisel Ali, an investigator in a Baghdad major crimes unit, criminals feared the heavy police presence in Baab Sharqi. ''Now, I'm afraid to go to Baab Sharqi, because if the criminals know I'm there, they will kidnap or kill me,'' Colonel Faisel said.
 Mr. Hussein also worked to destroy any sense of community among out-of-favor groups, and failing all else, simply denied that such enclaves existed. As a result, the notion of what an American might call a ghetto is novel enough here that Iraqis do not have a proper word for it. 
 Even now, with consummately Iraqi ridicule, people in the most common enclaves for the new poor -- government complexes that were looted, abandoned and then filled with squatters after the 2003 invasion -- are called Hawassim, literally ''those who produced the decisive victory,'' or just ''the Decisives.'' The reference is to Mr. Hussein's melodramatic term for the invasion: Maarekat al Hawassim, or the Decisive Battle.
 Members of Mr. Imam's tribe, whose accents, ragged dress and weathered, swarthy faces stand out on the streets of Basra, were first driven by war, drought and bad luck into exile in places like Iran and Saudi Arabia.
 Since 2003, they have returned to the Iraqi south and have gathered in the crumbling and sewage-fouled remains of a former naval compound in the middle of Basra. It is a world all its own.
 Unlike the great majority of people here, Mr. Imam's family did not vote in the recent elections, because, he said, they were confused about whether they had the proper identification cards and about where to cast ballots in their neighborhood.
 Mr. Imam's 8-year-old son has been denied entry to school -- he was told that there was no room; his severely diabetic mother has not received proper medical treatment; and there is barely enough electricity in his family's tiny room for a single overhead bulb.
 ''And whenever you go to the officials and say, 'Please help us,' they say, 'Don't speak, because you are staying in unofficial places,''' said his brother, Jassim Abid Ali al-Helfi.
 The last time anything approaching this phenomenon took place in Iraq was in the years surrounding the July 14, 1958, coup that overthrew the monarchy, said Ghassen Atiyyah, a former educator who is the director of the Iraq Foundation for Development and Democracy, based in Baghdad.
 As the poor from all over the Iraqi countryside created a shantytown on Baghdad's northeastern outskirts, Abdul Karim Qasim, who was prime minister from 1958 to 1963, built new housing there and called the district Revolution City. Mr. Hussein renamed it Saddam City. After the 2003 invasion, the district -- now dominated by religious Shiites -- became Sadr City, after a revered cleric who was killed during Mr. Hussein's rule.
 Although the district had always remained a kind of slum that many Baghdadis avoided after dark, Sadr City became a much more lawless place after the invasion, Dr. Atiyyah said. But it was not the only Baghdad neighborhood that went into decline.
 Within Baab Sharqi (literally East Gate, although it is in the center of the city), the Bataween and Orfaliya districts have become havens for illicit drug and alcohol sales, where crime and prostitution flourish just off central commercial streets. Orfaliya is heavily populated by Sudanese who immigrated as guest workers during Mr. Hussein's rule.
 Bataween, dotted with once elegant homes, was a neighborhood of well-to-do Jewish families that were numerous in Iraq decades ago. Drawing on their heritage from ancient Babylon and treated well in the Ottoman Empire, Iraqi Jews made up as much as 30 percent of Baghdad's population in the 1920's and were never forced to form poor enclaves, Dr. Atiyyah said.
 But with the strife that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948, the Jews began moving out. Bataween later became a Christian neighborhood and has most recently attracted poor Muslims in a historical progression that links it to a classic American ghetto. (The word, pronounced here as jetto, sometimes surfaces in Iraq, but it is not commonly used.)
 Most of the recent changes are direct functions of the chaos that has reigned in Iraq since the invasion, Dr. Atiyyah said.
 ''Who is paying attention to social and economic development?'' Dr. Atiyyah said. ''The government is busy with other things.''
 To government officials in Basra, the districts have already become synonymous with crime, hopelessness and strange customs. The former marsh people routinely raise water buffalo and thatch reeds for resale in their urban dwellings, just as they did in the swamp.
 ''They brought their habits to the city, and people living in the city are having real problems with them,'' said Abdula H. Neshan, an official in the Basra governor's building.
 There is disagreement about those assertions inside the old naval compound, where the rows of partly smashed barracks, officers quarters and recently built reed huts cover perhaps half a square mile.
 Other families live in a former brig -- the bars are still on the windows -- surrounded by a moat of greenish sewage. Men with AK-47's wander the grounds among chest-high piles of scrap iron and rotting garbage.
 ''There is some sort of misunderstanding,'' said Sheik Muhammad Faddal Seeyah Hussein al-Amarra, the leader of a large slice of the compound. ''Everywhere in Basra there are such problems.''
 Sheik Muhammad is the slum's sharpest dresser, decked out in a fine head cloth and gold-embroidered dishdasha, which is draped regally over a Western-style pinstriped jacket. He estimated that in his part of the compound alone there were 150 families. Since the invasion, his tribe -- hunters, fishermen and fighters back in the swamp -- have repeatedly sought jobs in the Basra police force and the Iraqi Army while doing odd jobs on construction sites.
 A tiny old woman dressed in a black abaya, Zenuba Hanoon Muail al-Helfi, explained succinctly what had become of those efforts, ''No one is employed.''
 Mr. Imam, 32, and his family of seven live on government food rations and the $3 to $4 he makes every week or 10 days as a temporary construction worker. In a society whose bedrock concept is the alpha male, Mr. Imam sleeps late most days and helps take care of his children around the compound.
 ''If I stay in the same routine,'' Mr. Imam said with shame in his voice, ''I will suffer from mental disease.''

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
I had an editor once whose wife was in the Audubon Society. There were a lot of articles about birds in that newspaper. 
 I had an editor once who loved fishing. There were a lot of articles about fish in that newspaper. 
 Organizations organically respond to please the boss. Bosses naturally surround themselves with people who tell them what they want to hear. 
 When King Lear's favorite daughter spoke frankly to him, and refused to fawn like her sisters, she was instantly banished. Insincerity pays. 
 It is absurd to have yet another investigation into the chuckleheaded assessments on Saddam's phantom W.M.D. that intentionally skirts how the $40 billion-a-year intelligence was molded and manufactured to fit the ideological schemes of those running the White House and Pentagon.
 As the commission's co-chairman, Laurence Silberman, put it: ''Our executive order did not direct us to deal with the use of intelligence by policy makers, and all of us were agreed that that was not part of our inquiry.''
 Huh? That's like an investigation into steroids in baseball that looks only at the drug companies, not the players who muscled up. 
 We don't need a 14-month inquiry producing 601 pages at a cost of $10 million to tell us the data on arms in Iraq was flawed. We know that. When we got over there, we didn't find any.
 This is the fourth exhaustive investigation that has not answered the basic question: How did the White House and Pentagon spin the information and why has no one gotten in trouble for it? If your kid lied and hid stuff from you to do something he thought would be great, then wouldn't admit it and blamed someone else, he'd be punished -- even if his adventure worked out all right for him.
 When the ''values'' president and his aides do it, they're rewarded. Condoleezza Rice was promoted to secretary of state. Stephen Hadley, Condi's old deputy, was promoted to national security adviser. Bob Joseph, a national security aide who helped shovel the uranium hooey into the State of the Union address, is becoming an under secretary of state. Paul Wolfowitz, who painted the takeover of Iraq as such a cakewalk that our troops went in without the proper armor or backup, will run the World Bank. George Tenet, who ran the C.I.A. when Al Qaeda attacked and when Saddam's mushroom cloud gained credibility, got the Medal of Freedom. 
 Then the president appoints a compliant Democrat and a complicit conservative judge to head an inquiry set up to let the president off the hook. 
 Please, no more pantomime investigations. We all know what happened. Dick Cheney and the neocons had a fever to sack Saddam. Mr. Cheney and Rummy persuaded W., ''the Man,'' that it was the manly thing to do. Everybody feigned a 9/11 connection. Ahmad Chalabi conned his neocon pals, thinking he could run Iraq if he gave the Bush administration the smoking gun it needed to sell the war. 
 Suddenly Curveball appeared, the relative of an aide to Mr. Chalabi, to become the lone C.I.A. source with the news that Iraq was cooking up biological agents in mobile facilities hidden from arms inspectors and Western spies. Curveball's obviously sketchy assertions ended up in Mr. Tenet's October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate and Colin Powell's U.N. speech in February 2003, laying the groundwork for an invasion of Iraq.
 Curveball's information was used to justify the war even though it was clear Curveball was a goofball. As the commission report notes, a Defense Department employee at the C.I.A. met with him and ''was concerned by Curveball's apparent 'hangover' during their meeting'' and suspicious that Curveball spoke excellent English, even though the Foreign Service had told U.S. intelligence officials that Curveball did not speak English. 
 By early 2001, the C.I.A. was receiving messages from our Foreign Service, reporting that Curveball was ''out of control'' and off the radar. A foreign intelligence service also warned the C.I.A. in April 2002 that it had ''doubts about Curveball's reliability'' and that elements of the tippling tipster's behavior ''strike us as typical of individuals we would normally assess as fabricators.''
 But Curveball's crazy assertions had traction because they were what the White House wanted to hear.
 The report warns the president to watch out for the ''headstrong'' intelligence agencies. If only the commission had concerned itself with headstrong officials at a higher level. Then its 601 pages would be worth reading.

HEADLINE: Boy Problems

BYLINE: By Ann Hulbert. 
Ann Hulbert is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
'It's her future. Do the math,'' instructs a poster that is part of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.'s two-year-old ''Girls Go Tech'' campaign. Accompanying the message -- which belongs to a series of public service announcements also sponsored by the Ad Council -- is a photograph of an adorable little girl reading a book called ''Charlotte's Web Site.'' The cover of the E. B. White takeoff shows Fern and Wilbur looking intently at Charlotte on a computer screen. The text below warns that ''by sixth grade, an alarming number of girls lose interest in math, science and technology. Which means they won't qualify for most future jobs.''
 But they don't lose interest in reading, this particular ad presumes -- nor do girls lose interest in school, certainly not at the rate boys do. The recent controversy over comments made by Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard, about the gender gap in science and engineering has eclipsed a different educational disparity: boys perform consistently below girls on most tests of reading and verbal skills and lag in college enrollment and degree attainment. After dominating postsecondary education through the late 1970's, young American men now earn 25 percent fewer bachelor's degrees than young women do. 
 Who knows what Summers would say about this phenomenon, which is the flip side of the underrepresentation of female scientists at the top that he was addressing. Male achievement, as he explained, tends toward the extremes when it comes to testing, while females' scores are more concentrated in the middle of the range. What Summers didn't spell out is that boys owe their edge in math to the unusually high performance of a relatively small number of boys in a pool that also has more than its share of low-scoring students. In assessments of verbal literacy, the clumping of boys toward the bottom is more pronounced. 
 The gender disparity widens among low-income and minority students. And it is especially dramatic among African-Americans, a recent Urban Institute study shows. Black women now earn twice as many college degrees as black men do. They also receive double the number of master's degrees. But the female lead isn't just a black phenomenon; among whites, women earn 30 percent more bachelor's degrees than men and some 50 percent more master's degrees. 
 It's his future. Do the math -- but, as the Boy Scouts warn, be prepared. This trend doesn't lend itself to clear-cut treatment. Ignore the male lag, some advocates of girls are inclined to argue, on the grounds that men on average still end up outearning women. Bring back old-fashioned competition and more hard-boiled reading matter, urge advocates for boys like Christina Hoff Sommers, who in ''The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men'' (2000) denounces a touchy-feely, cooperative, progressive ethos that she says undermines boys' performance and school engagement. Males come from Mars and thrive instead on no-nonsense authority, accountability, clarity and peer rivalry.
 What both of these views -- feminist and antifeminist alike -- fail to appreciate is how much patient attentiveness (in the Venus vein) it takes to boost stragglers rather than strivers. In the ''do the math'' mission under way with girls, the overarching goal has been surprisingly competitive: to maintain the momentum of female math students (who do just as well as boys early on in school) and to keep the top achievers in the academic pipeline for those ''future jobs'' in our technological world. The payoff for efforts that have been directed toward school performance has been gratifying. Girls are taking more math and science courses in high school and majoring with greater frequency in those fields in college. (Look at the 40 Intel finalists: this year 38 percent of them were girls.) 
 The educational predicament of boys is fuzzier by comparison and likely to elude tidy empirical diagnosis and well-focused remedies. At the National Bureau of Economic Research (under whose auspices Summers delivered his remarks about women), analysts have been puzzling over the whys behind ''Where the Boys Aren't,'' the title of one working paper. There are some obvious explanations: men in the Army and in prison and more job options for males (in construction and manufacturing) that don't require a college education but pay relatively well.
 Yet there are also murkier social and behavioral -- and biological -- issues at stake that don't augur well for a quick-fix approach. On the front end, boys appear to be later verbal bloomers than girls, which sets them up for early encounters with academic failure -- and which makes early-intervention gambits like the Bush administration's push to emphasize more literacy skills in preschool look misdirected. Down the road, there is evidence that poorer ''noncognitive skills'' (not academic capacity but work habits and conduct) may be what hobble males most, and that growing up in single-parent families takes more of an educational toll on boys than girls.
 Those are challenges that beg for more than school-based strategies. To give her credit, Laura Bush hasn't shied away from them as she starts a boy-focused youth initiative, which runs the gamut from dealing with gangs to financing fatherhood programs to improving remedial English programs. Rewards for such efforts aren't likely to be prompt and aren't aimed at the top -- two reasons they deserve the spotlight. Females have yet more strides to make in the sciences, but they're building on success. A boost-the-boys educational endeavor faces the challenge of dealing with downward drift. Clearly the nation needs an impetus to tackle the larger problem of growing social inequality. Worries that it is boys who are being left behind could be the goad we need.

PERSON: Guenter Reimann

HEADLINE: Guenter Reimann, Economic Publisher, Is Dead at 100

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Guenter Reimann, a Marxist economist early in his career who eventually published one of the most expensive and influential newsletters on international capitalism and monetary exchange, died on Feb. 5 in Valley Stream, N.Y. He was 100 and lived in Manhasset, N.Y. 
 His death was announced by his family.
 In his youth, Mr. Reimann was associated with the Communist opposition to Hitler's rise to power in Germany. After fleeing into exile, first to Britain and then to the United States, he published his first books here analyzing the market systems of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. 
 After World War II, having settled in New York, he started International Reports on Finance and Currency, a weekly advisory compiled for an elite group of subscribers who paid handsomely for it. It made him well-to-do but never changed his own his dim view of capitalism, especially in its unfettered variety. 
 His newsletter billed itself as the ''oldest advisory service in all fields of international finance.'' He started it in the wake of the Bretton Woods conference, which created the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The institutions were established in 1946, but in the postwar chaos official exchange rates were largely on paper only and international commerce often was at the mercy of bartering and black market vagaries. Mr. Reimann helped dispel the confusion with his advisories. 
 His newsletter counted leading economists among a worldwide network of correspondents who provided independent analyses of current conditions and trends. It had bureaus in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia as well as an editorial board of international bankers and academics. 
 Supplements provided specific information for specific areas, at extra cost. The readership was clustered in central banks, embassies, government ministries and the head offices of Fortune 500 companies. 
 Mr. Reimann remained editor in chief until 1982, when he sold his business -- International Reports Inc. of New York, by then a multi-title newsletter on international finance -- to The Financial Times. 
 Guenter Hans Reimann was born Hans Steinecke, scion of a merchant family, in Angermunde, northeast of Berlin. He linked up with the leftist youth movement at 14 and joined the Communist Party, a strong force at the time. At 17, he was business editor of Red Banner, a party organ. He graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Berlin in 1928, and in the early 1930's traveled in the Soviet Union, by invitation, to report on its economic programs.
 By that time he had parted company with the German Communist Party because of its growing fealty to Moscow. Once Hitler came to power, he went underground with the leftist resistance; he took the name Guenter Reimann and kept it for the rest of his life.
 He left Germany in the mid-1930's and went to Paris and then London, where he learned about international finance from the economist John Atkinson Hobson. When British authorities moved to send him back to Germany as an undesirable alien for having engaged in politics, the American Friends Service Committee arranged for him to come to the United States as a political refugee in 1937.
 A book he had researched at the British Library, ''The Vampire Economy: Doing Business Under Fascism,'' was published by Vanguard Press in 1939. He followed it with two other analytical works, ''The Myth of the Total State'' (1941) and ''Patents for Hitler'' (1942). 
 As a New Yorker, Mr. Reimann never lost touch with the land of his birth. After the war he took a public stand against the Morgenthau Plan, a wartime proposal that envisioned a totally de-industrialized Germany.
 His testimony before Congress helped win the repeal of the Trading With the Enemy Act, which immediately opened the way for the shipment of CARE packages to German families needing food, clothing and medicines. He also maintained a steady correspondence with Herbert Wehner, the German Social Democratic leader, an old friend once exiled like himself. It was published in book form in 1998. 
 Mr. Reimann is survived by his wife of 50 years, Jutta Ruesch Reimann; their daughter, Karen Reimann-Steinecke of Dresden, Germany, and son, Robert Reimann-Steinecke of Port Washington, N.Y.; a daughter and son from his earlier marriage, Margaret Reimann of Bedford, Pa., and John Reimann of Oakland, Calif.; four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.

HEADLINE: A GLOBAL AGENDA

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN; Neela Banerjee and Andy Newman contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The next pope faces challenges so urgent that many church leaders and analysts worry that even a pope with the charisma and capacity of John Paul II will have to resort to a strategy of triage. 
 The rich nations pose one set of concerns: the Roman Catholic Church is withering in Europe, the continent that once supplied it with priests, cathedrals and intellect, while in the United States, the church is self-consciously struggling to make its message relevant in a materialistic society where even religion is market driven. 
 The poorer countries pose a different set of concerns: in Latin America, home to 4 of every 10 Catholics in the world, priests say they cannot compete effectively with the exuberant, proliferating evangelical and Pentecostal churches. In Africa and Asia, growing Catholic populations often live uneasily among Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.
 The Roman Catholic Church is, more than ever, a global institution with global problems. With more than one billion members, amounting to half the world's Christians and 17 percent of the world's population, it is the largest and wealthiest religious or charitable institution on the planet. 
 But the biggest concerns of the new century -- the turmoil within the Muslim world and the explosive shift of economic power to India and China -- did not draw the focus of John Paul. As he proved, the church's leader is capable of changing the course of history. But the church has to make choices. 
 ''One question that the leadership of the church has to ask itself,'' said Christopher M. Bellitto, academic editor at Paulist Press, a large Catholic publishing house, ''is will it invest most of its time and money and energy in what we used to call the third world, or will it try to pull Europe and North America back from the materialism that John Paul II said was the curse of capitalism?''
 The choice may be embodied in the selection of a new pope. In the weeks leading to the conclave, the cardinals will be discussing among themselves not only who should lead, but what the church's priorities are. If they choose a candidate from Africa, or more likely, Latin America, it may signal that their primary concern is with the church in the Southern Hemisphere. Or they could choose a pope from Europe because he can speak convincingly to the West about its growing religious indifference. 
 Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas of Tucson said, ''As a church I think we're kind of tired, and I think we've lost a little bit of our confidence.'' The church in the United States, and in countries like Austria and Ireland, is still reeling from the disclosures of sexual abuse by priests. Bishop Kicanas's own diocese declared bankruptcy in the face of mounting lawsuits by people asserting abuse.
 He says he regularly meets Catholics who are hungry for spiritual teaching but skeptical that the Catholic Church actually lives what it preaches. The major challenge facing the church is, he said, ''to articulate the message of the faith in a way that's actually influential and convincing to people.'' 
 The most pressing problem facing the church, said Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, archbishop of Washington, is ''the secularity of our society, the passivity of people with regard to things of God.'' 
 In the third world, the church does not face the problem of making Christianity relevant. By serving the poor, refugees or people with AIDS, by speaking out on corruption, deforestation or global debt relief, churches are engaged in peoples' lives. 
 A crucial and delicate challenge for the next pope is relations with Islam at a time when militant Islam is on the rise. The church under John Paul focused its major interfaith and ecumenical initiatives on mending relations with Jews and Orthodox Christianity. But now the most urgent interfaith dialogue must be with Muslims, said Daniel Thompson, a theology and religious studies professor at Fordham University. 
 ''There are many countries in the world where the Christian and Muslim populations are at odds with each other,'' he said. ''The south of the Philippines is dominated by a Muslim majority and the northern part is Catholic. There are tensions there.''
 There are disagreements among Catholic theologians, he said, about how to engage with Muslims, and which Muslims to engage. Some theologians want to acknowledge that ''there has been a lot of historical damage wrought by people in the name of Christianity on the Muslim people,'' Mr. Thompson said, while others believe the focus should be on the wrongs perpetrated by Muslim extremists more recently. The next pope should help the church set a clear direction, he said. 
 The church is also struggling to respond to the rapid developments in science and biotechnology. Cloning, stem-cell research and new possibilities for genetic screening and selection will all be a test of how to apply the church's moral teaching on the sanctity of life. Vatican conferences have taken up those questions, but the church will need a pope not only conversant with the issues, but also driven by a clear vision on how to apply church teaching to these 21st century developments.
 George Weigel, senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a Catholic theologian, said in a January speech, ''Many cardinal-electors have the sense that the world has, at best, a 10-to-20-year window in which to build the legal and regulatory structures necessary to channel humanity's new genetic knowledge, and its marriage to technology, in directions that will lead to healing and genuine human flourishing rather than to Huxley's nightmare.''
 The problem in Latin America, and among Hispanics in the United States, is the proliferation of Pentecostal churches with their exuberant worship services and ability to provide instant social networks for rural residents looking for work in cities.
 The evangelical and Pentecostal churches in Latin America are powered by pastors who are often lay people, outnumbering Catholic clergy who must be ordained and make a lifelong commitment to the church and to celibacy. 
 Mary Gautier, senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University, said the priest shortage is global: ''Relative to the rest of the world, the United States is in very good shape. South and Central America are very Catholic cultures, but people wait years to get their babies baptized. They may see a priest only once a year. They don't have access to the sacraments the way we expect to. If Americans can't get communion on Sunday, we think there's something drastically wrong with our church.''
 While the church has grown by a quarter of a billion people during John Paul's 26-year papacy, the number of priests worldwide is about 400,000 -- almost exactly the same as when he started his globe-trotting evangelization campaign. Where should the church send newly ordained priests when they are needed everywhere?
 Bishop Ricardo Ramirez, who serves the priest-poor diocese of Las Cruces, New Mexico, said, ''I've asked my bishop friends in Mexico to send me priests, and they say, 'We'll keep you in mind, but right now our dioceses are growing and our cities are growing and we need all the priests we are getting.'''
 Another challenge facing a global church is how much autonomy priests and bishops should be given to adapt church teaching and liturgy to their own cultures. After the second Vatican Council of the early 1960's, the plan was for greater regional autonomy from Rome. But John Paul recentralized church authority.
 When the bishops from Asia held a synod in Rome in 1998, some of them confronted their colleagues in the Vatican with the autonomy issue, said the Rev. Peter C. Phan, a professor of Catholic social thought at Georgetown University. The bishop from Japan asked what was the point of composing all liturgical texts in Latin, then sending them to be translated to Japan, only to send them back to Rome for approval by Vatican officials who could not read Japanese. 
 ''The second thing on their minds is married clergy,'' Father Phan said. ''They have been asking for the possibility of married clergy because in Asia the number of priests is small. And Rome simply does not answer.''
 The question of whether local culture can be integrated into church practices, and if so how much, goes back to the 15th century, Professor Thompson of Fordham said. With the centralization of authority in the Vatican under John Paul, how much autonomy to permit local bishops has again become a pressing issue, he said. 
 ''That is a question that goes from St. Patrick's in New York all the way to Bangkok,'' Professor Thompson said. 
 The Rev. Ian T. Douglas, professor of world mission and global Christianity at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''When the Catholic Church was simply a Mediterranean church or a Western European church, it was a lot easier to know the limits of authority.'' 
 ''You knew who's in and who's out,'' he said, ''belief structures, tenets, doctrinal understandings. Now you have all these cultures, languages and peoples trying to find their way within a common fellowship.''

HEADLINE: Doctors Lobbying to Halt Cuts to Medicare Payments

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3 

 BODY:
Doctors are mobilizing a nationwide lobbying campaign to stave off cuts in their Medicare fees as Congress hunts for ways to rein in the soaring cost of the insurance program.
 Because of a quirk in federal law, Medicare will cut payments to doctors by 4 percent to 5 percent in each of the next six years, Bush administration officials say.
 ''This is a very difficult problem,'' Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said last week. ''Unless something changes, there will be quite substantial reductions in physician fees.'' 
 Doctors said that if the cuts took effect, they would be less likely to treat Medicare patients because the payments would not cover the costs of care.
 Dr. Nancy H. Nielsen, the speaker of the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association, said the cuts ''would have a devastating effect on access to care'' for elderly and disabled patients.
 The association is urging its members to make telephone calls and send e-mail messages to Congress, which reconvenes this week, and it has organized a nationwide network of patients to ''help stop the cuts.'' It has also devised posters for display in doctors' offices, saying that the cuts threaten ''physicians' ability to serve Medicare patients in the future.''
 Any action by Congress would affect beneficiaries and perhaps other taxpayers as well. Premiums are adjusted each year to cover about 25 percent of Medicare spending for doctors and other health care professionals. So if Medicare pays doctors more, premiums will rise even more than projected under current law.
 The basic premium, $78.20 a month, has increased 33 percent in the last two years. The Bush administration predicts that premiums next year, for basic coverage and the new prescription drug benefit, will total about $125 a month, or $1,500 a year.
 Advocates for Medicare beneficiaries are torn. They express alarm at the prospect of higher premiums. But they worry that doctors will refuse to take new Medicare patients if payments are cut.
 ''Rising Medicare costs have a direct impact on premiums,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group. ''But if payments to doctors are cut significantly over several years, beneficiaries could have problems gaining access to physicians, especially in rural areas.''
 John C. Rother, the policy director of AARP, said that a modest increase in Medicare payments to doctors might be appropriate. But Mr. Rother said: ''The cost should not be factored into the premiums for beneficiaries. Given the extraordinary increase in premiums in recent years, we cannot tolerate much more.''
 The latest annual report from the Medicare board of trustees, issued on March 23, said that federal law, as it now stands, would produce ''physician payment updates of about minus 5 percent annually for six consecutive years, beginning in 2006.''
 Those are not just reductions in the rate of growth, but cuts in fees that would be paid for each service -- a cumulative reduction of 26 percent by 2011.
 Doctors say Medicare should pay them more because they are spending more for supplies, office personnel and malpractice insurance. In official estimates of federal spending and the deficit, Congress and the Bush administration have assumed a continuation of current law, which calls for the cuts in doctors' fees. Just to keep fees at current levels would thus generate new costs under the accounting rules used by the government.
 A confidential memorandum to Mr. Leavitt describes the situation this way: ''Keeping Medicare physician fees at the current 2005 level -- a 10-year freeze -- would cost about $110 billion in federal dollars, increase the federal deficit by the same amount, and increase beneficiary premiums by about $35 billion.''
 General tax revenues cover about 75 percent of the cost of Part B of Medicare, which pays for doctors' services. Congress is under immense pressure to reduce the budget deficit, but lawmakers listen closely to their physician constituents, and many see merit in the doctors' concerns.
 ''The current Medicare payment system for physicians is unsustainable,'' said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut and the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Health of the Ways and Means Committee. ''We cannot allow Medicare's payments to doctors to fall through the floor while the cost of providing care continues to rise.''
 Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, said Congress should proceed with caution. By increasing the number and complexity of the services they provide, he said, doctors can maintain or increase their incomes even if the fee for each procedure is reduced.
 In more than two decades of work on Medicare, Mr. Stark said, he has found that medical societies are far more likely to seek ''more money for their members'' than to lobby for legislation to help their patients or the uninsured.
 Many doctors, like cardiologists and ophthalmologists, depend heavily on Medicare. But fees paid by private insurers and other government programs are often linked to the Medicare fee schedule. So Medicare policy has implications that extend beyond the 41 million beneficiaries.
 The impending cuts are an unintended result of a complex formula used to pay doctors. The formula sets goals for spending each year, based on economic growth and other factors. If spending repeatedly exceeds the goals, Medicare reduces the fees that would otherwise be paid in later years.
 As Congress considers ways to slow the growth of Medicare, doctors find themselves competing against hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers for a limited pot of money.
 ''Physicians have a very legitimate concern that needs to be addressed,'' said Richard J. Pollack, the executive vice president of the American Hospital Association. ''But the doctors' problem should not be solved by cutting Medicare payments to hospitals. That would just create another set of problems.''
 William A. Dombi, vice president of the National Association for Home Care, said he worried that Congress would help finance an increase in payments to doctors by imposing a co-payment on home health services. Home care agencies and advocates for the elderly say such a co-payment would amount to a ''sick tax.''
 The Medicare formula, established under laws passed in 1989 and 1997, was supposed to establish a ''sustainable growth rate'' for spending on doctors' services.
 But Glenn M. Hackbarth, the chairman of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent federal panel, said the formula had severe flaws. It sets a national goal for spending, with ''no incentive for individual physicians to control the volume of services'' they provide, he said.
 Mr. Hackbarth added, ''And it is inequitable because it treats all physicians and regions of the country alike.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Takes Step Toward New Government

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 3 

 BODY:
The Iraqi national assembly appointed a speaker and two deputy speakers on Sunday, taking the first step, though a largely symbolic one, toward installing a new government.
 In last-minute deal making on Saturday and Sunday morning, the leaders of the top political parties settled on Hajim M. al-Hassani, a prominent Sunni Arab and the minister of industry in the interim government, as speaker. They selected Hussain al-Shahristani, a nuclear physicist and leading Shiite Arab, and Arif Taifour, a Kurd, as the two deputies.
 Speaker of the assembly is a largely ceremonial post, and so the step the assembly took was more symbolic than substantive. But it showed that the various parties could at least resolve their differences on minor issues. The first significant move will only occur if the assembly agrees on a president and two vice presidents. Those officers would then have two weeks to select a prime minister, who would appoint a cabinet. 
 The assembly formalized the selections in an hourlong voting session. Mr. Hassani was appointed after several days of fractious negotiations, in which various groups reviewed and rejected candidates. The groups had agreed that a Sunni Arab should take the post, but could not settle on which one.
 At the second meeting of the 275-member assembly, on March 29, the assembly did not pick a speaker because Sheik Ghazi al-Yawar, the interim Iraqi president, had rejected the job. That stirred more unrest among many Iraqis, who have been eagerly awaiting the installation of a government since the Jan. 30 elections. The talks to form a coalition government have been mired in debate over many issues, including control of oil revenues and the role of Islam in the new government.
 After the votes were counted Sunday, Mr. Hassani took a seat at 12:20 p.m. at a table at the head of the assembly. He was flanked by his two deputies. He then urged the assembly members to move past ethnic and sectarian differences to work for the greater good of Iraq.
 ''The Iraqi people have placed their trust in you to rebuild the destroyed country and to eliminate all administrative and financial corruption in state establishments,'' said Mr. Hassani, 50, who earned a doctorate at the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics of the University of Connecticut and lived in Los Angeles for 12 years. ''You should be part of the suffering of your people.''
 Outside the assembly room, Mr. Hassani told reporters, ''I am an Iraqi before I am a Sunni.''
 He ran for the assembly as the second name on the Iraqis Party slate led by Sheik Yawar. During the formal American occupation and the start of the interim government, Mr. Hassani was a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, a religious Sunni group. But last November, when that party called for withdrawal from the interim government over the government's support for the American assault on Falluja, Mr. Hassani decided to leave the party and continue in his ministerial role.
 To Western reporters, Mr. Hassani puts forth a secular appearance and underscores his time in the United States. But his former ties to the Iraqi Islamic Party indicate that he could support conservative Islamic policies for the new government.
 In recent weeks, the main Shiite and Kurdish blocs, which together have more than two-thirds of the assembly seats, have said they want to ensure that prominent Sunni Arabs have significant roles in the new government. Mr. Hassani's appointment was a nod in that direction. The Sunnis, who held the bulk of political power in Saddam Hussein's government, make up a fifth of the population and lead the insurgency. 
 ''I think he's well accepted personally, and this acceptance will give him a broad base among the Sunnis, but this does not rule out that there will be opposition among some Sunnis,'' said Jawad al-Maliki, a deputy leader of the Dawa Islamic Party, a powerful Shiite group whose leader, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, is the top candidate for prime minister.
 Officials from the various parties said several issues still had to be worked out before the rest of the government would be appointed. The politicians have yet to determine who will take the vice presidential post they intend to give to a Sunni Arab: Sheik Yawar, the interim president, or Sharif Ali bin al-Hussein, a member of the Hashemite dynasty. The parties also need to work out who will get the most coveted ministry jobs, like oil minister.
 Assembly members said they would meet Wednesday to appoint the presidency council.
 Raja al-Khuzai, an assembly member on the slate led by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, said it was asking for the Interior Ministry, a deputy prime minister post and a vice presidency.
 During an intermission on Sunday, a mortar landed outside the fortified Green Zone, where the assembly meeting was being held.
 American military officials updated the casualty count from a well-organized insurgent attack on Abu Ghraib prison on Saturday evening. At least 23 soldiers and marines were wounded, most of them slightly, the officials said. Thirteen Iraqi prisoners were also wounded. Forty to 60 guerrillas took part in the assault.
 News agencies reported that the group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant, took responsibility in an Internet posting.
 Also on Sunday, the American military said a marine was killed by an explosion on Saturday in Haditha, in western Iraq. Another American soldier was killed Sunday evening in a roadside bomb explosion near Bayji in northern Iraq, the military said.

HEADLINE: Ungainful Employment

 BODY:
It was back to a glum future for job seekers in March, as the economy added only 110,000 new jobs, the worst monthly showing since last July and only about half the number economists had expected.
 The longer-term trend is even more disturbing than the monthly snapshot. In 6 of the last 12 months, job creation has not been strong enoughto absorb the growth of the work force. In sucha weak labor market, wages are stagnant or falling. Over the past year, for instance, hourly wage increases averaged only 2.6 percent for the 80 percent of the work force made up of non-managers in both white- and blue-collar jobs. The inflation rate for the same period has not yet been released, but it's a safe call that in March, wages failed to outpace price increases, as has happened every month since last May. That adds up to only one thing: a downturnin living standards, which will accelerate as oil prices, now well above $50 a barrel, consume an ever larger chunk of take-home pay. 
 In responding to the new numbers, the Bush administration chose to highlight the modest fall in the March unemployment rate. That's diversionary. Unlike the job creation number, the unemployment rate is derived from a notoriously volatile survey that almost certainly overstates March's job growth and thus understates weakness in the labor market. Other numbers in the report reveal a fuller picture. For example, the percentage of people who have been looking for jobs for at least six months ticked up in March, as did the average length of joblessness. According to research by the Economic Policy Institute, those factors suggest far more slack than the unemployment rate indicates. What the report really shows is that the Bush administration has succeeded in delivering decent economic growth, but has failed to ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared.

HEADLINE: 25 Years Ago, the Subways Stopped Running

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago this week, a strike by 33,000 transit workers shut down much of New York City and tested the resourcefulness, patience and sanity of more than 3 million subway and bus riders. 
 No commemoration of the strike has been planned, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which faces a round of labor negotiations in December, would probably prefer that it be long forgotten. But the 11-day walkout -- the second of only two general strikes in the subway system's history -- remains an indelible memory for New Yorkers who lived through it.
 The strike represented the last major effort by New York workers to challenge the fiscal austerity that had taken hold after the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975, according to Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. 
 The strike began early on the morning of April 1, 1980, after the board of the city's major transit union rejected management's offer of a 6 percent wage increase in each of the next two years. ''There was a pent-up feeling on the part of the transit workers, who, because of the fiscal stringencies of the 70's, hadn't had a wage increase in a long time,'' said Richard Ravitch, the authority's chairman at the time.
 The walkout was orderly, but shutting down the country's largest mass transit system, even temporarily, involved complex coordination. 
 Police officers roped and chained turnstiles and stairways at 458 subway stations with 2,000 entrances. Bus drivers, train operators and conductors were ordered to complete their runs and park their buses and trains in depots. 
 Edward I. Koch, who was mayor at the time, said the strike was terrifying at first. ''We were scared to death,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ''Remember, I had no experience with a strike. I had been in office two years.''
 But Mr. Koch said he was determined not to repeat the experience of John V. Lindsay, who had endured a 13-day transit strike that began the day he took office in 1966. Mr. Lindsay had urged workers to stay home unless they considered themselves ''essential.'' 
 By contrast, Mr. Koch ordered all city employees to work and famously stood on the Brooklyn Bridge, cheering on commuters walking across it.
 ''I thought: There are the municipal workers coming to save the city,'' he wrote in ''Mayor,'' his 1984 autobiography. ''It was like the Russian Army coming over frozen Lake Ladoga to save Leningrad.''
 During rush hours, cars were not permitted in Manhattan south of 96th Street without at least one passenger. Drivers lined up at bridge and tunnel entrances and competed with one another to pick up hitchhikers. 
 Entrepreneurs saw opportunity in the confusion. The cost of bicycle rentals, taxicab rides, garage spaces and gasoline -- even space on a stranger's couch -- soared. The city estimated that 500,000 people stayed in hotels or with friends or relatives in Manhattan.
 Hotels, restaurants, theaters and taxi drivers thrived. Some commercial banks ferried employees on chartered buses and boats. But manufacturing firms were hit hard, especially those in the garment industry. Hospitals reported an increase in visits from elderly people who had been left unattended because visiting nurses could not get to them. The City University of New York canceled classes at three campuses.
 The sight of people wearing business suits along with sneakers or jogging shoes became common, as did the practice of carrying a tote bag with a pair of casual footwear.
 In the end, the strike was estimated to have cost $75 million to $100 million in lost income for workers and companies -- and $3 million a day in overtime and lost taxes for the city.
 The strike resulted from bitter dissent within the union, Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union of America. Many members believed that the union's president, John E. Lawe, had not stood up to the city in previous negotiations. ''We had had two miserable contracts in a row,'' said George McAnanama, who was on the union's executive board at the time and is now an employee of the union.
 Mr. Koch and the city's business leaders were equally adamant that Mr. Ravitch not give in to the union's demands, fearful that doing so would set a costly precedent for future municipal contracts. 
 In the end, the authority made a new offer that included a 9 percent wage increase in the first year, an 8 percent increase in the second and a cost-of-living adjustment that helped offset the high inflation at the time. The union had been seeking 15 percent in the first year, and 10 percent in the second. 
 But even after a quarter-century, there is no consensus on whether the strike was necessary. 
 ''It was not the inability of me and the union to agree, it was the external forces -- Ed Koch on the one hand and militants in Lawe's union -- who prevented a settlement,'' Mr. Ravitch said yesterday.
 Mr. Koch, for his part, said Mr. Ravitch lost at the bargaining table what defiant commuters -- by surviving without the subway for 11 days -- had won on the streets. ''I thought he gave too much, and he did it without telling me,'' Mr. Koch said.

PERSON: Walter Thabit

HEADLINE: Walter Thabit, 83, Leader In Activism in City Planning

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Walter Thabit, a leader among city planners in pressing cities to build low-cost housing and encourage diversity in blighted areas, a movement now known as advocacy planning, died on March 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
 The cause was complications of Barrett's esophagus, in which esophageal cells change because of irritation, said his son Nikolai. 
 Mr. Thabit approached urban planning as an activist. Projects should benefit a site's residents, he argued, not politicians or developers. 
 Working as a consultant and offering his technical skills, Mr. Thabit helped members of more than a dozen communities in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania create their own development plans in response to city redevelopment proposals that threatened to displace many residents. 
 For example, when New York City's Committee on Slum Clearance set its sights on Cooper Square on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, neighborhood residents turned to Mr. Thabit for help in drawing up a plan that they succeeded in persuading the city to adopt in 1970. 
 More than 60 percent of the apartments that have since been built or renovated under the plan are low-income units, according to the Cooper Square Committee. 
 In 1964, Mr. Thabit founded Planners for Equal Opportunity, a progressive group with 600 members. It was succeeded in 1975 by the Planners Network.
 Mr. Thabit was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 20, 1921. He received a bachelor's degree in design from Brooklyn College and master's degrees in sociology from the New School and in city planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 After working as a planning analyst in New York, he was director of the master plan section in Baltimore's Department of City Planning from 1954 to 1958. He then worked as a planning consultant. 
 In the late 1960's he was New York City's planner for East New York, Brooklyn, and he later described the area's challenges in his book ''How East New York Became a Ghetto'' (New York University Press, 2003). 
 From 1976 to 1980, he was senior planner for New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission, and from 1980 to 1988, he was an associate city planner in the city's Department of Transportation. 
 Mr. Thabit's marriage to the former Frances Thargay ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: New Pope Could Influence Political Life in America

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3 

 BODY:
The death of Pope John Paul II came at a time when leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, reflecting the tone set by the Vatican, have become increasingly assertive in American political life. Their stance has created strains with some Catholic Democrats just as the White House has sought to make inroads with the once solidly Democratic Catholic constituency.
 Several Catholic academics and elected officials said on Sunday that the shift -- highlighted last year when some church leaders said Senator John Kerry should be denied communion because he supports abortion rights -- reflected the tone set by a pope who was known for being conservative and for being willing to confront governments to press his views. They said the choice of the next pontiff could thus prove nearly as important for American political life as for the Vatican itself, as Democrats and Republicans here face increasingly pitched battles over judicial nominations, abortion, gay rights and euthanasia.
 One of the potential successors to John Paul is Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria, who during last year's presidential campaign said a politician who supported abortion ''is not fit'' to receive communion. 
 ''I've seen an increase in directly political kinds of activity: what the responsibilities of Catholics are, how they should vote, etc.,'' said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University and the author of numerous books and articles on religion and politics. ''Some Vatican officials are pressing for more direct activism in public life and are willing to be more critical of public policy figures who do not take what they consider to be the right positions on policy issues.''
 John T. McGreevy, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, said: ''John Paul had this culture of life vision. And that has sort of radicalized and emboldened some bishops.''
 The attempt by some Catholic Church leaders to influence American policy goes back at least to the 1930's, when bishops pressed President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create Social Security. The notion of church activism was fostered by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council 40 years ago, which encouraged bishops to advocate government programs to help the poor.
 But in recent years, the emphasis has shifted away from fighting poverty and standing up for civil rights, issues associated with the Democratic Party, and toward issues like opposition to abortion, gay rights and euthanasia, issues that Mr. Bush and the Republicans have embraced. 
 At times last year, this assertiveness went beyond policy and into electoral politics, as some bishops hinted that their parishioners should vote for Mr. Bush instead of Mr. Kerry. At St. Patrick's Church in Wareham, Mass., for example, parishioners said that at the Saturday evening Mass right after the death of the pope, they were given pamphlets notifying them that they would be asked next week to sign postcards to Mr. Kerry and the state's other Democratic senator, Edward M. Kennedy, reading: ''Please do not make support of the U.S. Supreme Court's abortion decision a litmus test for judicial nominees.''
 The rising assertiveness of some church leaders is particularly significant for American politics because President Bush has been making a concerted effort to win support among Catholic voters. Mr. Bush's efforts are part of an overall drive by his chief adviser, Karl Rove, to make inroads among typically Democratic groups of voters.
 Mr. Bush assembled a group of Catholic advisers and began meeting with them regularly as soon as he entered the White House. Shortly after the Vatican announced the death of the pontiff, Mr. Bush and Laura Bush walked in unannounced to a Saturday afternoon Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle. Mr. Bush's aides said Sunday that he expected to attend the funeral but had not made formal plans pending an invitation from the Vatican.
 In talking about the dispute over the fate of Terri Schiavo, the severely brain-damaged Florida woman who died last week, Mr. Bush borrowed what had been a signature phrase of John Paul, as he talked about guarding ''the culture of life,'' and he has forcefully embraced the Vatican's views on abortion, stem cell research and gay marriage.
 ''It is remarkable that a Republican non-Catholic president would be echoing this papal phrase,'' Professor McGreevy said. ''Clearly, focusing on abortion and end-of-life issues, that was a big issue of this pope.''
 There is evidence that Mr. Bush has had some success in this regard. In last year's presidential election, Catholics supported Mr. Bush over Mr. Kerry, a Roman Catholic, by 52 percent to 47 percent, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls. Catholics made up 27 percent of the electorate last year, but they are disproportionately clustered in swing states, particularly Ohio and Pennsylvania, making them an important target in presidential campaigns.
 Roman Catholics, however, are hardly a unified bloc of voters, and some analysts suggested on Sunday that the prominent bishops at the forefront of these recent battles are more conservative than most Catholic voters or, indeed, their fellow bishops. 
 Most polls show that Catholics support at least some access to abortion. And Mr. Bush's success with those voters last year came among the more devout: regular church-going Catholics supported him by 56 percent to 43 percent. Catholics who attend church less than once a week supported Mr. Bush by 50 percent to 49 percent. Mr. Kerry was the third Catholic who has won a major party's nomination for president; Kennedy was the only Catholic to have been elected president. After Mr. Kerry's defeat, a number of Democrats said they could not see how in this environment a Catholic Democrat could win the presidency, given that he or she would almost certainly have to support abortion rights to win the nomination.
 There is arguably no other religion that has had such a contentious relationship with American politics, and Mr. Kerry is certainly not the first roman Catholic politician who has had difficulty with his church because of his views on issues of abortion. Most famously, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York tangled with Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York after the cardinal said he did not see how ''a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion.'' 
 Last May, 48 Democratic Catholics in Congress sent a letter to Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick of Washington, the chairman of the Task Force on Catholic Bishops and Catholic Politicians, expressing concern about the threat of withholding communion from Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. One of the signers, Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said she hoped the change of leadership at the Vatican would result in the church's turning its attention to what had been a traditional concern: ''the great traditions of economic and social justice.''
 Some Catholic leaders suggested it would be a mistake for the next pope to continue down the road of involvement in politics and policy.
 ''I really think it was counterproductive to have done what was done in the last election,'' said Margaret O'Brien Steinfels, a former editor of Commonweal, the magazine of the Catholic laity. ''I don't think it's going to work. I think it's a mistake for bishops to get involved to that degree in policy. I don't think the bishops should tell people who they should vote for. All they do is dilute their own credibility.''

 FINALIST Borzou Daragahi, a freelance journalist writing for The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J., for articles on the Iraq war's impact on citizens and soldiers.
 NATIONAL REPORTING
 Walt Bogdanich
 The New York Times
 The judges honored Mr. Bogdanich for his series ''Death on the Tracks,'' which revealed that some major railroad companies sidestepped responsibility for grade-crossing fatalities by destroying or losing evidence and failing to report hundreds of accidents, and also showed the ineffective oversight by government regulators. Mr. Bogdanich, 54, conducted hundreds of interviews in the 15-month investigation, which began in 2003, ''and the real challenge,'' he said, ''was to try to get documents for every serious allegation we made.''

 Although he has been reviewing movies for more than four decades -- the last 10 years with The Journal -- Mr. Morgenstern, 72, says he has not tired of the task. The Pulitzer judges praised him for reviews ''that elucidated the strengths and weaknesses of film with rare insight.'' 
 In one characteristically barbed review, the critic called 2004 ''a year marked by the cynicism and ineptitude of the entertainment conglomerates, which seem increasingly devoted to dulling the sensibilities of the mainstream audience.''
 FINALISTS -- Frank Rich of The New York Times, for exploring the influence of popular culture on American politics and society; Carlin Romano of The Chronicle of Higher Education, for bringing vitality to the classic essay.
 COMMENTARY
 CONNIE SCHULTZ

 The Pulitzer judges praised Mr. Philp, 43, for his ''deeply researched'' editorials defending the restoration of the Hetch Hetchy Valley, which has been underwater since 1923, when a dam was built to secure electricity for the San Francisco Bay area. The system now supplies about 85 percent of that city's water and most of its electricity.
 A serious political discussion about the dam was ignited by the editorials, like one last September that lamented the valley's dearth of tourists.
 FINALISTS -- Sebastian Mallaby of The Washington Post, for editorials on the disaster in the Darfur region of Sudan; David Yarnold and Daniel Vasquez of The San Jose Mercury News, for an editorial campaign against unethical behavior in City Hall.

HEADLINE: Baseball Is Booming Despite Talk Of Steroids

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Despite the steroids scandal that has rocked Major League Baseball over the past year, its business is robust and largely unaffected by developments that have implicated stars like Barry Bonds and forced the sport's top executives to testify at a recent Congressional hearing.
 As the season approached, advance ticket sales, as of March 31, were up 6.5 percent over last year, to 49 million. In addition, seven new corporate sponsors have signed on in the past year, including Bank of America, General Mills, General Motors, DHL and The Home Depot. 
 The sport's Web site, MLB.com, has sold 10 million tickets to this season's games, nearly as many as it sold all last year, and total revenue is projected to rise 40 percent to $190 million. And a deal with XM Satellite Radio, which began with the Boston Red Sox-Yankees season opener Sunday night, will provide baseball with $650 million over the next 11 years. 
 Steve Greenberg, a former deputy commissioner of baseball who is now an investment banker at Allen & Co., said, ''If you're a fan, you're a fan, and you're willing to overlook and forgive all the other nonsense.'' He said the blossoming of business amid the talk of steroids was not an illogical confluence of events.
 ''The steroid scandal is the kind of thing that comes along in all sports from time to time,'' said Greenberg, who recently brokered the $223 million sale of the Milwaukee Brewers to Mark Attanasio, a Los Angeles financier. ''But I don't think it undermines the fundamental premise on which baseball is built and its popularity.''
 It is possible that new steroid disclosures could emerge and implicate any number of players and undermine the sport's credibility to the point where its economics would be harmed.
 An Associated Press-AOL poll released yesterday listed the high salaries of players, rather than steroid use, as baseball's biggest problem, with 33 percent of respondents citing salaries compared with the 27 percent who cited steroids. But 55 percent of those surveyed also said they cared about the steroid issue.
 For now, baseball can point to numerous positives, which, while not diminishing the import of the steroids scandal, can help explain the healthy interest of fans and marketers.
 Those positives include last year's World Series victory by the Boston Red Sox, the team's first in 86 years; the ever-percolating Red Sox-Yankees rivalry (which has swelled TV ratings and produced a post-2004 publishing boomlet); and the shift of the moribund Expos from Montreal to Washington, where they were renamed the Nationals and have sold an estimated 1.6 million tickets. That more than doubles the Expos' paid attendance last season.
 The success of a small-market team like the Minnesota Twins and the continuing allure of the Chicago Cubs, who no longer have to share favored-underdog status with the Red Sox, are also factors in baseball's resilience.
 ''In the past two years, we've had 20 teams in the hunt for the playoffs as late as Labor Day,'' said Bob DuPuy, the president of Major League Baseball. ''And there is no doubt that some exciting, unique things will happen this year that no one can predict.''
 That optimism -- and the desire to believe baseball executives that the worst of the steroid scandal is over now that testing has been made tougher -- led G.M. and DHL to stage news conferences in the two weeks after the Congressional hearing on March 17.
 G.M. rolled two new Chevy models into a Manhattan hotel ballroom to herald its return to baseball as a national sponsor after a nine-year hiatus. Executives of baseball and the automaker posed inside the new SSR roadster, all tossing baseballs aloft. Last week, DHL, the delivery service, parked eight of its yellow-and-red trucks outside baseball's Park Avenue headquarters and revealed the slogan, ''Delivering America's Pastime On Time,'' for its role as baseball's official shipper.
 ''It's important to find the right partnership,'' said Karen Jones, a DHL vice president. ''And Major League Baseball was high on the top of our list.''
 Together, G.M. and DHL will pay $83 million through 2007 for sponsorship rights and advertising time on baseball broadcasts.
 Executives from each company said they were taking appropriate marketing steps in aligning themselves with baseball's demographics and not unnecessary risks at a time of some uncertainty.
 John Pearson, a DHL executive vice president, said he did not shrink from the steroids issue as talks progressed. ''The discussions gave us a huge degree of comfort that the issue will get better and go away,'' he said.
 Steve Tihanyi, the general director of marketing alliances for General Motors, said he was satisfied with the toughened steroids policy recently adopted. ''We're interested in the present and the future,'' he said. ''I feel very confident it's been addressed.''
 On Sunday, Major League Baseball announced that Tampa Bay's Alex Sanchez had violated the sport's updated steroid policy and had been suspended for 10 games, becoming the first player to be penalized and publicly named under the new policy. Yesterday, baseball released the names of 38 minor leaguers who tested positive in spring training under a testing program that Major League Baseball unilaterally instituted several years ago.
 Baseball executives acknowledged that the sport was being heavily scrutinized because of the steroid issue and that this might not be the perfect time in which to transact business. But in keeping their sponsors regularly informed about the steroids policy, they said they had persuaded those sponsors that they were dealing with the issue.
 ''Is this the ideal climate? No, because people want to know,'' said Tim Brosnan, the executive vice president of business for Major League Baseball. ''We spend a lot of time answering questions.'' No sponsors have left because of the steroids issue, baseball officials said. For existing and new sponsors, concern about steroids has not apparently chased fans from the sport.
 Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor who studies baseball's business, said that the sport had stayed below the ''threshold for scandal that if you go beyond you're in trouble.''
 ''Insofar as individual players transgressed, I think they'll suffer,'' he said. ''But it'll be on a personal level, not people turning off their fandom.'' 
 Peter Sealey, an adjunct professor of marketing at the University of California at Berkeley, said a disconnect between the on-field product and the steroids scandal was firmly in place.
 ''There's the scandal; Congress is talking about it, and baseball increased the penalties,'' he said. ''Yet on the other side, it's the icon. It's baseball. This isn't going to affect it. In my wildest dreams, I don't see a single marketing guy pulling back from dealing with baseball because of steroids.''
 MasterCard, a longtime sponsor, said that its ''Memorable Moments'' campaign in 2002 was not hurt by the labor struggle that nearly led that summer to the second strike in the sport in eight years. But the company did not proceed beyond early discussions with baseball to create a promotion starring Bonds, whose recovery from knee surgery is postponing the possibility that he will pass Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron on the career home run list and take over the No. 1 spot.
 ''The conversations didn't go very far,'' said Bob Cramer, MasterCard's vice president of partner and content integration. In effect, Cramer said, MasterCard drew the line on Bonds, but not on the sport itself. ''We feel good about our partnership and how we can celebrate the game,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Should We All Be Stocking Tamiflu?

BYLINE: By DEBORAH FRANKLIN

 BODY:
As a hedge against a possible worldwide pandemic of bird flu in humans, the governments of at least 17 countries have in recent weeks begun ordering stockpiles of Tamiflu, the potent antiviral drug with a sunny Sandra Dee of a name.
 But should the rest of us do the same? Until there's a vaccine against the virus (and clinical tests of a prototype have only just begun), Tamiflu will probably be our best defense. Why not, just in case, pester our doctors into prescribing a five-day packet of pills?
 ''Resist that urge,'' said Dr. Ben Schwartz, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist with the National Vaccine Program Office in Washington. Although he rates Tamiflu as a powerful tool in the global medical arsenal, Dr. Schwartz says he has not squirreled away an emergency store for himself or his loved ones. 
 Just two years ago, the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant Roche was having trouble getting doctors to prescribe Tamiflu even for patients who were sick. First approved for sale in the United States in 1999, the drug, also known as oseltamivir phosphate, cripples influenza's ability to spread from cell to cell by blocking a crucial enzyme, neuraminidase.
 According to the drug's label, which took only premarket research into account, Tamiflu can hasten recovery from flu by a day or two. To be effective, it must be started within 48 hours of the first symptoms -- abrupt fever, cough, congestion and racking muscle aches in adults, or simply a sudden fever in children.
 ''Most people don't get to the doctor that fast,'' said Dr. Janice Louie, an infectious disease specialist who helps track flu for the California State Department of Health Services. ''Early on, the benefit didn't seem that substantial relative to the cost.'' 
 More recent research has shown that Tamiflu not only shortens a flu bout if taken promptly, but also markedly cuts serious complications including pneumonia and secondary infections that require antibiotics or hospitalization.
 Still, what has prompted the global stockpiling isn't concern about garden variety flu but rather worry about the particularly quick and virulent leap from birds to people that a Type A avian strain known as H5N1 has made in Southeast Asia. Among the 74 people in the last year confirmed to have been infected with H5N1, many were young and previously healthy, and 49 died from their infection.
 Nearly all are thought to have caught the virus through contact with infected poultry, not people. No one can say if or when H5N1 will develop the ability to spread easily and efficiently from person to person -- the last step required to start a pandemic -- or whether the virus will retain its lethal virulence if that happens.
 Still, the signs from Asia are ominous enough that nations are scrambling to come up with a vaccine and are placing huge orders for what's widely expected to be the best of imperfect treatments -- Tamiflu -- with Roche, the world's sole supplier. Another drug from the same chemical family, Relenza (or zanamivir) from GlaxoSmithKline, is not being stockpiled to the same degree because its use is more limited, excluding children under 7 and people with asthma or other chronic lung disease.
 So far, the United States has just 2.3 million treatment courses of Tamiflu on hand; discussions are under way about how much more might be needed and who would get them first. According to a Roche spokesman, Terence Hurley, among the other countries that have placed firm orders, Britain will buy 14.6 million courses of the drug; France wants 13 million; and Canada, 5.4 million. The orders are to be filled over the next several years.
 Roche, too, has scrambled to increase production to meet the increased demand, doubling its production capacity for Tamiflu from 2003 to 2004, with another doubling expected by the end of 2005. The plan, Mr. Hurley said, is to bring additional manufacturing to the United States in the fall, with the first pills from those plants reaching the market 10 or 12 months later.
 Of course, a pandemic could strike sooner. Though Mr. Hurley insisted that Roche had ''more than enough'' Tamiflu to meet demand, Dr. Dominick Iacuzio, Roche's medical director, said that panic buying would deplete inventories.
 ''If everyone went out to buy a personal stockpile right now, there wouldn't be enough,'' Dr. Iacuzio said.
 Still, just reading the words ''pandemic'' and ''stockpile'' in the same sentence can be enough to kindle acquisitive angst, said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan. ''Historically, whenever there's a crisis you'll find stockpiling, hoarding, black marketeering and generally bad behavior,'' he said. ''It's been going on since Hippocrates.''
 Dr. Schwartz said he thought a hefty national stockpile made sense in ways that a personal stockpile didn't. For starters, drugs in a national cache are stored under ideal conditions and regularly checked to make sure pills close to their expiration date are still potent, he said. The same drug in the medicine cabinet of a humid bathroom could quickly lose its effectiveness. 
 Plus, governments typically get a price break, he said. Don't expect such a discount at your local pharmacy, where a five-day prescription for Tamiflu can run $65 to $100 or more.
 If economics and altruism aren't strong enough to stop you from trying to secure a personal stash, consider the problem of drug resistance, which is exacerbated by improper use. The older and cheaper generic flu drugs, amantadine and rimantadine, no longer work against H5N1, probably because of the past widespread use of the antivirals in some parts of the Asian poultry industry.
 Having a packet of pills on hand ''just in case,'' increases the temptation to take them for a bad cold instead of the flu, Dr. Markel said, or to stop taking the drug once you start feeling better -- just the sort of pill-popping that breeds resistance.
 ''Everybody -- doctors, journalists and hamburger flippers -- takes drugs inappropriately at one time or another,'' he said. ''Self-prescription is not good for anyone.''
 There's already a little evidence that H5N1 is evolving to get around Tamiflu, too, though the resistant versions of the worrisome strain that have popped up seem weaker than those susceptible to the antiviral. So far.
 ''It would behoove us to be as careful with these drugs as we are with antibiotics,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''The basic point is we don't have a lot of arrows in our quiver.''

HEADLINE: Some Asian Bankers Worry About the Economic Toll From Bird Flu

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 4 

 BODY:
Investment banks are starting to issue warnings on the risks that avian influenza poses to the economies and financial markets of East Asia, even as health experts struggle to assess whether the disease has the potential to cause a pandemic at all.
 With Asia, and particularly China, now the main area of global economic growth along with the United States, economists across the region are considering any factors that could derail the region's expansion. Many such risks are familiar ones -- an earthquake in Japan, a banking crisis, civil unrest in China or a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
 What is striking in the last two months, though, is the prominence with which avian flu, often called bird flu, is being mentioned as a risk as well. Discussion of the disease has increased in tandem with public anxiety, as seen by controversy here in the last few days over whether the municipal stadium might be used to treat overflow patients from hospitals in the event the disease spread. The stadium's neighbors were predictably unenthusiastic. 
 CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, the Asian investment banking arm of Credit Agricole of France, estimated in a report on Monday that the disease had already cost Asian nations $8 billion to $12 billion, mostly from the deaths or destruction of 140 million chickens and other poultry. But the cost would be greater if the disease gained the ability to spread easily from person to person, a possibility that is not factored into current stock and other asset prices, said Christopher Wood, CLSA's chief equity strategist. 
 ''It would be a regional panic and potentially a global panic,'' he said, adding, ''There's no way markets can discount this.''
 CLSA hired an American company, Bio Economic Research Associates, to produce much of its report, part of a growing reliance in East Asia on medical assessments of market risks after outbreaks in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. That disease nearly paralyzed air travel in the region and dealt severe, if short-lived, blows to stock and real estate markets.
 Tim Condon, chief Asian economist at the ING Group, said that while avian flu was a big risk for Asia, it was extremely difficult to estimate the prospects of its becoming significantly more damaging.
 Generally, a pandemic involves the spread of a disease over a wide region. While the World Health Organization has confirmed 79 human cases, including a family of 5 in Vietnam on Monday, it has said that the minimum for a pandemic is two million to seven million dead. 
 Among corporate pessimists, Citigroup has issued increasingly dire warnings, saying that bird flu could become much worse than SARS. Unlike SARS, influenza probably could not be stopped through quarantines or fever-recognition scanners at airports, because influenza victims become infectious up to a full day before they start exhibiting symptoms.
 Don Hanna, Citigroup's chief Asian economist and one of the gloomiest voices in Asia about bird flu, said that while SARS caused a brief dip in demand as people stopped going to restaurants and shops, a widespread influenza outbreak among humans could hurt the supply and demand for goods during the course of the disease and for years afterward.
 Other banks are considerably less worried, and they cite the swift rebound of economies and financial markets from SARS. ''People are going to be a little bit less alarmist about health concerns,'' said Adrian Mowat, Asian equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. ''We all survived SARS.''
 Influenza experts from around the world will be meeting with American officials in Washington this week to review what is known about the disease and what steps can be taken to prevent a pandemic.
 Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan epidemiologist who is in Washington for the meeting, said that with fewer than 100 confirmed human cases of avian influenza in a year and a half despite its widespread incidence in Southeast Asian poultry, it was possible that the disease would not evolve the capability to infect people easily.
 But Mr. Monto said that grimmer possibilities remained. ''We have to prepare for the worst,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Illegal Immigrants Are Bolstering Social Security With Billions

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: STOCKTON, Calif. 

 BODY:
Since illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States six years ago, Angel Martinez has done backbreaking work, harvesting asparagus, pruning grapevines and picking the ripe fruit. More recently, he has also washed trucks, often working as much as 70 hours a week, earning $8.50 to $12.75 an hour. 
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Martinez, 28, has not given much thought to Social Security's long-term financial problems. But Mr. Martinez -- who comes from the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico and hiked for two days through the desert to enter the United States near Tecate, some 20 miles east of Tijuana -- contributes more than most Americans to the solvency of the nation's public retirement system. 
 Last year, Mr. Martinez paid about $2,000 toward Social Security and $450 for Medicare through payroll taxes withheld from his wages. Yet unlike most Americans, who will receive some form of a public pension in retirement and will be eligible for Medicare as soon as they turn 65, Mr. Martinez is not entitled to benefits. 
 He belongs to a big club. As the debate over Social Security heats up, the estimated seven million or so illegal immigrant workers in the United States are now providing the system with a subsidy of as much as $7 billion a year. 
 While it has been evident for years that illegal immigrants pay a variety of taxes, the extent of their contributions to Social Security is striking: the money added up to about 10 percent of last year's surplus -- the difference between what the system currently receives in payroll taxes and what it doles out in pension benefits. Moreover, the money paid by illegal workers and their employers is factored into all the Social Security Administration's projections.
 Illegal immigration, Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, co-director of immigration studies at New York University, noted sardonically, could provide ''the fastest way to shore up the long-term finances of Social Security.''
 It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrant workers pay taxes. But according to specialists, most of them do. Since 1986, when the Immigration Reform and Control Act set penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants, most such workers have been forced to buy fake ID's to get a job. 
 Currently available for about $150 on street corners in just about any immigrant neighborhood in California, a typical fake ID package includes a green card and a Social Security card. It provides cover for employers, who, if asked, can plausibly assert that they believe all their workers are legal. It also means that workers must be paid by the book -- with payroll tax deductions.
 IRCA, as the immigration act is known, did little to deter employers from hiring illegal immigrants or to discourage them from working. But for Social Security's finances, it was a great piece of legislation. 
 Starting in the late 1980's, the Social Security Administration received a flood of W-2 earnings reports with incorrect -- sometimes simply fictitious -- Social Security numbers. It stashed them in what it calls the ''earnings suspense file'' in the hope that someday it would figure out whom they belonged to.
 The file has been mushrooming ever since: $189 billion worth of wages ended up recorded in the suspense file over the 1990's, two and a half times the amount of the 1980's. 
 In the current decade, the file is growing, on average, by more than $50 billion a year, generating $6 billion to $7 billion in Social Security tax revenue and about $1.5 billion in Medicare taxes. 
 In 2002 alone, the last year with figures released by the Social Security Administration, nine million W-2's with incorrect Social Security numbers landed in the suspense file, accounting for $56 billion in earnings, or about 1.5 percent of total reported wages.
 Social Security officials do not know what fraction of the suspense file corresponds to the earnings of illegal immigrants. But they suspect that the portion is significant. 
 ''Our assumption is that about three-quarters of other-than-legal immigrants pay payroll taxes,'' said Stephen C. Goss, Social Security's chief actuary, using the agency's term for illegal immigration. 
 Other researchers say illegal immigrants are the main contributors to the suspense file. ''Illegal immigrants account for the vast majority of the suspense file,'' said Nick Theodore, the director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''Especially its growth over the 1990's, as more and more undocumented immigrants entered the work force.''
 Using data from the Census Bureau's current population survey, Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group in Washington that favors more limits on immigration, estimated that 3.8 million households headed by illegal immigrants generated $6.4 billion in Social Security taxes in 2002.
 A comparative handful of former illegal immigrant workers who have obtained legal residence have been able to accredit their previous earnings to their new legal Social Security numbers. Mr. Camarota is among those opposed to granting a broad amnesty to illegal immigrants, arguing that, among other things, they might claim Social Security benefits and put further financial stress on the system. 
 The mismatched W-2's fit like a glove on illegal immigrants' known geographic distribution and the patchwork of jobs they typically hold. An audit found that more than half of the 100 employers filing the most earnings reports with false Social Security numbers from 1997 through 2001 came from just three states: California, Texas and Illinois. According to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office, about 17 percent of the businesses with inaccurate W-2's were restaurants, 10 percent were construction companies and 7 percent were farm operations. 
 Most immigration helps Social Security's finances, because new immigrants tend to be of working age and contribute more than they take from the system. A simulation by Social Security's actuaries found that if net immigration ran at 1.3 million a year instead of the 900,000 in their central assumption, the system's 75-year funding gap would narrow to 1.67 percent of total payroll, from 1.92 percent -- savings that come out to half a trillion dollars, valued in today's money.
 Illegal immigrants help even more because they will never collect benefits. According to Mr. Goss, without the flow of payroll taxes from wages in the suspense file, the system's long-term funding hole over 75 years would be 10 percent deeper.
 Yet to immigrants, the lack of retirement benefits is just part of the package of hardship they took on when they decided to make the trek north. Tying vines in a vineyard some 30 miles north of Stockton, Florencio Tapia, 20, from Guerrero, along Mexico's Pacific coast, has no idea what the money being withheld from his paycheck is for. ''I haven't asked,'' Mr. Tapia said.
 For illegal immigrants, Social Security numbers are simply a tool needed to work on this side of the border. Retirement does not enter the picture.
 ''There will be a moment when I won't be able to continue working,'' Mr. Martinez acknowledges. ''But that's many years off.''
 Mario Avalos, a naturalized Nicaraguan immigrant who prepares income tax returns for many workers in the area, including immigrants without legal papers, observes that many older workers return home to Mexico. ''Among my clients,'' he said, ''I can't recall anybody over 60 without papers.''
 No doubt most illegal immigrants would prefer to avoid Social Security altogether. As part of its efforts to properly assign the growing pile of unassigned wages, Social Security sends about 130,000 letters a year to employers with large numbers of mismatched pay statements.
 Though not an intended consequence of these so-called no-match letters, in many cases employers who get them dismiss the workers affected. Or the workers -- fearing that immigration authorities might be on their trail -- just leave. 
 Last February, for instance, discrepancies in Social Security numbers put an end to the job of Minerva Ortega, 25, from Zacatecas, in northern Mexico, who worked in the cheese department at a warehouse for Mike Campbell & Associates, a distributor for Trader Joe's, a popular discount food retailer with a large operation in California. 
 The company asked dozens of workers to prove that they had cleared up or were in the process of clearing up the ''discrepancy between the information on our payroll related to your employment and the S.S.A.'s records.'' Most could not.
 Ms. Ortega said about 150 workers lost their jobs. In a statement, Mike Campbell said that it did not fire any of the workers, but Robert Camarena, a company official, acknowledged that many left.
 Ms. Ortega is now looking for work again. She does not want to go back to the fields, so she is holding out for a better-paid factory job. Whatever work she finds, though, she intends to go on the payroll with the same Social Security number she has now, a number that will not jibe with federal records. 
 With this number, she will continue paying taxes. Last year she paid about $1,200 in Social Security taxes, matched by her employer, on an income of $19,000.
 She will never see the money again, she realizes, but at least she will have a job in the United States.
 ''I don't pay much attention,'' Ms. Ortega said. ''I know I don't get any benefit.''

HEADLINE: An Academic Question

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It's a fact, documented by two recent studies, that registered Republicans and self-proclaimed conservatives make up only a small minority of professors at elite universities. But what should we conclude from that?
 Conservatives see it as compelling evidence of liberal bias in university hiring and promotion. And they say that new ''academic freedom'' laws will simply mitigate the effects of that bias, promoting a diversity of views. But a closer look both at the universities and at the motives of those who would police them suggests a quite different story. 
 Claims that liberal bias keeps conservatives off college faculties almost always focus on the humanities and social sciences, where judgments about what constitutes good scholarship can seem subjective to an outsider. But studies that find registered Republicans in the minority at elite universities show that Republicans are almost as rare in hard sciences like physics and in engineering departments as in softer fields. Why?
 One answer is self-selection -- the same sort of self-selection that leads Republicans to outnumber Democrats four to one in the military. The sort of person who prefers an academic career to the private sector is likely to be somewhat more liberal than average, even in engineering.
 But there's also, crucially, a values issue. In the 1970's, even Democrats like Daniel Patrick Moynihan conceded that the Republican Party was the ''party of ideas.'' Today, even Republicans like Representative Chris Shays concede that it has become the ''party of theocracy.''
 Consider the statements of Dennis Baxley, a Florida legislator who has sponsored a bill that -- like similar bills introduced in almost a dozen states -- would give students who think that their conservative views aren't respected the right to sue their professors. Mr. Baxley says that he is taking on ''leftists'' struggling against ''mainstream society,'' professors who act as ''dictators'' and turn the classroom into a ''totalitarian niche.'' His prime example of academic totalitarianism? When professors say that evolution is a fact.
 In its April Fools' Day issue, Scientific American published a spoof editorial in which it apologized for endorsing the theory of evolution just because it's ''the unifying concept for all of biology and one of the greatest scientific ideas of all time,'' saying that ''as editors, we had no business being persuaded by mountains of evidence.'' And it conceded that it had succumbed ''to the easy mistake of thinking that scientists understand their fields better than, say, U.S. senators or best-selling novelists do.'' 
 The editorial was titled ''O.K., We Give Up.'' But it could just as well have been called ''Why So Few Scientists Are Republicans These Days.'' Thirty years ago, attacks on science came mostly from the left; these days, they come overwhelmingly from the right, and have the backing of leading Republicans.
 Scientific American may think that evolution is supported by mountains of evidence, but President Bush declares that ''the jury is still out.'' Senator James Inhofe dismisses the vast body of research supporting the scientific consensus on climate change as a ''gigantic hoax.'' And conservative pundits like George Will write approvingly about Michael Crichton's anti-environmentalist fantasies. 
 Think of the message this sends: today's Republican Party -- increasingly dominated by people who believe truth should be determined by revelation, not research -- doesn't respect science, or scholarship in general. It shouldn't be surprising that scholars have returned the favor by losing respect for the Republican Party.
 Conservatives should be worried by the alienation of the universities; they should at least wonder if some of the fault lies not in the professors, but in themselves. Instead, they're seeking a Lysenkoist solution that would have politics determine courses' content. 
 And it wouldn't just be a matter of demanding that historians play down the role of slavery in early America, or that economists give the macroeconomic theories of Friedrich Hayek as much respect as those of John Maynard Keynes. Soon, biology professors who don't give creationism equal time with evolution and geology professors who dismiss the view that the Earth is only 6,000 years old might face lawsuits.
 If it got that far, universities would probably find ways to cope -- by, say, requiring that all entering students sign waivers. But political pressure will nonetheless have a chilling effect on scholarship. And that, of course, is its purpose.

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW; Eli Sanders contributed reporting from Seattle for this article.

DATELINE: LUMMI INDIAN RESERVATION, Wash., March 29 

 BODY:
The very full house on Gumel Place was steeped in the usual loud weekend chaos when 14-year-old Cecilia Morris burst through the door.
 ''Hey,'' she said. ''Is Mom in jail?''
 No, said her uncle, Jasper Cladoosby, but her mother had gone back into drug treatment. Her father is the one in prison. 
 Mr. Cladoosby, 27, who is raising four of his own children along with Cecilia and two of her sisters, is one of possibly hundreds of uncles, aunts, grandparents and others caring for children whose parents are unable to raise them because of dire poverty, alcoholism and epidemic drug abuse on this reservation on Bellingham Bay in Northwest Washington. Cecilia's four remaining siblings are being cared for by other relatives.
 ''Their parents basically left them last summer,'' said Mr. Cladoosby, who works as a part-time crabber and mechanic but relies mostly on food stamps and his wife's salary and tips as a dealer at the new Lummi casino to care for his children and nieces. ''It's pretty much overwhelming.''
 Tribal officials here estimate that fewer than half of the 1,500 children on the reservation are living with a parent full time. A breakdown of the American Indian family, mirrored throughout reservations across the country, has been building for generations but is now growing worse, tribal and outside experts say.
 The crisis gained new attention this month after a troubled youth went on a shooting rampage on the Red Lake reservation in northern Minnesota. The broken family of the teenager, Jeff Weise, 16, who the police say killed nine people and then himself, is typical among Indians. With his father dead and his mother disabled by a drunken-driving accident, he was staying with his grandmother on the reservation, after living with his mother, before her accident, in Minneapolis. 
 ''The breakdown is huge,'' said Danita Washington, coordinator of Lummi's drug abuse prevention program, who is caring for three nieces and a nephew because her sister is addicted to heroin. ''We're trying to find a solution.''
 Lummi tribal officials say their roster shows that 11 percent of the children on the reservation have been placed in foster care or with relatives receiving foster care payments. Statewide, about 8 percent of Indian children are in foster care, Washington officials say. But like national statistics, those numbers tell only a sliver of the story. 
 Even though tribes have made great strides over the last two decades in keeping children from troubled homes, a cascade of statistics paints a bleak picture of the roughly 850,000 Indian and Alaska Native youths, about half of them living on Indian reservations, according to the Census Bureau. Compared with whites and with other minorities, Indians have extremely high teenage suicide rates, are more likely to get into fights at school and carry weapons to school, and have high rates of substance abuse, several recent reports show.
 ''It's not so much the idea of a traditional mother and father, but the concept of family, and the idea of supportive, safe and nurturing family is very important,'' said Dr. Jon T. Perez, director of the division of behavioral health for the Indian Health Service, the primary government agency responsible for providing health care to more than 560 federally recognized tribes. ''And when you have generations of people for whom that has not been the case, it can be problematic.''
 According to the latest federal statistics, nearly 10,000 Indian and Alaska Native children, or about 1.2 percent, are in foster care, living with relatives or others. (Indians and Alaska Natives make up 1.5 percent of the nation's population. ) The federal data, from the Department of Health and Human Services, show that about 1.8 percent of black children and about 0.5 percent of white children are in foster care.
 Terry L. Cross, executive director of the National Indian Child Welfare Association, based in Portland, Ore., said that at least 25,000 Indians under the age of 18, or 3 percent, were living in foster care or with relatives, although he acknowledged that his surveys, which do not include Alaska Native children, probably failed to take into account many more informal living arrangements.
 ''I think Native Americans aren't really on anybody's radar,'' said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, based in Alexandria, Va. ''When people write federal legislation, they keep leaving the tribes out.''
 While the shuttling of children between relatives is typical in inner cities and poor rural areas -- and much public attention has been paid to the large numbers of black and other minority children in foster care -- the crisis is growing more acute on the many isolated Indian reservations, several experts said. 
 ''Basic human needs are in very short supply,'' said Esther Wattenberg, professor of social work and an associate at the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs at the University of Minnesota. ''That is, food, shelter, income and a sense of having access and availability to services.''
 As public assistance benefits have dried up under time limits for federal welfare payments, Professor Wattenberg said, Indians and their children who were living in cities have begun to return in significant numbers to their reservations. There, they may find space on a relative's couch and add more families to the roster of the desperately poor.
 Many experts say the crisis for Indian children stems not so much from living without their parents -- the role of the extended family in child rearing is crucial in Indian culture -- but from a lack of mental health services and recreation on reservations, some so destitute that there is no swimming pool or basketball court, let alone a counselor. 
 Money for health and mental health care on reservations, which comes mostly from the federal government but is increasingly supplemented by gambling revenues, falls far short of the demand, many experts say.
 Here at Lummi Nation, the Silver Reef Casino opened in 2002 but has only recently begun to yield steady profits. The tribe has invested $2 million in a new home, scheduled to open April 13, that can hold 28 troubled children; a ''safe home'' for youths; and more counselors. Now, there are seven counselors available for the 1,500 children, well above the national average for Indians. 
 But tribal officials acknowledge that Lummi families still bear the brunt of caring for neglected children and emotionally supporting them.
 Ms. Washington, the Lummi drug prevention program coordinator who is caring for her sister Geraldine's four children, runs a tight ship. The children, ages 9 to 16, sleep in the front room of Ms. Washington's three-bedroom home, along with another sister of Ms. Washington and the sister's teenage son. Their clothes are kept in makeshift dressers in the garage.
 Ms. Washington, 49, who is divorced but still lives with her ex-husband, has two children of her own, a son, 20, and a daughter, 24, who live with her. Her daughter is helping raise her boyfriend's 2-year-old daughter, who stays at the house every other weekend. 
 Geraldine Washington's children were placed with her sister by the Lummi Tribal Court, which works with the state to arrange foster care; the state pays Danita Washington $647 monthly for their care.
 On a recent Sunday, Geraldine, 40, who is living with a relative, came to visit. Her children had not seen her in two weeks. 
 Sitting on her sister's couch, she said she quit using heroin on Oct. 14, her daughter Hannah's 11th birthday. But Danita said she doubted that Geraldine was clean.
 ''Nobody can really get you cleaned up,'' Geraldine said, as Hannah fiddled with her mother's rings and watch and grasped her hand tightly. ''I was tired of going to jail. This round is really different. I have had enough.''
 Danita Washington said she worried most about her nephew, Justin Zollner, who was to turn 16 on Wednesday, and who, she said, has an anger problem. The children's father, she said, has ''been out of the picture'' for a long time and has not come to see them in many years. 
 Justin has uncles who live nearby, and they attend his football games and take him canoe racing, a passionate pursuit for the tribe. 
 ''My brothers and I talk a lot about this,'' Danita Washington said. ''We made conscious choices. We can't change our sisters, but we can influence their children.''
 Still, it is painful when Justin talks, fairly often, about missing his father, she said. 
 ''Mostly, every kid wants their parents,'' said Justin, who has the biggest mattress in his aunt's front room and plays football for the Golden Eagles at Ferndale High School near here. ''Right now, I kind of wish my dad was still here because I've played football for like seven years now, and he never got to watch me.'' 
 He was happy to see his mother, though he was not sure when he would see her again.
 ''I think she's doing good now,'' he said. '' She's trying. I can see it.''
 And on this day, for his birthday, she was going with him, his aunt and his sisters to ride indoor go-carts.

Remote-Control Aircraft Crowd Skies Over Iraq
Remotely piloted aircraft like the Predator are in such demand for counterinsurgency and antiterrorism missions that the Pentagon is poised to spend $13 billion on them through the decade's end. The military has struggled to find enough pilots. And with hundreds of the aircraft buzzing around, they have created safety concerns for traditional crewed aircraft as well. PAGE A9

HEADLINE: Standout At Baylor Has Come Long Way

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, April 4 

 BODY:
The voice on the other end of the phone in Shreveport, La., was soft and polite and lilting, lacking just enough insistence to be ignored.
 The caller, Sophia Young, had transferred to Evangel Christian Academy as a foreign-exchange student from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent because she wanted to find someone to help polish her jagged basketball skills. 
 The recipient of Young's call was Bo Roberts, once a prominent Amateur Athletic Union coach in Shreveport. Roberts had declined her request four years ago. He was the fire chief and did not have time for basketball, certainly not enough to tutor a high school senior who had played the game only one year and knew little of the rules. 
 But Young persisted, calling a second and third time. Once she got Ellen Roberts, Bo's wife, on the phone.
 ''Bo, you need to help that little girl,'' Ellen Roberts told her husband.
 Reluctantly, he agreed to watch her play.
 ''He didn't really intend on seeing something good,'' Young said.
 Thus began perhaps the most unlikely story in a weekend of improbability at the women's Final Four. In this season of upstarts, Baylor (32-3) will face Michigan State (33-3) in the national championship on Tuesday night as each university seeks its first N.C.A.A. women's title.
 ''It just gives kids an opportunity to see they don't have to go to UConn or Tennessee to be good or to end up in the Final Four,'' said Young, a 6-foot-1 Baylor forward.
 Her team's ascent is no more improbable than her own. Young, a junior, has played organized basketball for only six years, yet she is a Kodak All-American, having led Baylor in scoring (18.1 points a game) rebounding (9.3 a game) and steals (70) and ranking second among the Lady Bears with 99 assists.
 Young played as a sophomore in high school in 1999-2000, but Louisiana rules that govern foreign-exchange students forced her to sit out as a junior. 
 With little enthusiasm, Bo Roberts went to see her play the summer before her senior season. What he saw amazed him: the lateral quickness, the speed, the jumping ability. And there was something even more engaging -- the uncommon wisdom, maturity and resolve of a young woman who essentially had been on her own since the age of 15.
 Roberts made a call to Jennifer Roberts, his daughter, an assistant basketball coach at Baylor. His message was short and direct: Get to Shreveport as quickly as your car and N.C.A.A. rules will allow.
 In the fall of 2001, Jennifer Roberts accompanied head coach Kim Mulkey-Robertson on the three-and-a-half-hour drive from the Baylor campus in Waco, Tex.
 Within five minutes of watching Young in preseason drills at Evangel Christian, Jennifer Roberts said, Mulkey-Robertson nudged her in delighted conspiracy.
 ''Let's don't say one word to anybody,'' Mulkey-Robertson said. Young did not know a single post move and she was as raw as an oyster, but her intelligence and desire and athletic ability were evident. The basketball skills could be taught, Mulkey-Robertson figured. Young had been a sprinter in St. Vincent and had dexterous footwork gained from playing net ball, a seven-on-seven relative of basketball that relies on passing, prohibits dribbling and requires precise shooting into a basket that is attached to a pole without a backboard.
 Young cannot say exactly what drew her to basketball, except that she tried it and liked it. Coming to the United States opened a door to a better life that might have remained closed on St. Vincent, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
 Still, there were adjustments, to the colder weather, to a different culture, to the absence of her mother. 
 Young even changed the way she spoke, so that others could better understand her English. 
 As the N.C.A.A. tournament approached, Mulkey-Robertson and Baylor's athletic director requested a visa for Christopher, who had seen her daughter only once since she left home six years earlier and had never watched her play in person.
 The visa was granted, and Christopher has been present as Baylor has made its glorious tournament run.
 Young's father, Denniston Young, and her brother, Kemmy Christopher, have also traveled here from their home in Brooklyn.

Justices Rule Creditors Cannot Go After I.R.A.'s
A unanimous Supreme Court interpreted federal bankruptcy law to shield individual retirement accounts from creditors. The decision had the effect of giving middle-income consumers the same protection in bankruptcy that higher-earning workers receive for their 401(k) plans and company pensions.
 The company plans, as well as Social Security payments, were already exempt from creditors. But the bankruptcy code's treatment of I.R.A.'s was sufficiently ambiguous to have resulted in much uncertainty and conflicting lower-court decisions. [Page C2.]

Cost-Cutting Expected at Pfizer
Pfizer is expected to announce annual spending cuts of $2 billion to $4 billion to help stabilize earnings at a meeting with investors. Shares of Pfizer are near a five-year low, sales are flat and profits are under pressure. Moreover, the company has few new drugs to make up for the $14 billion in sales it will lose over the next three years as some of its biggest-selling medicines lose patent protection. [C20.]

MAJOR CARRIERS GAIN -- Network carriers are reclaiming a bigger share of business travelers from low-cost carriers, according to a survey by Accenture, the consulting company. Last month, 82 percent of business travelers said they were now ''primarily'' using major airlines, up from 72 percent a year ago, according to the survey, which reported a ''significant shift'' back to major network carriers over the past year for both business and personal travel. For business travelers, a shift back to network carriers reflects a loosening of corporate travel policies in an improved economy, Paul Chiu, the head of travel and tourist research for Accenture, said in an interview. Business travelers now have ''more flexibility to pick airlines and flights more conducive to their schedules and destinations, rather than selecting them strictly on price,'' he said. A third of business travelers surveyed said they expected to travel more in the next six months than they did in the comparable period last year, while a little over half said their travel frequency would be about the same.

RADIO-FREE PASSPORTS? -- Corporate travel managers are uneasy about the State Department's plan to introduce passports later this year that will have tiny radio tags for transmitting personal and facial-biometric information, to expedite processing of travelers through border controls and Customs checkpoints. The Association of Corporate Travel Executives has polled its members and found that ''93 percent of them are opposed to this,'' said Jack Riepe, a spokesman for the group. The reason is that radio frequency identification, or RFID, devices -- similar to radio tags used in inventory management of manufactured goods -- can broadcast ''the presence of U.S. citizens in crowds, in hotel lobbies, on trains or even on the street to those in possession of a fairly unsophisticated receiver,'' according to a statement by the group. The main concern is about politically motivated attacks on United States citizens abroad, but the devices ''could also be pinpointing likely targets for pickpockets and thieves,'' said Greeley Koch, the group's president. ''The problem is that anyone can activate these things,'' which can be read from as far as 100 feet away, said Bill Scannell, a consultant on privacy who is organizing opposition to the proposal on a Web site, www.RFIDkills.com.

AUTOMATED CHECK-INS -- Domestic hotels are slowly following the lead of airlines in giving customers options for automated check-ins. Last year, Hilton Hotels tested self-service kiosks at several major hotels, and by year's end had them installed at 44 hotels. Hilton is now installing registration kiosks at all of its 175 Embassy Suites hotels. Others installing or testing kiosks are the Global Hyatt Corporation, which is putting them into 100 Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt hotels this year; Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which is installing kiosks in more than 100 Sheraton hotels; and Holiday Inn, a unit of Lodgian, which is testing a kiosk at its Gwinnett Center property in Georgia that will also allow guests to print out airline boarding passes. ''Initial expectations have been met that this is a viable means for customers to expedite check-ins,'' while still having access to personalized front desk service if desired, Thomas B. Spitler, Hilton's vice president for front office operations, said in an interview. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Shares Rise in Volatile Trading as Oil Briefly Tops $58

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks managed to squeeze out modest gains in a volatile session yesterday as crude oil futures prices briefly topped $58 a barrel. 
 Crude oil for delivery in May climbed to a new intraday high of $58.28 before settling lower, dropping 26 cents to $57.01 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Yet oil remained a source of concern for investors, who fear that crude prices in the high $50 range could eat into consumer spending, prompting either an economic slowdown or rising prices that could trigger inflation. And there was no real sign that oil would decline substantially. 
 ''It's hard to say where that line in the sand is, that level for oil prices where the market will seriously sell off,'' said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''I do think that if you have sustained levels of $60 to $65, then the market will be very hard pressed to make any move to the upside.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.84 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,421.14. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.20 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,176.12. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 6.26 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,991.07.
 A rare piece of good news for embattled American International Group helped blue chips make gains. A.I.G. gained $2.35, to $53.30, after the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said a civil resolution with A.I.G. would be achievable, and that the company was fully cooperating with his investigation of its accounting and business practices.
 The concerns about higher oil prices drew attention away from ChevronTexaco's $16.8 billion acquisition of the oil explorer Unocal, the planned spinoff of Morgan Stanley's Discover Card division and the possibility of a renewed bidding war for MCI.
 ''No matter what else may be going on, when you have oil topping $58 per barrel, the market's main focus is going to be inflation-related,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist and senior vice president at S.W. Bach & Company. ''I don't see this market collapsing, but it's going to be like this for a while until we see oil stabilize and we get clarity on interest rates.''
 Not even ChevronTexaco's move for Unocal, which valued the company at $62 a share, was enough to move the market. Unocal tumbled 7.4 percent, or $4.75, to $59.60, because of the relatively low valuation; ChevronTexaco lost 3.9 percent, or $2.33, to $56.98.
 Morgan Stanley climbed $1.43, to $58.30, after the company's board approved the sale of its Discover Card credit division. The divestiture is expected to net between $8 billion and $9 billion. 
 MCI slumped 21 cents, to $25.08, after it said it would reopen talks with Qwest Communications International, despite having agreed to a $7.6 billion takeover bid by Verizon Communications. Qwest, which sweetened its offer to nearly $9 billion, added 18 cents, to $3.82, while Verizon was up 46 cents at $35.65.
 General Motors lost 33 cents, to $29.05, after the company said Rick Wagoner, the chief executive, would take direct control of its struggling North America division.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to a price of 9612/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.46 percent, from 4.45 percent on Friday. 
 Here are the results of the three- month and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.308	98.465	High Rate	2.735	3.035	Investment Rate	2.792	3.125	Low Rate	2.710	2.940	Median Rate	2.725	3.030	Total applied for	$50,191,842	$41,713,421	Accepted	$24,596,298	$21,837,846	Noncompetitive	$1,856,876	$

HEADLINE: Afghan Officials Urge Donors to Shift Focus

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, April 4 

 BODY:
President Hamid Karzai and his top ministers made an urgent plea to international donors at an annual aid conference in Kabul on Monday to shift their focus to helping the country's struggling private sector and to let the Afghan government take a controlling lead in development planning.
 Mr. Karzai said his government considered building the infrastructure -- including energy, aviation and telecommunications -- to be an urgent priority to provide the foundation for private sector development. Urban development, completely neglected in the past three years, would be a priority too, he said. 
 The conference follows months of debate and recriminations over why the billions of dollars in aid that have poured into Afghanistan since the former Taliban rulers were ousted more than three years ago have accomplished so little.
 The government contends that private aid groups, which control much of the donated money, have squandered it. Many business leaders say corruption and the lack of staff trained in government are largely to blame.
 The government will insist on a national unified budget for 2006, said the finance minister, Anwar ul-Haq Ahady. More than 93 percent of Afghanistan's annual budget comes from international donors, but only a third of this year's $4.7 billion budget will go through government hands, he said. ''Let this government take full responsibility for our country's development,'' he told the donors. 
 Muhammad Iashaq Naderi, the government's chief economic adviser, said at the conference that the government would insist on greater control over foreign assistance flowing into the country and greater coordination with donors and private aid groups. Aid organizations will be monitored for the cost-effectiveness and impact of their programs, he said.
 Mr. Karzai said he had promised the Afghan people that he would raise the annual per capita income to $500 from $200 and reduce poverty during his five-year term. ''We must now work together to overcome chronic poverty, and build Afghanistan into a stable and thriving economy in the region,'' he said. ''We are keenly aware of our people's expectations, and our responsibility towards them.''
 The three-day conference was not aimed at raising more money for Afghanistan, because $8.3 billion of financing was pledged at a donors conference last year to see Afghanistan through 2007. The United States ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, announced though that the United States planned to double its assistance for the current year, to $5 billion, if Congress approves a supplemental spending request, in addition to the $10 billion planned for American military operations in Afghanistan. 
 Mr. Ahady also called for government to take a greater role in providing social services, replacing the international aid groups, which have provided much of the health and rural development services during the past 25 years of conflict.
 Last week, the cabinet approved a law that bars nonprofit aid groups from competing for government contracts. The contracts would be offered instead to private sector groups that would pay taxes back to the government. 
 The law alarmed donors and the aid groups and forced Mr. Karzai to meet with ambassadors the day before the conference. The government appears to have backed down, establishing a commission of ministers to examine the issue further. But Mr. Karzai still issued a harsh rebuke to the aid groups in a statement on the eve of the conference.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Pursue Airbus Action

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 4 

 BODY:
The European Union's governments may not be willing to abandon aid for development of new Airbus models, Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, said Monday, and the United States is prepared to seek litigation to stop it.
 Negotiations over development aid to Airbus and Boeing broke down March 19 and the Bush administration threatened to take the case to arbitration at the World Trade Organization. Both sides pledged in January to suspend any new aid and litigation at the W.T.O. until April 11. 
 ''Now and then we're compelled to bring disputes'' to the W.T.O., Mr. Zoellick told reporters in Brussels Monday. During discussions with the European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, ''we discovered that the E.U.'s constituencies may not be comfortable moving to the elimination of launch aid,'' he said.
 The United States is willing to continue talks and continue with the aid freeze past April 11 ''if the E.U. can follow through on the core principles we agreed on in January,'' Mr. Zoel-lick said. Mr. Mandelson has said the European Union will, as an interim measure, reduce government loans to Airbus provided the United States makes a ''commensurate'' offer to lower its subsidies to Boeing.
 The United States maintains that European governments provide Airbus with low-interest loans that do not have to be repaid unless its aircraft meet commercial success. The United States contends European governments have broken trade rules by giving more than $15 billion in loans since 1967 to Airbus.
 The European Union says those loans pale in comparison to what Boeing receives through military contracts, foreign government support and tax breaks that it contends amount to as much as $23 billion of unfair support since 1992.
 In an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Friday, Mr. Mandelson warned that a dispute with the United States at the W.T.O. could undermine relations and hurt prospects for a global trade deal.
 Mr. Zoellick disagreed. ''This talk that it would interfere with the Doha agenda, it's not talk that I would subscribe to,'' he said, referring to negotiations that began in 2001 in Qatar.
 Mr. Zoellick, who was the United States trade representative, said he cooperated with Mr. Mandelson's predecessor, Pascal Lamy, on the Doha agenda even as the two sides clashed over issues including steel tariffs and United States tax breaks.

HEADLINE: TV's Latest Obsession Seems to Be Television

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
For decades, Hollywood enticed audiences by creating television shows that promised them a clear view into the inner workings of police stations, hospitals and law offices. But after dozens of shows pulled back the curtains on those professions, their mystery and allure began to fade. So, locked in the writing room, sitting through endless pitch meetings, Hollywood found gold, or at least dramatic fodder, in its own bellybutton. 
 Now all kinds of Hollywood procedurals are sprouting on television, offering shows that render the entertainment business in all of its tawdry glory. HBO's ''Entourage'' pivots around an entitled posse trailing in the wake of the industry's next bright young thing. ''Fat Actress,'' which began recently on Showtime, follows the corpulent arc of a barely fictionalized Kirstie Alley as she tries to revive her career. Lisa Kudrow will try a thinner version of the same premise on ''Comeback,'' which will be on HBO this spring. 
 Earlier this season, HBO weighed in with ''Unscripted''; while the dialogue in the series, produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, may have been unscripted, the story lines about young actors trying to claw their way into the business were carefully wrought critiques of some of show business's more mundanely brutal aspects. 
 And the trend is not restricted to cable television. Last month, ABC trotted out ''Jake in Progress,'' a weekly portrait of a press agent who specializes in repairing the train wrecks celebrities often make of their lives.
 These shows-about-shows are distinct from productions that merely perform lurid taxonomy on celebrities. ''The Osbournes'' is a show about a highly dysfunctional family that happens to be led by a onetime rock god now gone to seed, while ''The Simple Life'' is about celebrities-in-training behaving badly. But there is a group of shows that take an anthropological approach, examining celebrities or people playing celebrities in a cultural context that is meant to critique and send up modern show business.
 While ''Fat Actress'' may be nominally about Kirstie Alley, it has the larger ambition of showing how shallow and objectifying television and film executives can be. Though that could hardly rate as an epiphany -- the Beautiful People will always be beautiful -- the show, along with ''Jake in Progress'' and ''Entourage,'' presumes a public interest in the folkways of show business. It is a gamble -- watching a show that happens to be about a comic or a television writer is a fundamentally different experience from spending time staring at the inner workings of a business that makes its living by creating illusion. The realities of any business -- whether rendered as reality, faux-reality or drama -- are not necessarily intrinsically interesting.
 Like most things on television, the shows are hardly without precedent. In the 1990's HBO delivered ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' a dark look at the bright lights of a television talk show, which was a huge industry favorite but met with indifference from audiences. More recently ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' has found a significant cult of viewers for Larry David's daily adventures in modern Los Angeles living. 
 And those who would suggest that shows about show business are one more sign of the bankruptcy of the entertainment industry would do well to recall that ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ''I Love Lucy'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' the holy trinity of the modern sitcom, all had their roots in the media-entertainment complex. And let's not forget that ''Seinfeld,'' which may have been less about the entertainment business than nothing in particular, still used the life of a comic as its chief framing device. But the newer crop of shows are more apt to head right into the entrails of the entertainment business in search of laughs. And part of their appeal is that they go a long way toward life-sizing celebrities and their daily lives.
 ''Larry shows that people actually live in Hollywood, and those people can be just as ordinary in their eccentricities,'' Chris Albrecht, the chairman of HBO, said in a reference to Mr. David's show. After a decade of intense celebrity coverage in magazines like Us Weekly and Entertainment Weekly, and nightly doses of industrial-strength news on ''Access Hollywood'' and ''Entertainment Tonight,'' producers are betting that audiences are in on the joke and ready to laugh about it.
 ''A generation ago, the sum total of what people knew about show business was what they heard discussed on the Johnny Carson show every night,'' said Robert J. Thompson, a professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University. ''Now there are 24-hour television channels dedicated to entertainment news.''
 The ubiquity of the coverage may have those being covered wondering why they should not have a piece of the pie.
 ''Kirstie Alley has already been starring in a show called 'Fat Actress' for the past four years,'' Mr. Thompson said, pointing to the relentless coverage of her ballooning figure and shrinking prospects. ''It is just now she is the one who should be writing the story and getting a piece of the action.''
 But just because increasing numbers of Hollywood writers are adhering to the dictum ''write what you know'' does not mean that people will tune in by the millions. The ratings of ''Fat Actress'' dropped significantly after its first episode, ''Entourage'' is still looking for its own audience on HBO, and ''Jake in Progress'' has not been piling up big numbers either.
 In the first episode of ''Fat Actress,'' Ms. Alley (playing herself) tries to talk John Travolta (playing himself) into making ''Look Whose Talking 4'' before meeting with the NBC executive Jeffrey Zucker (playing himself), who plays a video game under his desk while Ms. Alley prattles on. 
 In ''Jake in Progress,'' two competing press agents taunt each other about who has the better items on Page Six, the celebrity-obsessed gossip column of The New York Post. ''Entourage'' features a heavy-lidded star who is more interested in car shopping with his buddies from back home than reading the scripts that are sent to him. This may convulse industry insiders with laughter, but questions remain about whether viewers are interested in watching the show business sausage get made. 
 Austin Winsberg, an executive producer of ''Jake in Progress,'' said that like many popular shows, ''Jake'' gains contemporary resonance by feeding off current events. '''Law & Order' always takes these ripped-from-the-headlines news stories and uses them for dramatic effect,'' he said. ''I thought it would be interesting to do the same thing for our show as well, but the headlines would be ripped from Entertainment Weekly or Us Weekly.'' 
 In that spirit, this season the show has done or will do a take on ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' the December-May romance between Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher and the teen-queen throwdown between Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan. 
 ''There is a very high interest in the mundane aspects of celebrity life,'' said Bonnie Fuller, editorial director of American Media, which publishes Star magazine. ''Magazines like The Star have created interest not just in the glamorous parts of their life, but every other aspect as well.'' 
 Kurt Andersen, who wrote a very insiderish novel about the entertainment industry called ''Turn of the Century,'' said that what had grown was not so much the public's appetite as the ability to segment and reach niche audiences. ''There is always going to be a million or two million people who are sufficiently versed in the ins and outs of Hollywood, and the economics of cable allows you to reach those people and make a business of it,'' he said.
 Robert Greenblatt, president of entertainment for Showtime Networks, said shows like ''Fat Actress'' needed to walk a fine line. ''There is much more interest in the inner workings of the business, but we try to stay away from too much of that,'' he said. '''Fat Actress' is about a comeback, which is pretty universal. More than that, I think that cable offers a more sophisticated audience that is tuned into this stuff.''
 But it is tough to swim in those waters without leaving the audience feeling it might need a shower afterward.
 ''We are pretty careful of getting too inside,'' said Michael Hirschorn, an executive vice president at VH1, which has found success with ''Celebrity Fit Club,'' ''Celebrity Couples'' and ''The Surreal Life.'' ''Viewers want to see the artist or celebrity go through the annealing, ennobling process of being a pop culture product. They aren't that hip to, or interested in, the business part of that.''
 Tom Hill, creative director of TV Land, a cable channel that features reruns, is not so sure there are many of the uninitiated left.
 ''When I talk to viewers, they know what acquisitions are, they know what a promo schedule is,'' he said. ''We don't get as many innocent questions about why shows go away anymore. They know it's ratings.''
 ''We're all insiders now,'' he said.

PERSON: Robert C. Wood

HEADLINE: Robert Wood, Education Expert, Dies at 81

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Robert C. Wood, an academic, writer and bureaucrat whose acumen in domestic issues like housing and education prompted Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to seek his advice and the University of Massachusetts and the Boston school system to name him as their leader, died on Friday at his home in Boston. He was 81.
 The cause was stomach cancer, his wife, Margaret, said.
 For much of his career, Dr. Wood seemed the epitome of the university intellectual who periodically advises seekers and wielders of governmental power, usually quietly. But he also filled some high-profile positions, most notably as the superintendent of Boston schools, and helped Kennedy devise and carry out his urban and housing policies. 
 Dr. Wood wrote seven books on political science, including ''Suburbia: Its People and their Politics'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1959). Harrison Salisbury wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book ''sketches with searing realism the actuality of the suburb,'' and others later suggested that it had popularized the word ''suburbia.''
 As a senator running for president, Kennedy sought the advice of Dr. Wood, then a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on urban issues. In 1960 Dr. Wood helped write a notable campaign speech for Kennedy that focused on the needs of the American city. 
 In the Johnson administration, Dr. Wood led the task force that recommended the establishment of a cabinet-level department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He then served as the department's first under secretary and, for the last two weeks of Mr. Johnson's presidency, as its secretary.
 Dr. Wood helped create the Model Cities Program, which focused federal revenues on needy neighborhoods. He also played an important part in developing the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited racial discrimination in real estate sales.
 He then succeeded Daniel Patrick Moynihan as director of the Harvard-M.I.T. Joint Center for Urban Studies. From 1970 to 1978, he was president of the University of Massachusetts, where his accomplishments included expanding the university's Boston branch into a full campus and overseeing the completion of the medical school in Worcester.
 Dr. Wood also lured the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum to a site next to the university's Boston campus, a choice that news accounts at the time suggested was a setback for Harvard.
 In the Boston school system, he was the first superintendent in 66 years to be chosen from outside the school system, and he ruffled feathers on issues like staffing and desegregation in his two years in office. When the Boston School Committee fired him in 1980 after two stormy years, John D. O'Bryant, the first black elected to the committee in the 20th century, abstained, saying he did not ''choose to be present at a lynching.''
 Robert Coldwell Wood was born in St. Louis on Sept. 16, 1923. His father was a shoe salesman and his mother a schoolteacher. When he was 2, the family moved to Jacksonville, Fla., where he grew up.
 He won a scholarship from Princeton, where he interrupted his studies to serve in the Army in Europe during World War II, taking part in the Battle of the Bulge. He returned to Princeton and graduated summa cum laude. He earned a doctorate in government and political economy from Harvard.
 He next worked for the Legislative Reference Bureau in Florida, before moving to work as an urban affairs specialist at the agency that would become the Office of Management and Budget. He taught at Harvard from 1954 to 1957 before moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a member of the political science department for nine years.
 He returned to M.I.T. as chairman of the political science department after working in the Housing and Urban Affairs Department. In 1969 and 1970, he was chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
 In addition to his wife, Dr. Wood is survived by his daughters, Frances Wood of Cambridge, Mass., and State Senator Margaret Wood Hassan of Exeter, N.H.; his son, Frank, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Tax Receipts Fell $6 Billion After Sept. 11, Report Says

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
The Sept. 11 attacks cost New York almost $6 billion in city and state tax revenue through the fiscal year 2003, according to a federal report being released today that gives the most authoritative accounting yet of their impact on public coffers.
 New York City faces an additional loss of $550 million in taxes annually for fiscal years 2004 and 2005, according to the report, which is based on estimates from the New York City Office of Management and Budget.
 The numbers are slightly lower than prior estimates, but New York lawmakers seized on them to intensify a call for federal reimbursement. 
 ''We're still waiting for help with these expenses,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who was joined by Representatives Charles Rangel and Jose E. Serrano, also of New York, in requesting the report. ''The only thing that is different now is that we have a clearer sense of just how much money is at stake.''
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, added, ''The report reaffirms that there needs to be continuing cooperation at every level to ensure that the city and state have the resources to meet our ongoing challenges.''
 The report, compiled by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, also said that one of the biggest financial impacts on the city was the loss of about 17,000 securities jobs.
 ''Although the decline in securities employment was not as great as in some other sectors, high wage rates for the sector mean a much larger decline in income,'' the report said. ''For example, securities income fell by 28 percent in the first quarter of 2002 from the same quarter the previous year.''
 Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Gov. George E. Pataki, said that while she had not yet seen the report, the city and state clearly experienced enormous fiscal repercussions after Sept. 11. ''In fact, the state saw revenue decline for the first two consecutive years following Sept. 11, which happened for the first time since the Great Depression,'' she said, adding that Mr. Pataki intended to continue working with the Congressional delegation to ensure that New York gets all the financial support it needs.
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said the report was not only an indication of how devastating the attacks were for the city but also a clear indicator of just ''how far the city has come under Mayor Bloomberg's leadership, from near bankruptcy to fiscal stability.'' 
 Earlier estimates of the impact were higher, the report said, because they did not adequately consider the recession that was hitting New York in the months before the attacks.
 ''The losses aren't what we feared initially because lots of businesses stuck with New York after the attacks,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''But $6 billion is still not something to sneeze at, and we are expecting Washington to deliver on its promises.''
 Although job growth had begun to slow in New York before the attacks, it declined sharply in the four months after the attacks. The city was hit harder than elsewhere because many manufacturing and finance jobs moved to Connecticut, New Jersey and elsewhere in New York, the report said.

HEADLINE: Chief of G.M. Takes Control Of Operations

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 4 

 BODY:
With General Motors losing its once dominant grip on American car buyers, its chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, took direct control of the company's North American operations on Monday in an effort to overcome a drought in profit and sales.
 Mr. Wagoner, 52, reduced the authority of the two most senior North American executives, Robert A. Lutz and Gary Cowger, in a move analysts saw as a sign that his job depends on fixing the company's performance at home. Lucrative sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles propped up G.M.'s performance in the late 1990's until competitors like Toyota and Nissan let loose a wave of their own trucks. 
 ''It clearly puts Rick's neck in the noose in North America,'' said David Cole, the president of the Center for Automotive Research, a consulting and research firm.
 The management shake-up by Mr. Wagoner comes after several weeks of bad news from G.M., which is expecting later this month to report a second consecutive quarterly loss. G.M. is trying to stave off junk bond ratings from the major debt-ratings firms, and its struggles are weighing on the Midwest. In Michigan, which now has the nation's highest unemployment rate, G.M. and its former parts subsidiary, Delphi, are top employers and the engines for many local economies.
 ''Given the challenges we face in North America, it makes sense for me to assume control,'' Mr. Wagoner said in a statement. The move, he said, would ''shorten the lines of communication and decision-making.''
 G.M.'s shares, which closed down 33 cents on Monday, at $29.05, are trading near lows they have not reached in more than a decade. 
 The move recalled a shake-up that preceded a major boardroom coup in 1992. In April that year, G.M.'s board forced out the president, Lloyd Reuss, in a move that foreshadowed by six months the ouster of the chairman and chief executive, Robert C. Stempel. 
 But there was no indication on Monday that Mr. Wagoner had lost the confidence of G.M.'s board, of which he remains chairman, and he appeared to make the move on his own to broaden his own authority. 
 In internal remarks broadcast to G.M.'s employees, Mr. Wagoner said the company faced a ''twofold'' challenge at home: to redouble efforts to make more compelling cars and trucks, and to set up a more competitive cost structure. 
 ''In particular, we have a very challenging issue in these rising health care costs in the U.S. and the impact that has, not only across our active employees, but our huge retiree base,'' he said. 
 Mr. Lutz and Mr. Cowger were left with weighty assignments, but for Mr. Cowger, the change was seen as a difficult one. Mr. Cowger, 57, the president for North American operations, was given responsibility for global manufacturing and labor relations. But he was stripped of the North American presidency, long one of G.M.'s most prominent jobs and one that Mr. Wagoner held himself in the mid-1990's.
 Mr. Lutz, the 73-year-old chairman of G.M.'s North American operations and the company's global product development chief, will now focus exclusively on what has been his principal job, reviving product development. Mr. Lutz remains one of G.M.'s two overall vice chairmen. 
 Analysts said Mr. Wagoner would now be held directly accountable for turning the company's domestic business around. 
 ''He's on the hot seat,'' said Gerald Meyers, a professor at the University of Michigan and a former auto executive. ''He has direct and defined responsibility and authority for moving North America. He had it before, but he also had somebody else he could pin the tail on underneath him. He can't do that anymore.''
 In five years as chief executive, Mr. Wagoner has not been able to halt a decades-long slide in G.M.'s home market. In the first quarter, G.M.'s share of the United States market fell to 25.7 percent from 27 percent a year earlier, according to the AutoData Corporation. A decade ago, G.M. held about 33 percent of the domestic market. Many analysts have also said rising gas prices will pressure a company reliant on sales of large S.U.V.'s like the Chevrolet Suburban and Cadillac Escalade.
 Adding to the company's problems, it has about two and a half retirees for every worker in the United States and expects to spend more than $5 billion on health care this year. 
 Mr. Wagoner is attempting to turn this around by taking direct control. 
 ''This move stresses the importance of the domestic market, its current condition, and the urgent need for improvement,'' Robert Hinchcliffe, an analyst at UBS, said in a note to investors. But he added that in Mr. Wagoner's tenure as head of G.M.'s North American operations in the mid-1990's, ''market share fell from 34 percent to 30 percent.''
 Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland's school of business, compared it to ''moving around the chairs on the deck of the Titanic.''
 Both Mr. Lutz and Mr. Cowger, who were not available for comment, will continue to be among a handful of the most important executives at the company.
 Mr. Lutz is Detroit's most outspoken executive, a former Marine who flies a Soviet-era fighter jet for fun and never shies from the spotlight. In recent comments at a conference hosted by Morgan Stanley, he suggested that another one of G.M.'s brands might have to be phased out, as the company has done with Oldsmobile, if performance does not improve. He has since said his remarks were misrepresented by the media. 
 But critics have said that if Mr. Lutz, who was hired in late 2001 to be the company's product chief, does not make more progress, G.M. cannot continue to support its eight domestic brands, which include Cadillac, Chevrolet and Hummer. So far, critical new vehicles like the Pontiac G6 and Buick LaCrosse sedans have not stemmed steep sales declines at those brands or been the kind of breakthrough product DaimlerChrysler has with its Chrysler 300 sedan. 
 Mr. Cowger is being returned to his core competency, manufacturing and labor relations, at a time when both are critical to G.M.'s success. Mr. Cowger began his career at a G.M. plant in Kansas City and worked his way up in a variety of manufacturing jobs in a variety of countries. He is credited with repairing G.M.'s fractious relations with the United Automobile Workers union in the late 1990's and is respected by labor leaders. 
 In his comments on Monday, Mr. Wagoner said Mr. Cowger's new assignment would be critical in the drive to cut costs. G.M. is seeking to unify its global manufacturing into a single system in which cars and trucks can be readily built in one part of the world for use in another. The company is also hopeful the union will give back some of its enviable health care benefits before its labor contract expires in 2007.

HEADLINE: Europeans Cut Estimate Of Growth For 2005

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 4 

 BODY:
The European Commission reduced its 2005 growth forecast for the euro zone on Monday to 1.6 percent from 2 percent, the second cut in six months, because of record oil costs and rising unemployment.
 Growth for 2005 will be down from 2 percent last year, the European monetary commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said in Brussels. The commission also trimmed its 2006 forecast to 2.1 percent, from 2.2 percent, and said that risks to this projection are ''tilted to the downside.'' 
 Michael Hume, an economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the euro region, the 12 nations using the currency, is ''an albatross around the global economy's neck.'' 
 ''The stimulus from world trade is rapidly waning,'' he said, ''and it's not clear whether there's enough momentum on the domestic side to fill the gap.''
 An 85 percent increase in oil prices over the last 12 months and a regional unemployment rate of 8.9 percent have eroded consumer purchasing power and squeezed corporate profit, reducing capital investment. Consumer confidence dropped to a seven-month low last month.
 ''The 1.6 percent growth forecast is still very ambitious,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at the HVB Group, a big banking company in Munich. ''We're still suffering from the increase in oil prices, and the weak labor market is one reason that consumption has disappointed.''
 Lengthening jobless lines and slowing expansion will push the budget deficits of Germany, Italy, Greece and Portugal over the European Union limit of 3 percent of the gross domestic product this year, the commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also predicted on Monday. The union loosened its rules last month to allow countries with high deficits to avoid sanctions.
 Germany's deficit, at 3.3 percent of output, would be the highest for the fourth year. Italy would go back over the limit for the first time since the euro's formal introduction in 1999. Greece would breach the rule in 2005 and miss a 2006 deadline to get back under the limit, the forecasts said.
 In terms of overall growth, Germany will have the worst-performing economy in both the euro region and the 25-nation European Union this year, with growth of 0.8 percent, according to the forecasts. Ireland is predicted to be the euro zone's fastest-growing economy for a second year, with 4.9 percent expansion. Latvia, one of 10 nations to join the union last May, will be the top performer, expanding at a projected 7.2 percent.
 The commission predicts growth in the United States of 3.6 percent this year. 
 The European Central Bank's governing council meets here on Thursday to set short-term interest rates. Economists expect it to leave rates unchanged.

HEADLINE: Faulting U.S., Report Urges Arab Lands to Democratize

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, April 5 

 BODY:
A group of Arab intellectuals have called for rapid progress toward democracy in the Arab world and contended that the United States and Israel have impeded such progress, in a report issued here Tuesday.
 The Arab Human Development Report was released by the United Nations Development Program after a six-month delay, during which the Bush administration sought to block it. Nevertheless, according to its authors, it appeared to contain few major changes from earlier drafts. 
 The report warns that Arab governments may soon face the prospect of civil strife or change forced by outsiders unless swift and fundamental reforms are begun. But, in a departure from two earlier reports on Arab society in which the group focused almost exclusively on problems within the Arab world, this study says the United States and Israel have also played a part in suppressing Arab freedom. The Bush administration, in Washington, objected to that conclusion. 
 In part, the study blames the dearth of democracy and freedom in the region on the structure of modern Arab states, which have become highly centralized, mostly offering their citizens only a small margin of freedom. Even in the region's limited democracies, the report says, societies and economies are organized in a way that prevents the emergence of an effective opposition. 
 ''The Arab development crisis has widened, deepened and grown more complex to a degree that demands the full engagement of all Arab citizens in comprehensive reform,'' the authors say. ''Partial reforms, no matter how varied, are no longer effective or even possible.''
 The report asserts that Arabs enjoy greater personal and economic freedom than they once did, but that they have little if any political freedom. ''The freedoms of opinion, expression and organization, in particular, suffer from repression in most Arab countries,'' said Rima Khalaf, assistant secretary general of the development program, who led the effort that produced the report.
 The study is the third installment of the Human Development Report series written by prominent Arab scholars, who have taken an unsentimental eye to their world and offered the most prominent academic study of the Arab condition. 
 The first report, published in 2002, caused a stir in the Arab world when it outlined how the region was falling behind in development; the second offered criticized an ''Arab knowledge deficit'' in contrast to the rest of the world. The latest installment focuses on the lack of freedom and democratization in the region. 
 ''We are hoping to deepen the debate over freedom and good governance,'' said Ms. Khalaf.
 The Bush administration had objected to language in early drafts that said Israeli control over the Palestinian territories and the American occupation of Iraq only served to impede Arab human development. The report also said that one result of the American invasion of Iraq was that ''the Iraqi people have emerged from the grip of a despotic regime that violated their basic rights and freedoms, only to fall under a foreign occupation that increased human suffering.'' 
 ''One-tenth of Arabs live directly under foreign occupation,'' Ms. Khalaf told an audience on Tuesday.
 The Bush administration reportedly threatened to reduce financing for the development program if such language was not removed from the text. The development agency considered publishing the report through a private company, or publishing it under the names of its authors. It finally released the report under its own name, but with a disclaimer in the preface. 
 The authors said the original language was essentially intact, although some particularly prickly terms may have been softened. They added that the controversy may have given them a degree of legitimacy among Arabs, who might have otherwise dismissed them as apologists for American views. 
 ''Ironically they saved us from the agony of defense,'' said Nader Fergany, lead writer of the report. ''It was good to have had the fight and to have won it.''
 In Washington, Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said that ''our overall appraisal of the report is it fits in the pattern'' of the two previous reports that focused on need for reforms within the region. ''It's not even so much that we disagree with the problems,'' he said. ''We tend to disagree with these sort of gratuitous statements about where they come from.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 7, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Arab Human Development report of the United Nations Development Program asserted that its release had been delayed by Bush administration pressure on the agency to change language critical of the United States and Israel. The assertion was based on unattributed statements from several speakers and interviewees connected with the committee that wrote the report, who spoke during and after a news conference in Amman, Jordan, about its release.
 The Times did not seek comment on this assertion from either the Bush administration or the United Nations, which have previously denied that such pressure was exerted. The Times should have sought their comment or reported the previous denials.
 Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the extent to which this report differed from two previous ones. They, too, included language that objected to American and Israeli policies, and did not focus almost exclusively on problems within the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Development Program Gets New Life, but Not Without Debate

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 5 

 BODY:
In the budget they passed last week, state lawmakers authorized an extension of the Empire Zones, an economic development program that has been criticized for becoming too politicized and straying from its mission of revitalizing New York's blighted areas.
 The Empire Zones program has expanded markedly, growing from 10 zones in 1987 to 72 zones spread across the state. The zones are meant to attract businesses by offering limited tax breaks, spurring job growth in those areas. But critics have wondered if adding more zones has diluted their effectiveness and if the growth of zones in suburban areas has encouraged sprawl. 
 Audits by State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi have found that the program gave breaks to companies even though they had cut jobs, a notion the Pataki administration disputes. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who led investigations into the program, said there were growing concerns that political favoritism was at play in drawing the zone boundaries and in deciding which companies should get benefits.
 In extending the program, Mr. Brodsky said, lawmakers moved to ''stop the waste and fraud that permeated the program over the last half-dozen years,'' as well as to help return it to its antipoverty roots.
 To satisfy Democrats who control the State Assembly, the lawmakers linked the tax benefits for companies within the zones to the value of the jobs created. They sought to limit the practice by which new companies claimed tax breaks, often worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, even for creating a single job, though Gov. George E. Pataki sought to go further in reducing that potential for abuse in two areas: power plants and real estate investment trusts.
 They also reconfigured the zones to make them more contiguous. And they called for creating 12 new zones by 2009, to meet the Republican-led Senate's aim that no county be without the program's benefits.
 Currently, there are 11 counties that do not have zones. Though there are zones in New York City, Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, has bristled over the state's failure to approve one in Chinatown, which is in his district and has suffered since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. 
 As in other areas of the budget, the lawmakers' plan for the program is subject to scrutiny by Mr. Pataki, who voiced opposition to the proposal even before they included it in their budget. Mr. Pataki has until Tuesday to issue vetoes. It is unclear if the Empire Zones issue will become entangled in negotiations over proposals left out of the budget, including $1.1 billion for needy New Yorkers, and no one in Albany seemed willing to talk of compromises.
 ''Our staff is making it clear we want to see changes in this program,'' said David Catalfamo, the governor's communications director. ''It's a big priority.''
 In extending the program until 2011, lawmakers also established a new board to oversee the creation of new zones and to rule on boundary issues for all existing zones. The governor, Mr. Silver and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the Senate, would each designate a voting member, a move that would dilute the authority of the Empire State Development Corporation, which oversees the program.
 Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the corporation, said the new board would ''politicize the process,'' and undermine decisions made on the local level. He said other changes were ''technically and substantively flawed'' and would complicate the program for businesses, putting New York in danger of losing jobs to other states or nations.
 But Dan Weiller, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi, said the lawmakers addressed many areas of concern.
 ''The program will have increased accountability at the local and state levels,'' he said.
 Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed research group, said the lawmakers' work was ''a mixed bag -- some good and some bad.'' He said it was contradictory to try to refocus the zones in economically distressed areas, while allowing for the creation of one in every county.
 In the end, Mr. Bruno said he was still listening to the Pataki administration's objections. ''They feel that it's problematic, in terms of the way we have submitted it,'' he said. ''And we're talking about it.''

HEADLINE: Salt Lake City Makeover Stirs Some Controversy

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
It is not every day that a mayor of a city in a major metropolitan area is moved to complain publicly about a redevelopment project that will pump hundreds of millions of private dollars into the heart of his downtown. 
 In this case, however, the mayor is Rocky Anderson, a Democrat now in his second term who is eager to see pedestrian traffic return to this city's quiet downtown streets. He has assailed the Mormon Church's plan to reshape the two fortresslike shopping malls that stand opposite each other on Main Street, one block south of Temple Square, the church's historic world headquarters. The church, he says, is relying on an ''old, failed paradigm.''
 But church officials say they have every intention of making their property pedestrian-friendly and integrating it with the rest of downtown, although they have disclosed few details. The mayor, said H. David Burton, the presiding bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as Mormonism is known, and the official in charge of its real estate holdings, ''is not terribly familiar with what we're planning.'' 
 No one here disagrees that the church-owned malls, ZCMI Center and Crossroads Plaza, which opened in 1975 and 1980, respectively, are obsolete -- relics of an era when it was the fashion for an urban vertical shopping center to be hidden behind concrete walls, with its back to the street. For the last decade, business in the dark and tired-looking malls has been so bad that the Nordstrom in Crossroads has been the poorest performer in the entire chain, a spokeswoman said.
 Recently, the church announced that Taubman Centers, a publicly traded mall developer based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., had agreed to redevelop ZCMI and Crossroads as part of a $500 million project that would also include 900 units of housing, and the upgrading of church-owned office space surrounding the malls and elsewhere in downtown.
 Nordstrom, Crossroad's leading anchor store, had prompted consternation here by threatening to leave the city after its bid to move to Gateway, an open-air shopping and entertainment center on the western edge of downtown, was blocked by the City Council. It has since agreed to stay.
 ''Taubman pulled together a project that we were overwhelmed with,'' said Brooke F. White, a Nordstrom spokeswoman. 
 Church officials and Taubman executives have said they plan to combine the malls and keep them enclosed rather than transform them into a Gateway-like shopping center without a roof.
 ''We can do a lot of things architecturally to give you a feeling of openness so you can see the blue sky and the snow falling in the wintertime,'' Bishop Burton said in a recent interview in his Temple Square office. ''We need to protect patrons from the elements. Hopefully, this is the best of both worlds.'' 
 But Mayor Anderson, who blames the malls for destroying a once-thriving downtown, said the church should have worked with urban planners and designers to create a blueprint for a genuinely urban streetscape that would evolve organically. Making the city walkable is particularly challenging here, the mayor notes, because each city block occupies a daunting 10 acres.
 ''We just need to learn from the mistakes of the past,'' said the mayor, a former president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah. ''There's nothing I've read in any of the literature about downtowns or urban revitalization that says new enclosed malls are the answer.''
 Roberta Brandes Gratz, an urban specialist cited by the mayor, said an enclosed mall would kill the downtown's chances of regenerating. ''Connecting open streets is the only thing that will make it urban,'' said Ms. Gratz, the author of ''Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown'' (Wiley, 1998). ''Suburban and urban cannot mix.'' 
 The disagreement over whether a reconfigured mall will enhance or impede the revival of downtown reflects the tensions that have pitted representatives of this city's increasingly non-Mormon population against officials of one of the world's fastest-growing religions. 
 As the seat of Mormonism, this city of 181,000 annually draws millions of visits from church members. In 1876, the church opened its first Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution near the temple to help foster self-sufficiency among Mormon settlers. A century later, the store (which has since been replaced by a Meier & Frank department store) became a focal point of ZCMI Center.
 Crossroads Plaza was developed privately on land leased from the church, which acquired the mall in 2003. Today, as a result of an influx of Hispanic and other immigrants as well as outdoor enthusiasts attracted by the nearby Wasatch Mountains, only about 40 percent of this city's residents are Mormons, according to James A. Wood, an economist at the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah. As the city's largest property owner and employer, however, the church still wields considerable muscle.
 In recent years, the changing demographics here have led to clashes over whether strip clubs should be allowed downtown and over the church's decision to restrict behavior on a once-public block of Main Street. 
 In Taubman, the church has a partner known for a relatively small, but generally successful, portfolio of 21 shopping centers across the nation, including the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. The company reported average annual sales in 2004 of $477 a square foot -- the highest of any public regional mall company, said Matthew Ostrower, a retail real estate analyst at Morgan Stanley.
 Taubman will invest in the mall and become its primary owner, said Bruce W. Heckman, the company's vice president for development. Taubman's arrangement with the church has not been disclosed.
 Mr. Heckman said the new mall would bring in retailers who are not yet represented in Utah (he would not give any names) and would focus on medium- to high-end apparel. There will be several restrictions that might be risky for a mall developer that did not have a deep-pocketed partner like the church. The mall will not have movie theaters. Nor is it likely to be open on Sundays or to allow liquor to be served.
 Mr. Heckman acknowledged that the alcohol ban would deter some popular restaurants from opening at the mall.
 An even more unusual feature is the church's insistence on keeping its plans under wraps. Alison McFarlane, the mayor's senior adviser for economic development, said that developers usually worked with city planners during a project's early stages because the approval process could take a long time. In this instance, she said, the city has been told, ''when we have something to show you, we will.'' 
 She said a zoning change would be needed if the church intended to link the two malls by means of a pedestrian sky bridge. 
 A sky bridge across Main Street, where a free light-rail train circulates through downtown, would certainly ignite a heated debate. ''This could be the most controversial aspect,'' said Robert Farrington Jr., the executive director of the Downtown Alliance, a nonprofit organization. ''The city has a longstanding policy against upper-level bridges. As a planner, I don't like them. They take people off the street.'' 
 Defending the lack of disclosure, Ron Pastore, a principal at AEW Capital Management in Boston, who brought Taubman and the church together, said the project, which includes building an undetermined number of underground parking spaces, is so complex that it would be premature to discuss details at this point.
 ''One reason we haven't been able to share a lot of plans is that every time we come up with a concept we have to go back and make sure that it works,'' he said.
 Michael D. Beyard, a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, said the church's approach was a throwback to the 1980's. ''It's good politics and good development practice to share a common vision,'' he said. ''Today's retail is about more than shopping. It's about creating an environment that people want.''
 But Mr. Beyard said an enclosed mall would not necessarily doom Mayor Anderson's hopes for a walkable downtown. North Michigan Avenue in Chicago has them. The San Francisco Shopping Center, a vertical mall on Market Street in San Francisco, is considered a success and is undergoing an expansion. ''There's nothing inherently dinosaurlike about the enclosure,'' he said. ''It can be adapted to modern retailing.
 ''God is in the details,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Signs of a Budding Recovery as Speculation Blooms

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
Like crocuses in the spring, a surge in speculative building is being seen as a definite sign of a recovery in the New Jersey commercial real estate market.
 The last few years have been dreary ones for both the office and industrial markets in the state. From 2002 through 2004, according to analysts from the real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield, the amount of office space built on speculation each year dwindled drastically -- from five million square feet delivered in 2002 to less than 10 percent of that the next year when the economy was down. In a weak rebound in 2004, 1.2 million square feet of uncommitted office space was created. 
 For industrial buildings, the pattern was similarly bleak: developer confidence was blazing in 2001, when six million square feet was built speculatively. But the total square footage created the next year was just half that, and it shrank to 1.2 million square feet in 2003, rising slightly to 1.5 million square feet in 2004.
 Now, the industrial market is blooming with promise again. In the first quarter of this year, 5.2 million square feet of warehouse-storage and office-flex space was under construction and more new projects are being planned, according to area brokers, who say tenant interest is rising.
 Meanwhile, office development on spec -- while still considered too risky by most developers -- is beginning to appear here and there, most notably in Princeton, N.J. 
 But even in Parsippany, N.J., where the office vacancy rate has been stuck at 20 percent or higher since 2001-2, when the telecommunications and dot-com sectors went into decline, there is a plan to break ground on new space despite the lack of a committed tenant. The Gale Company, a worldwide developer based in Florham Park, N.J., is set to go with a new 150,000-square-foot office building at 100 Kimball Avenue, moving ahead with further construction at its Center of Morris County office park. 
 ''Personally, I still think it's taking a big chance,'' said a rival developer, Todd Rechler, who heads the New Jersey division of the Reckson Associates Realty, which has concentrated in recent years on upgrading existing buildings in prime locations. 
 Jeffrey L. Heller, a commercial market specialist for Cushman & Wakefield, said, ''Many times in a climate like this, the juices are flowing, but then the deal flakes out.'' Mr. Heller believes that certain areas of the state, like Princeton and parts of Bergen County, are promising locales for spec building, but he continues to see Parsippany as being ''in recovery.''
 Mark Yeager, Gale's president, says the time has come for developers to act on the good news in the state's economy: more jobs, lower unemployment and interest rates still low enough to permit a healthy capitalization rate. 
 Mr. Yeager says an analysis of the Parsippany market shows that it is ripe for new construction. ''The true vacancy rate for blocks of Class A space 50,000 square feet and larger is in the single digits,'' he said. Most space now available consists of smaller offices in older freestanding buildings.
 According to Cushman & Wakefield, five top-quality properties with 50,000 square feet or more are currently being marketed in Parsippany. Four of them are at Waterview Corporate Center, where Gale is among the landlords but has only two small office vacancies. The larger spaces there are an entire building with 120,000 square feet; two offices with 125,000 and 75,000 square feet, respectively; and a 154,000-square-foot office available for sublease. In addition, a 52,412-square-foot office is available at Maple Plaza.
 The Gale executive said that the company's planned new building at Center of Morris, where State Farm Insurance and Novartis Pharmaceuticals are already major tenants, was only ''a tiny bit risky.'' Building in partnership with J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Gale expects to start construction by summer and complete the building by mid-2006, Mr. Yeager said.
 In Princeton, where the Patrinely Group has steel in the ground for a 150,000-square-foot office building on Route 1, the potential for successfully marketing a spec office building seems to meet with very little skepticism from market specialists. 
 ''Vacancy in that market is in single digits,'' Mr. Heller of Cushman said about Princeton. ''If a tenant is looking for 100,000 square feet, there is currently no place to accommodate them.'' Tom Bermingham of the Patrinely Group said, ''Our building will be the first thing built since the wave of projects that came online during 2001.'' 
 Mr. Heller said he was aware of another speculative project in the works on Alexander Road, off University Square: a proposed four-story office building with more than 300,000 square feet. Construction permits require that work there begin by September, he said. 
 On the industrial side of the commercial market, the Matrix Development Group has received approvals for more than 720,000 square feet of speculative development at Northeast Business Park in Washington Township, off Exit 7A of the New Jersey Turnpike. The company says this would be the first speculative project for the Exit 7A area.
 Alexander B. Taylor of Matrix said that his company's analysis indicated the area had matured enough to warrant the risk and that he believed this space would be fully leased before construction was complete.
 At Exit 8A, which is north of Exit 7A and closer to New York City and Newark, robust development ate up most of the largest sites several years ago. But with demand growing for industrial buildings to support Newark's increasingly active port, smaller and less desirable sites are being developed.
 At Exit 8A, Klatskin is building a 250,000-square-foot building and Matrix is building a 400,000-square-foot industrial structure. And the KOR Companies is continuing its speculative development of Central Crossings in Bordentown, a 170-acre warehouse-distribution center situated on one of the last large virgin sites in that market. KOR is now building a 150,000-square-foot building that could be occupied by a single tenant or up to seven smaller tenants.
 ''We're not nervous at all,'' said Harry Kantor of KOR. ''The name of the game in industrial development these days is if you build it, they will come.''

HEADLINE: Back to '59: Sammy Is Running Again

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In the cutthroat, double-dealing world pictured in books about Enron and Disney, Sammy Glick may seem like a quaint relic of a simpler time. But when he landed on the American imagination in 1941 in Budd Schulberg's Hollywood novel ''What Makes Sammy Run,'' Sammy was an original, an archetype for the ruthless climber who sheds scruples and uses up friends as he slithers his way to the top. 
 He steals credits for scripts, drops his girlfriend for the studio owner's regal daughter and displays an almost acrobatic ability to feign ardent loyalty to his boss while making a case for dumping him at the same time.
 ''With me it's simple,'' he says. ''Whatever is good for Sammy Glick is right, and whatever is bad for Sammy Glick is immoral, unethical, unconstitutional. In other words, it stinks.'' 
 Despite a character type as iconically American as George Babbitt, Jay Gatsby and Willy Loman, ''What Makes Sammy Run'' was never made into a film. But it did have a powerful performance on television -- two episodes on consecutive Sundays in 1959 on the NBC anthology ''Sunday Showcase'' -- that starred a corrosive Larry Blyden.
 A full kinescope of that TV adaptation has recently been found after being lost to the public for decades. The Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan had possessed a videotape of the first hour practically since its founding in 1976, but its archivists could never find the concluding hour until the actress Dina Merrill, a museum trustee, asked to see her treasured role as Sammy's imperious goddess. 
 A new nationwide search unearthed an eight-reel kinescope of both segments at the Library of Congress. They had been mislabeled. Tonight the discovery will be celebrated with a screening at the museum attended by Mr. Schulberg, co-author of the teleplay with his brother Stuart, and Ms. Merrill.
 ''I thought I was writing about Hollywood,'' said Mr. Schulberg, now 91, living in the Hamptons and working on a boxing screenplay with Spike Lee. ''But people started calling me asking if I knew this person or that person because they thought he was so like him. Then I realized in a way that I had touched a national nerve.''
 In today's world of ''capitalism with the brakes off,'' Mr. Schulberg said, Sammy's kind of back-stabbing behavior is ''taken for granted.'' Indeed, he said, he has had readers come up to him and thank him for advice on advancing their careers.
 ''I've written a how-to book, which is not exactly what I had in mind,'' he said.
 Mr. Schulberg knew his Hollywood snakes because he was the son of a Paramount studio head, B.P. Schulberg, and as a young man wrote a screenplay with F. Scott Fitzgerald. Mr. Schulberg suggested that Sammy was a composite of many of the scheming sycophants whom he saw ''kissing up'' to his father.
 In the television version, filled with the kind of crisp dialogue not uncommon in an era when television drew writers like Paddy Chayefsky, Larry Blyden starts off as a newspaper copy boy who quickly sizes up the economic futility of a life in journalism. ''Don't do me no favors,'' he tells his mentor, Al Manheim, played by John Forsythe, when offered a chance at promotion. ''A cub reporter for $30 a week, and then all of a sudden you're a great big reporter for $50 and $60 a week for the rest of your life? No thanks.''
 Sammy then curries favor with a senior editor by pointing out an error in Manheim's column and is rewarded with a column of his own. Sammy vaults to Hollywood on the strength of a script he has stolen from a hapless writer, and the idealistic Manheim joins him. He watches Sammy make a loud fuss over a restaurant table, sell scripts on glib ad-libbing that, as one character says, ''will pass for genius'' in Hollywood, and put down Manheim as ''intelligent but not smart.'' Finally he sees him snatch the job of the studio production chief, a man who Sammy had once said was ''like a father to me.'' 
 The show tries to explain Sammy's hunger for success with glimpses of a penniless childhood on the Lower East Side where Sammy had to wear his brother's hand-me-down shoes. 
 ''I didn't have to read no books to find out about Darwin,'' Sammy says. ''I learned about that on the streets -- survival of the fittest.''
 The teleplay, directed by Delbert Mann, who had earlier directed the acclaimed television and movie versions of ''Marty,'' makes clear that Sammy's relentless drive is an aphrodisiac. A beautiful screenwriter, Kit Sargent, played by Barbara Rush, says she has a ''crazed desire to hold all that frenzy and violence.'' But still she is scrupulous enough to tell Sammy, ''If you were half the success, you'd be more of a man.''
 Sammy drops her for the aristocratic Laurette Harrington (Ms. Merrill), but gets his comeuppance. Still it is clear that Sammy Glicks are not easily stopped. The real question, Sammy says at the end, is not what makes Sammy run, but what makes ''all the rest of you run after me.''
 Jane Klain, the museum's manager of research services, and Allen Glover, the curator, speculated that despite efforts to get Frank Sinatra, Mickey Rooney and even Tom Cruise to play Sammy, the novel had never been filmed because of Hollywood's discomfort with a close-to-the-bone portrayal of a studio chief by an inside player. Ms. Klain said it was easier to mount a television production because ''television at the time tackled a lot of things that film was apprehensive about.'' An earlier, shorter television adaptation with Jose Ferrer as Sammy was broadcast in 1949, and the novel was turned into a Broadway musical in 1964 that starred Steve Lawrence and ran for more than 500 performances.
 The actor Ben Stiller has written a screenplay with Jerry Stahl and, with backing from Dreamworks, hopes to direct it, but he said, ''It's a hard movie to get made -- when people say no you never get the real reason for what the resistance is.''
 In the 1959 teleplay Mr. Schulberg had Kit Sargent suggest that the story did not necessarily have to take place in Hollywood and that Sammy did not have to be Jewish. ''I've known Glicks named Jones, Goldstein and Orsini,'' she says. ''Where the stakes are high and the pressure is great, that's where you'll find Sammy. He's a universal type.''
 But the Jewish nerve was hard to avoid in depicting a heavily Jewish industry. Mr. Schulberg recalled that when he wrote two short stories for Liberty magazine that grew into the novel, Liberty's editors insisted he give many of the characters names that were less obviously Jewish. Al Manheim became Al Manners. But for the novel and 1959 script, characters retained Jewish names to show that the victims of Sammy's venality were also Jewish. 
 Ms. Klain described ''Sammy'' as one of the ''legendary lost programs.'' The networks routinely threw away kinescopes of old shows and reused tapes, but NBC had given its kinescopes to the Library of Congress. Ms. Klain asked the library archives to comb its holdings more painstakingly, and the eight mislabeled reels were found.
 ''Jane ran upstairs very excited and said we'd found the second half of 'What Makes Sammy Run,''' Mr. Glover recalled. 
 Will the rediscovered teleplay of ''Sammy'' ever run outside the museum? ''In the perfect universe there would be a television counterpart of Turner Classic Movies,'' Mr. Glover said.

HEADLINE: New Tactics, Tools and Goals Are Emerging for White Power Organizations

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, April 5 

 BODY:
Frank Weltner's cluttered living room is one of the unlikely new hot spots in America's old and ongoing preoccupation with race.
 Mr. Weltner, a 63-year-old former local radio talk show host, began what white power groups say is the first round-the-clock racial Webcast this year. He can run many Web sites, including what he calls his most popular one, Jewwatch.com, with a laptop computer and a microphone from the comfort of his couch.
 Technically savvy and politically in tune with their communities, Mr. Weltner and people like him are the new figures to watch in the white power world, say people who track extremist groups. Many of the national organizations -- like the Aryan Nation, Creativity and the National Alliance, Mr. Weltner's group -- have fragmented in the last few years. Some leaders, including Matthew Hale, the former head of Creativity, who is to be sentenced on Wednesday for soliciting the murder of a federal judge, have been removed; others have died. 
 ''The hate groups are in disarray; the leaders have died or been jailed,'' said Karen Aroesty, the St. Louis-based regional director for Missouri and Southern Illinois for the Anti-Defamation League. ''But what we've seen, particularly here, is a more sophisticated use of mainstream media tools in order to sell the product.''
 The breakdown in national leadership has coincided, outside experts and group members say, with a transformation of tools and goals. Some corners of the Internet are openly racist, but local groups have broadened their message to include immigration and adopted more subtle appeals to attract new followers.
 Mr. Weltner said he preached love for the white race -- not hatred for any other -- and grass-roots action to protect the European gene pool in the United States, which he said was being diluted by immigration. ''Think racially, act locally,'' he said.
 The Internet, with its anonymity and lack of physical geography, does not lend itself to bossy leaders or compounds in the woods. Locally autonomous groups can also better refine their message to fit the markets, which further fuels the fragmentation. Here in St. Louis, which has long been one of the nation's most segregated cities, separatism -- not supremacy -- is the racial term of art. Jeff Weise, the 16-year-old who killed nine people and himself last month on an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota, was touched by the arguments of separatism and genetic purity, which he wrote about often in postings on the Internet.
 Brian H. Levin, a professor of criminal justice and director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said cruising the Internet for extremist racial views had become like shopping for books or airfares -- an endless consumer choice.
 ''On the Internet, you can craft your own buffet of hate,'' Professor Levin said.
 He cautioned, however, that the growth of racialist content on the Web did not necessarily mean a rise in racism in the country. The Internet's expansion into every niche of society, Professor Levin said, could merely be giving voice to impulses already there.
 Some parts of the white power movement are clearly more underground than ever, diffused and dispersed into the virtual cyberspace of Web sites that claim more members than the estimated size of the Ku Klux Klan. Whiterevolution.com solicits donations via credit card. 
 Other elements are reaching out more than ever for a public role and a piece of the nation's debate on subjects like immigration and the growing gap between rich and poor. Adherents to the movement say the two pieces fit perfectly.
 Mr. Weltner's group, the National Alliance, spent $1,500 in February, for example, to put advertisements on the local transit trains in St. Louis, and has distributed tens of thousands of leaflets just about every weekend in recent months urging residents to ''love your race.'' 
 The Council of Concerned Citizens, which is based here and has worked to protect use of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina and Mississippi, is talking more and more about immigration, especially nonwhite illegal immigrants. The group's chief executive, Gordon Lee Baum, said in an interview that immigrants were taking American jobs and pushing the nation toward what he called ''third-world status.'' 
 ''As communities suffer the results of massive illegal immigration, it's become a growing concern all over the U.S.,'' Mr. Baum said. He said big companies bringing in cheap foreign labor were as much to blame as anyone.
 ''In southwest Missouri,'' he said, ''there's a county down there now that is almost a majority Hispanic because of a big meat-processing plant.'' 
 Some local civic leaders here say the debate itself is frightening -- either because the mainstream society might come to accept a race-based perspective as part of legitimate public discourse or because people in economically battered cities like St. Louis might actually be listening.
 ''Groups that used to meet in secrecy are now coming out into the light,'' said Esther L. Wright, vice president and general manager at WGNU, an AM talk-radio station here that once employed both Mr. Weltner and Mr. Baum as hosts. ''That they're becoming more acceptable is just another example of the moral decay of the society.'' 
 (Mr. Weltner's and Mr. Baum's programs were canceled last fall. Ms. Wright said that there were violations of station policy but that she could not elaborate; Mr. Weltner and Mr. Baum said changes in political taste at the station forced them out.) 
 Some of the results of the racialist public outreach here come close to comedy. In February, for example, the owner of the Bevo Mill restaurant here, David Hanon, got what he thought was a routine booking for a private party. The European Cultural Society wanted to use his restaurant to bring in an Irish dancing school for the day and have a party to celebrate, as the group's name suggested, European culture.
 Then a reporter from The St. Louis Post-Dispatch called and asked whether Mr. Hanon knew that the European Cultural Society was a front for the National Alliance, a group classified as a neo-Nazi organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups. 
 Mr. Hanon immediately canceled the event. ''A lot of people were duped,'' he said.
 The National Alliance's transit train advertisements, meanwhile, were so vague and innocuous that few people, including the transit system's administrators, knew what was being advertised until the one-month contract had all but run out. The posters simply said, ''The future belongs to us!'' with a National Alliance contact number.
 Some experts say the atomization of the white organizations like the National Alliance and the Aryan Nation and the simultaneous rise of white power on the Internet make the groups less relevant. Mr. Hale, for example, had largely been marginalized in the movement, the experts say, since his conviction last year for soliciting the murder of a federal judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, who presided over a trademark infringement case involving the name of Mr. Hale's group.
 Chat rooms have buzzed in recent weeks, and Mr. Hale's star has risen again if only as a symbol, after the murder of Judge Lefkow's husband and mother. The police say the crime was unrelated to Mr. Hale or white power groups, though cheers for those deaths were posted on some racial Web sites.
 ''The movement as a whole is in the process of sorting itself out, finding its next set of directions, but that doesn't make it less dangerous,'' said Leonard Zeskind, a writer who has been monitoring white supremacist activity for 25 years.
 ''People don't need to be followers of groups,'' Mr. Zeskind added. ''They just need to be angry.''

HEADLINE: Long Island Reds That Don't Put on Airs

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
WHEN the Dining section's tasting panel sampled 25 Long Island red wines recently, we were as surprised by what we didn't find in the glass as by what we did.
 These wines, all made primarily from merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon, were mostly unpretentious, and even modest. Few divas here, screaming on their cellphones as they demanded more perks. The wines were more like good character actors in an ensemble. 
 Florence Fabricant and I were joined on the panel by Beth von Benz, consulting wine director at Guastavino's, and Scott Mayger, general manager of Barbuto, and for all of us, the sense of discovery was a delight. The world at times can seem overrun by wines that are done in by delusions of greatness. What consumers need are fewer wines that want to be at the center of a special occasion and far more that simply want to be on the table. Fewer stars, to put it another way, and more supporting players. 
 Whether Long Island winemakers see it this way is doubtful. Owners like Michael Lynne of Bedell Cellars, the Petrocelli family of Raphael, and Christian Wolffer of Wolffer Estate have not invested millions of dollars in their facilities in the last decade to make quaffable little wines. They believe that Long Island has the potential to make great wines. 
 Who knows? Maybe they are right. The Long Island wine region -- a 10-mile stretch of the North Fork east of Riverhead to Peconic, along with a few outposts on the South Fork -- is still awfully young. Though vines were planted and wines made in the 1970's and 80's, those early years were stabs in the dark. For all intents and purposes, the current arc of Long Island wines stretches back 15 years at most. Perhaps as the vines mature and farmers and winemakers learn what works best and where, the wines will gain complexity and intensity.
 Certainly we saw encouraging signs. The wines we tasted tended to be much lighter textured and lower in alcohol than most California wines, for example, an indication that they would be complementary on the table. They seemed to strive for balance and subtlety rather than power, and while a few were layered with too much oak flavor, restraint was the order of the day.
 ''These are good food wines,'' Ms. von Benz said. ''They're American wines done in an Old World style.''
 Ms. Fabricant called them ''eminently drinkable and not show-off wines,'' and Mr. Mayger noted definite improvement over what he has tasted in the past. He said that many of the wines reminded him of Loire Valley reds rather than of Bordeaux reds, which may not thrill Long Island winemakers who see Bordeaux as their model. But Ms. Fabricant said Bordeaux was the proper analogy. She suggested that the Long Island wines were reminiscent of wines from the Cotes du Blaye or the Cotes du Castillon, Bordeaux satellite regions that are far less known than the famous Medoc and Right Bank areas. This may thrill the Long Island winemakers even less.
 Their feelings are understandable from an economic point of view. There doesn't seem to be much of a market for reds from the Loire or the lesser Bordeaux regions. They don't fit the currently popular model of highly fruity, viscous wines, and they don't tend to receive high ratings from critics or great recognition. But as Ms. von Benz put it, wines like these can be ''untapped gems.''
 Our top wine, a 2002 merlot from Shinn Estate Vineyards, was balanced and somewhat austere, but we all could sense its substance. Remarkably, this was Shinn Estate's first vintage, made from three-year-old vines. It showed great potential, not, again, as a profound wine but as a bottle that would go well with dinner. The owners of Shinn Estate, David Page and Barbara Shinn, who own Home restaurant in Manhattan, are dedicated to the North Fork as a local source of wine and excellent produce and ingredients. Unlike some of the other new Long Island producers, they are modestly financed. They don't even have their own winery, though they plan to install one in a renovated barn. Perhaps this is a blessing, as they will be less burdened by grand ambitions of matching Bordeaux or making expensive cult wines and more intent on finding out what the North Fork does best. 
 By comparison, our No. 3 wine, a 2001 Raphael cabernet franc, comes from a fairly new winery with lots of resources. Clearly, this was an ambitious wine, with both more tannins and more intensity than many of the others. It was a cabernet franc that aimed more for St.-Emilion than Chinon, yet it was balanced as well. Raphael, by the way, feels its best wines are merlots. So does Lenz Winery. But we decided to taste what we found in the stores, so neither the Raphael cabernet franc nor the '99 Lenz cabernet sauvignon represent what the wineries consider their best wines. We all liked the earthy fruit flavors of the Lenz, but having tasted the Lenz merlots on other occasions, I agree that they are more interesting wines.
 Among our other favorites were a 2000 merlot from Wolffer Estate in the Hamptons area on the South Fork, a fruity wine that offers well-etched flavors but not much structure, and a 2002 cabernet from Rivendell Winery, a Hudson Valley producer that brings in grapes from the North Fork.
 Incidentally, the consensus on Long Island is that 2001 was an excellent vintage, 2002 above average and 2003 not so good. Hopes are high for 2004, but those reds may not be released for a few years.
 In the past Long Island wineries have struggled with pricing. The $42 that we paid for the Raphael could no doubt buy two bottles of wine just as good. For consumers it is hard to justify paying so much for wines without a track record. 
 Then again, ambitious new California wineries don't think twice about charging $80 a bottle for their first vintage, and somebody is buying those wines. Long Island wineries like Raphael, which have made a tremendous investment in an area that is not cheap, must hope they can exploit that market, too, if they want to recoup their spending. But four wines in our Top 10 were $20 or under, and I can't help feeling that's a better idea.

HEADLINE: A Side Order of Human Rights

BYLINE: By Eric Schlosser. 
Eric Schlosser is the author of ''Fast Food Nation'' and ''Reefer Madness.''

DATELINE: Monterey, Calif. 

 BODY:
AND now a word of good news from the world of fast food.
 Last month, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a group that represents farm workers in southern Florida, announced that it was ending a four-year boycott of Taco Bell. The most remarkable thing about the announcement was the reason behind it: Taco Bell had acceded to all of the coalition's demands. At a time of declining union membership, failed organizing drives and public apathy about poverty, a group of immigrant tomato pickers had persuaded an enormous fast food company -- Yum Brands, which in addition to Taco Bell owns KFC, Pizza Hut, A&W All American Food Restaurants and Long John Silver's -- to increase the wages of migrant workers and impose a tough code of conduct on Florida tomato suppliers. ''Human rights are universal,'' said Jonathan Blum, a senior vice president of Yum, adding that under Taco Bell's new labor rules ''indentured servitude by suppliers is strictly forbidden.'' 
 The need for a corporate edict against slavery in the United States reveals just how bad things have become for farm workers. But it also suggests that the fast food companies now sitting atop America's food system can prevent the sort of abuses that state and federal officials seem unwilling to address. 
 Migrant farm workers have long been the nation's poorest group of workers. Although wages and working conditions greatly improved during the 1970's, thanks to the efforts of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, the rise of illegal immigration and anti-union sentiment later eroded those gains. In California, where more than half of America's fruits and vegetables are grown (and mainly picked by hand), the hourly wages of some farm workers adjusted for inflation have fallen by more than 50 percent since 1980. 
 Today the majority of America's farm workers are illegal immigrants. They often live in run-down trailers, sheds, garages and motels, where a dozen or so may share a room. Their status as black market labor makes them fearful of being deported, wary of union organizers and vulnerable to exploitation. The typical migrant farm worker is a young Mexican male who earns less than $8,000 a year. 
 The working conditions in the fields of Florida are especially bad. According to a recent study by the Urban Institute, perhaps 80 percent of the migrants in Florida are illegal immigrants. They are usually employed by labor contractors, who charge them for food, housing, transportation -- and, on occasion, smuggling fees. These charges are often deducted from workers' paychecks, trapping migrants in debt. Since 1996, six cases of involuntary servitude have resulted in convictions in Florida; many others have probably gone undetected. In one of these cases, hundreds of farm workers were held captive by labor contractors based in La Belle and Immokalee, Fla., forced to work without pay and warned that their tongues would be cut off if they tried to escape. The Florida legislature has done little to help migrants. Agriculture is the state's second-largest industry, after tourism, and many legislators have close ties with leading growers. 
 The Coalition of Immokalee Workers is one of the few organizations willing to fight for migrant workers in Florida. Founded in 1996 and based in the town of Immokalee, amid lush tomato fields and citrus groves, the group helped the United States Justice Department gain convictions in five of the six slavery cases. During the late 1990's members of the coalition learned that Taco Bell was a major purchaser of tomatoes grown in Immokalee, where the wages of migrants (adjusted for inflation) had fallen by as much as 60 percent during the previous two decades. The coalition asked the fast food chain to pressure its Florida suppliers, seeking a wage increase and guarantees that human rights would be respected. When Taco Bell failed to respond, the coalition started a nationwide boycott in April 2001, focusing its efforts at high schools and college campuses. ''Boot the Bell!'' was the rallying cry, as students tried to close Taco Bells and block the opening of new ones.
 At first Taco Bell tried to ignore the protests and to deny responsibility for the behavior of its suppliers. ''We don't believe it's our place to get involved in another company's labor dispute,'' Jonathan Blum, the Yum Brands executive, said in an interview with The New Yorker. Asked about the possible link between slavery in Florida and Taco Bell's food, Mr. Blum replied, ''It's heinous, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.'' The company's attitude gradually changed as the boycott gained support not only from students, but also from the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the National Council of Churches, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights and former President Jimmy Carter, among others. (Disclosure: I supported the boycott, too, and spoke out on behalf of the coalition.) 
 With coalition members conducting hunger strikes and staging demonstrations in front of Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, Calif., it seemed increasingly unwise for the nation's leading purveyor of Mexican food to be publicly linked with the exploitation of poor Mexicans. And the coalition's wage demand was by no means outrageous. It was asking for a pay raise of one penny for every pound of tomatoes picked -- the first major wage increase in Immokalee since the late 1970's. 
 As part of the agreement with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers last month, Taco Bell vowed to help ''improve working and pay conditions for farm workers in the Florida tomato fields.'' It promised to give the penny per pound increase to its Florida suppliers, so that migrant wages could be raised by that amount. It invited the coalition to monitor the new labor policies. And it said it would reward those suppliers that treat farm workers well. The penny-per-pound supplement will nearly double the wages of migrants picking tomatoes for Taco Bell. And though there is some debate about the final cost to Yum Brands, the figure will most likely be a few hundred thousand dollars a year -- not a huge sum for a fast food company with annual sales of about $9 billion worldwide.
 Over the past few years the fast food industry has introduced healthier foods in response to consumer demands. It has adopted tough animal welfare policies in the wake of criticism from animal rights activists. The Taco Bell agreement demonstrates, for the first time, an industry commitment to farm workers' rights in the United States. Only a small number of tomato pickers will enjoy a wage increase as a result of the Taco Bell deal, but it's a step on the right path. 
 And what's the next step? Although farmers are often demonized in reports about migrant labor, it's important to point out that they are under tremendous pressure from the leading fast food chains to reduce costs. Food-service companies now purchase the majority of fresh produce in the United States -- and farmers often believe that cutting wages is necessary to cut prices for their largest customers. Meaningful change, therefore, will have to come from the top. 
 McDonald's seems an obvious target for the next boycott. It is one of the nation's leading purchasers of lettuce, tomatoes, apples and pickled cucumbers. It is far and away the industry giant. The failure of government to protect the weakest and most impoverished workers in the United States has left the job to corporations and consumers. Taco Bell deserves credit for acknowledging its responsibility on this issue. Now McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Yum's other brands need to do the same.

HEADLINE: Canada and Automakers Agree to Emissions Reductions

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, April 5 

 BODY:
The Canadian government and nearly all the world's major automakers reached an agreement Tuesday under which the companies would voluntarily reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of their vehicles.
 Under the agreement, the vehicle makers committed themselves to cutting a variety of emissions by 5.3 million metric tons by the end of 2010. The plan sets targets staggered over five years and requires regular reviews by a group of government and industry representatives. 
 How much cleaner the air may become as a result of the pact was unclear. John Bennett, a senior policy adviser for the Sierra Club of Canada, estimated that the new standards would be equivalent to an overall fuel efficiency improvement of 25 percent from current levels.
 R. John Efford, the Canadian minister of natural resources, said Canada was able to come to terms with the industry through negotiation rather than legislation. He suggested that approach could be a model for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California.
 ''I should say to Arnold that I've envied him for some time,'' Mr. Efford said in a phone interview, referring to Governor Schwarzenegger's yacht and film career. ''Now he should envy me. Our accomplishment in reducing greenhouse gas emissions starts with the signing.''
 Environmentalists here and in the United States said the Canadian pact may undercut an auto industry lawsuit against California's greenhouse gas emission reduction program. 
 ''The same automakers who are suing California over its clean car standards are agreeing to essentially the same level of reductions in Canada,'' said Jason Mark, the clean vehicles director for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Berkeley, Calif. 
 Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, part of the state's Environmental Protection Agency, welcomed the Canadian agreement.
 ''In California, we are just asking the car industry to do what they can do elsewhere in the world,'' he said from Sacramento.
 The auto markets in Canada and California are roughly the same size. Mr. Bennett of the Sierra Club of Canada said that the two programs have roughly the same overall targets, though Canada's will be achieved more quickly.
 ''The automakers are going to have a heck of a time saying that what California wants is impossible,'' Mr. Bennett said.
 The Alliance of Automotive Manufacturers, an American trade group that includes many of the 19 companies that signed the agreement in Canada, is leading the lawsuit against California. 
 The carmakers assert that California's emission rules effectively impose fuel-economy regulations, an area under federal control. Thus, the Canadian pact has no bearing on the case in California, said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the group in Washington.
 The Canadian agreement does not specify how the automakers must meet their targets, nor does it require emissions reduction on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. As a result, Mr. Bennett said, a carmaker may continue to sell gas guzzlers, offsetting their emissions by selling more low-emission hybrids.
 Mark A. Nantais, the president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said most companies would make gradual changes rather than introduce drastic new technologies.
 While many environmental groups in Canada and the United States praised the agreement, not all were impressed.
 Matthew Bramley, the director of climate change at the Pembina Institute of Appropriate Development, said the agreement appeared to contain loopholes that would permit automakers to increase sales of inefficient light trucks without penalty. He was also concerned that the program was voluntary.
 Mr. Efford added, however, that Canada was not abandoning its right to introduce regulations if the voluntary approach fails.

HEADLINE: Feed the Beast

BYLINE: By Bruce Bartlett. 
Bruce Bartlett is a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis.

DATELINE: Great Falls, Va. 

 BODY:
GROWING numbers of policy analysts and politicians are saying that it may finally be time to consider a value-added tax as part of our federal revenue system. In years past, I would have been in the forefront of those denouncing the idea. But now, reluctantly, I have joined the pro-V.A.T. side. Here's why.
 There are many arguments against a value-added tax, which is essentially a sales tax that applies at each stage of production. It is costly to put into effect, and it hits the poor and the elderly hardest because they spend a higher percentage of their income. 
 When the idea of a value-added tax for the United States first arose during the Nixon administration, there was no question that it would have fueled the growth of government, just as it did in Europe. As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial pointed out, in the countries that established a V.A.T. in the 1960's and early 1970's, taxes as a share of the gross domestic product have risen significantly.
 But the main reason for this is that it was too easy to raise V.A.T. rates amid the double-digit price increases of the inflationary 1970's. In those days, there were many economists who still believed that budget deficits caused inflation, making it easier to delude people into thinking that higher taxes were necessary to get inflation under control. 
 Those countries that adopted the value-added tax since the end of the great inflation, however, have been very restrained in raising rates. Of those countries that had a V.A.T. before 1974, all have raised their rates by an average of seven percentage points. But of those countries that established a V.A.T. since 1974, the average increase is just one percentage point, and a majority have not increased their rates at all. 
 In the 1980's and 1990's, I thought it was possible to restrain the growth of government by cutting taxes. This would ''starve the beast,'' as Ronald Reagan used to say, and force government to live on its allowance. And after Republicans got control of Congress in 1994, I thought the means had finally come to make a frontal assault on the welfare state.
 I have been sadly disappointed. After an initial effort at restraining Medicare spending -- squelched by President Bill Clinton's veto pen -- Republicans in Congress have become almost indistinguishable from Democrats on spending. They have been aided and abetted by President Bush, who not only refuses to veto anything, but also aggressively worked to ram a $23.5 trillion (of which $18.2 trillion must be covered by the general revenue) expansion of Medicare down the throats of the few small government conservatives left in the House.
 This behavior has led me and other conservatives to conclude that starving the beast simply doesn't work anymore. Deficits are no longer a barrier to greater government spending. And with the baby-boom generation aging, spending is set to explode in coming years even if no new government programs are enacted.
 As Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the House Budget Committee on March 2, ''The combination of an aging population and the soaring costs of its medical care is certain to place enormous demands on our nation's resources and to exert pressure on the budget that economic growth alone is unlikely to eliminate.''
 Yet many conservatives continue to delude themselves that all we have to do is cut foreign aid and get rid of pork barrel projects to rein in the budget. But unless health spending is confronted head on, even the most draconian cuts in discretionary spending won't be enough to restore fiscal balance.
 I am no deficit hawk. For decades I have argued that the negative effects of deficits are generally exaggerated. But unless spending is checked or revenue raised, we are facing deficits of historic proportions. It is simply unrealistic to think we can finance a 50 percent increase in spending as a share of gross domestic product -- which is what is in the pipeline -- just by running ever-larger deficits. Sooner or later, that bubble is going to burst and there will be overwhelming political support for deficit reduction, as there was in the 1980's and early 1990's.
 When that day comes, huge tax increases are inevitable because no one has the guts to seriously cut health spending. Therefore, the only question is how will the revenue be raised: in a smart way that preserves incentives and reduces growth as little as possible, or stupidly by raising marginal tax rates and making everything bad in our tax code worse?
 If the first route is chosen, the value-added tax is by far the best option available to deal with an unpalatable situation. Absent any evidence that the White House and Congress are prepared to restrain out-of-control health spending, I see no alternative.

HEADLINE: Official Cites Tax Abuses With Charities

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Charities of all types are wittingly and unwittingly being used in tax shelter schemes that cost the government billions of dollars in lost revenue, the tax commissioner, Mark W. Everson, said on Tuesday in a Senate hearing.
 ''There are increasing indications that the twin cancers of technical manipulation and outright abuse that we saw develop in the profit-making segments of the economy are now spreading to pockets of the nonprofit sector,'' he said.
 Mr. Everson estimated that $15 billion to $18 billion of the more than $300 billion in unpaid taxes from 2001 the Internal Revenue Service reported last week was related to tax-exempt organizations, some of which are charities. 
 The commissioner spoke at a hearing on charitable reform before the Senate Finance Committee, which has been looking into issues like tax abuse and the nuts-and-bolts of charity governance.
 Regulators have found cases where taxpayers have claimed big deductions based on inflated valuations of donated property, clothing and other items. They have identified people who have claimed deductions for donations that never reached charities. They have also found charities using the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds to underwrite thriving for-profit businesses, as well as for-profit businesses using affiliated nonprofit organizations to lower their tax burdens.
 ''More and more of the taxed economic activities in this country will end up in this area'' unless action is taken, Mr. Everson said.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Finance Committee and who has been pushing efforts to tighten government oversight of charities, said, ''Congress, the administration and the charitable sector itself are all obliged to make certain these tax preferences are used as intended.''
 Several committee members, however, seemed less convinced of the need for better policing of the nonprofit sector. ''I am concerned that Congress may inhibit charities' ability to do their missions if we impose unreasonable strictures,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia.
 Other committee members expressed concerns that proposals for change, like limiting deductions for non-monetary gifts and requiring audits for some organizations, would reduce charitable giving and be a burden to smaller charities.
 Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, and other senators suggested that better enforcement by the I.R.S. might be more effective in curbing charitable abuse than new laws and regulation.
 Mr. Everson said he had asked Congress for an additional $14.5 million next year to underwrite the operations of the I.R.S. division that oversees charities, pointing out that last year he got only a fraction of the money he sought for that purpose. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 12, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a Senate Finance Committee hearing on charitable reform misstated the amount of unpaid 2001 income tax that Tax Commissioner Mark W. Everson said was related to tax-exempt organizations. He said that $15 billion to $18 billion of unpaid income taxes was attributable to deductions, and that some -- but not all -- of that amount was related to charitable contributions.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Expects High Price To Lead to More Fuel Supplies

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Tuesday that oil and natural gas markets were under the heaviest strain in a generation and suggested that prices might remain high for some time.
 But Mr. Greenspan was optimistic about the long-run outlook for energy supplies, and he warned against efforts to ''distort'' or ''stifle'' prices set in global markets. 
 Mr. Greenspan was silent about the potential impact of higher oil prices on inflation or economic growth, or on the central bank's monetary policy.
 ''Markets for oil and natural gas have been subject to a degree of strain over the past year not experienced for a generation,'' he said in a speech beamed by satellite to petrochemical executives in Texas. 
 Noting that investment in new production capacity has lagged the growth in demand for oil, particularly from China, Mr. Greenspan said much of the ''slack'' in world energy markets had disappeared.
 ''For years, long-term prospects for oil and gas prices appeared benign,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''The recent shift in expectations, however, has been substantial enough and persistent enough to bias business investment decisions in favor of energy cost reduction.'' 
 Though Mr. Greenspan conceded that higher oil prices had caused only a ''modest'' reduction in demand so far, he predicted that higher prices over the long run would lead to higher investment in extraction technologies, exploration and unconventional sources of energy like methane gas frozen in Arctic ice.
 Investors had little reaction to the Fed chairman's remarks, which some analysts interpreted as fairly sanguine.
 Prices of crude oil hit a record of $58.28 a barrel on Monday, but receded to $56.04 on Tuesday.
 Higher oil prices tend to slow domestic economic growth, because they pinch consumer spending on goods and services produced in the United States. But they also push up inflation.
 Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials have argued in recent years that higher prices have relatively little effect on the underlying inflation rate and that they pose less threat to growth than in the 1970's and 1980's because energy has become a smaller part of the total economy.
 But Fed officials have stepped up their warnings about inflation in the last month. The central bank warned after its last policy meeting, on March 22, that inflation pressures had increased, even though inflation expectations were still ''well contained.''
 The central bank also said it saw little evidence that higher energy prices had led to higher prices in the rest of the economy, but it noted that companies had more ''pricing power'' than before.
 Mr. Greenspan studiously avoided any comment about the macroeconomic implications of current energy prices. 
 Instead, he focused on the issues that appear to be driving prices at the moment. 
 He noted that demand for oil had climbed sharply but speculated that prices had also been driven higher by concerns about the shortfalls of investment in both crude oil production and refineries.
 Natural gas prices have been kept high in the United States, he said, largely because of the limited infrastructure for importing natural gas from overseas. Gas prices, he said, have been ''notably higher'' in the United States than in other parts of the world.
 In the long run, he said, higher energy prices should lead to higher production of oil and natural gas as well as new sources of energy.
 ''We must remember that the same price signals that are so critical for balancing energy supply and demand in the short run also signal profit opportunities for long-term supply expansion,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In New York Mayoral Campaign, It Seems You Are What You Rent

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
If money is everything in politics, and real estate is everything in New York City, the four top Democratic contenders for mayor have a long way to go -- think railroad flat to penthouse with a park view -- if they hope to unseat Michael R. Bloomberg this fall.
 The mayor, a billionaire who spent $72 million on the 2001 campaign and is financing his re-election bid, is setting a high bar: paying $55,000 a month for 19,000 square feet just off Bryant Park for his campaign headquarters. The offices have a corporate sheen, with new flat-screen televisions and views of Midtown skyscrapers, but a campaign spokesman, Stu Loeser, warns against the image of a King Mike in his 19th-floor aerie.
 ''It's not down-market, but it's certainly not opulent,'' Mr. Loeser said. 
 Maybe not, but the Democrats are typically spending roughly a tenth of that on rent for digs that vary widely. C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, is running her campaign out of the basement of a brownstone on West 126th Street, where, her top consultant says, ''We have a front room, a back room, a bathroom, and a place to collect all the checks.'' 
 Council Speaker Gifford Miller and United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner are down by City Hall, renting 2,700 and 2,200 square feet respectively. Mr. Miller is paying $6,400, or about 50 percent more than Mr. Weiner's $3,950, for a Nassau Street address that is about two blocks closer to the mayor's office. The views are obstructed.
 Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic candidate who is leading in the polls, has the most advantageous rent deal of the quartet. Unlike his rivals, Mr. Ferrer did not have to put down a security deposit for his 3,300-square-foot headquarters at 14 East 38th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Nor was his campaign asked to pay the rent of $5,225 a month until six weeks after the mid-February move-in.
 The Ferrer lease is with a real estate company of the Schur family, who are major contributors to his campaign, giving $44,550 for this race. An official in the Ferrer campaign said the company did not require a deposit because the Schurs knew that Mr. Ferrer, of the Bronx, was good for the money. But some election lawyers said that the previously undisclosed absence of a deposit could be somewhat outside the city's campaign finance rules, a charge that the campaign rejects.
 Political headquarters are often windows into the strategies, needs and personalities of the campaigns and the candidates themselves. The Harlem brownstone is one sign that, for better or worse, Ms. Fields is husbanding resources as much as possible, putting off a larger headquarters and the hiring of costly staff members like a campaign manager and press secretary. And the office is in a supportive neighborhood, as she is counting on strong backing from black voters.
 Mr. Ferrer, meanwhile, is relying on donors who have always been there for him and is forgoing the symbolism of large offices with an upscale address that might befit a Democratic front-runner.
 ''If the minority candidates had headquarters that reeked of wealth, it will vitiate their claim that they represent 'the other,''' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a professor of political science at Columbia University. ''That isn't an issue for Bloomberg; it would be disingenuous of him to have his office in Washington Heights.''
 Yet it would be folly to read too much into their rental leases: a Quinnipiac University poll released last week showed that in the last month, support for Ms. Fields rose to 21 percent from 14 percent, while Mr. Ferrer's support fell to 36 percent from 40 percent. Even in New York, real estate may not be everything.
 ''If a campaign is operating smart, it's operating lean, so I'm not rushing to hire big-name consultants or get fancy office space,'' said Joseph Mercurio, the Fields campaign's top consultant, whose company has earned $114,500 in fees from her since 2003. He said that brokers were looking for a possible headquarters in Midtown.
 Saving money on rent, while ideal, is only one side of the coin: political and psychological factors can come into play, too. In 2004, John F. Kerry ran his presidential campaign from formal-looking, if cramped, offices in Washington that included elevators and back entrances to whisk in advisers for secret meetings when the news media was camped out front. Four years earlier, Al Gore decamped from Washington and went back to Tennessee, to add a down-home feel to his operation.
 Headquarters can also become matters of controversy. During the city's last mayoral election, in 2001, the campaign of the Democrat Alan Hevesi drew fire from some rivals because so much campaign work was done at consultants' offices.
 Mr. Ferrer's current lease, with its lack of a deposit, prompted some questions this week. The Bloomberg, Gifford and Weiner campaigns have paid security deposits (with the mayor's totaling $55,239), while Ms. Fields is paying for space in her campaign treasurer's brownstone.
 Leo Glickman, a Democratic campaign finance lawyer not affiliated with any campaign, said yesterday that it was ''highly unusual'' for a campaign to sign a lease for Manhattan office space and not have to pay customary fees like a security deposit. The fact that the realty company is owned by major donors suggests that the absent deposit is an in-kind contribution.
 ''Boy oh boy, if I could get my hands on office space without putting down any deposit at all, I would leap on that,'' Mr. Glickman said. ''No matter who the candidate is, the campaign may still run out of money, and an arm's-length transaction would have a landlord wanting a security deposit up front.''
 The Ferrer campaign, in its most recent filings last month, did not list the lack of a deposit as an in-kind contribution. Chad Clanton, a spokesman, said that it was not, and that it was not unusual to have a short-term lease without a deposit.
 ''People know that the Ferrer campaign pays its bills and meets its financial obligations,'' Mr. Clanton said. He added that the six-week period without an initial rent payment was based on the real estate company's bookkeeping practices.
 A spokeswoman for the city's Campaign Finance Board said that all financial transactions must be reported in campaign finance filings. She said the absence of a deposit would be reviewed as part of the board's standard audit of all candidates' office leases and other financial materials.
 Mr. Clanton also noted that the Ferrer campaign's headquarters were modest compared with the mayor's, which are nearly six times their size.
 ''This race is like Seabiscuit against War Admiral,'' he said, referring to the racehorses of old. ''We understand that like War Admiral, the Bloomberg campaign will have all the advantages that the well-connected elites enjoy.''
 Asked if Mr. Ferrer's ties to the Schurs were not a pretty good connection too, Mr. Clanton said: ''This is a self-funded billionaire mayor who will spend at least $100 million on this campaign. That's not us.''

HEADLINE: Europe to Issue Guide on Textile Imports

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 5 

 BODY:
Unlike the United States, the European Union is not yet considering action to stem the surge in textile imports from China that followed the end of quotas last year, a European trade official said on Tuesday. 
 Instead, the European Commission, which takes the lead on international trade issues for all 25 countries in the union, will complete a set of guidelines on Wednesday to determine when and how to step in. The guidelines would set parameters, possibly on market share or unit volume, that could ultimately set off safeguards. 
 ''The guidelines are not a step towards introducing curbs on Chinese imports,'' an adviser to Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, said Tuesday. ''It's important to be ready to react in a timely, measured way. That's what the guidelines are for.'' The adviser declined to be identified, citing commission policy.
 Mr. Mandelson is expected to propose extending the period of time needed to assess the surge in imports. At present, the European Union could impose sanctions on imports using one or two months of data.
 Senior Chinese officials will meet with Mr. Mandelson on Friday to discuss, among other things, the distortion in textile trade.
 Imports of Chinese tights and pantyhose into the European Union skyrocketed 1,940 percent by value in January and February, compared with a year earlier, according to Euratex, the European textile industry association. The value of imports of pullovers and jerseys from China increased 893 percent, while imports of trousers more than tripled, Euratex said.
 The United States has experienced a similar surge in clothing imports from China since the quotas ended, but its reaction has been stronger. On Monday, the Commerce Department said it would begin an investigation into the need to reimpose quotas on a wide variety of Chinese apparel, and Carlos M. Gutierrez, the commerce secretary, promised to ''work to ensure that American manufacturers and workers compete on a level playing field.''
 In contrast, Europe's trade officials appear to be taking a stance some distance from the interests of the European textile industry.
 ''There are striking rises in imports of some categories of goods, but other categories, such as women's blouses, have fallen,'' the European trade official said.
 Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the United States may ultimately have to take a guideline approach. ''If there are no general guidelines, you'll have a lot of individual casework to do,'' he said. ''America will probably go down the same route as Europe.'' 
 He added, however, that setting guidelines carried a risk of reviving protectionism. For instance, the guidelines could set off safeguards in cases where no local producer was complaining, he said. 
 Europe's textile association viewed the tide of Chinese goods with more urgency than the European Union did. ''There has been an explosion in imports from China,'' said Francesco Marchi, the head of economic affairs for Euratex. Euratex urged Mr. Mandelson last month to impose safeguards to stem the surge of imports from China, but Mr. Mandelson declined.
 Mr. Marchi said the United States was reacting to the problem of Chinese textile exports ''more proactively than Europe,'' but said he would reserve judgment of the European reaction until he sees the guidelines.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart's Chief Calls Its Critics Unrealistic

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., April 5 

 BODY:
The chief executive of Wal-Mart took the offensive on Tuesday against critics who have sought to block stores in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, insisting that the company was good for consumers and good for its 1.3 million American employees.
 In a feisty response to critics who accuse Wal-Mart of providing poverty-level wages and few benefits, the executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., said Wal-Mart offered good, stable jobs, noting that when it opens a store, more than 3,000 people often apply for the 300 jobs.
 ''It doesn't make sense,'' Mr. Scott said, ''that people would line up for jobs that are worse than they could get elsewhere, with fewer benefits and less opportunity.'' 
 After pointing to headlines on editorial pages that say ''Wal-Mart's low prices come at too high a cost,'' Mr. Scott said, ''I'd suggest a better headline, 'Wal-Mart is great for America.'''
 He was speaking at Wal-Mart's first-ever conference for journalists, which was scheduled as the company, the world's largest retailer, faces stiff resistance to its expansion plans in several cities and as labor unions, environmental groups and others are preparing a major campaign to pressure the retailer to change its ways. 
 Critics complain that Wal-Mart's average wage of $9.68 an hour is too low to support a family and that only half of its workers receive health insurance from the company. 
 An hour before the conference, several officials and ministers from Inglewood, Calif., where residents voted down a planned Wal-Mart last year, held a news conference here. They said that if Wal-Mart ever hoped to build a store in Inglewood, it needed to sign a pledge in which it promised to provide a living wage and better health benefits.
 A state assemblyman from Inglewood, Jerome Horton, said, ''We're very much concerned about Wal-Mart's business practices because they place a burden on California taxpayers when they don't provide health insurance to employees and when they pay wages that perpetuate poverty in the community.'' 
 Mr. Scott opened his remarks by noting that some critics who opposed Wal-Marts in New Orleans and Cincinnati are praising the stores now that they have opened. ''They're thrilled when we open up in their neighborhoods because they know that they'll have a better chance of participating more fully in the economy with the money they save at our stores,'' he said. Mike Duke, the president of Wal-Mart Stores, said the company continued to have ambitious expansion plans, hoping to open about 350 stores in the United States this year, on top of the 3,703 it already has. 
 Wal-Mart executives said an 8 percent expansion in floor space was pivotal to plans to increase sales and profits. Its revenue rose 11 percent last year to $288 billion, while its profit rose 16 percent, to $10.3 billion.
 But its expansion efforts have increasingly been frustrated. In February, a developer planning a Wal-Mart in Rego Park, Queens, dropped the effort in the face of opposition; stores planned for Cleveland and the South Side of Chicago have also been blocked recently. 
 Mr. Scott said the company had had good talks with its environmental critics, who were concerned that new stores could fuel suburban sprawl. But he had few kind words for the company's main labor adversary, the United Food and Commercial Workers, saying that its members wanted to block Wal-Mart to help protect their jobs and wages, even if it meant that consumers pay higher prices.
 Mr. Scott objected to assertions that Wal-Mart could afford to pay its workers far more, saying the company has a thin profit margin and annual profit of $6,000 an employee, compared with $143,000 at Microsoft.
 ''Some well-meaning critics contend that Wal-Mart should be setting the pace for wages and benefits for the entire economy, just as a unionized General Motors was said to have done in the postwar period, helping usher in the great American middle class that this country is so proud of and rightfully so,'' he said. ''The facts are that retailing doesn't perform that same function in the economy as G.M. does or did. Retailing has never occupied the top tier of wages in this country, or in any country.''
 Paul Blank, the Wal-Mart campaign director for the United Food and Commercial Workers, whose members often are paid $12 to $18 an hour, said Wal-Mart was leading a race to the bottom for workers.
 ''A lot of communities are concerned about how Wal-Mart treats its workers,'' Mr. Blank said. ''We're trying to stop Wal-Mart's expansion where they're not wanted.''
 Mr. Scott said Wal-Mart's adversaries were being unrealistic in pressing the company to spend more on wages and benefits. He said that this could erase Wal-Mart's profit or force it to raise prices, enabling less efficient rivals to thrive.

A Win for Wal-Mart
 BENNINGTON, Vt., April 5 (AP) -- An attempt to halt the expansion of a Wal-Mart store in Bennington failed on Tuesday when the retailer won a vote on whether to cap the size of retailers to 75,000 square feet. Voters rejected the cap by 2,189 to 1,724. Wal-Mart wants to increase its Bennington store to 112,000 square feet.
 The vote in Bennington, a town of 16,000 in the southwest corner of the state, was watched closely in Montpelier, where state lawmakers are considering a bill that would cap retailers at 50,000 square feet.

 BODY:
A Wall Street credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, raised its rating for New York City's general obligation bonds to A1, the highest rating Moody's has ever given the city's bonds, according to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's office. In a statement released on Monday, Moody's said the upgrade, from a rating of A2, was ''based upon the city's recovery from one of the most serious fiscal crises in decades, resulting from having made difficult budgetary and fiscal policy decisions.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Order Tire Sensors On New Cars

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
Federal regulators are set to make automakers equip all lightweight passenger vehicles with tire pressure monitors, concluding a fight over what technology to adopt.
 The regulation, which could be announced as soon as Thursday, will cover all cars and light trucks, including vans and sport utility vehicles. It is central to safety changes ordered by Congress that stemmed from problems with Firestone tires several years ago. 
 Underinflation is a serious safety hazard; the rollover crashes of Ford Explorer S.U.V.'s in the 1990's were attributed partly to tires that overheated and failed because of low pressure. Tires with insufficient air pressure also impair handling, hurt fuel economy and wear unevenly. 
 After legal and other delays, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require auto companies to install sensors that measure pressure on all four tires. A spokeswoman for the agency would not comment on the regulation, which will set a broad threshold for inflation pressure.
 If tires are underinflated by more than 25 percent, a dashboard light will warn motorists. But tiremakers and some safety groups oppose a single alert level because tires vary in size and thickness.
 A 25 percent drop in recommended pressure may leave some tires so underinflated that they cannot safely carry a fully loaded vehicle, manufacturers say.
 Underinflation can expose rubber and other materials to more heat, especially during hot weather, and create dangerous wear at the edges and sides of a tire.
 The government estimates that it will cost the industry between $800 million and $1.1 billion to phase in the technology on all new vehicles from this year through 2007.
 Automakers do not oppose the requirement because properly inflated tires can help create a smoother ride, improve fuel efficiency and reduce expensive tire maintenance and replacements. 
 Tire monitoring systems are already installed on 2 million to 4 million vehicles, mainly luxury vehicles. Most pressure monitoring systems use sensors that are tied into antilock brakes.
 In 2002, the safety agency proposed giving automakers the option of a direct monitoring system, which safety groups favor, and one that works with brakes, which is cheaper. But safety advocates successfully sued in federal court to force regulators to adopt the more stringent standard with a 25 percent pressure differential.

HEADLINE: Growth Pace Worldwide Is Expected To Slow in '05

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and KEITH BRADSHER; Edmund L. Andrews reported from Washington for this article and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund predicted on Wednesday that global economic growth would slow significantly in 2005, and they warned that the United States' ballooning trade imbalances could disrupt world markets if foreign investors stop buying American debt.
 ''Global expansion has become less balanced, with global growth continuing to be unduly dependent on the United States and China,'' said Rodrigo de Rato, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, in a speech at Georgetown University here.
 Warning against ''complacency,'' Mr. de Rato pointed to a number of ''downside risks'' that could catch investors by surprise. Those risks included higher oil prices, rising fears of inflation and, not the least, the United States' large and growing indebtedness to the rest of the world. 
 ''The demand for U.S. assets is not unlimited,'' Mr. de Rato warned, noting that bond markets were badly shaken last month by the mere hint that Asian central banks might begin to reduce their holdings of United States Treasury securities.
 ''A sharp reduction, or a reversal, of capital inflows could entail serious consequences for currency and capital markets,'' Mr. de Rato said.
 The United States trade deficit climbed to a record of $617 billion in 2004, nearly 6 percent of gross domestic product, and most analysts expect it to keep climbing because American economic growth is faster than that of Europe and Japan. America's current-account deficit, the broadest measure of trade and capital flows, soared to a record of $666 billion.
 In a separate report, the World Bank said that global growth had probably ''peaked'' at 3.8 percent last year and would probably slow to about 3.1 percent this year. Among the reasons, it said, were rising interest rates, high oil prices and less stimulative fiscal and monetary policies in many countries.
 The Asian Development Bank, a sister institution of the World Bank and the fund, predicted that the developing nations of Asia would continue to enjoy strong growth for the next three years and have largely put the financial crises of the late 1990's behind them. 
 Developing countries enjoyed rapid growth last year, and many benefited from low interest rates as global investors looked for places to earn higher returns. But the World Bank warned that developing countries were at risk from ''disorderly'' changes in exchange rates and unexpected surges in interest rates.
 The Asian bank's chief economist, Ifzal Ali, said that high oil prices, slowing demand in industrialized countries and avian influenza all posed risks to the bank's forecast. 
 But strong business investment and a quadrupling of central bank reserves in the region since the crisis have insulated countries from economic shocks, he said in releasing the bank's annual forecast at a news conference in Hong Kong.
 The economies of Asian developing countries expanded by 7.3 percent last year and can be expected to grow 6.5 percent this year, 6.6 percent next year and 6.9 percent in 2007, the bank said.
 Recent signs of economic weakness in the European Union and Japan, together with rising inflationary pressures and the likelihood of higher interest rates in the United States, could result in a sharp slowing in Asian exports of manufactured goods this year, Mr. Ali warned. But other sectors are doing well, he said, pointing to increased government spending on public works and strong investment by companies.
 Mr. Ali said that it would be desirable to see China rely more on market tools like a more flexible exchange rate or higher interest rates to manage its economy, but offered few specific recommendations. Its economy seems to be slowing this year after torrid growth over the last several years, he said. Still, the bank said it expected the Chinese economy would expand 8.5 percent this year after growth of 9.5 percent last year.
 Some of the biggest risks to Asia are the hardest to estimate, he cautioned, adding that ''what we have seen emerging with avian flu casts a huge shadow on the region.''

HEADLINE: Arabs Lift Their Voices 

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Thomas L. Friedman's documentary ''Does Europe Hate Us?'' will be shown on the Discovery Channel tonight at 8 and on the Discovery Times Channel on Monday at 9 p.m.

 BODY:
Until the recent elections in Iraq and among the Palestinians, the modern Arab world was largely immune to the winds of democracy that have blown everywhere else in the world. Why? That's a pretty important question. For years, though, it was avoided in both the East and the West. 
 In the West it was avoided because a toxic political correctness infected the academic field of Middle Eastern studies -- to such a degree that anyone focusing on the absence of freedom in the Arab world ran the risk of being labeled an ''Orientalist'' or an ''essentialist.'' It was also avoided because Western governments basically told Arab leaders that all they needed to do was keep their oil pumps open and their prices low and be nice to Israel. If they did all that, they could deny their own people the freedom America advocated everywhere else. 
 Meanwhile, the Arab peoples were told by their own leaders and state-owned intellectuals that democracy had to come later -- after the nationalist struggle against colonialism or the liberation of Palestine or the creation of an Islamic state.
 Well, the combination of 9/11, the Bush policies and the flattening of the world, whereby everyone can increasingly see how everyone else is living, changed all that -- as evidenced this week with the publication of the third Arab Human Development Report, written by a courageous group of Arab social scientists under the auspices of the United Nations Development Program. This is one of the finest U.N. products under Kofi Annan.
 The first report, in 2002, was about the poor state of Arab human development. The second, in 2003, was about the poor state of Arab education and science. The new one focuses on ''the acute deficit of freedom and good governance'' in the Arab world. It underscores how much Arab peoples crave, and need, freedom and good government -- as much any other people. With the great news that Iraqis are finally forming a new government, it couldn't appear at a better time.
 The report notes that most Arab states today resemble ''a 'black hole,' which converts its surrounding social environment into a setting in which nothing moves and from which nothing escapes.'' All political parties, institutions, courts, intelligence services, police and media are centralized in the hands of the Arab leader -- that's why the ''modern-day Arab state is frequently dubbed 'the intelligence state.''' What all these states have in common, the report says, ''is that power is concentrated at the tip of the executive pyramid and that the margin of freedom permitted (which can be swiftly reduced) has no effect on the state's firm and absolute grip on power.'' But without a majority of people behind them, all of these Arab regimes lack legitimacy.
 Arab societal structures tend to reinforce these autocratic trends, the report says: ''The family, the primary unit of Arab society, is based on clannism, which implants submission, and is considered the enemy of personal independence, intellectual daring and the flowering of a unique and authentic human entity. Once children enter school, they find an educational institution, curricula, teaching and evaluation methods which tend to rely on dictation and instill submissiveness. This learning environment does not open the doors to freedom of thought and criticism.'' 
 The chain constricting freedom, the report notes, ''completes its circle in the political realm, squeezing Arab public life into a small and constricted space. This complicated process has led Arab citizens, including some among the intelligentsia, to a state of submission fed by fear and marked by denial of their subjugation.''
 The report's authors conclude with their hope for a broad, peaceful redistribution of power in the Arab world, their fear that nothing will change -- which they predict could lead to ''chaotic upheavals'' -- and their expectation of some externally induced change and muddling through.
 But the important thing about this report is that political reform is now being put on the Arab agenda by Arabs. Yes, it's scathing about the Western and Israeli roles in retarding Arab democratization, but it's equally scathing about what Arabs have done to themselves and how they must change -- people don't change when you tell them they should, but when they tell themselves they must. Read this report and you'll also understand why part of every Arab hates the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- and why another part is praying that it succeeds.

HEADLINE: Low Costs Lure Foreigners to India for Medical Care

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, April 6 

 BODY:
Until recently, Robert Beeney, a 64-year-old real estate consultant from San Francisco, lived in pain. But when he finally decided to do something about the discomfort, he spurned all the usual choices.
 His doctors advised that he get his hip joint replaced, which his insurer would pay for, but after doing some research on the Internet, he decided to get a different procedure -- joint resurfacing -- not covered by his insurance. And instead of going to a nearby hospital, he chose to go to India and paid $6,600, a fraction of the $25,000 he would have paid at home for the surgery.
 This winter, Mr. Beeney flew to Hyderabad, in southern India, and had the surgery at Apollo Hospital by a specialist trained in London, Dr. Vijay Bose. Two weeks later, Mr. Beeney said that he was walking around the Taj Mahal ''just like any other tourist.'' 
 Mr. Beeney's story is becoming increasingly common, as Europeans and Americans, looking for world-class treatments at prices a fourth or fifth of what they would be at home, are traveling to India. Modern hospitals, skilled doctors and advanced treatments are helping foreigners overcome some of their qualms about getting medical treatments in India. Even as politicians and workers' groups are opposing the corporate practice of outsourcing, Mr. Beeney and patients like him are literally outsourcing themselves -- not only to India but also to Thailand, Singapore and other places -- for all kinds of medical services from cosmetic to critical surgeries. 
 About 150,000 foreigners visited India for medical treatments in the year ending in March 2004, the Confederation of Indian Industry, a leading industry group, said. That number was projected to rise by 15 percent each year for the next several years. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company, a management consultant based in New York, said foreign visitors would help Indian hospitals earn 100 billion rupees (about $2.3 billion) by 2012. 
 ''Health is an emotional issue; it's not like buying a toy or a shirt made abroad,'' said a health care analyst for McKinsey, Gautam Kumra, who is based in New Delhi. ''Nevertheless, you cannot deny the power of economics.'' 
 For some foreigners, like George Marshall, a 73-year-old violin restorer from Yorkshire, England, India's hospitals also offer speedier treatments. Last year, Mr. Marshall said that he started having trouble finishing a round of golf. An angiogram showed two blocked arteries in his heart. With the British National Health Service, Mr. Marshall would have had to wait three weeks to see a specialist, and six more months for coronary bypass surgery. ''At 73, I don't have the time to wait,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''Six months could be the rest of my life.'' Nor could he afford the $:20,000 ($38,000) for surgery at a private hospital.
 After an Internet search and a chance meeting with a businessman who had gone to India for surgery, Mr. Marshall traveled to the Wockhardt Hospital in Bangalore in southern India last winter. His surgeon, Vivek Jawali, had trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The men chatted about British politics and Dr. Jawali gave Mr. Marshall his cellphone number and said that he was available 24 hours. A surprised Mr. Marshall said that in the British health system, ''you are just a number, but here you are a person.'' Travel expenses included, the surgery cost him $:4,500 ($8,400). 
 While the number of patients from the West is still small in India, the trend is expected to grow as populations age and health costs balloon. In India, cardiac surgeries cost about one-fifth of what they would in the United States; orthopedic treatments cost about one-fourth as much and cataract surgeries are as low as one-tenth of their cost at American hospitals. 
 Mr. Kumra, the McKinsey health consultant who also advises the auto industry, noted that a corporation like General Motors spends $5 billion on health care annually. ''When you buy a G.M. car, you are helping G.M. fund $2,000 or $3,000 towards health care costs of retired workers,'' Mr. Kumra said. 
 To curb spending, corporations are being forced to look at creative low-cost solutions. For instance, radiologists working for Wipro, a software and information technology company based in Bangalore, analyze X-rays and scans from United States hospitals for a fraction of the cost. A diagnostics firm, SRL Ranbaxy, based in New Delhi, tests blood serum and tissue samples from British hospitals. Health specialists say that sending patients to India for treatment is not as unthinkable as it was 20 years ago.
 ''India is well-positioned to expand into this area of outsourcing,'' said John Lovelock, an analyst in Ontario on global industries for Gartner. ''India is equipped to provide long-term in-patient rehabilitation services, which are very labor intensive, require large facilities and are under serviced in North America,'' he said.
 In the last four years, the Apollo Hospital chain, which has 18 hospitals throughout Asia, has treated 43,000 foreigners, mainly from nations in southern Asia and the Persian Gulf. Last year, 7 percent of its 5 billion rupees ($114.9 million) in revenue came from medical services provided to foreigners. 
 Apollo's founder, Dr. Prathap C. Reddy, 73, a surgeon trained at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said that health care in India had drastically changed from the time he returned to open his first hospital in 1983. ''Then, all rich Indians rushed overseas for medical help,'' Dr. Reddy said. Now, he has 200 doctors on his staff who are qualified to work in the United States, and has many wealthy Indian expatriates as clients.
 Still, some hospitals in India are discovering that affordable costs and foreign-trained doctors may not be enough to make India a global health care destination. The country's dilapidated airports, garbage-strewn streets and overcrowded slums can put off even the hardiest foreigners. 
 ''Some foreign patients arrived at the airport and took the next flight back,'' said Dr. Reddy, who has been trying to persuade the local government in Chennai, formerly known as Madras, to clear a slum next to his hospital there. ''I can change the insides of my hospitals, but I cannot change the airports and roads,'' Dr. Reddy said,
 The challenge, said Harpal Singh, chairman of Fortis Healthcare, a chain of hospitals based in New Delhi, is to get the world to understand that India is a complex country. Acknowledging that foreigners might feel more at home having surgery in sleek hospitals in Singapore or Thailand, which are competing to woo them, Mr. Singh said, ''We have to project that India is capable of delivering first-rate as well as shoddy work.'' Fortis, part owned by the country's biggest drug firm, Ranbaxy Laboratories, has a chain of four hospitals in India and another six on the way. 
 Indian hospitals are also working to ensure that they meet international standards. The Indian Healthcare Federation, a group of 50 hospitals led by Dr. Reddy, is developing accreditation standards for hospitals.
 One doctor in India held up as first rate is Dr. Naresh Trehan, a cardiac surgeon based in New Delhi and the executive director of Escorts Heart Institute and Research Center. Dr. Trehan, 58, who studied cardiac surgery at the New York University School of Medicine and worked there for a decade, returned to India in 1988 to open his own cardiac hospital in New Delhi. The hospital now conducts 4,000 heart surgeries a year with 0.8 percent mortality rates and 0.3 percent infection rates, on par with the best of the world's hospitals. 
 Last October, Dr. Trehan performed surgery on Howard Staab, 53, an uninsured self-employed carpenter from Durham, N.C., to repair a leaking mitral heart valve. Mr. Staab paid $10,000 for his surgery, his round-trip fare to India and for a visit to the Taj Mahal. In the United States, his options included surgery costing $60,000 at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. 
 To take advantage of patients like Mr. Staab, Indian hospitals are expanding. In the Gurgaon suburbs of New Delhi, Dr. Trehan is building a $250 million multispecialty hospital modeled after the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. In the same neighborhood will be Fortis Healthcare's Medicity, a 43-acre hospital complex for foreign patients, which will have special immigration and travel counters and interpreters, with the idea of branding itself the Johns Hopkins Hospital of the East.
 ''We're gearing up, and the doors of Indian hospitals are wide open to the Western world,'' Dr. Trehan said.

HEADLINE: In Louisville, the World's a Stage for Soul-Searching, Anger and Anguish

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 3 

 BODY:
''So many topics, my head almost split open trying to choose,'' complains a character in Kia Corthron's ''Moot the Messenger,'' one of six full-length plays having their debuts at the 29th annual Humana Festival of New American Plays here.
 The cry could have served as an epigraph for the festival itself. Ms. Corthron's play was the most frantically issue-riddled of the lot, but almost all the works engaged meaty topics of immediate political and social currency. Accusations that the American theater has gently accepted its cultural irrelevance and withdrawn into an aesthetic neverland were once again belied by the raised voices on the stages of the Actors Theater of Louisville, the host of this efficiently run, always convivial festival.
 The lingering shadow of racism, the poisonous intermingling of media and politics, ecological blight and the activism it has inspired and the dubious uses of American power were among the many subjects addressed, directly or obliquely, in the new plays on view. The public soul-searching over the Terri Schiavo case found a coincidental echo in a play examining the anguish of parents tending to a child with severe cerebral palsy, while even that most heartwarming of domestic chores, the baking of a fruit pie, was accompanied by the steady drone of adolescent anger at the global imperatives of the United States. 
 But if the playwrights showing new works at the festival earned marks in the category of social significance, their grades in other, more artistically relevant subjects were middling at best. Admiration for their desire to inspire audience interest in tangled social and political issues mingled with disappointment at their inability to channel these concerns into potent theatrical forms.
 Ms. Corthron certainly led the class in terms of sheer number of hot-button issues addressed. ''Moot the Messenger,'' a sprawling drama about a young black woman's odyssey through the disillusioning maze of the news business, was essentially a bulging portmanteau stretched to fit Ms. Corthron's catalog of complaints about the last 20 years or so of American history.
 Factoid-packed and tirade-riddled, the director Marion McClinton's production careered awkwardly across the stage, despite an energetic performance from Tamilla Woodard in the central role of an idealistic reporter who moves from interning to embedded with disconcerting speed. 
 The Florida fracas from the 2000 elections and the abuses at Abu Ghraib are just the tip of the topical iceberg here, with everything from the genocide in Rwanda to Oliver L. North being dragged into a long, intellectually sloppy screed. Ms. Corthron's inflamed political sensitivity seems to have entirely subsumed her theatrical sense, and the resulting play is an unwieldy exercise in drive-by polemics.
 A similar blurry focus afflicts ''Hazard County,'' Allison Moore's drama about a Kentucky widow caught up in an ideological tug of war over the meaning of her husband's death. Based on an actual incident, the play depicts the aftermath of a racially tinged crime in which a young black man shot and killed a white man driving a car emblazoned with a Confederate flag. In Ms. Moore's retelling, various constituencies latched on to the crime for its unsavory resonance, seeking to manufacture political capital.
 Ms. Moore's larger goal is to examine how the cultural detritus left behind by the Confederate South -- celebrated by some, reviled by others -- continues to poison the social well. Television sets floating in the white-trash bog of Paul Owen's set design regularly blip into life, punctuating the drama with clips from and critiques of the good ol' boy series ''The Dukes of Hazzard.''
 Unfortunately, the central thread in the play is an implausibly drawn relationship between the widow and a glib reporter from Los Angeles with possibly nefarious motives. (How nefarious? He's an ex-reality show producer trying to go legit, at Fox News.) Ms. Moore, like Ms. Corthron, takes a dim view of the ethics of the broadcast branch of the media, but she too may be guilty of a desire to package complex matters in easy-to-digest formulas. 
 The focus was more concentrated on the domestic sphere in other plays at the festival that touched on issues of contemporary relevance. Both ''A Nervous Smile,'' by John Belluso, and ''The Shaker Chair,'' by Adam Bock, explored themes of personal responsibility that had broader cultural resonance.
 Mr. Belluso's play, set in a stylish Manhattan apartment decked out in modernist furniture, is a provocative if uneven drama about a couple driven to abandon their chronically ill daughter to pursue their separate dreams of personal happiness. Some sentimental and melodramatic flourishes aside, Mr. Belluso's writing is mostly honest, funny and compassionate, and the production's director, David Esbjornson, elicited fine work from his actors, notably Maureen Mueller, who brought a fine sense of dazed absence to the Vicodin-addicted mother, and Dale Soules as the young girl's Russian caretaker, who favors vodka.
 Mr. Belluso's decision to position his moral dilemma among the frightfully affluent was courageous, in its way -- he doesn't want the stark realities of the issue to be muddied by questions of economic necessity -- but it inevitably tipped the scales of sympathy firmly away from his characters. Without establishing the psychological cost of the parents' burden, it is difficult to see the characters as flawed, confused and desperate rather than monstrously self-absorbed.
 The ethics of self-absorption are in fact the central issue in Mr. Bock's ''Shaker Chair.'' ''Why is your circle of concern so small?'' one character, a militant environmentalist named Jean (Geraldine Librandi), asks of her timid neighbor Marion (Kathleen Butler). Marion lends a sympathetic ear to her sister Dolly's marital troubles but hesitates to join Jean and her allies in acts of sabotage on a local pig farm secreting toxins into a nearby river. She is gradually awakened to the call of social justice, and in the end vows to do something with her life.
 Likable in outline, Mr. Bock's warm, quirky comedy would be more effective if it were not written in a stagy, staccato style that threatened to enamel its characters in linguistic mannerism. The dialogue is awash in unfinished sentences and pointless repetitions that serve to extend scenes of minimal dramatic content to tedious lengths, a flaw that the production's director, Marc Masterson (who heads the Actors Theater of Louisville), was unable to mask, despite the energetic efforts of a largely engaging cast.
 Kathleen Tolan, the author of ''Memory House,'' takes a strictly naturalistic approach in her tale of two women in conflict over what both have made -- or will make -- of their lives. Ms. Tolan's play, which opens at Playwrights Horizons on May 17 in a separate production starring Dianne Wiest, unfolds in real time, an audacious, possibly foolhardy proposition when the real time is being spent in the presence of a sullen adolescent who has an hour or so to finish her college applications. 
 The play doesn't break new ground as it clambers across the rugged terrain of mother-daughter conflict, although global politics play a minor role. But Ms. Tolan and the production's fine performers (Cassandra Bissell and Taylor Miller) quietly illuminate the complex currents of feeling beneath the dialogue's plain-as-pie-crust surfaces.
 The one surefire crowd-pleaser at the festival, coincidentally or not, was the only play set in another era, Carlyle Brown's ''Pure Confidence.'' Drawn from a minor chapter in the history of horse racing, it tells the fact-based but fictional history of a black jockey named Simon Cato (Gavin Lawrence) in the Confederate South.
 Simon, a slave, has achieved a small measure of power over his destiny thanks to his prowess in the saddle. By threatening to hire himself out to another horse owner, he strikes a deal with Col. Wiley Johnson (William McNulty) to purchase his freedom and the freedom of Caroline (Kelly Taffe), the maid to Johnson's wife, Mattie (Jane Welch). But the Civil War erupts before Simon can earn his selling price.
 Mr. Brown's story is a naturally engrossing one, but the writing can be disappointingly slick and ingratiating. The early jousting between the cheery, smart-alecky Simon and the Colonel suggests that of friendly adversaries in a television sitcom. When Simon's wisecracking gives offense to a white man, the Colonel snaps with exasperation, ''Would you try to behave like a slave for just a few minutes?'' The audience roars. 
 Mr. Brown does take care to depict the mixed motives and moral flaws of the Colonel and his wife, but their slave-owning past is quickly atoned for after the war. The couple invite Simon and his wife to join them again down South. It is implied that they will do so, and this choice is presented as a quiet kind of victory. ''Well, Caroline, it seems to me that the only time you're ever really free is when you get a chance to choose,'' Simon says. '''Cause once you choose after that you bound to be a slave to something.''
 This metaphorical equation of slavery with the general drudgery of life could be construed as a commentary on the legacy of economic oppression that was a consequence of an ignominious chapter in American history. But in the context of Mr. Brown's soft-edged play -- and the affectionate response it earned from a largely white Louisville audience -- it doesn't come across that way. On the contrary, it almost seems to spread a coat of sugar over an abomination.

HEADLINE: Memorial for Kennan Recalls Drama of Cold War Tensions

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
George F. Kennan once remarked that there was nothing sadder than a Communist funeral in the Soviet Union, because it held out no hope or redemptive promise. 
 His own memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday was full of both, as Mr. Kennan's family, friends and fellow foreign policy experts gathered to remember the man whose thinking and writing helped steer the United States and Europe safely through the cold war. 
 Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell; Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the Carter administration; and James D. Wolfensohn, departing president of the World Bank, helped fill a front pew in tribute to the man who conceived the policy of containing the Soviet Union by any means short of war.
 Eulogists recalled Mr. Kennan, who died last month at 101, as a scholar, statesman, sailor, writer, woodworker and amateur farmer whose steely intellect was leavened by twinkling blue eyes and boundless curiosity.
 As spring sunshine streamed through the stained-glass windows, several hundred mourners prayed for Mr. Kennan, among the most influential American diplomats of his time, as one ''who in the day of decision ventured much for the liberties we now enjoy.'' 
 His eldest daughter, Grace Kennan Warnecke, said it seemed fitting that the service occurred just as President Viktor Yuschenko of Ukraine was addressing Congress, because ''our father's life was always intertwined with the Slavic world.''
 ''From early on,'' Ms. Warnecke said, ''I knew I had to share my father with his work,'' especially during the long absences his duties required. ''While I may have harbored a certain resentment at not having a stay-at-home dad, the plus side was that he brought the world to us.''
 Mr. Kennan's wife of 73 years, the former Annelise Sorensen, was unable to travel from their home in Princeton, N.J. But their son, Christopher, recalled the family's summer sailing expeditions from her native Norway to Denmark, with Mr. Kennan's navigating through the night on open sea just by dead reckoning. 
 ''Dad left us a lot to think about,'' he said.
 The younger Mr. Kennan and Blair Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute of Advanced Russian Studies here, confessed to being disappointed at Mr. Kennan's 1968 critique of the campus protest movement, ''Democracy and the Student Left.'' Mr. Ruble said that he had once told Mr. Kennan that it was the only one of his books he did not like and that Mr. Kennan ''struck the most intimidating pose imaginable'' and said, with the faintest hint of humor, ''I suggest that you reread it, now that you've grown up.''
 Mr. Wolfensohn paid tribute to the surpassing intellect of a man who wrote 22 books, won two Pulitzer Prizes and was for many years a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He spoke of his own frustration, and exhaustion, at staying up late into the night in search of the perfect quotation to summarize Mr. Kennan's career, only to be captivated in turn by one compelling passage after another.
 ''It's impossible to take a quote from George Kennan,'' he said. ''You just get trapped by his words.''
 Former President Bill Clinton, in a letter read to the congregation, summed up the tributes, calling Mr. Kennan a man ''who shaped the discourse and guided the policy of this country for more than 50 years'' and who ''left this world a better place than he found it.''

HEADLINE: If You Ask Small Business Owners, the Economy Is Improving

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Ted Farnsworth, founder and chief executive of XStream Beverage Network, has grand plans this year for his company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a maker of products like Yohimbe, an energy drink that sells for $2 a can. 
 He expects to add 40 workers to his staff of 67 and invest $200,000 in technology, and he projects an increase in revenue, to $30 million, from $9 million in 2004 and $3 million the year before.
 ''The recovery is picking up speed,'' Mr. Farnsworth said. ''I believe the economy is better than people think it is, especially here in South Florida.'' 
 If it is, then small and midsize companies like his are playing an important role. Though job creation in the United States has recently been weaker than expected, and higher oil prices and rising interest rates are raising red flags, the economy is continuing to expand strongly. 
 One reason is the growing optimism of small businesses, backed up by hiring and investment spending.
 In a survey released last month by American Express, 85 percent of 627 small-business owners and managers questioned said they saw growth opportunities in the next six months, up from 72 percent in a similar poll a year earlier and 56 percent in 2003. Fifty-seven percent said they expected their sales to outpace last year's, and 66 percent reported plans to make capital investments within six months, up from 59 percent in 2004.
 In another poll in February by SBTV.com, an online television network for small-business owners, 77.2 percent of those questioned said they planned to invest in new technology this year.
 ''During an economic cycle, small businesses are one of the principle drivers of a rebound, since they account for a large portion of hiring and increasingly, a larger portion of total business investments,'' said Mat Johnson, an economist for the investment bank ThinkEquity Partners in San Francisco. 
 To a large extent, he said, that is because they are nimbler than larger firms, which have huge inventory management concerns and layers of managers, making it harder for them to react to trends in the marketplace. In addition, he said, because they are often suppliers of goods and services to big corporations, they are the first to enjoy an upsurge in orders.
 Kevin Greaney, chief executive and co-founder of Children's Progress, a New York educational-testing company, says he plans to spend $1 million this year for technology and infrastructure, twice last year's outlays, to accommodate an expected threefold to fivefold increase in revenues, from $1 million last year. The gains, he says, are the result of ''four major contracts coming into play.'' 
 Children's Progress will also move to more spacious office quarters and add 12 people, from software programmers to sales staff, to its current 7, he said.
 ''We see the economy is rebounding and that's good news for everyone because America's backbone is small business,'' Mr. Greaney said.
 Small businesses are also getting a boost in their expansion plans from a loosening of the purse strings over the past few months by venture-capital firms, banks and other providers of capital. ''I think right now there's an awful lot of money on the sidelines looking to be deployed,'' said Neal Verfuerth, founder and president of Orion Energy Systems, a maker of energy-efficient lighting systems in Plymouth, Wis. Orion Energy is now entering its fifth round of private financing in four years, he said, and expects to raise $10 million, double its previous record of $4.8 million in late 2004. He says he is already making preliminary plans for an initial public offering.
 ''If you look back, everything is cyclical; there's always a boom-bust, boom-bust,'' he said. ''I think the next dot-com type thing is going to be energy and the environment.''
 Mr. Verfuerth says his company has doubled sales every year for the past three years, to $24 million in the fiscal year that ended March 31, and expects to do the same in the year ahead. It has also increased its work force to 110, from 18 three years ago, and plans to hire 50 more this year in Manitowoc, Wis., where it bought a 260,000-square-foot plant six months ago to supplement its existing 22,000-square-foot factory in Plymouth. The new location will be used for manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and research and development, and will cost about $3 million to buy and upgrade, he said.
 Entrepreneurs in the West and South exhibit the most optimism in the country, according to the American Express survey. It showed, for example, that 56 percent of small-business owners in the West expected to hire more staff in the next six months, compared with a 44 percent national average. Those findings were backed up by a survey in February by Union Bank of California in San Francisco of 1,941 small-business owners in the state. More than 70 percent of the owners said they expected business to improve this year.
 Jeremy Shepherd, president and owner of Pearlparadise.com, an on-line seller of pearls, has no doubt about it. His company moved into a 1,500-square-foot office in Santa Monica because it was bursting at the seams in a space about half the size. He also spent $25,000 on computers last year and plans to spend an additional $12,000 this year.
 ''Business is growing astronomically and there really isn't any end in sight,'' Mr. Shepard said. Sales came close to breaking $5 million in 2004, up from $280,000 two years earlier, he said. ''People are actually buying jewelry again,'' he said. ''We had someone in December buy a $23,700 set of pearls online, the highest we ever sold.''
 To meet demand, Mr. Shepherd of Pearlparadise.com has been adding 1 to 2 workers a month and now employs 35.
 The picture on hiring plans is not uniformly upbeat. The 44 percent of respondents to the American Express poll who said they planned to hire was down from 46 percent in the spring of 2004, though sharply higher than the 35 percent who reported such intentions last October. On the other hand, 90 percent of the 175 small businesses surveyed in February by International Profit Associates, a management consulting firm for small- to medium-size businesses, said they would maintain or increase the size of their staffs this year. Of that number, 42 percent said they planned to hire workers, up from 36 percent last August.
 Joseph Bushey, owner and founder of POS World, a supplier of bar code systems in Atlanta, plans to double his staff of five employees this year. He projects his company's sales of $13 million in 2004 will top $14 million this year. ''I think the time is right for small businesses to gain market share from the larger companies because they can't compete as they did before,'' he said. 
 Two dark clouds are hanging over the otherwise sunny small-business world -- soaring health insurance premiums and increased competition from China. To keep expenses down, only half of the businesses surveyed by Union Bank provided health benefits, and of those, about 20 percent had shifted more of the cost to employees last year. The American Express poll also found employers transferring costs to workers; the proportion that offered paid vacation fell to 52 percent, from 56 percent in 2004; the portion that offered paid holidays fell to 50 percent, from 57 percent, and the number that provided 401(k) plans fell to 20 percent, from 28 percent.
 Mr. Bushey of POS World said his big worry was the impact of free trade, especially from China. ''It's a major problem small businesses are going to face,'' he said. ''It's pretty scary.''
 But he maintained that forethought would give him the edge, pointing to the $100,000 he spent on equipment last year and the $100,000 he plans to spend this year. ''That's why I'm spending more money now,'' he said, ''bolstering our services so we can add more value to our customers and keep expanding our customer base.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Takes Social Security to Airwaves

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
He holds a doctorate in economics, was chief executive of a Fortune 500 company and is in his third year as secretary of the Treasury.
 But on Wednesday morning, John W. Snow was doing what he does now on most days: being chief pitchman for a plan to overhaul Social Security that he himself has had little role in developing.
 At Mr. Snow's invitation, more than 25 radio hosts from around the country -- from G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate fame to Hoppy Kercheval of West Virginia Radio -- broadcast interviews on Social Security all day long from the Treasury Department. 
 Mr. Snow, genial and tirelessly on message, gave five back-to-back interviews before 9 a.m. and another four for afternoon drive-time shows.
 He bantered with Mr. Liddy, reminisced about Ohio with a talk-show host from Bowling Green and taped an interview that would be translated into Spanish for CNN en Espanol.
 Social Security ''served us well,'' Mr. Snow said shortly before he donned the first in a series of headphones. ''Unfortunately, the safety net is now frayed.''
 In assembly-line fashion, the Treasury Department scheduled hundreds of similar interviews with dozens of other administration ''surrogates,'' in the jargon of administration media planners.
 The serial surrogates included Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, and a man whose interviews have been almost as rare as victories last season by the Washington Redskins; Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez; Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director; and four of Mr. Snow's lieutenants at the Treasury Department.
 Mr. Snow has spent more than half of his time on Social Security, according to Robert Nichols, his chief spokesman. He has been hopscotching the country, repeating talking points to community leaders in Bozeman, Mont.; business groups in New Orleans and Albuquerque; and students at the Sam M. Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Ark.
 The goal of Mr. Snow's trips, as well as those of the president himself, has been to drum up publicity on local television and radio, projecting Mr. Bush's message beyond national news organizations. The administration has drawn scrutiny for some of its efforts to promote its policies; in one case, employees at Social Security objected to a publicity drive that they said had twisted facts about the solvency of the system. 
 On Wednesday, more than two dozen broadcasters were lined up at long tables in the ornate Cash Room of the Treasury Department.
 They all came at their own expense. Many were local broadcasters and many were conservative talk-show hosts who already supported Mr. Bush's plan.
 Mr. Snow and dozens of other administration officials hopped from one broadcaster to the next. Mr. Rove arrived early, making a folksy appeal for letting people divert part of their Social Security taxes to private investment accounts.
 ''We should be concerned about the guy at the bottom of the scale,'' Mr. Rove told Kirby Wilbur, a conservative talk-show host from KVI-AM, an affiliate of Fox News in Seattle. ''Why should we say that he shouldn't have access to the wealth-making capacity of the American market? Why should we say, 'You're stuck with Social Security and you're getting 2 percent on your money'?''
 Mr. Wilbur, who interviewed at least four officials during the morning rush, said most of his listeners did not need any convincing.
 ''When you're talking to the converted, you are really trying to make them better messengers,'' he said during a break between broadcasts. ''It's reinforcing the choir.''
 Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury official under President Ronald Reagan, said he was concerned about the time Mr. Snow was spending on the Social Security campaign. ''I frankly find it insulting, as a former Treasury official, to see an office once held by Alexander Hamilton used in such a trivial way,'' Mr. Bartlett said.

HEADLINE: Alcoa's Profit Drops in Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Alcoa, one of the world's top aluminum producers, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings fell from a year earlier because of reorganization charges and other items, but profit from continuing operations narrowly beat Wall Street expectations. 
 Net income fell to $260 million, or 30 cents a share, from $355 million, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. 
 Earnings from continuing operations totaled $273 million, or 31 cents a share, in the latest period. 
 Those results include charges of 9 cents a share for the reorganization, tax on the sale of its Elkem investment, and integration and start-up costs for Russian plants. 
 Sales rose 13 percent, to $6.29 billion, from $5.59 billion a year ago, driven by higher primary metal and aluminum prices as well as strength in the flat-rolled products, extruded products and engineered services segments. 
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial were expecting the company to post earnings of 39 cents a share before charges in the latest quarter on sales of $6.34 billion.
 Alcoa's earnings of 40 cents a share from continuing operations before charges beat the forecast by a penny a share, Thomson Financial said. 
 ''Underlying business performance improved in the quarter as we captured the benefits of higher metal prices and a stronger economy in North America,'' said Alain J.P. Belda, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive. 
 ''We were able to regain traction on the cost initiative, overcoming cost inflation increases, to deliver savings to the bottom line,'' Mr. Belda said. 
 Shares in Alcoa, which is based in Pittsburgh, closed unchanged at $29.98 on the New York Stock Exchange before the earnings announcement.

HEADLINE: A Mild Rally, Led by G.M. and Oil Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose yesterday as bond yields dropped and oil prices ended the session lower. 
 General Motors, the benchmark's worst performer this year, led the advance.
 ''The economy continues to do remarkably well,'' said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company in Nashville. ''Unless oil prices scream above $60 a barrel, I would think that most of this is already built into the market.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average added 27.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,486.02, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,184.07. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.18 point, to 1,999.14. 
 Financial shares, the worst performers in the S.&P. 500 last month, advanced. 
 Bank of America increased 29 cents, to $44.60.
 Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of United States mortgages, added $1.87, to $54.15. 
 Crude oil for May delivery bounced between gains and losses before ending the day down 19 cents, at $55.85 a barrel. 
 The Energy Department said United States refiners increased stockpiles for an eighth week. Crude reached a record intraday high of $58.28 Tuesday.
 ''As oil prices ease, in many cases that should give some cost relief to companies, which would help earnings,'' said David Scott, who helps oversee $2 billion at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Va.
 A measure of energy shares rose 1.7 percent even as oil prices fell, for the best performance among 10 industry groups in the S.&P. 500.
 Exxon Mobil added 84 cents, to $60.90. Valero Energy, the oil refiner, rallied $4.79, to $80.17.
 Archer Daniels Midland, the maker of ethanol, plunged $2.68, to $21.32, on concern that the declining price of ethanol, a corn-based fuel, would erode earnings. 
 Christine L. McCracken, an analyst at FTN Midwest Research Securities, cut the company's shares to sell from neutral because of overcapacity in the ethanol industry. The 11 percent decline of Archer shares was the biggest since 1987. 
 General Motors added 82 cents, to $29.86. The shares have retreated 11 percent since the company sharply cut its first-quarter forecast March 16 amid a slump in United States sales. G.M. has fallen 25 percent this year for the worst performance in the Dow average.
 Dell retreated 98 cents, to $38.15, dragging the Nasdaq down. After the close of regular trading, the company said that first-quarter net income would meet its February projection of 37 cents a share and that it planned to buy back $2 billion of its shares this quarter. The report might allay concerns about growth after revenue trailed the company's forecast last quarter. Dell gained 49 cents in after-hours trading.
 Forest Laboratories slumped $4.48, to $33.51. The company warned about profit in the fourth quarter as sales of its depression drug Celexa were hurt by cheaper competitors. It said diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time factors, will be about 40 cents, short of the 52 cents expected by analysts.
 Anheuser-Busch lost $1.79, to $45.65, after it said first-quarter profit declined as sales in the United States dropped more than expected.
 Prices of Treasury securities rose after oil and gas prices eased from record highs, tempering concern that the Federal Reserve will view rising energy prices as a source of faster inflation.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 9620/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.42 percent, from 4.47 percent Tuesday. 
 Here are the results of the eight-day cash management auction: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price -- 99.940
Investment Rate -- 2.699
High Rate -- 2.660
Low Rate -- 2.620

HEADLINE: Spitzer Says Albany Budget Ducked Crucial Issues

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 6 

 BODY:
Since he announced his run for governor in December, Eliot Spitzer has largely remained above the fray in the state capital, concentrating on his job as attorney general and refraining from getting involved in Albany's major debates.
 But on Wednesday, with Gov. George E. Pataki and his closely guarded political aspirations headed off to the papal funeral in Rome, Mr. Spitzer thrust himself into state politics by belittling the on-time budget passed by lawmakers last week, saying it was filled with holes and failed to solve the state's long-term problems, like spiraling Medicaid costs, financing education or addressing chronic problems with the state's economy. And he said that Albany had not gone far enough in reforming itself despite a more open budget process this year.
 His remarks, made during an impromptu appearance on an Albany radio program, came less than a week after lawmakers trumpeted their first passage of an on-time budget in a generation, and by faulting the budget, he was indirectly attacking the two legislative leaders who devised the spending plan: the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican Senate president, Joseph L. Bruno. 
 ''Maybe we have a budget, maybe it's on time, and the ambiguity arises from the fact that I think this budget deferred many, if not most, of the difficult issues that are confronting state government,'' Mr. Spitzer said, alluding to the many holes in the document -- $1.5 billion worth of initiatives on the environment, aid to the needy and college construction. ''And while it is better to have a budget than not to have a budget, substance ultimately is more important than process.''
 For Mr. Spitzer, the only Democrat to have announced his intention to try to replace Mr. Pataki, the comments provided a revealing insight into his beliefs about government's fundamental job of taxing and spending. Though he is a national figure for his inquiries into Wall Street misdeeds, the attorney general has so far been coy about the bread-and-butter issues facing the capital, like the governor's calls to reform Medicaid or matters like school financing.
 Indeed, it was a question about Mr. Spitzer's whereabouts, broadcast live on the radio by Fredric U. Dicker, a New York Post reporter with a knack for getting under the skin of leading politicians, that drew Mr. Spitzer out.
 Moments after Mr. Dicker wondered on the air where Mr. Spitzer was, as he broadcast his program from his office in the State Capitol, Mr. Spitzer surprised him by walking in to prove he was at work in the building. And, after a few jocular moments, he answered Mr. Dicker's questions about the budget on WROW-AM.
 While Mr. Spitzer started congenially, saying the political officials in Albany certainly deserved credit for passing a budget by the April 1 deadline for the first time since 1984, he quickly ticked off a series of troubles. He said the budget left many questions unanswered. The process, he said, was too secretive, even though lawmakers have been congratulating themselves for their openness in writing a budget proposal that conflicted with the $105.6 billon plan laid out by Mr. Pataki, a third-term Republican who is considering whether to run for a fourth term next year.
 In reacting, Republicans said it was about time they heard from Mr. Spitzer on such issues, though they also said they wished they could have heard more from him about possible solutions.
 ''We're glad that the attorney general returned from Aspen, unplugged himself from his iPod and finally took the time to make a comment on the most significant development in Albany in 20 years,'' Stephen Minarik, the State Republican Party chairman, said in a comment provided by Ryan Moses, the party's executive director.
 Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for Governor Pataki, said: ''We're glad that the attorney general has now realized what the governor has been saying for weeks -- that we need a final, fiscally responsible budget that includes significant reforms and fully addresses the needs of New Yorkers. We're hopeful that he will spread his message to the speaker and Assembly majority because they are the ones who have consistently blocked real Medicaid reform, real education reform and real fiscal reform.''
 During his radio interview, Mr. Spitzer raised issues that have vexed Albany politicians for years. ''Even if we have overcome some of the process hurdles in terms of getting a budget passed, we have not confronted the very difficult substantive issues: How do we pay for education? How do we control Medicaid spending? How do we invest in infrastructure? How do we create an economic foundation for growth in that massive piece of the state, which is in financial distress?'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 Turning even more intently to process, Mr. Spitzer was critical of both the round-table public discussions on the budget that the governor held, which he said appeared ''scripted,'' and the series of bipartisan legislative conference committees that lawmakers held, which he said should be more accountable, like Washington's. In that way, he seemed to puncture the self-congratulatory air that filled Albany last week, with the top legislative leaders boasting about their open meetings and rank-and file lawmakers flexing new institutional muscles.
 ''The open meetings are important, they're useful,'' Mr. Spitzer said of the budget meetings held with the governor. ''But I think we need to go beyond meetings among five leaders, which to a certain extent continue to be scripted events.'' David Catalfamo, the governor's communications director, disputed that characterization, saying, ''They certainly were not scripted.''
 Narrowing in on the meetings held by the lawmakers, Mr. Spitzer continued: ''We need to get into a much more open discourse of conference committees and model our budget process more after what they do in Congress, where there are actually committees that parse the budget for particular departments, so there is transparency and accountability. We are completely devoid of accountability.''
 He went on: ''Who actually knows how the Department of Health's budget is spent? And that is probably the single largest piece of the state budget, determining how a major sector of our economy is structured, and it is the piece of the economy that business complains about the most, that individuals complain about the most and yet nobody knows how the Department of Health spends its money.'' 
 In criticizing the budget, Mr. Spitzer risked alienating fellow Democrats in the State Assembly and their allies, whose support he may need to count on in next year's gubernatorial race.
 His words raised questions about how State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a fellow Democrat, would ultimately come down on the budget's dollars and cents -- how it affected education, Medicaid, local governments and debt, and whether it was balanced.
 An aide to Mr. Hevesi said the comptroller's annual report on the budget would be issued in a couple of weeks. Mr. Hevesi moved quickly last Thursday to say the budget met the requirements of state law because lawmakers acted on the governor's appropriation bills and he deemed them ''sufficient for the ongoing operation and support of state government and local assistance.'' But he declined to comment on its fundamental fiscal merits.

HEADLINE: Nominee Challenged Over Program On Pesticides

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
Stephen L. Johnson, President Bush's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, encountered unexpected turbulence at his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday as Senator Barbara Boxer of California threatened to hold up his nomination over a small but controversial pesticide program in Florida.
 Appearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Johnson, a 24-year veteran of the agency who has been acting administrator since his predecessor, Michael O. Leavitt, became secretary of health and human services, was greeted warmly by Republicans and faced predictably pointed questions from Democrats over recent agency initiatives, including emission control rules put into place last month.
 Ms. Boxer's objections were based on a little-known research program near Jacksonville, Fla., sponsored by the agency and the American Chemistry Council, that offered money to low-income families willing to allow the agency to measure the effects of pesticides on their children under one year of age. The project, called Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study, or Cheers, was suspended last year after negative public reaction that prompted the agency to call in outside experts to assess its feasibility. 
 The program was limited to families in Duval County that routinely used pesticides inside their homes. It offered parents $970 over two years if they made sure their young children went about their usual activities as the use of pesticides continued. Researchers would then visit the home every three to six months to collect data. 
 In a letter that reached Ms. Boxer several hours after she raised her concerns, Mr. Johnson said, ''No additional work will be conducted on this study subject to the outcome of external scientific and ethical review.''
 But that was well short of her demands. Calling the program ''appalling, unethical and immoral,'' Ms. Boxer implored Mr. Johnson ''to pull the plug on this program tomorrow.'' In an interview later, she said she would do whatever she could to hold up Mr. Johnson's confirmation so long as the program had any chance of being revived.
 ''Until it's canceled, I will do anything I can to stop this nomination,'' she said. ''This program is the worst kind of thing; it's environmental injustice where children are the victims.''
 Mr. Johnson, 54, is the first career employee at the agency with a formal scientific background to be nominated to lead it. Trained as a biologist and pathologist, he led the agency's pesticide and toxic substances office before rising to several senior positions under Mr. Leavitt and his predecessor, Christie Whitman.
 In his opening remarks, Mr. Johnson assured committee members that under his leadership, decisions would be made on ''the best available scientific information'' and that they would be made through a process ''as open and transparent'' as possible.
 But fielding questions from other Democrats and Senator James M. Jeffords, Independent of Vermont, who warned Mr. Johnson against becoming ''a rubber stamp for White House policies,'' Mr. Johnson made it clear that he would strongly support preferences of the administration.
 That became especially evident in an exchange with Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, who pressed Mr. Johnson to explain why the agency provided the committee with detailed analyses of the administration's pollution-reduction bill, known as Clear Skies, but not two competing bills. The measure has stalled in the last two sessions of Congress.
 Mr. Johnson said the agency had more pressing matters to address, but he vowed to do whatever he could to help the committee pass effective antipollution legislation so long as it was built on Clear Skies.
 ''I appreciate the work the committee has already done on this issue,'' he said, ''and I look forward to working with you to advance this important legislative initiative.''
 Responding to friendly questions from Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, Mr. Johnson returned to the theme of sound science as the overarching imperative for all agency decisions. But Mr. Jeffords threw the concept back to him, asking Mr. Johnson why the agency chose a cap-and-trade program for its recently announced mercury rules for power plant emissions, rather than a program that demanded the use of best available technologies.
 Mr. Johnson's answer reflected his willingness to balance economic considerations with new environmental regulations. He said that new guidelines for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions were also helping to reduce mercury emissions and that forcing plant operators to do more would prove too expensive.
 ''It's a much more cost-effective approach,'' he said of the cap-and-trade program.
 As he left the hearing room, Mr. Johnson smiled when asked about Ms. Boxer's concerns and said, ''Today was a pleasure being before the senators, and I'm looking forward to swift confirmation so I can run the E.P.A. on a full-time basis.''

HEADLINE: Limits Urged in Mortgage Portfolios

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6 

 BODY:
As Congress again began work on legislation to strengthen oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big mortgage finance companies, the Federal Reserve chairman urged lawmakers on Wednesday to impose sharp limits on the $1.5 trillion holdings of the companies.
 Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companies -- nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market -- posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems.
 ''We at the Federal Reserve,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''remain concerned about the growth and magnitude of the mortgage portfolios of the Government Sponsored Enterprises, which concentrate interest rate risk and prepayment risk at these two institutions and makes our financial system dependent on their ability to manage these risks. 
 ''To fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we assess as likely if G.S.E. expansion continues unabated, preventive actions are required sooner rather than later.''
 Most assets in the portfolios are mortgage-backed securities that the companies find more profitable to hold than to sell in the secondary markets. Mr. Greenspan said that these holdings did nothing to further Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's mission of providing liquidity and lowering mortgage interest rates, but was solely a method of increasing earnings. 
 In the meantime, at a hearing in the House, the top regulator of the two companies, Armando Falcon Jr., said it could take years for Fannie Mae to work through the problems caused by accounting lapses.
 Mr. Greenspan, in his testimony, went beyond previous statements in which he urged tighter scrutiny of the two companies. 
 In previous years, lawmakers have failed to approve legislation requiring stronger oversight of the companies. They have been formidable lobbying forces, able to block attempts by lawmakers, often with the support of rival mortgage companies, to restrict them. 
 But some members of Congress say that this year presents the best opportunity to adopt legislation because both companies have lost political luster as they have struggled through accounting scandals.
 Mr. Greenspan's heavy regulatory bent on Wednesday was in marked contrast to his overall deregulatory approach in other areas, like hedge funds. That distinction was noted by several senators who questioned the need to force Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce their portfolios.
 In several pointed lines of questioning, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, criticized Mr. Greenspan's recommendation and called it both inconsistent with his other views on regulation and potentially damaging to the housing markets. 
 Without identifying anyone in particular, Mr. Schumer also suggested that some people who have advanced tougher regulation of the two housing finance companies were really pushing a broader agenda to eliminate the companies and their mission of providing affordable housing.
 ''I see an analogy to Social Security,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''Social Security has a problem and there are ideologues who want to undo it. Fannie and Freddie have problems, and there are ideologues who want to undo them. But there are ways to fix the problems short of what's been proposed. When the sink is broken, you don't want to tear down the house.''
 Mr. Greenspan did not offer a precise limit to impose on the overall size of the portfolios of the two companies, although he suggested that it should be a small fraction of the current size -- perhaps $100 billion to $200 billion. He said the final figure should be left to the lawmakers and any new regulatory agency that they might create.
 He suggested that reducing the portfolios could be done gradually and with little impact on the markets, and that it would free the companies from having to hedge risks through the purchase of derivative securities and other complicated trading techniques that, he said, carried significant risks of their own.
 And he added that if Congress simply created a new regulatory apparatus without also addressing the large portfolios of the companies, it could make matters worse.
 Returning to the idea of Government Sponsored Enterprises, or G.S.E.'s, Mr. Greenspan said: ''World-class regulation, by itself, may not be sufficient and indeed might even worsen the potential for systemic risk if market participants inferred from such regulation that the government would be more likely to back G.S.E. debt in the event of financial stress. This is the heart of a dilemma in designing regulation for G.S.E's.''
 Mr. Falcon, the head of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, gave a House panel further details of new accounting problems that Fannie Mae executives had disclosed last month. 
 He said that the company appeared to have improperly recorded some pooled mortgage loans and improperly employed so-called ''special purpose entities,'' corporate vehicles used to move the company's assets and liabilities off the books, to issue mortgage-backed securities. He said officials had instructed the company to determine which employees might have falsified entries in some journals.
 Neither Mr. Falcon nor Fannie Mae has said how the new accounting problems may affect earlier earnings statements or its balance sheet because the company remains under investigation.
 Mr. Falcon announced on Tuesday that he would be stepping down next month.

HEADLINE: Braves Still on Top, 14 Years Later

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
TERRY PENDLETON was there when it started. He was, in fact, instrumental in its start. 
 He was the third baseman on the 1991 Atlanta Braves, joining them with first baseman Sid Bream, another free agent. The Braves had finished in sixth, or last, place in the National League West each of the previous three seasons and four of the previous five years. The way the Braves played in the early exhibition games that spring, they could have easily wound up last again.
 That's when Pendleton and Bream stepped forward. Bream went to Atlanta from the National League East champion Pittsburgh Pirates. Pendleton arrived from the St. Louis Cardinals, with whom he finished first and last, and he knew he liked first better. 
 ''After a couple spring training games, my impression was we were going through the motions as a team,'' Pendleton, now the Braves' hitting coach, said. ''Everybody expected us to be the Atlanta Braves, lose our 90 or 100 and move on. But Sid Bream and I had a different vision. Bobby Cox and John Schuerholz had a different vision.''
 Schuerholz was the general manager who had signed Pendleton and Bream. He had moved to Atlanta from Kansas City before that season, after Cox decided to relinquish the general manager's job, which he had held since October 1985. Cox returned to the dugout as manager on June 22, 1990, replacing Russ Nixon.
 ''I wanted to manage,'' Cox said last month. ''No way I could do both.'' So the Braves left Cox in the dugout and hired Schuerholz.
 Pendleton said: ''Our vision was to win, so we held a meeting of the players a few days into spring training and told them exactly how we felt and what we thought we were capable of doing. That was something we thought was necessary for us to be successful, and Bobby gave us the closed door to do it.''
 The Braves did not charge out of that door and instantly run roughshod over the competition. But Pendleton said: ''It changed guys' attitudes. You could see our work ethic and everything else was different.''
 Nevertheless, the Braves reached the All-Star Game break nine and a half games out of first with a 39-40 record. Heading for home at the break, the players talked among themselves.
 ''The kids were talking about how horrible we played in the first half and how much better we could be,'' Pendleton said. ''That four-hour plane ride from L.A. to Atlanta, you could really start to see them change, you know, we can do something here.''
 The Braves won seven of the first eight games after the break, while the division-leading Dodgers lost seven in a row and eight of nine. Suddenly, the Braves were three games out and on their way to the first of the team's 13 consecutive division championships, a run unparalleled in a major American professional sports.
 ''They started walking around with their chests out,'' Pendleton said. ''It made a major difference in their confidence and ability to get it done.''
 As the incredible streak has grown, the Braves, who moved to the N.L. East in 1994, have won only one World Series, in 1995, and have played in three others, but the mere feat of finishing first every year is mind-boggling. Finishing first means a team plays in the postseason, and without that step, there's no World Series to consider. 
 ''Nobody seriously can imagine 13 in a row,'' said Pendleton, who played on the first three championship teams (four over all) and has coached on the last three. ''I knew we had a good team. We had young pitching and guys who could play the game. But I couldn't imagine this. Nobody could.''
 The Braves, who will play host to the Mets in a three-game series beginning tonight, have done it despite a continual turnover of players, including integral elements like Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, making the streak all the more remarkable. Each year, Schuerholz lets some players go as free agents or in trades and adds others in the same way.
 Not missing a beat, Cox fits the newcomers into the team, and six months from opening day the Braves have another division championship.
 ''This is an awesome organization to come into,'' said Johnny Estrada, who replaced Javy Lopez last season as the team's catcher after Lopez experienced a career year in 2003. ''The clubhouse was easy. Bobby Cox is unbelievable as the manager. He gets the best out of his players. They've averaged 10 new players every year the past few years, and it starts with Bobby Cox.''
 Chipper Jones, who is in his 11th season with the Braves and is second in seniority (John Smoltz is the only player who has been on all 13 division winners), said the Braves kept their rosters intact earlier in his career, but not in the last few years. 
 Schuerholz said: ''It's all about economics. We continually update a three-year financial plan. We're not going to be caught by surprise by anything that happens.''
 The irrepressible Ted Turner owned the Braves through their first five division titles. Then he sold the team after the 1996 season to Time Warner, which for the first few years supported the Braves' hefty payrolls.
 ''Some of them ran our budget well beyond its limitations,'' Schuerholz said. ''Our company was more than willing to do that. It got to the point where it started to get, if not ridiculous, near it, in terms of the cost of the team being up against our ability to generate the revenues to support it.
 ''It didn't make sense to lose the money we were losing in this operation. They said the payroll's going to go from near $100 million to $80 million. We did that and still won our division by 10 games.''
 Schuerholz said of the payroll reduction, ''It was the right thing to do.'' 
 This year the payroll will be $80 million, the same as last year. Tim Hudson, Dan Kolb, Brian Jordan and Raul Mondesi are among the newcomers to the team this year. Last year, J.D. Drew and John Thomson were new. The year before, Mike Hampton and Roberto Hernandez were added, and in 2002 Vinny Castilla and Gary Sheffield signed on.
 Chipper Jones has seen them all come and most of them go. Does he feel a responsibility to help the newcomers fit in?
 ''It's one of my jobs to be a leader on this ball club,'' Jones said. ''Most people are pretty aware of what's expected when they come in here. They're going to be expected to produce and help us win our division and go into the playoffs. When guys come in here, they'll pick one guy who's been around a while and that they relate to and kind of follow them around.''
 Sheffield, now with the Yankees, did that when he joined the Braves in 2002. He had a reputation as a difficult player to deal with. 
 '''When we get to camp,''' Jones said Sheffield had told him, '''I'm going to be like your little puppy. I'm going to follow your lead. It's your team. I don't want to mess you up or cause any waves or anything like that.'''
 Jones said: ''To me that was a big compliment. You're talking about one of the great players in the game just wanting to get along with everybody in camp. I wish he was still here, but that's the business of baseball. We couldn't afford to keep him.''
 Time Warner put the Braves up for sale, but it pulled them back because it wasn't satisfied with the offers. The market, however, seems to be improving for a Braves sale. 
 The new owner should insist that Schuerholz and Cox be part of the deal.

HEADLINE: Sales at Wholesalers Fell in February

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Sales at wholesalers dropped 0.4 percent in February, according to a report released yesterday by the Commerce Department.
 The decline in sales at wholesalers was the first dip in 21 months. 
They rose 0.3 percent in January.
 Inventories increased 0.6 percent in February after a 1 percent gain in January.
 A separate report yesterday showed a decline in the number of American workers filing for unemployment benefits last week. 
 First-time applications dropped 19,000 in the week ended Saturday, to 334,000, the Labor Department said in Washington. 
 The level is close to figures reported for March, when the economy added 110,000 jobs. That was less than half the number created in February, when claims averaged 307,250.
 The previous week's figure was the highest since 356,000 in September. That may have been because of difficulties adjusting gross numbers for a shortened workweek that included Good Friday.
 The less-volatile four-week moving average of claims fell to 336,500, from 336,750.
 The number of people continuing to collect state jobless benefits rose to 2.688 million in the week that ended March 26, from a four-year low of 2.598 million the previous week. The four-week moving average of continuing claims dropped to 2.651 million, the lowest since April 2001.

HEADLINE: Bombing at Cairo Tourist Site Leaves 2 Dead, 18 Wounded

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 7 

 BODY:
A small bomb apparently stuffed with nails exploded Thursday near the heart of the main tourist bazaar here, killing 2 people including a French woman and an unidentified man and wounding 18 others, according to the Egyptian Interior Ministry and senior police officials. 
 The bombing, which occurred around 5 p.m. when the Khan al-Khalili bazaar and nearby streets are usually mobbed with tour groups, was the first such attack on foreigners in the capital in more than seven years. The country's tourism industry, a main engine of its economy, has been booming after suffering from violent attacks by Islamic militants seeking to topple the government in the late 1990's. 
 The wounded -- listed as four French, three Americans, an Italian, a Turk and nine Egyptians -- were treated at Hussein Hospital, which was surrounded by a row of police officers in full riot gear. 
 Nurses at the receiving desk said most of those admitted had nails more than an inch long and shards of glass embedded in their bodies, although one woman had much of her lower body blown away. 
 Ismael al-Shaer, head of the Mabahith, the Egyptian equivalent of the F.B.I., confirmed that a small bomb had gone off but denied reports that it had been thrown from a motor scooter. He said most of those injured were lightly wounded. 
 Al Jazeera, however, reported that the unidentified body might have been that of a suicide bomber.
 The bomb went off in Al Muski, a main section of the bazaar near the central Khan al-Khalili, about 200 yards from the main gold and silver souk and a renowned school dating from around 1425, the Madrasa of Sultan Barsbay. 
 ''There was a loud boom, a horrible sound, and everybody started running,'' said Rabab Rifaat, one of the few witnesses available after the police sealed off the area. 
 Shopkeepers said they feared that the bombing would scare away foreigners who have been visiting Egypt in record numbers. 
 ''Our customers are either Arabs or foreign tourists,'' said Nagla Osama, 23, whose family owns the Mecca Bazaar, a store selling framed embroidery featuring Koranic verses. ''Now it will all come to a halt.'' 
 The American Embassy in Cairo issued a warning to all American citizens to avoid the bazaar until further notice along with other areas where large numbers of tourists concentrate. 
 The last attack against tourists in Egypt occurred last October, when 34 people died in bombings at Taba and other Red Sea resorts.

HEADLINE: Hunger-Based Lines Lengthen at the Faith-Based Soup Kitchens

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
The 1,130 soup kitchen guests, as they're respectfully called, began gathering outside the church doors an hour early, curling around the corner in a long line to await a free main meal -- their safety-net highlight in another day of being down and out, part of the working poor, or surviving somewhere in between. 
 The repast, at 2,500 calories a serving, steamed aromatically: chicken a la king, rice, buttered spinach, peaches. A staff member in the nave of the building, the Church of the Holy Apostles, cued dozens of volunteer helpers: ''Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime. Thanks be to God.'' And from Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, the diners flowed in. 
 The sight of masses of Americans gratefully chowing down on free food is indeed a show, an amazingly discreet one that is classified not as outright hunger but as ''food insecurity'' by government specialists who are busy measuring the growing lines at soup kitchens and food pantries across the nation. There were 25.5 million supplicants regularly lining up in 2002; they were joined by 1.1 million more the next year. And even more arrive as unemployment and other government programs run out.
 Much as the diners at Holy Apostles peered ahead to see what was being dished up at the steam tables, soup kitchen administrators across the country are currently eying governments' trilevel budget season and wincing at all the politicians' economizing vows. They know that ''budget tightening'' eventually means longer lines outside their doors. 
 ''It's a desperate thing,'' said the Rev. Bill Greenlaw, director of the Holy Apostles charity, one of the largest among 1,298 kitchens and pantries regularly helping more than one million residents in New York City. ''Every level of government seems to have the same mantra, that these programs are vulnerable. 
 ''We're bracing that all three levels of government are coming down at the same time.''
 Most immediately, food charities are pleading against further cuts in the federal emergency food and shelter program, which directly fights hunger. Last year, 48 soup kitchens closed in the city as supplies were exhausted, and hundreds of others were reported to be making do by cutting back on daily portions. 
 Beyond that, however, administrators know that the myriad of severe program cuts looming in Washington -- for everything from low-income wage supplements to health care spending for poor people -- can only lead to further cuts down the revenue food chain in statehouses and city halls and, finally, longer lines of people silently begging for food. 
 The budget debate in the Republican-run Capitol presents a Hobson's choice between the House's five-year, $30 billion-plus in program cuts for the poor and the Senate's $2.8 billion in cuts -- one-tenth the pain, but focused most heavily on nutrition programs. The compromise cuts are likely to lean toward the House, levying more than their fair budget share on the poor, even as President Bush and the G.O.P. leaders argue that still more upper-bracket tax cuts are somehow justifiable. 
 So Father Greenlaw can only turn to pleading for even more charity from the city's better-off residents. 
 According to a survey by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, seven out of 10 of the city's pantries and kitchens are ''faith based,'' using the terminology of the Bush administration. But their besieged directors overwhelmingly warn that government, not charities, must take the lead if poverty is to be properly confronted.
 ''We're faith-based by the old rules, not the new ones,'' Father Greenlaw carefully noted. ''We'll be feeding more guests unless and until society decides we don't have to tolerate a huge underclass in our cities.'' 
 In the meantime, the pungent scene in the nave at Holy Apostles is unabashedly hunger-based. People are being fed, not proselytized, at dining tables where the pews used to be. A midday hubbub of satiation rises up, plain as the pipes of the church organ, as the line lengthens outside.

HEADLINE: Made in the U.S.A. (Except for the Parts)

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The back-ordered Prius, with its hybrid gasoline-electric engine, is coming into the United States as fast as Toyota can turn the car out: 7,000 were shipped from Japan in February and the same number in January. That is just one of many indicators of how the everyday needs and desires of Americans keep imports rising despite a weaker dollar.
 This winter, ships, planes and trucks coming from abroad also carried extra loads of costume jewelry from Austria and China; front-loading washing machines from Germany; tires from the Far East; refrigerators from Mexico and South Korea; and computers from China.
 These are among the imports that have increased most quickly in recent months, helping to swell the January import bill to $159.1 billion, a record for any month. That comes after the 2004 trade deficit reached a record $617 billion. 
 Just when, at least in theory, imports should be falling or at least leveling off in response to a dollar that no longer buys as much in euros, pounds and yens, they have continued to surge. Imports now equal 16 percent of the nation's overall economic output, up a full percentage point in one year. They represented only 11 percent of the gross domestic product a decade ago. But while imported finished goods like costume jewelry and clothing are what most people notice most, what they do not see is even more significant.
 The biggest change is that American companies increasingly import many of the parts and components that go into the products they make in the United States, drawing on the global economy to supply what they once made at home.
 So when factories raise their production, as they are in the currently robust economy, foreign-made parts and components flow into the country in ever greater quantities. Exports also grow, but imports are rising faster, and the American trade gap widens.
 ''The current surge in imports is strongly related to our rising industrial output,'' said Kathleen Cooper, under secretary for economic affairs at the Commerce Department. ''Goods that are assembled in this country have an awful lot of imported components that used to be made in this country.''
 That helps to explain why gasoline engines purchased abroad for cars assembled in America were up 8 percent in January, to $960 million. Imported steering and suspension mechanisms also shot up 8 percent in January, to $312 million, accounting for much of the 19 percent increase in these items over 12 months, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the United States Business and Industry Council.
 Toyota is one of thousands of companies bringing parts from abroad, as well as finished vehicles. The 7,000 Prius cars imported in February more than doubled the monthly number a year ago, the company said. Toyota has gradually shifted production of many of its other models to the United States, and also the components that go into those cars. Still, roughly 25 percent of those components continue to be imported. As production rises in any given month, as it has lately for Toyota, so does the number of imported components.
 While such global production decisions are increasingly determining trade flows, don't discount the effect of changing tastes. In the case of costume jewelry, for example, fashion trumped the upward pressure on prices as the dollar fell. Imports of costume jewelry reached $111.3 million in January, up 16 percent in that month alone and 33 percent over the last year. Most of these bracelets, earrings, necklaces, broaches and rings come from China, with Austria in a strong second place.
 ''The fashion right now is showing very feminine, very decorative, very sparkly, and not everyone can afford the real thing,'' said Barry Kieselstein-Cord, president of Kieselstein-Cord, which operates luxury goods retail stores in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
 Even when American companies make a product at home, their customers often prefer the imported version. The front-loading washing machine is a case in point. It has gained market share in the United States on a reputation for using less water and less energy than the traditional American machines that load clothing from the top and wash by agitating the clothes rather than spinning them.
 Front-loaders are made here, by Maytag and Whirlpool, among others, but they are not a high priority. By contrast, front-loaders are the most popular clothes washers in Germany, and appliance makers in that country, among them Siemens and Miele, are leading exporters of these machines.
 To satisfy American demand, shipments from Germany have risen sevenfold since 1999, to $419 million in 2004, including a 122 percent increase last year.
 That should eventually stir American appliance manufacturers to step up production in the United States, says Joseph M. McGuire, president of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. ''I fully expect more of that type of machine to be made here as well,'' he said.
 While fashion and preference drive some imports, industrial integration on a global scale is the biggest single factor. American companies with operations abroad now account for nearly 48 percent of the nation's imports, the Commerce Department reports, up from an average of 45 percent in the 1990's. 
 The Eaton Corporation, for example, makes truck transmissions in Brazil, some of which are shipped to Ohio to be used in Navistar trucks. Ford makes gasoline engines in Mexico for cars assembled in the United States. Medtronic imports coronary stents and angioplasty balloons from its factory in Ireland, a nation that in 2000 bought $3 billion more in medical devices from the United States than it sold to this country. That $3 billion deficit has turned into a $3 billion surplus today. The devices from Ireland include American components -- for example, drugs used to coat stents to prevent clots from building up.
 Indeed, the American-made content of a heart stent, a jet aircraft engine, or any imported item might be 50 percent of its value or more. But in the trade statistics, that distinction is not made; the entire value is listed as an import.
 The pattern is evident in personal computers, which generally rely on chips from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices for much of their value. Fully assembled computers showed up as a $25 billion item in last year's import bill; the American contribution showed up separately only in export figures. China accounted for 55 percent of these shipments in January, up from just 9 percent in 2000, the Census Bureau reported. 
 Across many categories, imports are rising faster than exports, an imbalance not likely to change, says Diana Farrell, director for the global institute at McKinsey & Company.
 ''American companies are doing more things abroad and bringing them back to the United States,'' she said. ''We have had these big dollar devaluations and we don't see the commensurate drop in imports. The reason is that the companies are pursuing labor cost savings that offset exchange rates.''
 Pursuing this arbitrage, as Ms. Farrell calls it, General Electric has gradually shifted the manufacture of some refrigerators to its plants in Mexico and South Korea. That shift and the growing presence of Asian manufacturers like LG Electronics, a Korean company with a factory in Mexico, has contributed to a 154 percent rise in household refrigerator imports since 2000. The total reached $107 million in January. 
 Similarly, the low end of the auto tire market -- the sort of tires that are priced at four for $99 -- has shifted to the Far East, mainly to China, which has tripled tire exports to the United States since 1999. Some of the low-price tires are coming from American factories abroad, but not many, says Edward Markey, a spokesman for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which once made these tires in the United States. ''We won't position the Goodyear brand to compete in that part of the market,'' he said. 
 Aircraft engines and engine parts, a category that has experienced a 24 percent increase in imports in the latest 12 months, are also affected by global sourcing, but in a more complex way. General Electric in the United States and Snechma of France, for example, jointly manufacture the jet engine for Boeing's 737 and Airbus's 320.
 G.E. makes the ''hot section'' at its plant in Cincinnati, while Snechma manufactures the giant fans in France. They ship these components to each other and each partner does the final assembly of the engines for its customers. In addition, G.E. makes smaller jet engines for the commuter planes that Bombardier makes in Canada and Embraer in Brazil. These are exported to those countries, but 24 percent of the value of the engines is composed of components imported from Japan.
 The upshot is that exports of engines and engine parts are rising, but so are imports. It is a pattern evident in many industries, said Alan Tonelson, a research fellow at the Business and Industry Council.
 ''Our exports,'' he said, ''are increasingly the type of products that generate greater import flows.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Limits on Internet Gambling Are Backed

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

 BODY:
An appeals panel of the World Trade Organization ruled yesterday that the United States can maintain many of its restrictions on Internet gambling, largely reversing an earlier ruling that the country was violating its international obligations.
 But the appeals panel, ruling in a dispute involving the island nation of Antigua, also found that a 2000 American law on horse racing discriminates against foreign operators.
 Both Washington and Antigua claimed victory after the appeals panel issued its decision in Geneva.
 ''This win confirms what we knew from the start -- W.T.O. members are entitled to maintain restriction on Internet gambling,'' said Peter F. Allgeier, the acting United States trade representative. ''This report essentially says that if we clarify U.S. Internet gambling restrictions in a certain way, we'll be fine.'' 
 But Mark Mendel, the lead lawyer for Antigua, a Caribbean nation of 67,000 people, said, ''This is a big victory for Antigua.''
 ''The United States will have to bring its gambling laws into conformity with the decision,'' Mr. Mendel said in a telephone interview from Geneva.
 Given the conflicting interpretations of the 138-page decision by the World Trade Organization Appellate Body, Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., who is an expert on gambling law, said: ''Of course, both sides can say they won. But the reality is, it's a pretty big win for the United States.''
 The crucial part of the victory for Washington, he said, was that the panel found that international trade law allowed an exception to W.T.O. rules in cases in which countries can prove that special laws are needed to protect ''public morals.'' In the original decision last year, the W.T.O. did not agree that the United States was entitled to this exception.
 On the other hand, Professor Rose said, Antigua could claim victory because the panel found that the 2000 Interstate Horse Racing Act expressly allowed Americans to bet on horse races from their homes by computer or telephone, but only by placing the bets with United States-based off-track companies. ''The panel quite rightly found that the U.S. has not shown this is not discriminatory,'' Professor Rose said.
 Professor Rose said he now expected that there would be some further discussions and negotiations between Antigua and the United States and that Washington would amend the horse racing act to allow international bets on horse races placed through casinos in places like Antigua. The panel's decision is final, with no further appeal allowed.
 The decision removes a major threat to United States gambling law, several specialists said, but Internet gambling is already rapidly developing and there are questions about how long the United States can hold out.
 Under the 1961 Interstate Wire Act, which outlaws betting over interstate phone lines, Internet gambling has been illegal under federal law.
 Nevertheless, ''the average Joe doesn't see eye to eye with Washington on this, and the United States is the largest market for Internet gambling,'' said Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisers, a New York-based gambling consulting and market research firm. In 2004, by his estimate, bettors in the United States accounted for half the world total of $7.4 billion wagered in Internet gambling, with many people betting through their home computers.
 ''We estimate that by 2010 this total will grow to $18.4 billion,'' Mr. Sinclair said.
 Antigua has been trying to diversify its tourist-based economy by attracting Internet gambling companies that take bets from American gamblers, but Washington has blocked that effort.
 Mr. Sinclair said one clear thing to emerge from the dispute was that ''the United States and the rest of the world have a fundamentally different view about the whole concept of Internet gambling.''
 Led by Britain, virtually all the countries in Western Europe now have companies that take bets from Internet gamblers, he said, ranging from horse racing to lotteries.

HEADLINE: For St. Louis, Great Expectations but a Slow-Rolling Renaissance

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, April 5 

 BODY:
People here joke that the sidewalks get rolled up at night as workers flee to the suburbs, but through the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament that ended on Monday, the sidewalks got washed instead. St. Louis primped and spruced and papered its empty buildings with signs about the rosy days to come and got its television close-up in front of millions of viewers around the world.
 But much of the city's upbeat message was intended for consumption at home, where urban pioneers like John and Mary Kelly have staked their fortunes on making the renaissance real. The couple opened Kelly's Deli four years ago on what was then a nearly abandoned block of downtown, and they still have great expectations because of the conversion of vacant buildings into loft-style apartments in their neighborhood and the escalating real-estate prices that are drawing investors. 
 But for St. Louis, which lost half its population in the decades after World War II, and for the Kellys, the good times still remain mostly unrealized. The basketball crowds gave a nice jolt to the cash register, they said. And the event put as much as $60 million into the local economy over four days of revelry, economic development officials said. But by Tuesday it was business as usual.
 ''I don't know how long we can hold on,'' Mr. Kelly said.
 The calculus of rehabilitating any wounded city is partly about experimenting until something that works is found. St. Louis is pinning its hopes on architecture, specifically its stock of glorious old buildings that now stand like monuments to a vanished economy of manufacturing might. But selling the portrait of that recovery, city officials and development leaders say, is complicated by history and myth and the deep divisions in Missouri politics, and to a certain extent by the even trickier terrain of sexual orientation.
 The city is an island of Democratic voters in a sea of increasingly conservative rural and suburban ones. It suffers from a reputation as a dangerous place, which tends to keep many outsiders from venturing in. And the recovery effort has partly been led by members of a group that is not popular in many parts of Missouri: gay men and lesbians who have renovated neighborhoods and opened new businesses in recent years. 
 In August, voters across the state overwhelming voted yes on an amendment to the State Constitution banning same-sex marriage. St. Louis, in a lonely dissent, voted no.
 The ongoing pitch to the rest of Missouri is that St. Louis's diversity is exactly what makes the city exciting, said James A. Cloar, the president and chief executive of the Downtown St. Louis Partnership, a civic development group.
 ''People outside the city have got to buy in,'' Mr. Cloar said.
 Many low-income residents outside downtown, meanwhile, will probably have to wait longer than the Kellys to see any benefit from the resurgence, advocates for the poor say. 
 Along Washington Avenue, where loft redevelopment is concentrated, the sounds of hammers and saws filled the air on a recent afternoon. Three new businesses have opened on one block in just the last few weeks, including Washington Avenue Post, which combines a coffee bar, an Internet cafe and an office supply operation. 
 A mile or two away in the city's mostly black North End, the scars of St. Louis's long fall seem unhealed, with block after block of sagging brick houses.
 The city's population, which was more than 850,000 in 1950, had fallen to 348,000 people by 2000, with many of those who left now living in the city's ring of suburbs. Unemployment is about 6.5 percent for the metropolitan area, but far higher in the North End, residents say. 
 ''If you truly create a new industry, there will be jobs,'' said the Rev. Bill Hutchison, a Jesuit priest and the founder of the Northside Community Center, a nonprofit group. ''What's happening now is not designed to hit the low-income people. It's designed to hit the mobile, professional, upper-income class.'' 
 But optimism can be an unpredictable thing, with consequences of its own, other people say. And there are hints that St. Louis might be regaining some of its old swagger. 
 Asked whether the city might suffer if Missourians came to see St. Louis as too different in its politics or too accepting of diversity, one senior city official said the risk of opprobrium was really the other way around -- that potential newcomers, drawn to a resurgent St. Louis, might not be so keen on the rest of the state.
 ''I'm not so worried that they won't tolerate us,'' said Jeff Rainford, the chief of staff to Mayor Francis G. Slay, referring to Missouri residents outside the city. ''I am a little afraid that the folks we want to come won't tolerate them.''

HEADLINE: Man Guilty In Murder Of Pregnant Companion

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
It took just a few hours yesterday for a Manhattan jury to convict a college graduate from Brooklyn of strangling his pregnant lover and dumping her body on a Far West Side sidewalk because he did not want her to have his baby. 
 Emmanuel Pierre, a diminutive 26-year-old in wire-rimmed glasses, was found guilty of second-degree murder for the June 2002 killing of Sandra Bonaventure.
 Mr. Pierre, who double-majored in psychology and economics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, had spent his six-day trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan taking copious notes. He had never before been in trouble with the law, and attended court in a dark suit each day. 
 He killed his girlfriend, prosecutors said, because he did not want the financial responsibility of a baby. They said that he had been trying to persuade Ms. Bonaventure, 20, of Westchester County, to have an abortion, but that she had decided to keep the baby. Her body was dumped on the sidewalk by Mr. Pierre and a fraternity brother.
 Ms. Bonaventure's mother, Mirlande Bonaventure, who had frequently broken down sobbing in the courtroom during the trial, expressed her satisfaction with the verdict.
 ''He thought he was going to kill my daughter and get away with it,'' Ms. Bonaventure said outside the courthouse yesterday. ''He should have the death sentence.''
 ''I'm the one who told my daughter, 'Keep your child,''' she said. ''Maybe God give you only one.''
 Justice James A. Yates, who heard the case, will sentence Mr. Pierre later this month. He faces 25 years to life in prison. 
 Mr. Pierre is the oldest of three children, born to parents he feared disappointing. His mother is a hospital worker and his father is a school bus driver, said his lawyer, Edward V. Sapone. 
 Mr. Pierre and Ms. Bonaventure met in 2000 or 2001. Both were children of Haitian immigrants, and both were college students. Ms. Bonaventure was attending SUNY College at New Paltz. She wanted to become a teacher for disabled children, her sister said. They chatted online through instant-message programs, and sometimes met on weekends.
 But the relationship was not trouble free. Mr. Pierre was dating Ms. Bonaventure's college roommate, her friends who testified at the trial said. Prosecutors portrayed Mr. Pierre as a playboy who had many girlfriends. The day after Ms. Bonaventure's death, Mr. Pierre went with one woman to a health clinic, attended a concert with another, and was driven to Cleveland for a party by a third, said David Drucker, a prosecutor.
 Things soured for good when Ms. Bonaventure got pregnant. Mr. Pierre was most afraid that his parents would find out, one of Ms. Bonaventure's friends testified.
 The last night friends and relatives said they heard from Ms. Bonaventure, she left her foster mother's house in Westchester to meet Mr. Pierre in Brooklyn. She arrived in the city after midnight and called Mr. Pierre to pick her up, Mr. Drucker said. She was seven months pregnant. 
 Mr. Drucker could not say where Ms. Bonaventure was strangled. Mr. Pierre's fraternity brother, Joshua Cayenne, testified that he helped Mr. Pierre wrap her body in trash bags and then drove around until sunrise until finally dumping it on an empty stretch of sidewalk on West 56th Street. 
 Mr. Pierre argued that Mr. Cayenne was the murderer. Mr. Cayenne has been charged with hindering the prosecution, but not with the murder.
 Mr. Drucker said phone records showed that Mr. Pierre did not call Ms. Bonaventure after that night.
 ''He knows there's no point in calling her because she can't answer the telephone in a garbage bag.''

HEADLINE: National Briefing Midwest: Wisconsin: Welfare-To-Work Success Mixed, Audit Says

BYLINE: By Gretchen Ruethling (NYT)

 BODY:
Wisconsin's welfare-to-work program, a model used by other states, has had mixed success in helping people become economically self-sufficient over the past seven years, according to a report by the state's legislative audit bureau. About 20 percent of former program participants earned more than the poverty level in their first year out of the program, the audit found. The report also said that program agencies had made more than $3 million in excess payments to some participants. The bureau made several recommendations, and the Department of Workforce Development, which administers the program, has already acted on some, like improving financial monitoring, making program sanctions more consistent and changing the way job placements are tracked, a department official said.

HEADLINE: March Retail Sales Mostly Miss Estimates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's retailers struggled with mixed sales in March as cold weather kept many shoppers indoors, but analysts said consumers' willingness to spend nonetheless appeared robust.
 According to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index, March sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.3 percent, compared with 6.8 percent in March 2004. Analysts had estimated a March increase of 4 percent. 
 Wal-Mart Stores and Limited Brands posted results yesterday that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. J.C. Penney said its sales missed estimates, while the discount department store operator Kohl's also posted an unexpected drop. May Department Stores widely missed forecasts.
 By contrast, youth-oriented apparel sellers including Abercrombie & Fitch and Bebe Stores were big winners, posting results that were sharply better than expected. The discounter Target also beat forecasts.
 Analysts said March's results showed that consumers were still willing to spend despite oil prices in the $50 range and the threat of rising interest rates, though last month showed signs of a drop-off after strong sales in January and February.
 March sales show ''consumers are still resilient, but cautiously spending,'' said Rachel Schechter, a retail analyst at Thomson Financial in New York. ''The theme that I've noticed is that teen retailers are paving the way for some great results,'' while department stores, which tend to attract older shoppers, put in a more mixed performance, Ms. Schechter added.
 The tally is based on what the industry calls same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least one year. Analysts consider same-store sales the best indicator of performance.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said its March same-store sales rose 4.3 percent, shy of the 4.4 percent predicted by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. The company also pegged quarterly earnings at the low end of its target range, and forecast a slight rise in April same-store sales, blaming the shift in the Easter holiday and continuing bad weather for its forecast.
 Limited Brands, operator of Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works, and Express clothing chains, said its same-store sales fell 7 percent, worse than the 2.2 percent decline forecast by Wall Street.
 Penney said its same-store sales edged up 0.1 percent, missing an estimated 4 percent rise. It also forecast current-quarter sales would range from flat to up slightly.
 Kohl's said its same-store sales fell 1 percent, defying expectations of a slight gain.
 In the standout teen retail sector, Abercrombie & Fitch said its sales jumped 21 percent, surpassing estimates of a 12.6 percent gain.
 Another youth apparel seller, American Eagle Outfitters, said its same-store sales climbed 29.2 percent, above forecasts of a 21.8 percent rise.
 May Department Stores said its same-store sales tumbled 10.8 percent, widely missing analysts' estimate of a decline of 3.9 percent. May, which operates Filene's, Famous-Barr and Lord & Taylor, said it was hurt by the shift of a big sales promotion to the first week of April from the end of March.
 The luxury market also had its share of disappointments. Both Neiman Marcus and Saks reported higher sales, but the gains fell short of forecasts. Neiman Marcus had a 3.4 percent same-store gain, while Saks showed a 2.3 percent same-store increase.
 Target, the nation's No.2 retailer, said its March same-store sales surged 8.2 percent, above estimates, and said it expected to meet or beat its quarterly earnings estimate.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Earnings Lift Market As Oil Prices Decline Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose as oil prices fell and Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season by reporting higher-than-expected profit. 
 Share prices ''are poised for an April-May rally if earnings come in O.K.,'' said Janna Sampson, who helps manage $1.1 billion at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Ill. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 7.07 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,191.14, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.3 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,546.32. The Nasdaq composite index added 19.65 points, or 1 percent, to 2,018.79. 
 Weakness in shares of retailers kept the benchmarks from rising more as Wal-Mart Stores said profit would be at the low end of its forecast. 
 Seven stocks advanced for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 5.9 percent less than the three-month daily average. 
 Crude oil for delivery in May tumbled 3.1 percent, to $54.11 a barrel, in New York as hedge funds and other speculators sold futures contracts on signs that increased refinery output in the United States will expand gasoline inventories. Three days ago, oil touched a record $58.28. 
 ''The market is looking through these high energy prices and seeing that they may peak,'' said Scott Vergin, who manages $2.5 billion at Thrivent Financial for Lutherans in Minneapolis. ''So much is tied to the price of oil.'' 
 Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum maker, rose $1.49, or 4.9 percent, to $31.47, the biggest gain in the Dow average. First-quarter earnings, excluding discontinued businesses and other items, were 40 cents a share. The average analyst estimate was 39 cents in a Thomson Financial survey. 
 Pfizer rose 4 cents, to $26.90, reversing earlier declines. At the request of the Food and Drug Administration, the company agreed to suspend sales of its Bextra painkiller, which generated $1.29 billion, or 2.4 percent, of Pfizer's revenue last year. Pfizer must also add the government's strictest warning to another painkiller, Celebrex. 
 ''Bextra wasn't a huge revenue source for Pfizer, so taking Bextra off the market is not in and of itself huge news,'' Ms. Sampson of Oakbrook said. 
 Wal-Mart said its net income this quarter would be close to 56 cents a share, compared with its earlier prediction of as much as 58 cents, as sales of more profitable items lag behind groceries. The stock dropped 60 cents, to $48.90; it was the biggest drag on the Dow average. 
 Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains, slumped 78 cents, to $23.86. The company said sales last month at stores open at least a year fell 7 percent from a year ago. They were expected to decline 2.2 percent, according to Thomson. 
 Starbucks slid $1.63, or 3.1 percent, to $50.50, for the second-biggest loss in the S.&P. 500. March sales rose 6 percent, the smallest gain in more than three years. They were expected to increase 7.1 percent, according to Thomson.
 Pier 1 Imports, the home furnishings retailer, fell $1, to $16.99. The company forecast a loss this quarter of 3 cents to 10 cents a share. Same-store sales in March dropped 18 percent from a year earlier, more than analysts expected. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to a price of 96 6/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.48 percent from 4.42 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: European Tax Opinion Could Mean Huge Refunds

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 7 

 BODY:
A member of Europe's highest court offered a preliminary opinion Thursday that could lead to billions of euros in tax refunds to companies at a time when many European governments can least afford them.
 On Thursday, Miguel Poiares Maduro, an advocate general on the European Court of Justice, said that British tax authorities erred in denying the retail chain Marks & Spencer the right to offset losses incurred in other European Union countries in its British tax filing. 
 If the judge's opinion is upheld, as often occurs, governments throughout Europe might face a threat to their already hard-pressed budgets. That possibility prompted Germany and six other countries to intervene in support of the British government at a court hearing last year. Their efforts apparently had little effect. 
 ''The advocate general rejects the German government's argument that the taking into account of foreign losses by the state concerned could not be permitted because it would lead to a reduction in tax revenue, and thus to major budgetary difficulties for the member state concerned,'' the court said in a statement Thursday.
 Marks & Spencer has been seeking a tax refund of more than $:30 million ($56.4 million), since 2001 from Inland Revenue, the British tax agency, to compensate it for losses in Belgium, Germany and France that it was not able to claim in those countries. Marks & Spencer incurred the losses during a doomed foray into Continental Europe in the late 1990's.
 Adam Craig, head of the European tax practice of Deloitte Touche, commented, ''Britain could face a bill of up to $:1 billion.''
 Sixty other companies have filed claims similar to Marks & Spencer's in the British courts, and Thursday's opinion could become legal precedent for them. Those companies include British Telecom; the British subsidiary of BNP Paribas; and three American companies with large operations in Britain, the H.J. Heinz food company, PepsiCo and the construction equipment maker Caterpillar.
 ''There are hundreds of others that have made similar claims in their tax returns,'' Mr. Craig noted.
 Analysts said Germany in particular had good reason to be worried about the Marks & Spencer case. 
 ''If the final ruling permits retroactive claims, then the German government could face a bill of 30 billion euros,'' said Isabelle Kronawitter, an economist with the German bank HVB. That, she said, was her estimate of losses at German subsidiaries in other countries in the European Union from 1998 to 2002. 
 The issue of retroactivity, however, has not yet been decided. The court will ultimately rule on whether companies are allowed to claim past losses, which will determine the impact on national treasuries across Europe. 
 ''It's 50-50,'' Ms. Kronawitter said of chances for retroactivity, adding that the court may decide not to allow it so that member states could have time to adjust their tax laws.
 Mr. Craig, however, felt sure the ruling would allow retroactive claims. ''It would be surprising if the companies that have already made claims are unable to get their money back,'' he said.
 Mr. Maduro, the judge, stressed that a company should not be able to get a double tax advantage by registering the loss both at home and in the country where the losses occurred.

HEADLINE: DUKE ENERGY PRESSES FOR CARBON DIOXIDE TAX

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The Duke Energy Corporation will lobby for a tax on carbon dioxide emissions to reduce fuel consumption and address global warming, the company's chairman and chief executive said yesterday. ''Personally, I feel the time has come to act to take steps as a nation to reduce the carbon intensity of our economy,'' Paul Anderson told business and civil leaders at a breakfast meeting in Charlotte, N.C. ''And it's going to take all of us to do it.'' Mr. Anderson acknowledged that a national carbon tax would mean bigger utility bills and higher prices at the gas pump for consumers. But unless industry leaders take the lead, he said, the long-term outcome could be even more disastrous. The Duke Power Company, Duke Energy's regulated utility, relies heavily on carbon-based coal and nuclear energy to produce nearly all of its power.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Sees Gasoline Prices Moving Higher Still, a Political Hazard for Bush

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7 

 BODY:
The government projected on Thursday that gasoline prices would surge even higher in coming weeks and remain high through the summer, a forecast underscoring both the economic effect of the sharp rise in energy costs and growing political risks for President Bush.
 The Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department, said it expected the price of unleaded regular gasoline to hit a peak national average of $2.35 a gallon in May and to average $2.28 from April through September. Last week the average price was $2.22.
 With crude oil prices at record highs in recent weeks and still close to them, the White House is casting itself as immersed in addressing the problem. It is using the increase in oil and gasoline prices to raise the pressure on Congress to pass Mr. Bush's stalled energy bill, which the administration says would encourage domestic oil exploration and production, support alternative energy sources and improve conservation. 
 Mr. Bush discussed energy prices with his cabinet on Tuesday and is sure to raise the subject during a meeting being planned for this month with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer.
 But Democrats say they intend to use the renewed focus on energy issues to revive their case that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, both of whom worked in the oil business, are more interested in helping oil companies than in helping consumers. And several recent polls suggest that the spike in oil prices and the resulting rise in gasoline prices have undermined Mr. Bush's political standing. 
 ''When gas prices go up to the level they're at now, they are in some ways the economic equivalent of the color-coded terrorism alerts,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ''They work their way through into public opinion very quickly in terms of affecting people's opinions about the direction of the nation and raising the stakes on pocketbook issues generally.''
 An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey published Thursday showed a drop in approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the economy to 41 percent from 46 percent two months ago. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released this week found an even sharper drop, to 41 percent from 48 percent five weeks earlier.
 Analysts said consumer concern about what it costs to fill up at the pump was also pulling down the percentage of people who think the country is on the right track. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 34 percent of respondents said the country was headed in the right direction, down from 42 percent in February. 
 The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll found the price of gasoline rivaling terrorism and health care as the top issues among respondents, well ahead of the priority Mr. Bush has put at the top of his agenda, overhauling Social Security.
 ''Certainly if it goes on for a while, it's a risk,'' said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster. 
 The administration has shown no sign of rethinking its opposition to releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a means of trying to force prices down.
 ''We are concerned about rising gasoline prices and rising energy prices,'' said Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary. ''They are a drag on our growing economy. That's all the more reason why Congress needs to act to pass the president's comprehensive energy strategy that he outlined four years ago.''
 Energy Department officials said that despite the higher gasoline prices in coming months, with the average projected to be 38 cents a gallon more this summer than last, they did not expect any drop in demand.
 Though gasoline has established itself well above $2 around the country lately, demand is up about 1.8 percent over this time last year, said Guy F. Caruso, administrator of the Energy Information Administration.
 Mr. Caruso added that the price of gasoline was still a small part of the cost of driving a car, including insurance and car payments, and that for a typical car, driven 12,000 miles a year and getting 20 miles a gallon, the increase would mean about $180 in higher annual costs. 
 But steep increases in gasoline prices tend to have repercussions as much political as economic.
 ''This is not just an economic problem,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ''It is also, in the public judgment, a national security problem. There is a widespread belief in the country that the problem could be solved or a real dent made in it, but that this administration, because it is tied to big oil, is unwilling to take the steps necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.''
 Administration officials said they were assuming that the surge in prices would help put pressure on Congress to pass Mr. Bush's energy plan. Already, Republicans in the Senate have shown for the first time that they have the votes to include in that bill the authorization for drilling in a section of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
 The rise in oil and gasoline prices could also provide another reason for the nation to embrace Mr. Bush's call for the spread of democracy in the Middle East, a source of nearly 20 percent of the nation's oil. A more stable, democratic Middle East would presumably reduce concerns about interruptions in the flow of oil. 
 For now, though, the first signs that the seeds of democracy are germinating in the region are being accompanied not by lower crude oil prices but by near-record highs.
 And Democrats say they intend to use gasoline prices to reopen issues they have previously invoked to hold up the Bush energy bill, among them their call for an increase in fuel economy standards.

HEADLINE: Chinese Navy Buildup Gives Pentagon New Worries

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and THOM SHANKER; Jim Yardley reported from Zhanjiang for this article, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

DATELINE: ZHANJIANG, China 

 BODY:
At a time when the American military is consumed with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, global terrorism and the threat of nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran, China is presenting a new and strategically different security concern to America, as well as to Japan and Taiwan, in the western Pacific, Pentagon and military officials say.
 China, these officials say, has smartly analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the American military and has focused its growing defense spending on weapons systems that could exploit the perceived American weaknesses in case the United States ever needs to respond to fighting in Taiwan.
 A decade ago, American military planners dismissed the threat of a Chinese attack against Taiwan as a 100-mile infantry swim. The Pentagon now believes that China has purchased or built enough amphibious assault ships, submarines, fighter jets and short-range missiles to pose an immediate threat to Taiwan and to any American force that might come to Taiwan's aid.
 In the worst case in a Taiwan crisis, Pentagon officials say that any delay in American aircraft carriers reaching the island would mean that the United States would initially depend on fighter jets and bombers based on Guam and Okinawa, while Chinese forces could use their amphibious ships to go back and forth across the narrow Taiwan Strait. 
 Some American military analysts believe China could now defeat Taiwan before American forces could arrive at the scene, leaving a political decision about whether to attack, even though Taiwan would already be lost.
 Even the most hawkish officials at the Pentagon do not believe China is preparing for an imminent invasion of Taiwan. Nor do analysts believe China is any match for the United States military. But as neighboring North Korea is erratically trying to play the nuclear card, China is quietly challenging America's reach in the western Pacific by concentrating strategically on conventional forces.
 ''They are building their force to deter and delay our ability to intervene in a Taiwan crisis,'' said Eric McVadon, a former military attache at the United States Embassy in Beijing. ''What they have done is cleverly develop some capabilities that have the prospect of attacking our niche vulnerabilities.''
 China's rapid military modernization is the major reason President Bush has warned the European Union not to lift its arms embargo against Beijing. At the same time, some officials in Washington, particularly on Capitol Hill, would like Taiwan to buy more American arms to beef up its own defenses.
 Japan, America's closest ally in East Asia and China's rival for regional dominance, is also watching China's buildup and reorganizing its own military. The Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has echoed President Bush by calling on Europe to leave the arms embargo against China in place. A research center affiliated with Japan's Defense Ministry has also criticized China's increased military spending and cautioned that Beijing was rushing to prepare for possible conflict with Taiwan, an assertion China sharply denied.
 The growing friction between Japan and China, fueled by rising nationalism in both countries, is just one of the political developments adding to tensions in East Asia. In March, China passed a controversial new ''antisecession'' law authorizing a military attack if top leaders in Beijing believe Taiwan moves too far toward independence -- a move that brought hundreds of thousands of people in Taiwan out to protest China's most recent military white paper also alarmed American policy makers because it mentioned the United States by name for the first time since 1998. It stated that the American presence in the region ''complicated security factors.'' China, meanwhile, accused the United States and Japan of meddling in a domestic Chinese matter when Washington and Tokyo recently issued a joint security statement that listed peace in Taiwan as a ''common strategic objective.''
 ''The potential for a miscalculation or an incident here has actually increased, just based on the rhetoric over the past six months to a year,'' one American intelligence analyst in Washington said.
 At a welcoming ceremony on March 28 for the command ship Blue Ridge, of the American Seventh Fleet, here at the home base of China's South Sea Fleet, the American commanding officer, Capt. J. Stephen Maynard, and his Chinese counterpart, Senior Capt. Wen Rulang, sidestepped questions about the antisecession law and military tensions. Asked about China's military buildup and how America should view it, Captain Wen praised the United States Navy as the most modern in the world.
 ''As for China,'' Captain Wen said, ''our desire is to upgrade China's self-defense capabilities.''
 In China's view, however, self-defense involves Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province and which the United States, by treaty, has suggested it would help defend. In 1996, when China fired warning-shot missiles across the Taiwan Strait before the Taiwanese elections, President Clinton responded by sending a carrier battle group to a position near Taiwan. Then, China could do nothing about it, Now, analysts say, it can.
 In fact, American carriers responding to a crisis would now initially have to operate at least 500 miles from Taiwan, which would reduce the number of fighter sorties they could launch. This is because China now has a modern fleet of submarines, including new Russian-made nuclear subs that can fire missiles from a submerged position. America would first need to subdue these submarines.
 China launched 13 attack submarines between 2002 and 2004, a period when it also built 23 ships that can ferry tanks, armored vehicles and troops across the 100-mile strait. Tomohide Murai, an expert on the Chinese military at the National Defense Academy in Tokyo, said that China's buildup is intended to focus on an American response, but he is skeptical that China already has the naval and air superiority over Taiwan to dominate the strait. 
 But Mr. Murai said China's military would continue to expand and modernize for years to come because of the country's booming economy, while Japan is restricted by budget constraints and its World War II era Constitution. Chinese subs and Japanese vessels already have played politically explosive cat-and-mouse games around a string of islands claimed by both countries.
 ''The speed of our modernization is not so rapid as in China,'' Mr. Murai said. ''Many people in Japan worry that the balance eventually will be less favorable.''
 China, meanwhile, often expresses concern about rising militarism in Japan and notes that Japan spends more on its military budget -- a debatable point since Western experts say China vastly understates its own military spending. China also worries that the United States Navy could be used to try to cut off oil supplies if a conflict ever arises over Taiwan.
 Asked about growing concerns in Washington over China's military buildup, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, said: ''American worries are unnecessary. We stick to the path of peaceful development, and we do not pose threats to American influence.''
 Robert Karniol, an Asia specialist at Jane's Defense Weekly, noted that Japan is also modernizing its military in a significant way, largely as its competes with China for regional dominance in Asia. He said Japan is restructuring the independent branches of its military under a unified command modeled after the American Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 And just as Japan is looking at China, he said, so is China looking past Taiwan at Japan. China's naval upgrades will not only strengthen its hand against Taiwan but also expand its influence around Asia.
 ''If the Taiwan issue was resolved next month, China's military modernization would not end,'' Mr. Karniol said. ''The Chinese understand that if their ambition is to become the dominant power in Asia -- well, who can disrupt that? The United States and Japan.''


CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about Pentagon concerns over China's military buildup referred incorrectly to the United States policy on the defense of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province. It is in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 -- not a treaty -- that the United States suggests that it would help defend Taiwan.

HEADLINE: Europe's Economy Hit Hard By Rapid Rise in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 7 

 BODY:
With oil trading well above $50 a barrel, the European Central Bank said Thursday that the high price was ''very unwelcome,'' pulling down Europe's growth and pushing up inflation.
 ''We are now at a level that is very, very high,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank's president, said at a news conference where he announced that the bank would not raise interest rates.
 Europe's economy has shown signs of faltering in recent weeks, most visibly in surveys that report sharp drops in German industrial production and business confidence. On Monday, the European Commission cut its 2005 growth forecast for the 12-nation euro zone to 1.6 percent, from 2 percent. 
 The drumbeat of bad news has forced the European Central Bank to put off a long-signaled increase in its benchmark rate, which remains at 2 percent, a record low in the post-World War II period. In Britain, which is outside the European monetary union, the Bank of England also voted Thursday to leave its benchmark rate unchanged.
 ''Oil is by far the biggest threat to the world economy, and it is felt most by the weakest link, the European Union,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London.
 Mr. Mayer said high oil prices were most likely the main culprit for Germany's recent spate of bad numbers, including a surprising 2.2 percent decline in industrial production in February. Germany, as a major importer of oil, is particularly sensitive to spikes in the price.
 Rising oil prices, however, also stoke inflation, which remains slightly above the 2 percent threshold set by the European Central Bank. The bank is laboring to balance its primary mission -- serving as a sentinel against inflation -- against its responsibility to foster economic growth.
 Mr. Trichet made it clear that the bank still hoped to tighten monetary policy. A rate cut, which some economists advocate, is not an option, he said Thursday. But at the same time, he said the bank's governors did not discuss raising rates at their monthly policy meeting.
 Sifting through the nuances of Mr. Trichet's pronouncements, most bank watchers now believe that a rate increase will not occur before the summer, and perhaps not until the end of the year.
 ''The bank's underlying message is the same, but his tone was somewhat less hawkish,'' said Jorg Kramer of the HVB Group in Munich.
 He said he worried that the bank's unwillingness to budge -- this is the 22nd month without a change in rates -- was contributing to a bubble in property prices in some countries. Since 1998, he said, housing prices in Spain and France have risen more than in the United States.
 Mr. Trichet described the economic data as mixed, saying it offered no evidence that Europe's fragile economy had gained any traction. He acknowledged that housing prices had risen sharply in a few countries.
 Still, Mr. Trichet said the expansion of Europe's money supply and the loosening of credit was a cause for concern.
 Political shadows now also loom over the European Central Bank and its common currency. In France, the faltering recovery and stubbornly high unemployment have swelled public opposition to the European Union's Constitution, which faces a referendum in late May.
 Mr. Trichet, a Frenchman, said he believed that the Constitution would be approved. He urged doubters to recall the days before Europe adopted the euro, a period he said was one of chronic instability.

HEADLINE: Indians' Wish List: Big-City Sites for Casinos

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

DATELINE: DENVER, April 1 

 BODY:
The Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians have not had land in Colorado since many of their women and children were massacred in their sleep by soldiers at Sand Creek in 1864. Driven out of the state, they live today in poor rural areas scattered around Oklahoma.
 But the tribes are now offering Colorado a gift of $1 billion and are willing to give up their ancestral claims to nearly half of the state, all in exchange for a 500-acre piece of land near Denver on which they hope to build one of the world's largest casinos, complete with a five-star hotel, a golf course, a mall and an Indian cultural center. 
 ''This would be more than a casino for us,'' said Clara Bushyhead, a spokeswoman for the tribes. ''It is the dream of our elders to complete our life cycle, to come back to our homeland in Colorado from which we were driven. Oklahoma was never our home.'' 
 Their campaign for a casino in Denver reflects the latest trend in the explosive growth of Indian gambling: tribes in remote areas, some of them without reservations, trying to acquire land near cities for lucrative casinos. It is a practice known as off-reservation gambling. Its critics use a harsher phrase, reservation shopping.
 Currently there are efforts by several tiny landless bands of Indians in California to build casinos in three cities on San Francisco Bay. There are also proposals by three tribes, now in Oklahoma, to construct casinos in Ohio, where they once lived. And there are tribes in Wisconsin and Oklahoma, originally from New York, that have proposed exchanging their land claims for the right to build casinos in the Catskills. 
 Revenues for tribal casinos reached $18.5 billion last year, double the take of all the casinos in Nevada, according to the National Indian Gaming Association. That is up from $5.4 billion in 1995. With that kind of money in Indian gambling, the drive for permission to build casinos far from reservations is drawing protests from more established Indian gambling operations that do not want more local competition, as well as from tribes that built casinos on their own remote lands, limiting the kinds of profits they can make.
 The trend has also come under scrutiny in Congress, where the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, headed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is examining such proposals and where lawmakers in both houses are considering more stringent rules, like banning tribes from moving across state borders and giving greater say to other tribes that would be affected. 
 Certainly, the push for off-reservation gambling is not what Congress had in mind when in 1988 it passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act legalizing Indian casinos. Congress envisioned that the law would help impoverished tribes on remote and already existing reservations in states like South Dakota or New Mexico open small casinos as a way to create jobs and, perhaps, foster long-needed economic development.
 In many ways, the law has been successful. There are now 411 tribes operating casinos that employ 553,000 people, the National Indian Gaming Association calculates.
 ''The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is the only Indian act that ever worked,'' said Keller George, the president of the United South and Eastern Tribes, a confederation of 24 tribes ranging from Maine to Florida and South Carolina to Texas.
 But Mr. George opposes off-reservation gambling. ''When you have tribes that want to cross state lines and travel thousands of miles to build casinos, then we object,'' he told a meeting of state officials and Indian leaders at a conference of the Western Governors' Association. 
 The reason is largely economic. If the tribes from Oklahoma and Wisconsin succeed in exchanging their land claims for casinos in the Catskills, for example, they would directly compete with a similar plan by the Oneida tribe, to which Mr. George belongs.
 The proposal for the casino near Denver grew out of an effort to help the Cheyenne and Arapaho in Oklahoma by Steve Hillard, a venture capitalist from Golden, just outside Denver, who has specialized in making investments to benefit Native American groups, particularly those in Alaska. 
 In 2001, Mr. Hillard and his company, Council Tree Communications, which had a minority stake in Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network, made money for Native Alaskan corporations that were his investors when Telemundo was sold to NBC for $2.7 billion.
 Mr. Hillard, who grew up in Colorado, said he had long wanted to find a deal that would help the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and so two years ago he called their tribal leaders proposing to acquire a chain of radio stations for them.
 But after a visit to Oklahoma, Mr. Hillard changed his plans. 
 ''What I saw was 11,500 people locked in a generational cycle of poverty, with 70 percent unemployment,'' he said.
 ''It was clear that no set of radio stations were going to make a difference for these tribes,'' Mr. Hillard said.
 The tribal leaders offered a different idea. They wanted to return to Colorado and they wanted to open a casino.
 ''A casino offers us both a way to break out of years of poverty and a way to return to our land, which is the most important thing to Native Americans,'' said Bill Blind, the vice chairman of the two tribes' business committee. ''We believe land takes care of us.''
 The Cheyenne and Arapaho already operate two casinos in Oklahoma, but they are small and in rural areas more than 10 miles from a major highway, so their profits come to only $7 million a year, tribal leaders say.
 Under federal law, if a tribe wants to open a casino on land it does not already control as part of a reservation, it must get permission both from the governor and the secretary of the interior. So Mr. Hillard decided on a bold two-pronged strategy, a stick and a carrot.
 The stick was to file claims with the Department of the Interior in April last year for 27 million acres in Colorado that the Cheyenne and Arapaho said were theirs under an 1851 treaty. 
 As the carrot, Mr. Hillard proposed that the tribes would pay Colorado $1 billion up front, or about 10 years worth of the projected profits from the casino, which the Indians have envisioned as one of the largest in the world, with up to 5,000 slot machines. The $400 million project would also generate about $100 million annually in profits for the tribes, according to Mr. Hillard's projection. 
 The tribes would also give up their broader claims for land in Colorado.
 But Gov. Bill Owens rejected the plan, leaving the project at an impasse. In an interview, Mr. Owens, a Republican, said his opposition was not a moral ''Christian right kind of thing.'' But he said he worried about the social and economic consequences of gambling, and under the state's Constitution, he insisted, before a gambling proposal can be approved, it must be put to a popular vote.
 Mr. Hillard says the tribes can wait out the governor. Mr. Owens's term expires next year, and he cannot run again because of a term limit.
 ''We have also gotten very heartening overtures from three or four communities around Denver who want our project in their towns for economic development,'' Mr. Hillard said. ''And we think the people of Colorado will get interested in that $1 billion.''
 The tribes are also stepping up the pressure on the state, saying they are preparing to file a lawsuit in federal court on the broad land claims, which cover all of Denver and could endanger the property rights of many Coloradans.
 Governor Owens dismisses that threat, noting that in 1965 tribal leaders agreed to a $15 million settlement. 
 But Mr. Blind, the vice chairman of the business committee, said there was evidence that the tribal leaders at the time did not understand what they were doing. 
 ''Would you sell Colorado to us for 2.75 cents an acre?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Answers a Gay Group; Miller Offers a Tax Break Plan

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic candidate for mayor, came under fire from gay rights advocates on Wednesday night for his vote as a Bronx city councilman in 1986 in favor of amending the city's landmark gay rights law.
 At the Greater Voices mayoral forum, organized by several gay, bisexual and transgender groups at New York University, Allen Roskoff, a longtime gay rights advocate, accused Mr. Ferrer of voting to weaken the measure and asked him to explain. 
 Mr. Ferrer, who had clearly anticipated the question, called the amendment a ''side agreement'' that was necessary to hold together the ''fragile coalition'' that passed the antidiscrimination bill, 15 years in the making.
 The law, proposed by Mayor Edward I. Koch, amended the city's administrative code to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing, employment and public accommodations, but it provided exceptions, among them owner-occupied dwellings of one or two families.
 The amendment would also have exempted owner-occupied three- and four-family homes, an issue that became part of the negotiations before passage of the original bill. But the Council agreed to consider that exemption separately.
 The Council passed it, but it was ultimately vetoed by the mayor. 
 ''Choices aren't always perfect,'' Mr. Ferrer said on Wednesday to sustained applause, ''but I'm proud to have played a role not only in that coalition but preserving that coalition.''
 Yesterday, another Democratic candidate for mayor, Council Speaker Gifford Miller, proposed that the city offer new tax credits to businesses that provide jobs in biotechnology, entertainment and other growing industries in an effort to spur economic development.
 ''Instead of leveraging our own natural advantages, New York has fallen behind for the simple reason that we don't invest in biotechnology enough, or do more to incubate new businesses,'' Mr. Miller told educators at a job fair sponsored by the City University of New York.
 Mr. Miller said he planned to introduce legislation to create the tax credits in his response next week to the fiscal 2006 budget proposed this year by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 It would be modeled after legislation that already offers tax incentives for movies and television shows that are filmed in the city.
 In addition, Mr. Miller said he would call for expanding an existing college scholarship program to help students gain work experience in biotechnology and other fields. 
 Mr. Miller, who received the endorsement of the Brooklyn Democratic Party's executive committee last night, sought to present his economic development proposals as a more realistic alternative to Mayor Bloomberg's plan to help build a football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Ford Lowers Its Earnings Forecast for Year

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 8 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company lowered its earnings forecast for the year on Friday, citing higher gas prices and rising health care costs. The company said it would also abandon its goal of $7 billion in pretax profit by 2006, a cornerstone of the turnaround plan that its chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., put in place after he took control in 2001.
 Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, now expects to earn $1.25 to $1.50 a share for the year, down from its previous guidance of $1.75 to $1.90 a share.
 In addition, Ford warned that pretax profit at its automotive division would ''break even at best,'' down from an earlier forecast of at least $1.5 billion, an indication that it would have to again rely on its financing division, Ford Credit, to turn a profit. 
 Friday's announcement was the second from a Detroit automaker in recent weeks that reinforces the dim outlook for American automakers. Last month, General Motors cut its earnings forecast for the year to a range of $1 to $2 a share, down from $4 to $5 and said it would lose close to $850 million in the first quarter alone. That announcement put G.M.'s already tenuous investment-grade rating in further peril as Standard & Poor's put the automaker on negative outlook, indicating it could cut G.M.'s rating to junk status. 
 The reaction to Ford's pared-down earnings guidance was similar. Standard & Poor's, which currently rates Ford at its lowest investment-grade level, revised its debt rating outlook to negative on Friday and said it could cut Ford to junk status at any point if it determined the company was not poised for a turnaround.
 Shares of Ford fell 27 cents on Friday to $11.03, before the company revised its earnings outlook. After the announcement, the shares fell 5 percent, to as low as $10.49 in after-hours trading. 
 Ford's difficulties mirror those of G.M., its more financially strained crosstown rival. Both companies face substantial costs associated with paying health care for current workers and retirees; both have seen an increase in the price of commodities like steel; and both face intense competition from Asian automakers, which are chipping away at the market shares of Ford and G.M. as the dollar weakens.
 Ford and G.M are also having a difficult time getting Americans to buy their cars while the Asian auto companies are seeing record sales in the United States. Last month, Ford's sales were down 4.9 percent compared with a year ago, and G.M. reported a 1.5 percent drop. Over all, auto sales were up slightly less than 1 percent for the month.
 While many auto industry analysts and executives say the rising cost of gasoline is slowing sales for domestic automakers, particularly sales of sport utility vehicles and trucks, Ford and G.M. differ on the issue. Ford cited high fuel costs as a major factor in its declining profits, something G.M. has not done.
 Ford's chief financial officer, Don Leclair, said in a statement, ''the company's analysis of recent market trends, which include the prospect of higher and sustained gasoline prices and continued aggressive pricing actions by competitors, have led us to conclude that further challenges lie ahead.'' 
 An automotive analyst at Burnham Securities, David Healy, said ''Ford is admitting it, and G.M. is still in denial.'' Mr. Healy added that Ford would probably cut production of its larger S.U.V.'s like the Explorer and Expedition. 
 ''It's the biggest S.U.V.'s that are building up too much in inventories,'' he said, ''and they're going to have to whack production.''
 Perhaps just as telling as Ford's announcement that it would miss its yearly earnings forecast is the company's decision to abandon its goal of making a $7 billion profit before taxes by next year. 
 That goal was crucial to the long-term revitalization plan Mr. Ford set when he took over in 2001.
 ''Obviously there are actions we could take to achieve our pretax profit goal of $7 billion for 2006, but we will not mortgage Ford's future by chasing an objective set under vastly different market and economic conditions,'' Mr. Ford said in a statement.

HEADLINE: At 15, Dreaming Big Dreams: Oh, to Be a Scholar 

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICALI, Mexico 

 BODY:
ALICIA ALVAREZ lives two miles from the American border and light-years from the American dream.
 Growing up in Mexicali has made her a realist at 15. She has no taste for romances and soap operas. Harry Potter stories and a horror movie at the mall are as far away as fictions take her from her city's heat and dust.
 Alicia has a fierce intelligence, and it fires her only soaring ambition: to get a decent education, schooling that could lift her up and out of her surroundings into a better life. It looks to her as likely as a trip to Mars. 
 ''It seems impossible,'' Alicia said with a shy, distant gaze. She has started high school, having proved herself one of the brightest girls in her city, a straight-A student with an exceptional aptitude for math.
 ''My family has no money for college,'' she said. ''I probably will never get to a university, though I would love to. 
 ''My education has been hard. My teachers are trained in teaching, not in math and science. It's a struggle for them to teach me what I need to be taught. To learn what I want to know. And I want to know so much.''
 She finds herself, like her country, poised with one foot in the door of opportunity and one stuck in the poverty and powerlessness of the past. But with her fine mind, the idea of having a better life than one's parents, while distant, is still a shimmering possibility.
 Her father, David Osuna, 46, works part time selling used cars. He has good weeks and bad weeks. Her mother, Alicia Alvarez, 48, keeps house. They have provided their children with the basics of life: food, clothes, shelter. Their slender, dutiful, deep-thinking daughter is a bit of a mystery to them.
 Alicia's brothers, David, 21, and Luis, 16, are in awe of her intelligence, respectful, sometimes distant. David is the one in whom she sometimes confides her dreams.
 ALICIA'S uncle and godfather, Abel Alvarez, 56, knows her aspirations. He grew up behind a plow, and then crossed over the border when he was her age to work the fields of the Imperial Valley in California. He now earns a good living in construction, a self-made man who builds malls in El Centro, Calif., 15 minutes north of Mexicali.
 He has watched Alicia grow up with a mixture of pride and worry. 
 ''It's not a lot easier growing up in Mexicali now than it was 40 years ago,'' he said. ''The pie's a little bigger, but a lot more people want a slice. Growing up here, you go up against all that, and with the United States and all its riches just over the line.''
 Mexico's economy has been flat for almost five years. Poverty is ever-present. The middle class is small; it has been shrinking for a generation. Stealing into the United States is often the only way out.
 Alicia has seen what is over the line, having traveled with her uncle and cousins on short trips to Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside, halfway between Los Angeles and Palm Springs. ''I love Riverside best of all, it's so pretty,'' she said. ''So much greenery, so many trees. It's the cleanest, greenest place I've ever seen.''
 But Alicia says the idea of sneaking across the border to live and work holds no attraction for her. ''I don't want to migrate,'' she said flatly. There is no legal path for her, and she does not want to be an outlaw.
 She is a bit better off than many other young Mexicans, especially the millions living in the countryside whose families struggle for enough to eat, and she would not risk what little she has for a gamble in a strange land.
 Still, Alicia sometimes feels the walls of her cinder-block house closing in on her. The heat rises above 100 degrees in Mexicali for almost half the year. The house is crowded, and the closeness sometimes chafes at family life and familial love.
 ''We quarrel sometimes,'' she says. ''We don't always get along. My parents don't always think the way I do.'' When the little house gets too hot, too close, she finds refuge in books, or when there is a little money to spare, alone at the movies, at a mall a mile from home on the edge of the city, near where the desert begins.
 She has become, of late, more of a loner, though she has a best friend, Karen Aguilar. ''She is my one close friend, Karen, and no one else,'' Alicia said. ''We grew up together. We shared secrets and all that. We used to spend all our free time together. But now she works, and I have to study, and time seems so short.''
 Karen, 16, used to visit Alicia almost every day. ''We'd go hide in her room, play music, dance together, talk about boys and things,'' Karen said. ''If we went out, it would be to walk to the mall, look at clothes. She is often a shy girl, but with me, she'll open up.''
 But things are changing. Karen's father forbade her to go to Alicia's 15th birthday celebration last year, a day that serves as the formal presentation of a girl as a woman in Mexican society. It traditionally is marked first with a formal Catholic Mass, then with the best party a girl's family can afford.
 Karen's parents are Jehovah's Witnesses, and they objected to her going to a Catholic church. The schism almost broke Alicia's heart. While not a deeply devout Catholic, Alicia took the ritual seriously -- the Mass is the last of its kind that a Mexican girl receives before her marriage.
 Karen's absence was marked by an empty chair at the party afterward, held in an electricians' union hall. A D.J. played Eminem. Many of the girls danced with one another in a tight circle, dressed in tube tops, hot pants and tiny minidresses, making sexy hip-shaking moves stolen from music videos.
 Alicia danced chastely, outside the edge of the circle, moving slowly in her creamy beige gown.
 The priest and her elders had said this was to be the most beautiful day of her life. On the first night of summer, under a new moon, she was turning from a girl into a woman. The party made her parents happy, and that made Alicia happy.
 But the ritual was a little empty, like her friend's place at the table, and the romance of it all felt rented, like the hall. She was dancing alone, a world apart.
 SHE has once or twice held hands with boys. There have been ''little kisses,'' but nothing else, she says. She is not ready for the intensity and confusion of sex. Her mind is growing fast. But her body is starting to catch up. Sometimes she feels that when she looks in the mirror, she sees a different person every day.
 ''I know I'm changing,'' she said. ''I'm not the same as I was when I was a child. But I'm not grown up either.
 ''There have been guys who say they want to be my boyfriend,'' she said. ''I tell them no. I tell them I don't want that. I tell them I'm special. I'm different. I haven't been attracted to them. I tell them that, and sometimes it makes me feel ugly. But no one whom I've been attracted to has asked me.
 ''Boys are not what I think about, not that much,'' she said. ''What I think about when I'm alone is growing up. Because I have to grow up, I have to think about high school, and then how I am going to find a way to go to a university despite having no money? If I get there, what I am going to study.''
 Mexico has made strides in public education over the past 25 years, particularly in primary schools, but not nearly enough. Only one of seven children entering first grade finishes high school.
 ''Maybe half the students who finish eighth grade don't have access to a good high school,'' said Rafael Rangel, chancellor of Tec de Monterrey, Mexico's most prestigious university. ''We haven't built enough high schools or trained enough teachers. It's a terrible situation. Many of the kids who do make it through high school have no access to a university.''
 ''There's no bigger problem in Mexico,'' he said.
 If Alicia is struggling for answers, so is her country. Her life is a long list of questions, including the biggest of all: what she will be when she grows up.
 ''Maybe the best I can hope for is to find a teacher in high school who can teach me accounting, and then a job keeping the books at some business,'' she said. ''Still, I would love to be a real scholar, to go to a university and make my life better than that.''

This is the first article in a series examining the challenges and aspirations of young people in countries around the world.

HEADLINE: Trade Quotas? Ah, the Good Old Days

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands 

 BODY:
This quiet little American territory, a tropical island that struggled for years to improve working conditions in its sweatshops, may now lose many of its apparel factories to free market forces.
 The factories could fall victim to a flood of cheap Chinese clothing surging into the United States. And as Saipan's factories close or cut jobs, thousands of workers -- most of them Chinese women -- are left with a cruel choice: go back to China's real sweatshops and earn a fraction of their current pay or stay in Saipan, where the prospects for legal work are dim at best. 
 ''There have been ups and downs in the past,'' said Lu Jian Ping, a seamstress who has been here for 13 years, working to support her son, who is a university student in China. But now that she has been laid off along with 400 workers at her factory, she is convinced that ''this time is different.'' 
 Since garment trade quotas ended worldwide on Jan. 1, four of Saipan's factories, which have long benefited from tariff-free access to the American market, have closed. Orders to the rest have plummeted. About 1,585 workers have lost their jobs. 
 While Washington is moving to impose some restraints to soften the blow from the explosion in Chinese apparel exports, the largest company here, Concorde Garment Manufacturing, says it may still have to let go hundreds of workers by June. The Saipan Garment Manufacturers Association predicts sales could drop by 50 percent in 2005. 
 This is all part of a long-awaited global shift driven by the lifting of country-by-country quotas, allowing the fashion industry to develop a more efficient worldwide supply network. In January, Chinese clothing exports to the United States jumped to $1.2 billion, a 75 percent increase over a year earlier, according to Chinese government trade figures. For the first two months of the year, China quadrupled its exports of knit and synthetic tops -- a Saipan specialty -- to the United States. 
 ''We are down by 28 percent; it's brutal,'' Richard A. Pierce, executive director of the industry association, said of those categories. ''It is happening so quickly now, every factory in our association is downsizing. We guess we will lose 3 to 10 more factories by the end of this year.''
 In the past, Saipan's annual clothing shipments to the American mainland were roughly equal to one month of China's clothing exports to the United States. In the 2004 fiscal year, Saipan sold $821 million worth of garments, well below the peak of $1.05 billion in 1999. But soon, Saipan's sales, when compared with China's, may be measured in days.
 ''We want our tickets. We want to go home,'' a dozen newly unemployed women chanted here recently outside the office of Saipan's governor, Juan N. Babauta.
 In interviews, several Chinese women said they could go home to do the same sewing job in China, but for 30 cents an hour; here they get $3.05. Or they could stay in Saipan, where the most lucrative option is a furtive life of hunting male tourists who will pay $50 for a ''special massage.''
 ''It is very hard to get a new job,'' said a four-year veteran of the garment factories, who called herself Doudou. ''A lot of the girls now working in Garapan as prostitutes used to be garment workers.''
 Perhaps not by coincidence, one week after the American and European clothing markets opened to unchecked imports from China, Governor Babauta signed a no-loitering law, and the police installed closed-circuit TV cameras in Garapan, Saipan's bar district, where massage parlors beckon to beachfront hotels. Within days, six Chinese women, all former garment workers, were detained by the police for solicitation, a step that led to deportation hearings.
 ''Many people come to me, crying, saying, 'What can I do to pay my bills?''' said Qian Ma, a Chinese translator for a federal office that works with garment workers. ''There is going to be more prostitution, more robbery. The best solution is for people to go home.''
 But the island government has mismanaged a worker repatriation fund and a bankruptcy insurance system, according to James J. Benedetto, ombudsman here for the Interior Department.
 As clothing makers around the globe adjust to the brave new world of markets to benefit consumers, the economy here offers a clear illustration of the impact on producers long sheltered from full competition.
 Garment production started here two decades ago as part of an effort by Washington to encourage growth and to cut taxpayer subsidies to this island, twice the size of Manhattan and 3,800 miles west of Hawaii. 
 The framers of the covenant between the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and the United States allowed Saipan to control its own immigration policy, to set its own minimum wage rate and to send garments to the American mainland duty free, with the label ''Made in the U.S.A.,'' and in unlimited quantities as long as workers here added at least 50 percent to the value. 
 During the Clinton administration, Congress sought to strip the islands of their exemption from the minimum wage and immigration laws. The Senate approved the legislation.
 But a Republican lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, working with Representative Tom DeLay, the Texas Republican, managed to get the legislation defeated in the House, using the argument that the Marianas represented low taxes and free enterprise and should be left alone.
 [Mr. Abramoff's ties to Mr. DeLay are now the subject of scrutiny by federal investigators.]
 With the minimum wage at $3.05 -- the mainland is $5.15 -- the largely Korean-run factories here were targets of exposes in the 1990's that reported that the workers, mostly young women from China, had paid kickbacks to win the jobs, but once on the island were not allowed to change jobs. Some workers were not paid overtime for working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, reporters found, and many lived in substandard barracks that they were not allowed to leave at night.
 Conditions improved but in the last five years, Chinese competition has eaten into already thin profit margins. Factories here were forced to cut wholesale prices: revenues have fallen by 22.5 percent since 1999 even as unit sales of garment items slipped only 3 percent, according to the manufacturers association.
 Despite this erosion, the garment industry remains one of Saipan's two economic pillars, along with tourism. The clothing industry's 14,000 workers account for at least one half of the jobs on this island of 78,000 people, according to Samuel F. McPhetres, a social sciences instructor at Northern Marianas College. 
 ''I believe garments are 65 percent of the economy,'' Alex A. Sablan, president of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, said. A decline in the industry is ''just going to trickle down.''
 According to the manufacturers association, the clothing industry spends almost $50 million on the island for food, gasoline, supplies, land leases, insurance and freight. Taxes collected amount to $70 million, or a third of the commonwealth budget.
 A sharp decline could hit the delicate racial balance on an island where local-born residents are now a minority. Buying social peace, the government doubled its work force in recent decades. It now provides half the jobs held by Saipan's native Chamorro and Carolinean residents. 
 ''We would not have the size of government today without the garment industry,'' said Lynn A. Knight, president of the Hotel Association of the Northern Marianas. Although tourist arrivals grew by 16.4 percent last year, to 535,224 visitors, she warned that tourism could not make up for a garment industry decline. ''Until now, we have been so fortunate we have two legs to stand on.''
 With the end of quotas, Saipan's main advantage over China is that it still escapes American tariffs on garments, which average 17 percent. To save factories, Saipan officials hope to persuade Congress to change the tariff code to lower the required local contribution to 30 percent from 50 percent. This would allow more cutting to be done in China, reducing shipping costs and enabling factories to move to more expensive fabrics.
 But islanders' efforts are undermined by their mixed message.
 ''You have to ascertain whether the garment industry takes out more than it takes in: health services, water, power, roads, schools,'' said Governor Babauta, who has long opposed the garment industries. ''When you weigh that against whatever amount of tax they pay, you wonder if they are worth having.''
 For the women left behind, the garment jobs once so reviled by the mainland American media now look increasingly good.
 ''The truth is the majority of those girls do not want to go back to China,'' said Jun Mei Wang, 36, who moved from garment worker to student at Northern Marianas College. ''It is hard to find a job in China, and, even if they find a job, they earn less money. My friends who finished their contracts, some went into waitressing, some became house maids, some went into the massage shops.''
 Mr. McPhetres, the college instructor, said that ''what we fear is being stuck with 1,000 to 2,000 people who can't go home.''
 It is already happening. On a recent morning at a beachfront hotel, a knock came at the door. The young Chinese woman did not call out ''Housekeeping!'' Instead, she proposed, in broken English, ''Massaji?''

HEADLINE: As Trade Surplus Balloons, So Does Talk of Protectionism

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and DAVID BARBOZA; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong for this article and David Barboza from Shanghai.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 8 

 BODY:
After years of running large trade surpluses mainly with the United States, China is now exporting around the world at such a rapid rate that other countries find themselves racking up large bills to China as well. The resulting boom for China is certain to step up trade frictions elsewhere and increase pressure on Beijing to let its currency appreciate. 
 If the trend of the first two months continues, China would run a trade surplus with not only the United States but it would also turn its deficit with the rest of the world into a surplus. This could lead some of China's trading partners in Europe to join the United States in stronger demands for trade restrictions on China. 
 China had a trade surplus with the world of $33 billion in 2004. But if trade with the United States is excluded, China actually ran a deficit of $47 billion with all other countries combined. 
 Yet, with 36 percent more exports landing on foreign shores in January and February, China ran a $10.9 billion trade surplus with the world in the first two months, compared with a $7.9 billion deficit for the period a year ago. 
 While toys, clothing, furniture and television sets from China have dominated the shelves of American retailers for years, these and newer products like portable electric lamps and even radio navigation equipment are being shipped in growing quantities to countries ranging from Britain and Spain to Brazil and Indonesia, according to recently released Chinese customs data. 
 At the same time, China is entering global markets in which it previously played little role. It is becoming a large exporter of commodities like steel and chemicals, with steel exports nearly quintupling in the first two months of 2005 compared with a year ago. China is importing fewer cars and less heavy machinery as more of these are made in China, and companies make plans to export more cars and machinery. 
 By keeping China's currency tightly pegged to the dollar, which has declined in the last three years, Beijing authorities have made Chinese goods even more competitive in countries using currencies like the euro that have appreciated rapidly against the dollar. This has helped China export more, while discouraging businesses in China from importing.
 But China's currency policies have angered Washington, where the Senate is considering a bill to impose a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese exports unless Beijing revalues the renminbi, currently pegged at 8.28 to the dollar, within six months. While the bill is not expected to become law -- the Bush administration is strongly opposed -- consideration of the proposal shows growing attention in Congress to the trade relationship. 
 This week, the Bush administration began considering whether to place restrictions on textile imports from China; European Union officials have set up import alert levels, which could result in restricting Chinese textile imports.
 The Commerce Department plans to release trade figures on Tuesday, and experts expect that the nation ran another big deficit in February with China. But statistics already released by Beijing show that Chinese exports to the United States climbed 36.8 percent in the first two months of this year, while American exports to China fell by 9.7 percent. 
 Chinese exports to many other countries rose even faster, while its total imports increased by only 8 percent. Exports to Britain rose this year by 42 percent; to Germany, 44 percent; to Canada and Italy, 59 percent; and to Spain and Indonesia, 75 percent, compared with the period last year. 
 So much freight is leaving Chinese ports that exporters struggle to find ships and containers to carry it all. 
 One big shift in trade is starting to take place in global steel markets. China has become the world's largest steel consumer. But Chinese steel production has risen even faster, as practically every province has erected steel mills.
 So many of these mills produce steel reinforcing bars, called rebar in the construction business, that China has gone from a shortage to a glut. Its bars are now being exported all over the world, including the United States. ''We bought some rebar at pretty good prices in China and brought them to the United States'' in January and again in February, said Nicholas Tolerico, the president of ThyssenKrupp Steel Services in Richburg, S.C.
 China still imports high-quality galvanized steel, the sort used in automobile bodies. Over all, it was a net importer of steel, but by a shrinking margin. Steel imports fell 11.3 percent, to $3.82 billion, while exports rose 389 percent, to $2.62 billion.
 And while copper shortages forced prices up to a record $1.785 a pound on Thursday, Chinese companies are rapidly stepping up copper exports, particularly of bathroom pipes. China's trade surplus in copper pipes quintupled in the first two months of this year, to $46 million from $9 million a year earlier. 
 Germany, which has benefited for years by selling machinery and manufacturing equipment to China, had a trade surplus of $1.24 billion with China in January and February of last year that has turned into a deficit of $316 million in the first two months of 2005. Italy ran a $181 million trade deficit with China in January and February of 2003 that widened to $256 million in 2004 and $812 million for those months this year.
 Chinese computers, clothing and office furniture are now flowing to Germany and Italy. So are Chinese exports of synthetic dyes to the Netherlands and railroad locomotive parts to Canada, both categories having more than doubled. 
 But economists say this is not just the effect of the weaker dollar. Much of the export growth, Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, said, is the cumulative effect of foreign multinationals building up their Chinese production. 
 The two big questions now puzzling executives and economists are whether China's trade surplus will continue to widen and whether it will prompt protectionism in industrialized countries. Of course, China still runs big deficits with oil-producing countries, notably Saudi Arabia and Angola. But even with oil close to $60 a barrel, demand for Chinese goods is running far ahead of China's costs for the energy needed to make them. 
 Some economists, like Ifzal Ali, the chief economist of the Asian Development Bank, say slowing economies in Europe and Japan could start to weaken demand for all goods, including Chinese exports, this year. 
 But with exports rising now, the United States and European Union officials have begun objecting, mainly to China's textile and apparel exports, which are no longer limited by the global system of quotas that expired at the end of last year. 
 American and European apparel producers have been extremely upset, but manufacturers in many other industries have been less concerned so far. ''It is likely for the near term that the export-import situation out of China will ebb and flow,'' said Terrence Straub, the senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at the United States Steel Corporation.
 Mr. Straub and other executives at companies competing with Chinese exports said they were most worried about the low value of the Chinese currency, known as the yuan or renminbi. Mr. Straub said that most American companies were likely to focus on the currency more than trade deficits for any single product.
 ''Long term, this is an unsustainable relationship,'' he said. 
 Rising trade surpluses could make it harder for China to keep the currency pegged at its current level.

HEADLINE: Settlement Dispute on Bush-Sharon Agenda

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., April 8 

 BODY:
President Bush said Friday that he would press Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel at a meeting here on Monday to halt the expansion of an Israeli settlement on the West Bank.
 In remarks to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush said that his message for Mr. Sharon would be the same one he has delivered publicly in recent weeks: that under the terms of the framework for peace agreed to by the Israelis and Palestinians, known as the road map, the Israeli government should not proceed with plans to build new housing in a settlement in disputed territory near Jerusalem. 
 The Israeli settlement plans, intended in part to help Mr. Sharon shore up his domestic political standing as he prepares for Israel's planned withdrawal from Gaza, have angered many Palestinians.
 ''What I say publicly, I say privately,'' Mr. Bush said as he flew here from Rome after the funeral of Pope John Paul II. ''And that is the road map has clear obligations on settlements, and that we expect the prime minister to adhere to those road map obligations.''
 Mr. Bush also said he would encourage Mr. Sharon to work with the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to ensure that the Palestinians succeed in bringing jobs and stability to Gaza when Israel withdraws from that region.
 ''We need to have institution-building, and there needs to be an international effort that encourages and fosters economic vitality so that a government which does emerge in Gaza will be able to better speak to the hopes of those who live in the Gaza,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And success in the Gaza will make success on the West Bank easier.''
 The president said it was encouraging to see the Iraqis setting up an elected government, but said Americans should be patient about the pace at which democracy spreads throughout the Middle East.
 ''There's got to be a certain realism about how fast things can possibly happen, given where different nations have started from,'' he said.
 In his 47-minute session with reporters in his conference room on Air Force One, Mr. Bush spoke at length about his admiration for the late pope and about his own faith.
 ''I think a walk in faith constantly confronts doubt, as faith becomes more mature,'' Mr. Bush said when asked if he ever confronted doubts in his own faith.
 He said that despite reluctance even within his party to address Social Security, he was still optimistic that he could persuade Congress to act this year to add investment accounts to Social Security and bolster the retirement program's long-term financial condition. 
 ''I happen to believe that not dealing with the problem will create political consequences when the public realizes how serious the problem is,'' he said.
 Mr. Bush is to meet at his ranch here on Monday with Mr. Sharon in an effort to nurse along progress toward a lasting accommodation between the Israelis and Palestinians.
 Israeli and American officials say the settlement issue has been simmering for months, with the United States willing to look the other way while Israel expands its settlements in order to ease pressure on Mr. Sharon while he carries out the Gaza withdrawal.
 But that approach has shifted in recent weeks, after Israel announced plans to proceed with 3,500 housing units in a bloc east of Jerusalem that, if built, would cut north-south links between Palestinians living in the West Bank. As a result, ''there has been a little bit of a push-back,'' a senior administration official said Friday.
 Aides to Mr. Sharon are attaching enormous importance to the visit to Crawford, saying it is necessary for the Israeli leader to get a full embrace from Washington as his government enters the extremely difficult challenge of removing -- possibly by force -- 8,000 settlers from Gaza, starting in June.
 Mr. Sharon has won parliamentary approval for the Gaza withdrawal, but his aides fear that the spectacle of pulling settlers, including deeply religious Jews who believe that they are hastening the arrival of the Messiah, will be traumatic and something that can only happen with relentless American support.
 Also on the agenda, Israeli officials say, however, is a growing concern among Mr. Sharon's aides over what they say has been slowness in disarming militant groups and arranging for security and other forces to replace the departing Israelis in Gaza.
 On Thursday, in a significant breakthrough, Israel's defense minister, Shaul Mofaz, proposed that Israel not destroy the settlers' houses as they leave, reversing a policy that American diplomats feared would provoke Palestinian anger.
 Palestinian officials, meanwhile, are putting pressure on Washington to curb Israel's settlement growth as the main way to strengthen Mr. Abbas. This week, Muhammad Dahlan, the Palestinian in charge of the Gaza takeover, said in Washington, at a conference sponsored by the Aspen Institute, that if Israel did not curb its settlement activity and ease conditions for all Palestinians, there could be a renewed uprising.
 Israeli officials said that a main focus of Mr. Sharon's discussion with Mr. Bush would be steps to strengthen the hand of Mr. Abbas, against what appears to be growing support in Gaza for Hamas and other radical groups.

HEADLINE: Council Speaker Struggles for Broader Voter Support

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
As the speaker of the City Council, Gifford Miller is the second-highest-ranking City Hall official, behind only Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. And as a candidate for mayor, he has raised more campaign contributions than anyone else and maintains a grueling schedule of daily news conferences and campaign swings across the five boroughs.
 But Mr. Miller has yet to parlay his powerful position and aggressive campaigning into broad voter support. Recent polls show that he consistently trails his Democratic rivals: Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. And more often than not, he gets lumped together with United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who is courting many of the same voters as Mr. Miller in Brooklyn and Queens. 
 By all accounts, Mr. Miller remains convinced that he can eventually win, but signs of his frustration appear to be growing. Last week, Mr. Miller testily deflected a question from a reporter who asked whether he would consider dropping out of the race because he was down in the polls. Mr. Miller called that ''a pretty silly question.''
 Mr. Miller later bantered with the reporter, Rafael Martinez Alequin, who turned 72 that day, asking whether he would consider ''dropping out of this life'' since he was getting up there in years. ''At first, I took it as a joke and then I was wondering why he said that to me,'' said Mr. Martinez Alequin, a City Hall fixture who is known for antagonizing politicians.
 Mr. Miller and his aides say the polls do not show that voters disapprove of him but that he is not well known even after more than three years at the helm of the City Council. While his position affects the city at large, Mr. Miller himself was elected by a relatively small number of voters from his Council district on the Upper East Side. He has never before run in a citywide election.
 ''Most people don't know or really care who the speaker of the New York City Council is, and that's O.K. because their lives are busier than that,'' Mr. Miller said in an interview on Thursday. ''So clearly I have a long way to go to get myself introduced, but I look at that as an opportunity.''
 Many political aides, consultants and lobbyists concur that early polls can be unreliable and that much can change in the next several months. ''It's too early yet to say that Gifford won't have traction,'' said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's director of communications. ''That implies that you're stuck in the mud. It's more like he's trying to build a platform to run from.''
 But others point to a larger problem for Mr. Miller, saying that he lacks an obvious voting base in a city that tends to fracture politically along racial and ethnic lines. Mr. Ferrer has overwhelming support among Puerto Ricans, and Ms. Fields is counting on support from blacks and women. Mr. Weiner, whose Congressional district includes parts of Brooklyn and Queens, appeals to white ethnic voters and those outside Manhattan.
 All of which leaves Mr. Miller, the privileged son of a socially prominent family, with little choice but to adopt an aggressive campaign strategy of focusing on as many voters as possible. ''I don't believe that you get elected mayor of the city of New York based on one group of voters or another,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I think winning campaigns reach out to every group of voters.''
 So Mr. Miller lined up endorsements from more than a dozen black and Hispanic elected officials, and kicked off his mayoral campaign in front of Brooklyn Borough Hall in February. He visits black churches nearly every Sunday and sings gospel hymns along with the choirs. (Mr. Miller even confided to reporters that one of his favorite songs is the black anthem ''Lift Every Voice and Sing.'')
 At City Hall news conferences, Mr. Miller routinely reads from cue cards in Spanish. He co-sponsored a reception for Mexican-Americans to honor Cesar Chavez, the migrant labor organizer, and pledged $250,000 in city money to a Chinese-American association to help build a grand archway in Chinatown. He also paid tribute to a foundation dedicated to the late hip-hop performer Jam Master Jay. 
 But it seems that Mr. Miller's efforts have yet to register with voters in his own party. In a Quinnipiac University poll released on March 30, only 5 percent of registered black Democrats said they supported Mr. Miller. Thirty-nine percent were for Ms. Fields, 31 percent for Mr. Ferrer and 8 percent for Mr. Weiner. 
 Similarly, 4 percent of Hispanic Democrats said they supported Mr. Miller, compared with 65 percent for Mr. Ferrer, 8 percent for Ms. Fields and 5 percent for Mr. Weiner. 
 Moreover, some critics say that Mr. Miller is trying so hard to appeal to everyone that he is undermining his own credibility by coming across as superficial, and at worst, a politician trolling for votes. 
 ''I'm not impressed with any of that,'' said Councilman Charles Barron, who represents a heavily black district in Brooklyn. ''Is he going to rap next? Are you going to call him Gospel Giff? That's just political showboating.''
 Councilman Larry B. Seabrook, whose predominantly black district in the Bronx includes Co-op City, said that while he did not vote for Mr. Miller as speaker three years ago, he had decided to endorse him for mayor. He said that Mr. Miller won him over by addressing chronic unemployment among black and Hispanic men and by financing AIDS programs, among other things.
 ''Most people would see him as this rich kid running around, but there's a whole lot more in that shirt,'' Mr. Seabrook said. ''Gifford's much at home when he's in these communities. I can take him to church, and he won't embarrass me.''
 Mr. Miller and his aides say they are confident that the speaker's legislative record, and his relationships with prominent minority leaders, are working to broaden his voter base outside of Manhattan -- something they say will eventually be reflected in the polls as the election draws closer. 
 ''I believe that the work that I have been doing to build that extraordinarily broad and diverse support is paying off so I'm not concerned at all,'' Mr. Miller said.

HEADLINE: How to Hurt American Business

 BODY:
So much for the cheap dollar's help for United States exports. Beginning May 1, American companies that sell paper, textiles, machinery and farm produce to Europe are due to be slapped with punitive tariffs of 15 percent. Companies that sell oysters, live swine and certain types of fish to Canada will also be hit. Ditto for those selling certain products to Brazil, Chile, India, South Korea and Mexico. 
 Altogether, the tariffs will cost American exporters up to $150 million this year, but that's just the beginning. That number could multiply by leaps and bounds next year, unless Congress backs off its quest to tilt the global playing field in favor of politically powerful domestic steel companies. 
 So why is this happening? Back in 2000, Congress allowed a fiery protectionist, Senator Robert Byrd, to push through a bill that handed the tariffs that the government imposes on foreign competitors for supposed ''dumping'' infractions over to the American companies that filed the complaints. The money used to go to the Treasury. 
 The law was meant to help American steel companies, which are always complaining that their foreign rivals dump their products in America by charging below-market prices. It was a dumb move. The dumping charges are often pretty dubious. Foreign countries have long, and correctly, argued that the American definition of dumping often just means charging any price below the price in America. 
 The Byrd amendment also added insult to injury when it gave the tariffs extracted from foreign companies to their American competitors.
 It's not hard to guess what happened next. American steel companies filed antidumping suits and collected $1.04 billion in four years. The rest of the world filed suits at the World Trade Organization and, naturally, won. The W.T.O. authorized the winners to hit the United States with punitive tariffs unless Congress repeals the Byrd amendment.
 This is a textbook case of global trade rules doing exactly what they're supposed to do. Now it would be nice to see members of Congress, including the many free-trade senators who cravenly voted for the Byrd amendment, come to their senses and repeal it.

HEADLINE: Dispute on Planes Is Unresolved

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said on Friday that a 90-day negotiation period had failed to resolve a trade dispute with the European Union over commercial airplane subsidies.
 While Washington officials held out the threat of resuming a trade case against Europe, they said the administration would not do so as long as Europe did not increase development subsidies for Airbus, the major rival of the Boeing Company. 
 A spokesman for the United States Trade Office, Richard Mills, said that if the European Union went ahead with additional subsidies for the large civil aircraft of Airbus, the United States would return to the World Trade Organization to settle the dispute.
 The administration announcement was not a surprise. No talks had been scheduled this week, and both sides had been sniping at each other.
 The deputy secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, said in Brussels this week that Europe did not appear to be serious about the negotiations. Europe's trade chief, Peter Mandelson, said Mr. Zoellick's hands were tied because of lobbying by Boeing.
 While Mr. Zoellick started the talks in January, he has since switched jobs and is now the No.2 official at the State Department. But the administration said Friday that he would continue to handle the Boeing-Airbus dispute while the Senate considered the nomination of Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, as the new trade representative.
 Guy Hicks, a spokesman for EADS North America, said the company was encouraged that no immediate complaint was being filed with the W.T.O., a process that could have resulted in sanctions against the Europe if the United States won. Airbus is 80 percent-owned by the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company.

HEADLINE: Nukes Are Green

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If there was one thing that used to be crystal clear to any environmentalist, it was that nuclear energy was the deadliest threat this planet faced. That's why Dick Gregory pledged at a huge anti-nuke demonstration in 1979 that he would eat no solid food until all nuclear plants in the U.S. were shut down.
 Mr. Gregory may be getting hungry. 
 But it's time for the rest of us to drop that hostility to nuclear power. It's increasingly clear that the biggest environmental threat we face is actually global warming, and that leads to a corollary: nuclear energy is green.
 Nuclear power, in contrast with other sources, produces no greenhouse gases. So President Bush's overall environmental policy gives me the shivers, but he's right to push ahead for nuclear energy. There haven't been any successful orders for new nuclear plants since 1973, but several proposals for new plants are now moving ahead -- and that's good for the world we live in.
 Global energy demand will rise 60 percent over the next 25 years, according to the International Energy Agency, and nuclear power is the cleanest and best bet to fill that gap. 
 Solar power is a disappointment, still accounting for only about one-fifth of 1 percent of the nation's electricity and costing about five times as much as other sources. Wind is promising, for its costs have fallen 80 percent, but it suffers from one big problem: wind doesn't blow all the time. It's difficult to rely upon a source that comes and goes.
 In contrast, nuclear energy already makes up 20 percent of America's power, not to mention 75 percent of France's.
 A sensible energy plan must encourage conservation -- far more than Mr. Bush's plans do -- and promote things like hybrid vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells. But for now, nuclear power is the only source that doesn't contribute to global warming and that can quickly become a mainstay of the grid.
 Is it safe? No, not entirely. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl demonstrated that, and there are also risks from terrorist attacks. 
 Then again, the world now has a half-century of experience with nuclear power plants, 440 of them around the world, and they have proved safer so far than the alternatives. America's biggest power source is now coal, which kills about 25,000 people a year through soot in the air.
 To put it another way, nuclear energy seems much safer than our dependency on coal, which kills more than 60 people every day.
 Moreover, nuclear technology has become far safer over the years. The future may belong to pebble-bed reactors, a new design that promises to be both highly efficient and incapable of a meltdown. 
 Radioactive wastes are a challenge. But burdening future generations with nuclear wastes in deep shafts is probably more reasonable than burdening them with a warmer world in which Manhattan is submerged under 20 feet of water. 
 Right now, the only significant source of electricity in the U.S. that does not involve carbon emissions is hydropower. But salmon runs have declined so much that we should be ripping out dams, not adding more.
 What killed nuclear power in the past was cold economics. Major studies at M.I.T. and elsewhere show that nuclear power is still a bit more expensive than new coal or natural gas plants, but in the same ballpark if fossil fuel prices rise. And if a $200-per-ton tax was imposed on carbon emissions, nuclear energy would become cheaper than coal from new plants.
 So it's time to welcome nuclear energy as green . Indeed, some environmentalists are already climbing onboard. For example, the National Commission on Energy Policy, a privately financed effort involving environmentalists, academics and industry representatives, issued a report in December that favors new nuclear plants.
 One of the most eloquent advocates of nuclear energy is James Lovelock, the British scientist who created the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that Earth is, in effect, a self-regulating organism.
 ''I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy,'' Mr. Lovelock wrote last year, adding: ''Every year that we continue burning carbon makes it worse for our descendents. Only one immediately available source does not cause global warming, and that is nuclear energy.''

HEADLINE: India and China Are Poised to Share a Defining Moment

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA and HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 9 

 BODY:
Wen Jiabao, prime minister of China, began a four-day visit to India on Saturday just as the two countries -- a third of humanity -- are coming into their own at the same moment, with the potential for a dynamic shift in the world's politics and economy. 
 The impact on the global balance of power, the competition for resources and the health of the planet is causing many analysts and political leaders to sit up and take notice. 
 ''Both countries have waited 3,000 years for this moment,'' said Gurcharan Das, the former chief executive of Procter & Gamble India and now an author.
 Onetime rivals who went to war in 1962, India and China today find their economies growing at a remarkable clip. Both have a giant appetite for energy. Both are hungry for new markets. And both, it seems, are now gingerly testing the possibilities of doing business together. 
 It is not an accident that Mr. Wen began his visit not here in the capital but in Bangalore, the southern high-tech hub whose phenomenal rise China has eyed.
 Trade is booming between them, especially as seen from the Indian side: after the United States, China is now its second largest trade partner, and it is growing by a giant 30 percent each year to an estimated $14 billion this year.
 For the United States and the rest of the world, the effects of the sudden awakening of the Asian giants could be profound. In the years ahead, it may mean more downward pressure on wages, the outsourcing of more jobs, greater competition for investment and higher prices for scarce resources. 
 Indeed, Beijing's overtures toward India, though clearly made with the economic opportunities in mind, are also being contemplated with a keen awareness of China's rivalry with the United States. Washington has also courted New Delhi, lately promising to help make it a major world power. 
 India and China say they will push hard to resolve a decades-old border dispute. There is talk of a free trade agreement as well as joint oil exploration and purchases of commercial airliners. China may even endorse India's bid to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, or at least strongly hint at its support.
 But Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says relations could become difficult. 
 ''As long as their relationship remains trade, economic ties, cultural, even kibitzing with the U.S., that is fine,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''but as soon as you get some confrontation, on the border, Chinese goods flooding into India, or an incident at sea, or in Tibet or Nepal, then things quickly become much more nationalistic and complicated.'' 
 Indeed, competition is as much the byword as cooperation. The day after Mr. Wen arrives here, work is set to begin on India's first Indian-built aircraft carrier. 
 China is increasingly on people's minds here, both as a model to be learned from and a cautionary tale. From boardrooms to think tanks to op-ed pages, Indians speak often nowadays of matching their neighbor's success and power, or as some now dare suggest, surpassing it. 
 ''Reinventing the silk route'' was the headline of a column on Tuesday on the op-ed page of The Economic Times, a financial daily. The latest edition of Business World, a weekly, asked on its cover: ''India and China: What can they do together?''
 The short answer is more and more. Chinese-made toys, toasters and televisions have proliferated across the Indian marketplace. On any given day, a shopper at Chandni Chowk market in Delhi can pick up a Ganesha idol, or electric versions of the traditional oil lamps,or water pistols used to splash passers-by during the spring festival of Holi -- all made in China.
 India exports raw materials for China's booming construction industry, largely ore, iron and plastic, and its pharmaceutical companies have begun producing drugs for the Chinese market. 
 Indian software services companies, too, have set up shop in China for development and customer support. At least one Indian company, Zensar Technologies, has set up a joint venture with a Chinese firm and is bidding on a large e-government contract in one Chinese province.
 NIIT, the Indian technology education firm that began training Chinese software developers in 1998, today has 100 training centers in 23 provinces across China. For Indian software, said Vijay Thadani, a founder of NIIT, China is the next big thing. 
 ''There's an excitement with setting up a Chinese operation,'' Mr. Thadani said. ''There is an enigma attached.''
 The India-China dalliance is perhaps most critical when it comes to satisfying both countries' incredible appetites for energy. Clearly, China and India already compete over finite sources of oil and gas. Mani Shankar Aiyar, India's petroleum minister, insisted that China and India would have to join hands.
 In Sudan, he noted, the Chinese are building a refinery; the Indians are building a pipeline. The Indian state-owned oil company is also now producing oil in Sudan in cooperation with the Chinese state-owned oil company. 
 ''We are both in quest of energy security. Why should that make us rivals?'' Mr. Aiyar argued. 
 The speculation was not always so. In 1959, John F. Kennedy spoke of the importance of what he saw as a contest between these giants, casting their rivalry as one ''for the leadership of the East, for the respect of all Asia, for the opportunity to demonstrate whose way of life is better.'' 
 Not least, the two nations pursued famously divergent paths: for India, democracy and belated economic reforms since the 1990's; for China, a Communist system that began reforms in 1979, unleashing rapid economic growth. 
 But for much of the last half century that contest was a dud. China nearly self-destructed during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's, and India wasted decades on policies that left its economy closed and stagnant while hundreds of millions of its people were mired in poverty. 
 Today, their simultaneous emergence has few comparisons in modern history, economists say. According to the World Bank, their combined growth can be credited with cutting the share of the world's population living in extreme poverty to 20 percent in 2001 from 40 percent two decades earlier. 
 Despite India's rapid growth, however, China's development enjoys a good 15-year head start, and the gap shows no signs of narrowing. Indians worry openly whether a consensus for growth can be sustained with the kind of single-mindedness that has helped propel China. 
 There is constant talk these days of turning Mumbai, the southern commercial metropolis formerly known as Bombay, into a new Shanghai, China's most glitteringly modern city. 
 More to the point may be Bangalore, India's booming capital of telephone call centers and high-tech software. Growth there has been menaced by political delays that have stalled construction of a new airport for seven years. Shanghai, on the other hand, built one of the world's most spectacular airports in three years. 
 Such contrasts have left some Indians to remark, sometimes despairingly, about a ''democracy price'' that slows development. At the same time, Indians almost invariably say they would have it no other way. 
 ''I'm often approached by friends returning impressed from China, saying how our airports in Bombay and Delhi can't compare,'' said G.P. Deshpande, a longtime China scholar at Jawaharal Nehru University in Delhi. ''When I tell them that these things come in a package, that you don't just get the new airports, and I describe the package, though, they say no thank you.'' 
 The package Mr. Deshpande alludes to is strict authoritarianism, which allows the local and central governments in China to rezone entire districts without so much as a hearing, to pollute city and countryside without having to face public objections and to conduct large-scale social engineering, often disastrously, but with similarly little question. 
 For their part, mainstream Chinese intellectuals talk of India's advantages in democratic governance. For all of China's apparent strengths today, they say, future success may depend on democratic reform.
 ''If China learns its lessons from India, it can succeed in democratizing in the future,'' said Pang Yongzhing, a professor of international relations at Nankai University in Tianjin. 
 ''India is a far more diverse country,'' he said, ''a place with the second largest Muslim population in the world, and lots of ethnic minorities, and yet it organizes regular elections without conflict. China is 90 percent Han, so if India can conduct elections, so can China.'' 
 Chinese have also begun openly to question the kind of growth their authoritarianism has spawned. 
 ''We are using too many raw materials to sustain this growth,'' said Pan Yue, China's environment minister, in a recent interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. ''To produce goods worth $10,000, for example, we need seven times more resources than Japan, nearly six times more than the United States and, perhaps most embarrassing, nearly three times more than India. 
 ''Things can't, nor should they, be allowed to go on like that,'' he said. 
 Others worry about China's seeming addiction to large investment, which leads to huge waste and steep cyclical downturns, a shaky financial system imperiled by a huge burden of nonperforming loans, and rampant official corruption. 
 ''In India there is a lot more room to move around,'' said Zhang Jun, director of the China Center for Economic Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''Their capital markets are good, their banking sector is better than in China, and there is entrepreneurialism everywhere in India, along with well-protected intellectual property rights. All of these are things that China lacks.'' 
 Pressed for a prediction, Mr. Zhang said he saw the two countries' positions converging within 15 or 20 years, by which time they may rank as the two largest economies in the world, if still far below the United States and other top economies in terms of per capita wealth. 
 How they get there, and the examples they set along the way, may hold important lessons for other developing nations, on global peace, human rights and democratization. 
 ''If China continues to grow and grow, people will inevitably begin to think this is proof of the validity of their system, and that would be very bad for all of Asia,'' said Subramanian Swamy, president of India's Janata Party and former minister of law, commerce and justice. 
 ''On the contrary, if India continues to emerge, taking a seat on the Security Council, it will have a tremendous impact for the good,'' he said. ''As far as exporting democracy, it is only a matter of time before India gets the self-confidence to begin doing this.''

HEADLINE: Making Money When the Market Is Mistaken

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
NO one ever went broke underestimating people's intelligence, H.L. Mencken observed. Among managers of a group of mutual funds offered by J.P. Morgan, a school of thought holds that there is good money to be made underestimating people's capacity to act rationally.
 The funds are run according to principles of behavioral finance, the logical bedrock of which is that people are illogical, yet predictable. Adherents of this approach do not ignore the nuts and bolts of business -- profits, sales, cash flow and so forth. But they contend that investors consistently err in evaluating such information, and that astute portfolio managers can profit from the ways that others make mistakes. 
 ''Traditional finance theory tells us markets are efficient and rational,'' said Silvio Tarca, one of the managers of the Morgan funds. ''Behavioral finance tells us that human psychology affects investment decisions. Irrational behavior gives rise to market inefficiencies, and our investment process tries to capitalize on those inefficiencies.'' 
 The five Morgan portfolios sold under the Intrepid brand all outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the 12 months through March. The flagship Intrepid America, for instance, gained 11.1 percent in the 12 months through March, compared with a 6.7 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Intrepid Contrarian gained 8.1 percent in that period.
 Contrarian, America and two other Intrepid funds, Value and Growth, were introduced two years ago. The fifth in the series, Intrepid European, is nearly five years old. Through their life spans, all have handily beaten the S.&P. 500.
 Two other funds, Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Value and Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth, have had a mixed record over their six-year lives. Morgan acquired them in 2003 from a small investment firm run by Russell J. Fuller, who continues to supervise portfolio management, and Richard H. Thaler, a University of Chicago professor of economics and behavioral science who is widely considered the father of behavioral finance theory. Professor Thaler sets the funds' investment strategy.
 Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Growth endured a rocky period in 2001 and 2002 that has left it trailing the market slightly over the last five years, but the value fund has excellent five-year returns. And both funds have outpaced the market over the last three years, if not in the last year. In the 12 months through March, the Behavioral Growth fund gained 3.2 percent, while Behavioral Value rose 5.4 percent. 
 While successful in the markets, the Morgan funds have been less so in marketing. Perhaps because most of the Intrepid funds are still fairly new, they remain fairly small; the five portfolios have $800 million in assets among them. The two Undiscovered Managers funds have a total of $265 million.
 The funds are all but ignored by industry analysts. The research firms Morningstar, Lipper and Standard & Poor's have no analysts assigned to cover the Intrepid funds, and financial advisers who were contacted said they were either unfamiliar with the Morgan behavioral funds or were not knowledgeable enough about behavioral finance to discuss it.
 One analyst, Jeffrey Ptak at Morningstar, follows the Undiscovered Managers funds. Their strong overall performance and the discipline they display in following the tenets of behavioral finance have made him a fan.
 The theory ''is quite useful for investors looking for an organizing framework to explain how mispricings occur and for a framework to exploit those mispricings,'' Mr. Ptak said. ''I think they're onto something, absolutely.''
 What they may be onto are the systematic mistakes that even exceptionally knowledgeable people like Wall Street analysts are prone to make. Mr. Tarca points to studies showing, for instance, that analysts tend to make far more earnings revisions of the companies they cover in the second half of a fiscal year than in the first.
 The reason, he said, is that analysts fall in love with their forecasts and resist changing them until the hard facts of corporate performance can no longer be ignored. A good buy candidate, he said, is a stock that has just had its first upward earnings revision and is still cheap, based on common valuation measures.
 Stocks to avoid include strong performers whose valuations leave little room for disappointment, Mr. Tarca said.
 ''When companies have outperformed the market over three to five years, investors tend to extrapolate that performance out into the future,'' he said. ''Investors become overconfident in their forecasting ability, they rush in to buy these glamour stocks, and they become overpriced.''
 Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale, warned fund investors not to make the same misjudgment. He says that behavioral finance theory has much to recommend it and that he is glad some fund managers ''are listening respectfully to people from other social sciences who had been treated as second-class citizens.''
 But there can be a gap between theory and practice, he cautioned, and he said the Morgan funds needed a longer track record before their managers' ability could be gauged accurately. ''You really can't judge these on a short horizon,'' he said.
 Behavioral finance theory has gained currency among academics and economists as an alternative to the efficient-market theory, the belief that investors are rational and that the price of an asset is fair and accurate and reflects all available information about it.
 Fund managers, apart from operators of index trackers, tend to reject the efficient-market notion, which would render them irrelevant if it were shown to be strictly true. Exceptional fund performance would be impossible, except by chance, because all assets would be fairly priced.
 Neither has the behavioral finance theory won many converts at investment houses, although the theory's disciples are not alone in basing investment decisions on the frailties of the human mind. Technical analysts who follow indicators of market sentiment already practice a kind of behavioral finance.
 Managers of the Intrepid funds are not overly worried about investment fundamentals, either. In fact, they have incorporated a stock-picking process based on behavioral finance theory into a computer model.
 The model looks for two types of candidates: value stocks, whose prices have been knocked down more than is deserved, and momentum stocks, whose prices have yet to catch up with improved growth prospects.
 Often stocks can qualify on both criteria. Mr. Tarca said that this was the case with one of Intrepid America's five largest holdings, ChevronTexaco. Others in the top five are Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, I.B.M. and the Altria Group.
 Johnson & Johnson is the only pure momentum play among the five, he said. Bank of America and Altria are value holdings, as is I.B.M., which he said offers ''good value, particularly relative to other I.T. stocks.''
 DAVID M. POTTER, part of the team managing Undiscovered Managers Behavioral Value, says that he and his colleagues take a more hands-on approach to picking stocks, switching off the computer after it spits out a list of investment candidates and sifting through them to find the best prospects.
 ''Essentially we use a behavioral screen, then spend a lot of time looking at fundamentals,'' Mr. Potter said. ''We're taking stocks apart and looking at them more than technical analysts do.''
 His value fund is overweight in technology and health care, sectors that, he said, are ''beaten down more than obvious contenders like petrochemicals.''
 Given the severe swings in the market over the last several years, Professor Shiller expressed surprise that behavioral theory was not more popular. Among investment professionals, the idea ''that markets go through booms and busts seems to be on everyone's mind, but the general public is not attuned to these things,'' he said.
 ''Academic arguments don't travel well,'' Professor Shiller said. ''People are much more likely to put their faith in a rich man or woman with a yacht and a mansion.''

HEADLINE: The Evolution of a Justice 

BYLINE: By Linda Greenhouse. 
Linda Greenhouse covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times. This article is adapted from her book, ''Becoming Justice Blackmun: Harry Blackmun's Supreme Court Journey,'' to be published next month by Times Books/Henry Holt & Company.

 BODY:
The battle over abortion, now flaring again with the prospect of change at the Supreme Court, has been raging for so long that its origins have been largely lost to time and myth. During the 32 years since the court decided Roe v. Wade, the right to abortion has become so entwined, both in political discourse and in the public mind, with women's rights in general that it is tempting to assume that the middle-aged men who voted in 1973 to overturn state abortion laws thought they were striking a blow for women's equality. 
 The collected papers of Roe's author, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, show a more complicated reality, illuminating what turns out to be a highly tenuous connection between the abortion cases and the cases on women's equality that reached the Supreme Court simultaneously in the early 1970's. 
 The Library of Congress, following Blackmun's instructions, opened his papers to the public in March of last year, on the fifth anniversary of his death. The voluminous files, which occupy more than 600 feet on the shelves of the library's manuscript division, include not only detailed records of the business the court conducted during the 24 years he served there, but also memos and annotations that reveal Blackmun's own efforts to grapple with the issues presented by the thousands of cases he encountered. The record of his personal responses to the briefs and arguments in many of the cases indicates a kind of interior monologue that ranged across the court's docket. His papers tell an intensely personal story even as they open a window on a period of Supreme Court history that is in many ways as pertinent today as it was when he and his fellow justices were trying to understand and respond to a changing world. 
 Named to the court by Richard Nixon, Harry Blackmun took his seat in June 1970. Two abortion cases arrived at the court's door in the following months: Roe v. Wade, challenging a Texas law that made abortion a crime in nearly all instances, and Doe v. Bolton, a case from Georgia, where a new ''reform'' law permitted some abortions, though under stringent regulations. Federal courts in both states had ruled that the Constitution gave women a right to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term.
 For Blackmun, who had spent nine years as general counsel to the Mayo Clinic and who held the medical profession in high regard, state laws that criminalized abortion were indeed troublesome -- not, particularly, because they interfered with the rights of women but because they put doctors at risk for using their best judgment in treating their pregnant patients. Among Blackmun's files is an article from the Mayo alumni magazine by Dr. Jane E. Hodgson, a prominent Minnesota obstetrician and Mayo alumna who had been prosecuted for performing an abortion on a patient who contracted German measles early in pregnancy, a circumstance known to carry a high risk of birth defects. ''Someday, abortion will be a humane medical service, not a felony,'' Dr. Hodgson boldly predicted. Leading medical organizations had recently dropped their longstanding opposition to legal abortion and filed briefs with the court depicting criminal abortion laws as a threat to public health. 
 The degree to which these developments influenced both Blackmun and the other members of his 7-to-2 majority in Roe v. Wade is strikingly clear from the opinion itself. ''The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment,'' Blackmun wrote in a key summary paragraph. To the extent the decision vindicated the rights of women, it was by proxy, through their (mostly male) doctors. 
 Harry Blackmun served another 21 years on the court after Roe v. Wade, retiring in 1994 at the age of 85. By then, he had long since become an icon of feminism. Just as he was reviled by opponents of abortion, he was treated worshipfully by women's rights groups. Yet Blackmun came slowly to the cause of women's equality, and his papers show just how improbable an icon he was. 
It was not that Blackmun was hostile to women's rights. He scarcely could have been, as the father of three daughters, one of whom eventually became a lawyer. When the family lived in Rochester, Minn., home of the Mayo Clinic, his wife, Dorothy, was a partner in a clothing business called Designing Women. At a time when many men of his generation disregarded women's professional accomplishments, Blackmun appreciated them. By the time he retired, he had hired more female law clerks than the other sitting justices combined, and during his last 10 years on the court, a majority of his clerks were women.
 But when Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project in the 1970's, began bringing cases to the court as part of a carefully constructed litigation campaign, Blackmun was unimpressed. The cases often struck him as contrived, with petty claims and overbearing arguments. In one of the earliest cases, Reed v. Reed, the court was asked to invalidate an Idaho law that gave automatic preference to men over women for selection to administer an estate. Ginsburg did not argue the case, but she worked on a brief for the appellant, Sally Reed. 
 At the time, the court's precedents did not recognize sex discrimination as presenting any special constitutional concern; for the government to prefer one sex over the other was no more problematic than to favor tall people over short or young over old, permissible as long as the government could articulate a ''rational basis'' for the policy. The so-called rational-basis test, instructing judges to give maximum deference to whatever explanation the government provided, is scarcely a test at all, because the government nearly always prevails. 
 Ginsburg's goal was to persuade the Supreme Court to accept a different paradigm: to see sex discrimination as analogous to racial discrimination and to declare that under the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection, official policies that discriminated on the basis of sex were presumptively unconstitutional. Under the court's precedents, a policy that treats racial groups differently is considered ''suspect'' and receives the most searching scrutiny from judges -- ''strict scrutiny'' -- and can be upheld only if the government demonstrates that it serves a ''compelling state interest.'' Policies that receive strict judicial scrutiny are not invariably found unconstitutional -- two years ago, the Supreme Court accepted the University of Michigan's justification for affirmative action in admission to its law school -- but they nearly always are.
 Blackmun was initially skeptical of the challenge to the Idaho probate law. ''This case, of course, is a test case and much ado about nothing,'' he wrote in a memo to himself before the argument in October 1971, noting that the estate in dispute amounted to less than $1,000. He described Ginsburg's brief as ''mildly offensive and arrogant'' and ''a very lengthy brief filled with emotion and historical context about the inferior status of women.'' At 68 pages, the brief was indeed longer than most, although not drastically so, providing dramatically worded background information for what Blackmun saw as ''a very simple little case.'' The Idaho probate code commanded the ''subordination of women,'' the brief stated. ''American women have been stigmatized historically as an inferior class and are today subject to pervasive discrimination. . . . A person born female continues to be branded inferior for this congenital and unalterable condition of birth.''
 Yet even as he criticized Ginsburg's brief, Blackmun was attentive to it; almost despite himself, his response to the case was shaped by her presentation, as his memo makes clear. The memo, barely four pages long and internally inconsistent in places, shows a judge wrestling with his instincts and biases in order to get to the heart of a challenging legal problem. ''All in all, I am inclined to feel that sex can be considered a suspect classification just as race,'' he wrote. ''This does not mean that every statute which makes a distinction based on sex is automatically invalid. It merely sets as the starting point the proposition that such a distinction is suspect and strong justification is needed to uphold it. There can be no question that women have been held down in the past in almost every area.''
 In the end, Blackmun persuaded himself that the Idaho law was indeed unconstitutional. ''We certainly could write a fairly brief and simple opinion accomplishing that very result,'' he concluded in his memo. ''I would hope that we do not get into a long and emotional discussion about women's rights.''
 The court's unanimous decision in Reed v. Reed, in a six-page opinion written by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, reflected little of the deeper debate. Idaho's preference for men over women to administer estates was arbitrary and unreasonable, the court held. The law failed to meet even the rational-basis test, relieving the justices of the need to decide whether sex-discrimination claims should be evaluated under a more searching standard -- whether sex, like race, should be deemed a ''suspect classification,'' presumably unconstitutional as a basis for government policy. 
The court was only one front in the struggle for women's rights during those years. Congress approved the proposed Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 and sent it to the states for ratification. If three-quarters of the legislatures ratified it, the amendment would accomplish what Ginsburg's brief had asked the court to do in Reed v. Reed and make discrimination against women subject to strict judicial scrutiny. Soon, the highly charged politics of the amendment and the uncertainty within the court about how far and how fast to move the law converged in a new case. Frontiero v. Richardson was a suit by an Air Force officer for the right to claim her husband as a dependent for the purpose of obtaining housing and medical benefits, although the husband was not financially dependent on her. Under the laws governing military benefits, a serviceman could automatically claim his wife as a dependent, regardless of their relative circumstances, while a woman could claim her husband only if she brought in more than half the family income.
 ''This must be stricken down,'' Blackmun wrote in his notes before the January 1973 argument. The question is ''by what route and how far.'' That, indeed, was the question: whether to accomplish the goals of the Equal Rights Amendment by judicial decree and make its ratification unnecessary. The battle inside the court went back and forth for weeks. All the justices except William H. Rehnquist agreed that the distinction between servicemen and servicewomen was unsustainable. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wanted to use the case to establish strict scrutiny, arguing that Reed v. Reed had done so implicitly, in its rejection of administrative convenience as an acceptable rationale for the state's policy. Burger, who wrote the Reed opinion, vigorously disagreed. ''Some may construe Reed as supporting the 'suspect' view but I do not,'' he wrote to Brennan. ''The author of Reed never remotely contemplated such a broad concept, but then a lot of people sire offspring unintended!''
 In the new case, Ginsburg filed a 70-page brief for the A.C.L.U., urging the court to adopt strict scrutiny. James W. Ziglar, one of Blackmun's law clerks, found the brief persuasive and urged the justice to ''go the whole route and find that sex is a 'suspect classification.' '' But Blackmun resisted. 
 Roe v. Wade had been decided barely six weeks earlier, but no member of the court referred to it as the sex-discrimination debate unfolded. ''After some struggle, I have now concluded that it is not advisable, and certainly not necessary, for us to reach out in this case to hold that sex, like race and national origin and alienage, is a suspect classification,'' Blackmun wrote to Brennan. ''It seems to me that Reed v. Reed is ample precedent here and is all we need and that we should not, by this case, enter the arena of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.'' 
 Brennan, monitoring the amendment's sagging fortunes, argued that the time for the court to act was now. The Equal Rights Amendment had already been rejected by 11 state legislatures, he pointed out, and two more would be sufficient to kill it. Three other justices, William O. Douglas, Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall, agreed, but Brennan could not find a fifth vote for strict scrutiny in the Frontiero case. Blackmun concurred only in the judgment that military benefits had to be equal, as did Burger, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Potter Stewart. Rehnquist, alone, dissented. So while the court voted 8 to 1 that the distinction in benefits was unconstitutional, the Frontiero decision, issued May 14, 1973, did not establish a new standard of review for sex discrimination.
 The next term, the court heard another of Ginsburg's cases, Kahn v. Shevin. Representing a male plaintiff this time, Ginsburg was challenging a Florida law that gave an annual automatic $500 property-tax exemption to widows but not to widowers. The Florida Supreme Court had upheld the law, finding that it bore a ''fair and substantial relation'' to the goal of reducing ''the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman.'' To a majority of the court, including Blackmun, that reasoning seemed to produce a sensible outcome. ''Too smart,'' was the comment he wrote to himself on Ginsburg's argument; at the same time he gave her argument a grade of B, higher than the C he gave her opponent, an assistant state attorney general. (Blackmun used various measures over the years to grade attorneys' arguments, sometimes giving letter grades and sometimes numbers on a variety of scales.)
 Brennan, Marshall and White voted to apply strict scrutiny and overturn the Florida law, but Blackmun agreed with Douglas that the law was ''reasonably designed to further the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for whom that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden,'' as Douglas wrote in the almost cursory four-page opinion the court issued in April 1974. Before signing on to the final draft of the opinion, Blackmun objected to a footnote that contained an oblique and, in Blackmun's mind, gratuitous reference of Roe v. Wade. Defending his rejection of strict scrutiny, Douglas tried to show that there was nothing in Roe v. Wade that required it; that decision was about women as potential mothers, not women versus men, he maintained. ''Gender has never been rejected as an impermissible classification in all instances,'' Douglas wrote in his draft opinion in the new case. ''When we had before us Roe v. Wade, the court proceeded to treat the abortion problem on the basis that it pertained to the prerogative of the mother in which the putative father had no concern.''
 Blackmun was ''somewhat disturbed'' by the reference, he told Douglas, because in Roe itself, the court had explicitly deferred consideration of whether fathers had any rights in the abortion context. Douglas's reference was ''not consistent'' with the court's decision to avoid the issue, Blackmun said. Douglas responded that Blackmun's point was ''very well taken'' and removed the reference.
That it took 14 months after Roe v. Wade for any mention of abortion to seep into the court's evolving conversation about sex discrimination showed how unrelated the two subjects appeared to the justices. Blackmun and the other justices were extremely reluctant to place a label of sex discrimination even on a policy that involved pregnancy -- mandatory unpaid leaves for public schoolteachers before their pregnancies began to ''show'' -- and which struck most of them as troubling and unfair. ''It is easy to say initially that any regulation which relates to pregnancy is automatically and per se sex discriminatory,'' Blackmun wrote in his memo before the argument in Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, decided in January 1974. ''I am not at all certain that this is necessarily so. Actually, what the regulation does is to draw distinctions between classes of women, that is, those who are pregnant and those who are not pregnant, rather than between male and female.'' Similarly, an Army regulation prohibiting beards, he noted, could not be viewed as sex discrimination, because it applied to only men. At the top of this typewritten memo, Blackmun added a handwritten note: ''N[ot] sex related.'' He eventually joined Potter Stewart's majority opinion that invalidated the mandatory-leave policy on the basis of due process -- that forcing a woman to stop working by her fifth month of pregnancy was ''arbitrary'' -- rather than equal protection; the word ''discrimination'' did not appear in Stewart's opinion.
 Two years later, the deferred question that Blackmun had discussed with Douglas, whether a state could give a man veto power over his wife's decision to have an abortion, reached the court in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth. Blackmun wrote the majority opinion finding a husband's veto unconstitutional, but his tone was detached. Preparing for the argument, he read a brief that framed the issue in overtly feminist terms, and his memo disparaged the presentation. ''This brief, of course, presents the extreme on the female side,'' he wrote to himself. The court's abortion and sex-discrimination cases were still running on their parallel tracks.
 Ginsburg was back before the court in the 1975 term, in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, a challenge to a provision of the Social Security Act that made still another distinction between men and women in calculating government benefits. If a male wage earner died, both his widow and their minor children would receive benefits. But if the wage earner was a woman, benefits would go only to her children and not her husband. The difference was based on the government's assumption that a father was more likely to be a family's breadwinner and would not need the support of his wife's Social Security benefits. Ginsburg's client, Stephen C. Wiesenfeld, was a self-employed consultant whose wife, a schoolteacher, provided most of the couple's income. She died in childbirth, and he was told that while their newborn son was eligible for benefits, he was not.
 The case initially struck Blackmun as little different from Kahn v. Shevin, in which the court recently upheld Florida's preferential tax exemption and rejected Ginsburg's argument on behalf of her male client. In his memo, Blackmun said the premise behind the federal law was sound. Change should come from Congress, not the court. ''That is where it belongs really if changing times are equalizing income as between men and women. . . . So long as the objective of the differential is to alleviate need, I suspect that we shall have to hold that the differential is not unconstitutional.'' His law clerk, Richard Blumenthal, agreed, observing to Blackmun that ''women are more likely to be needy, even in this increasingly liberated age.''
 But as Blackmun listened to Ginsburg, he began to change his mind. ''It is a good clean case, factually,'' he noted to himself during the argument, and the distinction the law made appeared ''useless.'' He gave Ginsburg a B. After initially voting to uphold the law, he eventually joined Brennan's majority opinion that found the sex-based distinction ''entirely irrational.'' 
Even so, Blackmun retained his skepticism. In November 1980, in anticipation that a woman might join their ranks someday, the justices voted to drop the traditional ''Mr. Justice'' in formal court papers. Blackmun made his objections known within the court. ''We seem to be eliminating, step by step, all aspects of diverseness, and we give impetus to the trend toward a colorless society,'' he wrote to his colleagues in protest. Ten months later, Sandra Day O'Connor did join the court. It was far from clear what difference she might make on the issue of sex discrimination. O'Connor had not presented herself as a feminist, and Blackmun did not expect her to be one. The first test came in her first term, when the court accepted a challenge to the constitutionality of a state-supported single-sex college, the Mississippi University for Women.
 Joe Hogan, who was denied admission to the university's nursing school, sued and won a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that his exclusion was unconstitutional. The university appealed. One of Blackmun's law clerks, Kit Kinports, urged him to vote to affirm the decision. ''The opinion need not be a sweeping one,'' she wrote reassuringly. There would be ''very little practical impact'' because there were only two other single-sex state universities in the country. Blackmun was unpersuaded. He would vote to reverse ''despite my clerks,'' he wrote in his memo before the argument in March 1982. The state's defense of its women-only program sounded plausible. ''I am not qualified to say single-sex situation cannot be educationally sound,'' he noted.
 During the arguments in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, Blackmun jotted down his prediction that O'Connor would join him in a vote to reverse. But he was wrong. At the conference, the justices were closely divided. O'Connor, Brennan, White, Marshall and John Paul Stevens voted to affirm, while Blackmun, Burger, Powell, and Rehnquist voted to reverse. The case engaged the court on an emotional level that had been missing from the cases parsing the finer points of Social Security law. ''We all belong to all-male organizations,'' Burger observed during the conference, according to Blackmun's notes. Powell, who had graduated from Washington and Lee University when it was all-male, said that ''all Powells have gone to single-sex schools.'' They were ''perfectly legitimate,'' he said.
 Assigned by Brennan to write the majority opinion, O'Connor circulated a draft that emphasized the anachronistic nature of the university's stated mission, to train ''the girls of the state'' for the ''practical affairs of life.'' Excluding men from the nursing program ''tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman's job'' and makes that view a ''self-fulfilling prophecy,'' O'Connor wrote. Kinports, Blackmun's clerk, urged him to join O'Connor's ''persuasive, analytical and exceedingly narrow opinion,'' but he held firm. His dissenting opinion warned against ''needless conformity'' in the name of equality. ''I have come to suspect that it is easy to go too far with rigid rules in this area of claimed sex discrimination, and to lose -- indeed destroy -- values that mean much to some people by forbidding the State to offer them a choice while not depriving others of an alternative choice.'' 
Sandra Day O'connor surprised Blackmun in the Mississippi case, but there was a bigger challenge to come: her vote the next year in her first abortion case, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. O'Connor dissented from a 6-to-3 majority decision that struck down a package of regulations that Akron, Ohio, had adopted to discourage abortions. The majority held that the regulations, including a 24-hour waiting period, were inconsistent with Roe v. Wade. O'Connor's dissenting opinion not only disputed that conclusion, but also took issue with Roe v. Wade itself. Predicting that the date of fetal viability would move ever closer toward the beginning of a pregnancy, she proclaimed Roe's analytic framework to be ''clearly on a collision course with itself.'' Abortion restrictions should be upheld, O'Connor wrote, as long as they did not present an ''undue burden,'' a standard that would strip the right to abortion of its status as ''fundamental.''
 Just past its 10th anniversary, Roe was in trouble. And it was in the course of protecting Roe that Blackmun began to see himself as protecting the rights of women.
 A series of decisions on whether poor women were entitled to publicly financed abortions had already served to shift Blackmun's focus. He had argued, unsuccessfully, that the government's refusal to pay for abortions for poor women was an indirect circumvention of Roe v. Wade that the court should not permit. His concern in these cases was not doctors, but women -- poor, pregnant, alone, in need. In Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in 1986, the justices voted by only a 5-to-4 majority to strike down a series of anti-abortion regulations from Pennsylvania. As the Roe majority shrank, with Burger having defected and O'Connor having joined the court, Blackmun's previously clinical tone was replaced by something close to passion. Blackmun's majority opinion bore little resemblance to the doctor-centric tone of Roe v. Wade. ''Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy,'' he wrote, than a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.
 By 1989, when the court in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services upheld a series of anti-abortion regulations in a Missouri statute, Blackmun was in dissent. Now, as he contemplated the prospect that Roe itself would soon be overturned, his entire focus was on women. ''I fear for the liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age in the 16 years since Roe was decided,'' he wrote. For Blackmun, the abortion and sex-discrimination cases, having run on parallel tracks for years, were about to converge in the embrace of reproductive freedom as an essential aspect of women's equality. 
 In 1992, the court finally confronted Roe directly in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. At issue was a Pennsylvania law that imposed a series of abortion regulations, similar to those in other recent cases. The Webster case three years earlier indicated that these were likely to be upheld. Further, two of Roe's strongest supporters, Justices Brennan and Marshall, had retired since the Webster decision, succeeded by David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas. Planned Parenthood v. Casey was argued in April 1992. As the country waited for an answer from the court and with a presidential campaign well under way, advocates on both sides gave Roe little prospect of surviving. But it did, with the crucial participation of three Republican-appointed justices: Souter, Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor. They had considered the question, the three wrote in an unusual joint opinion, and had concluded that ''the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.'' With Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurring separately, that meant five votes for the right to abortion. Blackmun's opinion read like a women's rights manifesto:
 A State's restrictions on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of gender equality. State restrictions on abortion compel women to continue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. By restricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State conscripts women's bodies into its service. . . . The State does not compensate women for their services; instead, it assumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. This assumption -- that women can simply be forced to accept the ''natural'' status and incidents of motherhood -- appears to rest upon a conception of women's role that has triggered the protection of the Equal Protection Clause. 
 And then Blackmun did something remarkable. He cited Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, O'Connor's opinion on single-sex education that had provoked his heartfelt dissent 10 years before. The convergence was complete.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the court the next year. Blackmun was wary. Ginsburg had criticized Roe -- its analysis, not its outcome -- in a highly publicized lecture in which she asserted that the court had moved too far and too fast in issuing a decision and that ''a less encompassing Roe'' might have ultimately done more to promote abortion rights. Further, she and Justice Antonin Scalia, Roe's most outspoken critic on the court, were known to be friends from their years together as Court of Appeals judges. ''Can she stand up to A.S.?'' Blackmun noted to himself after her nomination.
 But Ginsburg's first term -- which proved to be Blackmun's last -- demonstrated that she was not about to temper her views to Scalia's liking. The court accepted J.E.B. v. Alabama, a case on whether the Constitution permitted lawyers to strike potential jurors on the basis of sex. Eight years earlier, the court barred race as a factor in jury selection. Applying the same principle to sex was ''inevitable,'' Blackmun wrote in his memo before the argument in November 1993. The conference discussion after the argument was lively, with Scalia particularly energized. To bar the use of sex in jury selection would be a ''terrible thing,'' he said, the ''most radical decision in 30 years.'' The vote to extend the race-discrimination precedent to sex was 6 to 3, with Scalia, Rehnquist and Thomas in dissent. As the senior associate justice, Blackmun had the power to assign opinions when the chief justice was in dissent. He assigned this case to himself.
 His opinion traced the history of the court system's discrimination against women, citing four of the cases Ginsburg had brought to the Supreme Court. His draft included a footnote on whether claims of sex discrimination should be subject to strict judicial scrutiny; although it was not necessary to decide that question in this case, because sex-based jury selection could not be sustained even under a lower standard, the strict-scrutiny question remained open for future cases. The footnote was a bouquet to his new colleague -- offering the prospect that the battle she had lost so long ago might be won yet -- and Ginsburg understood it as such. ''I am pleased to join your opinion and particularly appreciate footnote 6,'' she wrote to Blackmun.
 In an angry dissent, Scalia accused the majority of adopting a ''unisex creed,'' of obscuring its reasoning behind ''anti-male-chauvinist oratory'' in order to ''pay conspicuous obeisance to the equality of the sexes.'' Sandra Day O'Connor joined Blackmun's opinion and filed a separate concurring opinion as well. Ruth Ginsburg said nothing. She had no need to. Harry Blackmun had, finally and improbably, spoken for her.

HEADLINE: Major Leagues Taking a Few Hefty Cuts at the Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
ICHIRO SUZUKI ended last season with a major-league-record 262 hits, and Hideki Matsui started this season with three home runs in the Yankees' first four games and a home-run-averting catch in the opener.
 Suzuki's record performance stamped him with an exclamation point as the remarkable player he has been in his four seasons in the major leagues. Matsui's strong start signaled a performance that will most likely surpass his effort in his first two seasons in the majors.
 Together Suzuki and Matsui are in the forefront of the platoon of Asian players who populate the majors this season. It is an impressive array of players, the largest Asian contingent that has opened a season in the majors in the same season. The platoon numbers 16 -- 10 pitchers and 6 hitters, 12 Japanese and 4 Koreans. 
 Until Suzuki and then Matsui came along, baseball people had doubts that Japanese hitters could make it in the majors. But Suzuki, the Mariners' right fielder, and Matsui, the Yankees' left fielder, have erased those doubts 
 ''From a talent standpoint, these two are exceptions, but I think there will be other hitters to follow,'' said Pat Gillick, who has been the general manager of three teams and signed Suzuki for one of them. ''People say only pitchers can succeed here, but I think there will be hitters coming out of Asia.''
 Arn Tellem, the agent for Hideki and the Mets' Kazuo Matsui, agreed with Gillick's view. ''The level of play there is right there with ours,'' said Tellem, who also represents foreign N.B.A. players. ''There are a number of players there who can play here.''
 Besides Suzuki and the Matsuis, other Asian hitters in the majors are Tadahito Iguchi (White Sox), first baseman Hee Seop Choi (Dodgers) and outfielder So Taguchi (Cardinals). Choi is Korean, the others Japanese.
 Pitching in the majors are Kazuhisa Ishii and Dae Sung Koo (Mets), Hideo Nomo (Devil Rays), Chan Ho Park (Rangers), Shigetoshi Hasegawa (Mariners), Shingo Takatsu (White Sox), Byung Hyun Kim (Rockies), Akinori Otsuka (Padres), Tomo Ohka (Nationals) and Keiichi Yabu (Athletics). Koo, Kim and Park are Korean, the others Japanese.
 Chin Hui Tsao, who is Taiwanese, was scheduled to be the Rockies' closer, but he began the season on the disabled list.
 The Mets have the largest contingent of Asian players with Kazuo Matsui, Ishii and Koo and could add a fourth in Jae Seo if their pitchers keep getting hurt.
 ''It started with Nomo,'' Omar Minaya, the Mets' general manager, said of the Asian influx. ''He was the first in this era. He opened the doors.''
 Nomo, a 36-year-old right-hander, is in his 11th season in the majors, having started with the Dodgers in 1995. He is sixth career in strikeouts per nine innings (8.93) and is seventh among active pitchers in hits per nine innings (7.84).
 Suzuki was the pioneer Asian hitter. Gillick said the Mariners pursued him on the advice of Jim Colborn, now the Dodgers' pitching coach, then the Mariners' director of Pacific Rim scouting, and Ted Heid, who holds Colborn's old job. Colborn had been pitching coach for the Orix Blue Wave, Suzuki's Japanese team for nine years.
 ''They knew not only his physical talent but knew his mental makeup,'' Gillick said. ''They motivated the organization to go after him.''
 Suzuki and Hideki Matsui were stars in Japan and could have remained stars in their native country. But they had other thoughts.
 ''It's a challenge to play in the major leagues, to play against the best competition and show that they can succeed here,'' Tellem said. ''I think that's the primary motivation. They're leaving the security of home, where they already are a star and are making a good living, and putting it all on the line here. They're making adjustments to live here for the love of baseball and their dreams of playing in the major leagues.''
 Some players sign with major league teams for less money than they could make in Japan. Koo, for example, opted to play for the Mets for $450,000 this year when he could have played in Japan for $1 million.
 ''They want to play with the players considered the best in the world,'' Minaya said. ''They want to challenge themselves against the best.''
 From Major League Baseball's standpoint, Tellem said, it makes sense to pursue Asian players.
 ''The major leagues want to have the best players,'' Tellem said. ''It's another source of talent. It helps when baseball opens itself to all types of nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. I think it makes it a better game and a stronger game. And it's good from a business perspective. Baseball is global. People want to see players from all over playing in the major leagues.''
 Gillick, a special consultant for the Mariners, sees an even greater influx of players from the Far East.
 ''Maybe not in our lifetime, but I think China will produce some players,'' he said.
 ''We've had the Chinese team train with the Mariners in the winter. You can see the progress they've made in the last two years. I think at some point China will produce players who can play in the majors.''

Quiet Charity for Tsunami Victims
 At home in Japan, the Yankees' Hideki Matsui ''is a combination of Michael Jordan and Elvis Presley,'' said his agent, Arn Tellem. But his stature goes beyond celebrity and popularity. 
 After the tsunami, Tellem said, ''when I was trying to get players to raise money for tsunami relief, I sent him and his father an e-mail.'' 
 ''They replied that they appreciated my concern and my suggestions,'' Tellem said, ''and then they told me they had already gone to the head of Asian relief and he gave the equivalent of $500,000 without any fanfare, almost anonymously.''

A Threesome No More
 They broke up that old gang of theirs, the Oakland Athletics did, and so there were Barry Zito pitching for the Athletics last Monday, Tim Hudson for Atlanta on Thursday and Mark Mulder for St. Louis on Friday.
 ''It was going to happen sooner or later, but maybe not in the way it did or as quick as it did,'' Mulder said.
 Faced with their economic plight, the Athletics reluctantly traded Hudson to the Braves last Dec. 16 and Mulder to the Cardinals two days later, leaving Zito by his lonesome. The three pitchers had been together since the 2000 season, serving as the force that led Oakland to three division titles and four playoff appearances in four seasons.
 ''Yeah, I was surprised,'' Mulder said of his trade. ''It wasn't something I expected, especially two or three days after they traded Huddy. But it was exciting going to a good team that was in the World Series last year.''
 Mulder and Hudson were the latest front-line members of the team to leave because the low-revenue Athletics did not feel they could afford to re-sign them, following Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, Miguel Tejada and Jason Isringhausen out the Coliseum door.
 ''I loved playing there,'' Mulder said. ''It was awesome while I was there. It was just unfortunate that we couldn't keep everyone together -- Tejada and Damon and Giambi and Izzy and a bunch of guys -- but I think we all kind of accepted it. That's the way it was.''
 Despite their good pitching, the Athletics never got beyond the first round in the postseason. Did the players feel an urgency to win while the starting corps was intact?
 ''There's an urgency to win every year,'' Mulder said. ''Nobody changed our approach just because we lost another guy. We just went out there and got the job done. But that's why we all loved playing there so much because we were always the underdogs.''
 The Cardinals will play the Braves the last weekend of this month and the first weekend of August. Mulder said he was looking forward to playing, if not batting, against Hudson.
 ''It will be fun,'' he said. ''I don't think either of us hit all that well, so it will be interesting having to face each other. The only thing is both of us know what the other person has because we played catch together every day.''
 Will that help Mulder hit Hudson? ''No, not at all.'' Mulder said, ''Not in the least.''

It's the Time of the Season
 Pitchers are always said to be ahead of the hitters early in the season, but this far ahead? 
 In the first 58 games, through Friday night, 12 starting pitchers (13 if an unearned run is not counted) gave up no runs while working anywhere from six to nine innings. Dontrelle Willis of Florida had the only shutout, while Jeff Weaver of the Dodgers and Mark Buehrle of the White Sox each allowed no runs in eight innings.
 Twenty-seven pitchers gave up one run while lasting anywhere from five to eight innings, with Jake Westbrook of Cleveland and Denny Bautista of Kansas City the most effective with one run in eight innings. There have been two 1-0 games, one lasting 12 innings.

Are We Having Fun Yet?
 Peter Angelos is presumably not a happy man today. Or is he? Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' owner, is not saying.
 Last summer, Commissioner Bud Selig said that in relocating the Montreal Expos he would do nothing that would make Angelos unhappy. Some inferred from that comment that Selig would not award the Expos to Washington because Angelos was dead set against that move.
 But Selig did send the Expos to Washington, and Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, spent six months negotiating an economic deal with Angelos that was supposed to make him happy. 
 Angelos, however, has not said he is happy. He has not said anything. Despite repeated calls to his law office in Baltimore and his promise to call back, Angelos has not returned the calls and has not spoken about the deal. One could assume that if he was happy with the deal, he would be willing to talk about it.
 Then again, if he were not happy with it, why would he accept it?

HEADLINE: The Slow Fadeout of Rent Regulated Apartments

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
In the last decade, the number of rent-regulated apartments in New York City has been gradually diminishing. Now, statistics indicate, the gradual has become less gradual -- the era of rent regulation is ever more rapidly fading. 
 According to figures provided by landlords to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, 13,024 apartments were removed from the rolls last year, compared with 8,402 in 2003 and 6,406 in 2002. 
 For decades, New York City was synonymous with rent regulation, and a regulated apartment, protected by a system of rent control and rent stabilization that kept rents from rising abruptly, was the holy grail. In the early 60's, 77 percent of the city's rental housing stock was covered by the system; now, 51.5 percent of the stock is regulated. 
 ''I'm stunned by the pace of destabilization,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor and a demographic statistician at Queens College. 
 Precise figures for how many apartments have left the system over the years do not exist because various governmental agencies rely on different data sets, and their samples are flawed. They do, however, point in one direction -- decreasing units.
 The process is quite visible at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, two vast, adjoining apartment complexes along First Avenue between 14th and 23rd Streets that have stood as bulwarks of the city's rent-regulated stock for half a century.
 But four years ago, as rents for vacated, renovated apartments at the two complexes reached $2,000 a month, the process of deregulation began. When a tenant moves out or dies and the allowable rent reaches that level, a landlord can choose to take the apartment out of the system. Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village have many older people in their regulated apartments. 
 While regulated rents at the complexes range from about $1,400 to $1,800 for a two-bedroom, a deregulated rent for the same space is $3,200. So far, according to representatives of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which owns the complexes, about 20 percent -- or 2,240 -- of the 11,216 units in 110 buildings have been deregulated. 
 Rent control applies to rental units in buildings constructed before 1947 that have been continuously occupied by the same tenant or a legal successor tenant since before July 1, 1971. Rent stabilization generally applies to apartments in buildings with six or more units built between 1947 and 1974, to some loft buildings, and to some buildings whose landlords participate in tax-abatement or other government programs. 
 According to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau every three years, there were 1,241,367 regulated apartments in the five boroughs in 1981. Over the next 18 years, by 1999, the total decreased to 1,146,459 -- a drop of 94,908 units. And by 2002, just three years later, an additional 73,271 apartments were deregulated. That constituted a net drop of 168,179 units over those two decades.
 But, as Ingrid Gould Ellen, deputy director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, pointed out, there was a significant sampling error in the 1990 census, upon which the Housing and Vacancy Survey is based -- an undercount of about 400,000 households in the city. ''When you look at changes between the 1990's and the 2002 survey, the samples are not comparable,'' Dr. Ellen said.
 For a number of years, building owners were required to file reports with the state on the number of units deregulated each year. But their participation in that system was voluntary between 1994 and 2000, so those numbers are also not considered ideal as a historical measure. 
 Nevertheless, all numbers indicate a decrease, and there is, not surprisingly, a debate over whether the change is good or bad for New York.
 Many lament it as a shift that will reduce the amount of housing that can accommodate people earning typical incomes. ''We're already in the middle of a process through which a large proportion of the city's affordable rentals are slipping out of the stock,'' said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation.
 Others believe that decades of rent regulation have distorted housing prices and discouraged construction and renovation. The shift can't come soon enough for Peter D. Salins, co-author of ''Scarcity by Design: The Legacy of New York City's Housing Policies'' (Harvard University Press, 1992). 
 Dr. Salins said rent regulation has created an imbalance in the housing market, limiting the supply and, thereby, ratcheting up the cost of market-rate units. ''The entire supply and demand dynamic only acts on a portion of the market,'' he said. ''So astronomical market-rate rents and the price of comparable condos and co-ops indirectly make all housing in the city more expensive.''
 In the high-rent districts of Manhattan, the impetus to deregulate is particularly strong. The average market-rate rent for apartments of all sizes below 103rd Street is $2,706, said Nancy Packes, president of Halstead Leasing Consultants. The average regulated rent below East 96th Street and West 110th Street, according to the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, was $1,262 in 2002, the latest figure available.
 Under state rent laws, the owner of a vacated apartment is entitled to a 20 percent increase. Then, if renovations are made, one-fortieth of the cost can be added to the monthly rent, in perpetuity (a $40,000 renovation would provide a $1,000 increase). And if the vacancy and renovation increases push the rent above $2,000, the apartment can be deregulated.
 That situation, said Andrew Scherer, author of ''Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York'' (West Group, 2001), prompts some owners to start eviction proceedings. 
 ''Where a few years ago a landlord might not have even brought a proceeding,'' he said, ''they now go to great lengths to find cause to evict regulated tenants, particularly in gentrifying neighborhoods.'' There are more eviction proceedings in Manhattan than in any other borough, he said, with landlords frequently claiming that the residents don't live there full time, or that they sublet illegally.
 Big complexes that have been home to middle-income residents for many years are just at the beginning of the shift out of regulation, like Lenox Terrace -- a development of six 17-story towers between Fifth and Lenox Avenues from 132nd to 135th Streets.
 Hanging on a wall of the Lenox Terrace rental office is an Art Deco style poster from 1958, the year the first building opened. The poster, depicting a crisply uniformed doorman with a whistle at his lips, declares, ''Harlem's first luxury apartments offer Park Avenue elegance.'' 
 Prices on the poster are a bit dated: ''Two to five rooms -- $96 and up.''
 These days, rents at Lenox Terrace range from $975 for a studio to $2,100 for the most expensive two-bedroom, although no apartments have so far been rented at the top prices. Whenever a tenant moves out, the owner of Lenox Terrace, the Olnick Organization, renovates the apartment, allowing it to raise the rent. 
 ''We don't look at this process as a mechanism to move out of rent stabilization,'' said Neil L. Rubler, an executive vice president at the Olnick Organization. ''We spend exactly as much on an apartment renovation as we need to deliver a first-class product in keeping with the property's tradition. If we do get the legal rent over $2,000 we, of course, will deregulate the apartment.'' 
 Tremors in the rent system are evident even in the depths of the boroughs outside of Manhattan. In East Flatbush, Brooklyn, for example, a somewhat deteriorated development of 59 six-story buildings (where Barbra Streisand grew up) is now undergoing a $17 million capital improvement program designed to attract a middle-income clientele. It may take years before any rents at the complex -- formerly called Vanderveer Estates, and now Flatbush Gardens -- climb above the transformational $2,000 mark. But they are inching closer.
 The new owner, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, paid $87 million to buy the property out of receivership. It no longer charges what are called preferential rents, meaning less than the legally allowable regulated rent. Over the last 20 years, all five previous owners had charged the lower, preferential rents, because that was what the local market could bear. A year ago, the average rent was $720. Two-bedrooms now start at $950; three-bedrooms at $1,250.
 If, over time, the city's entire rental stock were deregulated, there would be minimal increases outside Manhattan, ''where there already isn't much difference between regulated and market rents,'' Dr. Salins said. ''And in Manhattan, if everything was deregulated it would be much harder for new buildings to get $5,000 for a two-bedroom apartment when the deregulated comparable units in the building next door had been receiving $1,800. Both will now rent probably for something closer to $3,000.''
 Dr. Salins called for outright vacancy decontrol, with no $2,000 rent requirement. ''It would protect all current tenants, but let apartments reach market levels when they moved out,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Scherer points out that rent regulation is not merely meant to protect current tenants. An underlying concept, he said, ''was that market forces alone weren't sufficient to keep rents at a level that allows working people and low-income people to stay in the city.''
 ''Manhattan has already become, pretty much, only for the rich,'' he said, ''and neighborhood by neighborhood, other parts of the city are changing in that direction.''
 Under state law, rent regulation is initiated when vacancy rates drop below 5 percent. According to the Housing and Vacancy Survey, the percentage of vacant apartments in 2002 was 2.9 percent, down from 3.2 percent in 1999 and 4 percent in 1996.
 Dr. Ellen at N.Y.U. noted that the city's share of renter households living in severely crowded conditions (defined as 1.5 people per room, not counting kitchens and bathrooms) is 3.9 percent, four times the national rate of 0.94 percent, and that 22.7 percent of renter households spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent.
 If there is a discernible face on the future of rent regulation in the city, it is in the construction and rehabilitation of buildings through government subsidy and tax-abatement programs. Under those programs, typically, developers must set aside 20 percent of the apartments in their well-appointed buildings for lower-income tenants, or must finance affordable housing elsewhere in the city. And while the new, so-called 80-20 buildings are registered as regulated, their initial rents are set at market rate -- often over the $2,000 mark -- with future increases capped according to the rent-stabilization system.
 Nicole Christie appreciates her regulated, one-bedroom apartment in a doorman building on 34th Street in Murray Hill -- even though her rent is $2,800.
 Ms. Christie, a corporate communications consultant, moved from Seattle in November. ''I'd never heard of rent stabilization,'' she said, ''but the leasing agent explained that there was a cap on how much the landlord could increase my rent every year.'' She liked anything, she said, that would ''increase the predictability of your cost of living in Manhattan.''
 In Seattle, Ms. Christie built a 2,400-square-foot home in an upscale neighborhood. ''My mortgage was $300 less than the rent I now pay in Manhattan, and my house was four times the size of my apartment,'' she said. ''It's insane, but it's as good a deal as it can be in Manhattan.''
 For Angela Faulcon, living in West End Towers, an 80-20 building on West End Avenue at 62nd Street, is ''an excellent deal.'' 
 Ms. Faulcon, a single mother of two, grew up with eight brothers and sisters in Polo Grounds Towers, a housing project in Harlem. The 24-hour doorman building where she now rents a two-bedroom apartment ''is pretty fancy,'' she said. ''And I really like my view of the Hudson River.''
 A traffic court clerk for the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, Ms. Faulcon earns ''in the 30's,'' she said, qualifying her for an apartment set aside for those with lower incomes. For an apartment that rents to others for $2,400, she pays $532.
 West End Towers is one of nine tax-abated buildings, with a total of about 3,000 apartments, developed over the last 20 years by the Brodsky Organization -- creating about 600 affordable units. 
 Daniel Brodsky, the company's president, said that these situations are going to be increasingly common. ''The only rental housing that's going to be built is with these subsidies or tax abatements; it's the way of the future,'' he said. ''And with these programs, it's right that the buildings are regulated since the public is helping to create this housing and is entitled to insurances that rents are reasonably controlled.''
 Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation agreed. ''Opportunities for developing many more affordable rental units are generally limited to these kinds of 80-20 deals,'' he said. ''This is the only game in town.''
 Still, there is a catch -- the abatements expire, usually after 20 years, and then the apartments revert to market rents. 
 Rafael Cestero, deputy commissioner for development at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the department is instituting strategies ''to maintain the pipeline.''
 It is working with other city agencies to identify property available for affordable rental development. And under what is called the Inclusionary Housing Program, market-rate developers are granted varying levels of increased density in exchange for setting aside 15 to 30 percent of their apartments at affordable rates. ''As long as the building stands, the units will be registered and their increases governed by rent stabilization,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''And if rent regulations were ever to disappear, these units would remain affordable under a use-restriction placed on the title of the property.''

HEADLINE: Telling Tales of History, Myth, Fantasy (and Real Life, Too)

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
A rainbow has settled over regional museums and art centers. It may just be a byproduct of the torrid economic storm they have weathered the last couple of years, or it may be a sign that positive changes are afoot. I think it is the latter.
 One good development is a new camaraderie among regional institutions. In Connecticut, for instance, three art spaces -- Artspace in New Haven, the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield and Real Art Ways in Hartford -- are planning a joint statewide exhibition for next year, while the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan and the plucky Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts in Long Branch, N.J., are collaborating on ''Characters,'' on view at both sites until later this month. 
 Regional museums can achieve much by working together. Collaboration cuts costs, facilitates loans of expensive equipment (like video projectors) and increases access to collections. And it helps open these institutions to different kinds of audiences.
 ''Characters,'' organized by Helianthe Bourdeaux-Maurin, an independent curator, explores the role of storytelling in contemporary art. Narrative has been the backbone of visual art since Paleolithic artists scrawled roaming bison, horses and deer pursued by matchstick figures on the walls of the Lascaux caves. But in the 20th century, this style retreated to the periphery, replaced by more formal, abstract, minimal and conceptual art forms. It was really only with Pop that narrative-based art returned to museum walls. (It was, of course, always popular in the art market.)
 ''Characters'' endeavors to flesh out this thesis, mustering examples of the work of around two dozen well-known and emerging artists from the United States, Asia and Europe. The show offers only a snapshot of its theme, but the curator has nonetheless found works worthy of attention for their individual aesthetic merits and for their ability to illustrate the wider point.
 The show is divided between the sites, with each artist represented by a few works in both places (except for Cindy Sherman, who is showing only at Silvermine after some crucial loans fell through). This creates a sense of two complementary if occasionally overlapping exhibitions; the videos, for example, are the same in both spaces. But you will not have seen the complete exhibition unless you visit both sites.
 The essence of a good story is character, and both shows abound with imagery of real and imaginary characters. Various artists fuse their life experience with characters from history and mythology to create fantasy characters, while others engage popular stereotypes. Still others play with archetypes, or mine fairy tales, comic or children's books, film characters and cartoons.
 There is a preponderance of diligent, colorful and often funny graphic work. Many of the artists also resort to a naive, childlike drawing style to beguile the viewer. This at times results in superficial work that is too cute, for example, in Yoshitomo Nara's pastel lithographs of bratty guitar-playing girls, or everything by Takashi Murakami.
 But all is not so wholesome. There is a sado-erotic streak to quite a bit of the imagery, like Kyung Jeon's kinky fusion of characters from old Korean children's books and the Kama Sutra, or Chitra Ganesh's dynamic drawings of figures with multiple heads, arms and orifices.
 Jeremy Bronson's short animated video ''Timekeepers'' (2005), a fantasy narrative, is an exhibition highlight. For this piece, he used hand-crafted and painted sets and models (made with wire, foam, latex and found objects) to create a narrative-based stop-motion animation picture show. 
 James Bewley is one of the artists who take their own lives as a starting point for their work. His gouaches depict a character in a bat suit whose bumbling adventures are based loosely on his life. He places his suited antihero in ridiculous situations, like trying to chat up women, smoking a cigar or riding a motorcycle to church.
 Then there are the video artists, like Shannon Plumb and Julian Stark, who not only use their lives for inspiration, but also perform in their works. To some extent, the sculptor Nina Levy also does this. A merry prankster, Ms. Levy is showing life-size versions of her naked torso at each site. At Silvermine, the work is ''Spectator,'' representing the viewer, I guess, busy puzzling out the rest of the exhibition.
 ''Characters: Scene I'' is at Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts, 20 Third Avenue, Long Branch, N.J., through April 26. Information: www.sica.org or (732)263-1121. ''Characters: Scene II'' is at Silvermine Guild Arts Center, 1037 Silvermine Road, New Canaan, through April 21. Information: www.silvermineart.org or (203)966-9700.

HEADLINE: Remembering the Doolittle Raiders

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
KEITH B. NEILSON, the owner of an engineering company in Mystic, has been fascinated with flying since he was a toddler, and captivated by the exploits of the Doolittle Raiders since he was a preschooler.
 The first airplane model he built was a B-25, the same kind the Raiders took into battle in World War II, and until he was a teenager he wanted to marry someone who looked like Phyllis Thaxter, the actress who played the lead female role in ''Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,'' about the Doolittle raid in 1942.
 Mr. Neilson has learned his fascination is not unique. 
 The Greater Mystic Chamber of Commerce will be host to the 2005 Doolittle Raiders reunion Thursday through Sunday in Groton, New London and Mystic. 
 Mr. Neilson is chairman of the reunion, which is taking place in New England for the first time. 
 Hotels in the area are fully booked, and there are people coming from as far away as China and Japan. Dozens of businesses have signed on as sponsors, and it's been difficult keeping track of the people who have volunteered to do everything from set up for book signings to cleaning up after the dinner.
 ''We've talked to people from about 30 states who are coming,'' Mr. Neilson said. ''A year ago, when I first started planning this, I got a call from a woman in Michigan who asked where they were going to be. She made her reservations immediately, because she wanted to be at the same hotel. I never expected it to get this big.''
 The chamber has been inundated with requests from groups that want to be host to Raiders' functions. Lt. Col. William P. Shea, commander of the Connecticut National Guard 1,109th Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot in Groton, will greet nine Raiders who are expected to attend when they arrive on Thursday. The Raiders will be introduced to a unit that was among the first to deploy to the Iraq war. 
 ''The opportunity to meet these great Americans is just phenomenal, particularly our soldiers, this generation's warriors, getting to meet these soldiers of the greatest generation,'' Colonel Shea said.
 The raid, the first American strike against mainland Japan in World War II, is named after the Army Air Forces officer who led it on April 18, 1942, then-Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle. Eighty men in 16 B-25 medium bombers flew off the decks of the aircraft carrier Hornet, knowing they could not return to the ship because it was not large enough for their planes to land.
 The Raiders were supposed to land at an airstrip in China. None of them made it there: 11 of the five-man crews bailed out over China when they could not find the airport, one crew crash-landed in a rice paddy, three crashed into the water off the China coast and one landed in the Soviet Union.
 Of the 80 men, three were killed jumping from their aircraft, and eight were captured by the Japanese -- three of them were executed Oct. 15 of that year. 
 Thomas G. Casey, business manager for the Doolittle Raiders (17 still survive), said the men entertain proposals from groups around the country that want to be host to the reunion every year, and look not only at the setting but at proposals to use the event for fund-raising for a local purpose. In Connecticut, the reunion is expected to generate $5,000 for local scholarships.
 ''When they sent in their presentation last year, I read it at the reunion in Tucson, we looked over the demographics of the community, we looked over the things that they wanted to do, and it was no question about it, it was a 100 percent vote that we would celebrate the 63rd in Mystic,'' Mr. Casey said. ''There were two other programs on the table that were completely dismissed because the Mystic offer was so inviting.''
 Southeastern Connecticut is known primarily as a sea services area, for the presence of the Naval Submarine Base in Groton and the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London. But Jeweldeen (Deen) Brown of Montville knows first-hand that the Navy played an important role in the raid as well -- he was a radioman on the U.S.S. Trout, one of two submarines that, along with 15 Navy ships, escorted the Hornet deep into enemy waters. This will be his first opportunity to meet the men he helped to protect.
 ''Most of us had just gone through Pearl Harbor, and we wanted to hit back,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Doolittle's raiders might not have known it at the time, but every one of us was riding with them in spirit it was a great morale booster for the American people.''
 Dr. Walter P. Doolittle, a Preston veterinarian and reunion committee member, who is a distant cousin of the raid's namesake, said while joint services operations are normal today, the Doolittle raid was one of the first major collaborations between the Army and the Navy.
 ''This is the biggest national event ever to come to Groton,'' Dr. Doolittle said.
 Glenn M. Wilson, director of Groton Utilities, a sponsor of the event, said he hopes the reunion sparks greater appreciation for the military, particularly this year, when the region is at risk of losing a large part of its economy in the 2005 base closure process. Some analysts consider the Groton submarine base to be at risk. Richard Cole, 89, Colonel Doolittle's co-pilot on that fateful day, was at the February event in Groton announcing that the Mystic group had been awarded the reunion.
 ''I had chills when I had the opportunity to introduce Deen Brown to Dick Cole, and have in front of me 50-plus submarine veterans and World War II pilots,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''Looking out into that audience, there wasn't a dry eye, including the 60-some high school kids who were there. As one of the high school kids put it, you don't often get a chance to meet someone who made history.''
 Bridget A. Linicus, owner of a Stonington insurance company and the reunion administrator, said there will be a combination of public, private and paid events. Perhaps the most celebrated of the private events will be the goblet ceremony, where the Raiders will toast their departed comrades. The paid festivities begin with a reception at 6 p.m. Thursday at the City of Groton Municipal Building, which will cost $25 a ticket, and the free public events start Friday with an event from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Leamy Hall on the grounds of the Coast Guard Academy.
 Ms. Linicus said that when she agreed to take the job she expected it be about 15 hours a week.
 ''It's kind of taken over my life,'' Ms. Linicus said. ''I'm putting in 35 or 40 hours a week, at least. But it's also the most exciting event I have ever worked on. People are so thrilled this is happening here.''

HEADLINE: What do you call two straight men having dinner?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
THE delicate posturing began with the phone call. 
 The proposal was that two buddies back in New York City for a holiday break in December meet to visit the Museum of Modern Art after its major renovation.
 ''He explicitly said, 'I know this is kind of weird, but we should probably go,''' said Matthew Speiser, 25, recalling his conversation with John Putman, 28, a former classmate from Williams College.
 The weirdness was apparent once they reached the museum, where they semi-avoided each other as they made their way through the galleries and eschewed any public displays of connoisseurship. ''We definitely went out of our way to look at things separately,'' recalled Mr. Speiser, who has had art-history classes in his time. 
 ''We shuffled. We probably both pretended to know less about the art than we did.''
 Eager to cut the tension following what they perceived to be a slightly unmanly excursion -- two guys looking at art together -- they headed directly to a bar. ''We couldn't stop talking about the fact that it was ridiculous we had spent the whole day together one on one,'' said Mr. Speiser, who is straight, as is Mr. Putman. ''We were purging ourselves of insecurity.''
 Anyone who finds a date with a potential romantic partner to be a minefield of unspoken rules should consider the man date, a rendezvous between two straight men that is even more socially perilous. 
 Simply defined a man date is two heterosexual men socializing without the crutch of business or sports. It is two guys meeting for the kind of outing a straight man might reasonably arrange with a woman. Dining together across a table without the aid of a television is a man date; eating at a bar is not. Taking a walk in the park together is a man date; going for a jog is not. Attending the movie ''Friday Night Lights'' is a man date, but going to see the Jets play is definitely not. 
 ''Sideways,'' the Oscar-winning film about two buddies touring the central California wine country on the eve of the wedding of one of them, is one long and boozy man date. 
 Although ''man date'' is a coinage invented for this article, appearing nowhere in the literature of male bonding (or of homosexual panic), the 30 to 40 straight men interviewed, from their 20's to their 50's, living in cities across the country, instantly recognized the peculiar ritual even if they had not consciously examined its dos and don'ts. Depending on the activity and on the two men involved, an undercurrent of homoeroticism that may be present determines what feels comfortable or not on a man date, as Mr. Speiser and Mr. Putman discovered in their squeamishness at the Modern. 
 Jim O'Donnell, a professor of business and economics at Huntington University in Indiana, who said his life had been changed by a male friend, urges men to get over their discomfort in socializing one on one because they have much to gain from the emotional support of male friendships. (Women understand this instinctively, which is why there is no female equivalent to the awkward man date; straight women have long met for dinner or a movie without a second thought.) 
 ''A lot of quality time is lost as we fritter around with minor stuff like the Final Four scores,'' said Mr. O'Donnell, who was on the verge of divorce in the mid-1980's before a series of conversations over meals and walks with a friend 20 years his senior changed his thinking. ''He was instrumental in turning me around in the vulnerability that he showed,'' said Mr. O'Donnell, who wrote about the friendship in a book, ''Walking With Arthur.'' ''I can remember times when he wanted to know why I was going to leave my wife. No guy had ever done that before.''
 While some men explicitly seek man dates, and others flatly reject them as pointless, most seem to view them as an unavoidable form of socializing in an age when friends can often catch up only by planning in advance. The ritual comes particularly into play for many men after college, as they adjust to a more structured, less spontaneous social life. ''You see kids in college talking to each other, bull sessions,'' said Peter Nardi, a sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who edited a book called ''Men's Friendships.'' ''But the opportunities to get close to another man, to share and talk about their feelings, are not available after a certain age.'' 
 The concern about being perceived as gay is one of the major complications of socializing one on one, many straight men acknowledge. That is what Mr. Speiser, now a graduate student at the University of Virginia, recalled about another man date he set up at a highly praised Italian restaurant in a strip mall in Charlottesville. It seemed a comfortable choice to meet his roommate, Thomas Kim, a lawyer, but no sooner had they walked in than they were confronted by cello music, amber lights, white tablecloths and a wine list. 
 The two exchanged a look. ''It was funny,'' Mr. Speiser said. ''We just knew we couldn't do it.'' Within minutes they were eating fried chicken at a ''down and dirty'' place down the road. 
 Mr. Kim, 28, who is now married, was flustered in part because he saw someone he knew at the Italian restaurant. ''I was kind of worried that word might get out,'' he said. ''This is weird, and now there is a witness maybe.''
 Dinner with a friend has not always been so fraught. Before women were considered men's equals, some gender historians say, men routinely confided in and sought advice from one another in ways they did not do with women, even their wives. Then, these scholars say, two things changed during the last century: an increased public awareness of homosexuality created a stigma around male intimacy, and at the same time women began encroaching on traditionally male spheres, causing men to become more defensive about notions of masculinity.
 ''If men become too close to other men, then they are always vulnerable to this accusation of, 'Oh, you must be gay,''' said Gregory Lehne, a medical psychologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who has studied gender issues. At the same time, he added, ''When you have women in the same world and seeking equality with men, then all of a sudden issues emerge in the need to maintain the male sex role.'' 
 And thus a simple meal turns into social Stratego. Some men avoid dinner altogether unless the friend is coming from out of town or has a specific problem that he wants advice about. Otherwise, grabbing beers at a bar will do just fine, thank you. 
 Other men say dinners may be all right, but never brunch, although a post-hangover meal taking place during brunch hours is O.K. ''The company at that point is purely secondary,'' explained Steven Carlson, 29, a public relations executive in Chicago. 
 Almost all men agree that beer and hard alcohol are acceptable man date beverages, but wine is risky. And sharing a bottle is out of the question. ''If a guy wants to get a glass of wine, that's O.K.,'' said Rob Discher, 24, who moved to Washington from Dallas and has dinner regularly with his male roommate. ''But there is something kind of odd about splitting a bottle of wine with a guy.''
 Other restaurant red flags include coat checks, busboys who ask, ''Still or sparkling?'' and candles, unless there is a power failure. All of those are fine, however, at a steakhouse. ''Your one go-to is if you go and get some kind of meat product,'' explained James Halow, 28, who works for a leveraged buyout firm in San Francisco.
 Cooking for a friend at home violates the man date comfort zone for almost everyone, with a possible exemption for grilling or deep-frying. ''The grilling thing would take away the majority of the stigma because there is a masculine overtone to the grill,'' Mr. Discher said.
 And man dates should always be Dutch treat, men agree. Armen Myers, 28, a lawyer in New York who is an unabashed man dater, remembers when he tried to pay for dinner for a friend. ''I just plopped out the money and didn't even think about it,'' Mr. Myers said. ''He said, 'What are you doing?' And I'm like: 'I was going to pay. What's the big deal?' And he said something like, 'Guys don't pay for me,' or 'No one pays for me.' There was a certain slight power issue.''
 When attending a movie together -- preferably with explosions or heavy special effects, never a romantic comedy -- guys prefer to put a nice big seat between each other. (This only sounds like an episode of ''Seinfeld.'') ''Going to the movie with one other guy is sort of weird, but you can balance it out by having a seat space between you,'' explained Ames McArdle, a financial analyst in Washington. 
 Men who avoid man dates altogether are often puzzled by the suggestion that they might like to spend time with male friends. ''If you're buddies with another guy, there shouldn't be any work involved,'' Mr. Halow of San Francisco said. Which is why many men say that a successful man dates requires a guy to demonstrate concern for his friend without ever letting on. ''The amount of preparation that the other guy is making is directly proportional to how awkward it is,'' Mr. McArdle of Washington said.
 When man daters socialize with non-man daters, the activities always fall to the lowest common denominator. Mr. Myers of New York remembers how he would ask his roommate Jonathan Freimann out for dinner by himself. But Mr. Freimann would instinctively pre-empt, by asking other guys along. 
 ''If I had known he wanted to spend one-on-one time, I would have,'' Mr. Freimann explained, adding that group dinners had simply seemed ''more fun.'' (The two had dinner in San Diego last week.)
 Jeffrey Toohig, 27, is a more reliable bet for Mr. Myers. They regularly have dinner together to discuss women, jobs and whatever else is on their minds, because, as Mr. Toohig put it, ''the conversation is more in-depth than you can have at a bar.'' Mr. Toohig, who is looking for a job helping underdeveloped countries, divides his male friends into two groups: ''good friends who I go out one on one with, and guys I go out with and we have beers and wings.'' And, he pointed out, dinner with Mr. Myers has the advantage of not making his girlfriend jealous, the way dinners with his female friends do. 
 All men, however, agree that one rule of guy-meets-guy time is inviolable: if a woman enters the picture, a man can drop his buddies, last minute, no questions asked. 
 A romantic date always trumps a man date.

HEADLINE: Tenant Surcharges For Appliances

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
LATE last month, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency that administers the rent-regulation laws, issued an operational bulletin that allows landlords, for the first time, to impose surcharges on tenants who install washers, dryers or dishwashers in their apartments.
 Landlords, and the lawyers who represent them, welcomed the action, but they said they are concerned that implementing the surcharge could increase landlord-tenant litigation.
 Marcia Hirsch, the state agency's general counsel, said that on March 24, it issued Operational Bulletin 2005-1, which applies to both rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The bulletin provides that when a tenant requests permission to install a washer, dryer or dishwasher, and the owner consents, the owner can collect a surcharge for each appliance. The bulletin also allows a landlord to impose the surcharge when a tenant has installed a washer, dryer or dishwasher -- portable or permanent -- without prior consent. 
 Ms. Hirsch emphasized that the bulletin does not require landlords to allow tenants to install the appliances. When a landlord finds out that a tenant has installed an appliance without consent, she said, and the owner agrees to the continued use of the appliance, he cannot collect the surcharge retroactively. 
 The surcharges do not become part of the legal regulated rent for purposes of computing any increases under the rent laws, she said.
 Ms. Hirsch said that the surcharges were computed by considering the costs of water and of heating the water, the cost of electricity and the potential wear and tear on plumbing.
 The amounts vary according to what type of appliance is involved, whether a tenant's electricity is included in the rent, and where the apartment is located. Ms. Hirsch said that the authorized monthly surcharge for a washing machine in New York City is $13.62 if the tenant pays for electricity separately and $14.92 if electricity is included in the rent. For regulated apartments outside New York City, the surcharges for a washing machine are $10.96 and $12.26 respectively. 
 A tenant who installs a dryer in an apartment, either inside or outside New York City, would have to pay a surcharge of $10.89 if the landlord supplies the electricity -- but there is no surcharge for a dryer if the tenant pays for electricity on his own. 
 For dishwashers, Ms. Hirsch said, the monthly surcharge, both in the city and elsewhere, is $3.77 when the tenant pays the electric bill and $5.50 when it is paid by the landlord.
 Lawyers who represent landlords say that while the surcharges will help landlords with recent significant rises in utility costs, the charge could increase landlord-tenant disputes. 
 Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who represents landlords, said that since not all tenants will be aware of the new regulation, some may at first refuse to pay the surcharge. ''Do you really think that tenants are going to pay a surcharge just because the landlord asks for it?'' Mr. Bailey said. So, he said, landlords might have to try to enforce the surcharge in court.
 Also, Mr. Bailey said, since landlords may now impose surcharges on pre-existing but unauthorized appliances, owners may want to inspect all apartments. 
 Robert Sokolski, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants, said that while tenants may at first resent the intrusion, it may work to their benefit. ''This type of surcharge may result in an incentive for a landlord to ratify a tenant's unauthorized use of a washer, dryer or dishwasher,'' he said. ''And they may make owners more likely to allow tenants who do not already have such appliances to install them.''

HEADLINE: The Quarter When Nothing Worked

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
IT'S why investors are taught to diversify: When one asset class falls, others are expected to rise, thereby safeguarding portfolios from across-the-board losses. But in the first three months of 2005, stock and bond funds lost money in lock step for the first quarter in eight years.
 For stock funds, the quarter was the worst period of performance in two years. Yet bond funds offered little portfolio protection, as they lost money for only the second quarter since the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2000. 
 ''Nothing worked,'' said Joseph P. Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America's Investment Strategies Group, noting that stock and bond investors feared rising inflation, interest rates and oil prices. 
 One niche that did have gains was natural-resources stock funds, which surged more than 13 percent in the quarter on the strength of high oil prices. But most every other type of equity fund lost value. The average general domestic stock fund fell 2.3 percent, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund research company.
 That decline could hardly be called a disaster, but it was a setback for investors after the dreamlike fourth quarter of 2004, when stock funds surged more than 10 percent. 
 No wonder that stock fund investors ''boycotted the quarter,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors. Indeed, stock funds in the first quarter had a net inflow of only about $42 billion, according to estimates by TrimTabs Investment Research, which tracks mutual fund investments.
 That is only about half the amount that flowed into stock funds in the first three months last year. In addition, more than half of the new stock fund investments in the most recent quarter were directed into foreign funds, which over the last decade have received only about one-sixth the money that domestic funds have reaped. 
 Yet even international stock funds hit a slight rough patch, losing 0.03 percent of their value, in part because rising oil prices cast some doubt on the future of the global economic recovery. Moreover, a slight strengthening of the dollar during the quarter took away some gains enjoyed by American investors in foreign stock funds.
 Funds that are focused on Latin American stocks gained 2.5 percent, on average, and those specializing in European stocks were up 2.1 percent. Those that focus on Japan, however, lost 1.6 percent on average. 
 The big blow for diversified investors was that bond funds also fared poorly during this stretch, as long-term interest rates finally began to respond to short-term rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board that started last summer. 
 The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, for instance, was 4.5 percent at the end of the quarter, up from 4.22 percent at the start of the year. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, so the average taxable fixed-income portfolio slipped 0.7 percent as prices slumped on older, lower-yielding bonds.
 A risky segment of the fixed-income universe fared among the worst: high-yield bond funds lost 1.5 percent, on average. Emerging-market bond funds fell 1.1 percent. 
 One of the few bright spots among bond funds were so-called bank loan funds, a niche category of portfolios that invest in floating-rate debt and therefore perform better in times of rising interest rates. The average bank loan fund was up 1.2 percent in the quarter.
 Mr. Quinlan predicted ''continued rough sledding'' for investors in coming months, especially because there was no consensus on a good place for them to put their money.
 THERE is also little agreement about the threat that inflation poses to the economy and the markets.
 Interest rates have clearly been heading higher, and the Fed is expected to raise short-term rates another quarter of a percentage point when it meets in May. But fears over inflation may be somewhat overblown, some money managers and market strategists argue.
 Pricing power does appear to be returning to many companies. But the core Consumer Price Index, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, has risen by a modest amount, 2.4 percent, over the last 12 months, said Zachary Karabell, senior economic analyst at Fred Alger Management in New York. 
 On the other hand, John Caldwell, chief investment strategist at the McDonald Financial Group, based in Cleveland, said that inflationary pressures were building as corporate profit growth was declining. ''One of two things is likely to happen: Either profit margins have to fall or headline inflation has to pick up,'' he said, referring to the core C.P.I. ''We think it's going to be a little of both.''
 Part of the reason that Wall Street appears so concerned about inflation may be the crisis mentality that has grown among investors.
 ''There's a feeling that we're due for another crisis,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Smith Barney. ''If you go back in time, to 1997, it was the Asian currency crisis. In '98, it was Long-Term Capital. In '99, it was the bubble. In 2000, it was the bursting of the bubble. In 2001, it was 9/11. In 2002, it was the accounting scandals. In 2003, it was the war in Iraq. And in '04, it was the surge in energy prices.''
 And today? ''Inflation and interest rates are clearly front and center,'' he said. 
 The Federal Reserve Board can be thanked for that, as its warnings about inflation during the first quarter -- in particular, after its monetary policy meeting in March -- scared the bond markets. 
 A question now is this: Will oil prices, which jumped to more than $55 a barrel in the first quarter, keep rising, further fanning inflation fears? Energy was the big winner in the first quarter, as rising oil prices and profits propelled the average natural-resources fund to double-digit gains. Funds that invest in utilities were also one of the few stock fund categories to post positive returns, advancing 2.7 percent, on average.
 In the coming months, many market watchers say, it will be even more important to be diversified, despite the disappointing results of diversification in the first quarter.
 Holding a variety of investments is important because there is little clarity about which asset classes are set to outperform. For example, Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said it was hard to know whether now was the time to choose growth stocks over value, or blue-chip stocks over shares of small companies. ''Today, it's very much of a stock-by-stock discussion.''
 For his part, Mr. Quinlan of Bank of America says he believes that investors should favor large, high-quality blue chips, especially those that pay dividends. But even that strategy offers no guarantees. 
 TO be sure, small stocks fared poorly in the first quarter; the average small-cap growth fund, for example, fell 4.5 percent. But the quarter was hardly a bonanza for large caps, as many big blue-chip names like General Motors, A.I.G., Verizon, Home Depot and Microsoft took a beating. This helps to explain why the average large-cap growth fund fell 4.3 percent.
 Dan C. Chung, president of Fred Alger Management, said that ''it's very difficult for stocks or bonds to rise dramatically in the face of slowing earnings growth, rising inflation and an interest rate cycle that's still on the way up.'' 
 But the prospects for stocks aren't hopeless. He said the economy went through a similar period in the early to mid-1990's -- yet 1995 proved to be a successful year for stocks.

 BODY:
I PULLED up in front of a red brick building with turrets. The place looked like a run-down miniaturized Elizabethan castle. I had to laugh. What an odd place for a sperm bank. 
 The mission at hand was terrifying: I'd come here to choose a partner, a father for my yet-to-be-conceived child. To do so I had to select anonymous sperm from among the bank's verified swimmers.
 Choosing in general -- or rather, making practical choices -- is not exactly my forte, which may explain why I've had plenty of boyfriends but have never been able to figure out whom I could settle down with. So at 42 I was still like a teenager, single, stupid, spinning from steady to steady. But unlike a teenager I was running out of time to find the perfect man and create the perfect family. Still, I wanted to have a baby, even if it meant doing the whole thing on my own. 
 Now at the castle I entered a dark wood-paneled hall, the floorboards creaking with my steps along the tatty red carpets, until I came to a frosted glass door with T.S.B.C. inscribed in black letters, like a detective's office in an old film noir. It stood for the Sperm Bank of California. I buzzed, heard a buzz back and walked in. 
 ''Hi, I'm Shellie,'' a young woman said. She wore flowing cotton pants, a turquoise tank top, Birkenstocks and a tight band of beads around her neck. Her long hair was light brown and frizzy.
 After greeting her I asked, ''What was this building before?''
 ''A funeral parlor,'' she said, matter-of-factly. 
 A funeral parlor? And now it was a sperm bank? She had to be kidding. This was taking the idea of full circle too far. 
 ''Everything, our comings and goings, are carefully timed here,'' Shellie said, beginning my tour. ''That's to protect the identity of the donors and the recipients. We have separate rooms, arrival times and hallways, so never the twain shall meet.''
 I looked at the closed doors along the hall and wondered who might be lurking inside and what they might be doing.
 She pointed through a doorway. ''These are our tanks, where the frozen sperm are stored.''
 The tanks were large, round silver containers, not much different from beer kegs. But instead of a spigot at the top there was a wheel, the sort used to batten down submarine hatches. It wasn't an antiseptic room. Just a room. To judge from the flocked wallpaper, it might have been a vigil room for the funerals that were once held here.
 Now that I was touring the place, I marveled that my friend Tom had actually gone to the trouble of coming here months before, entering one of these rooms and, with the aid of his imagination or maybe a magazine, producing, all on my behalf. ''A designated donor,'' Shellie called him. 
 I marveled, too, that my friend Michael had been so kind as to stop by on his way to work to pick up nitrogen-frosted thermoses with Tom's cold drowsy sperm inside and take them across the bridge to me at the doctor's office in San Francisco. 
 But after months of trying to conceive this way I gave up. Tom is a wonderful friend, an ex-boyfriend and a talented professor, and I very much liked the idea that he would be the father of my child. But apparently his sperm wasn't going to work for me. 
 SO now it was my turn to come here, to this unlikely sperm castle, seeking an anonymous donor. I just had to find him.
 Shellie explained how the system worked. ''You pay by the hour and go through the files of available donors privately,'' she said. ''You select three, and we see whose sperm is available at the time you are ovulating.'' 
 So it wasn't even a single donor I had to choose but a collection, a triumvirate.
 The initial roster was short and concise, providing only ethnicity, height, weight, hair and eye color, career and availability. I picked 10 to consider more thoroughly. Shellie then took those files and escorted me into what looked like a student dorm room, complete with a futon covered in an Indian cloth that resembled Shellie's pants. There was a table, a lamp, a desk and a chair. There were no windows, but several cheerful posters of puppies and kittens adorned the walls, a hint of new life without being so overt as to promise a new baby. 
 Shellie left me alone, and I sat down to read through the files. A door opened and shut in the hallway, and a moment later I heard a man's voice. 
 I wanted to run and look, but I knew it was against the rules. I felt I was playing ''Let's Make a Deal,'' trying to guess who or what was behind Door No. 1 and Door No. 2.
 One young prospect excited me, a tall young man of Japanese and Jewish descent. Jewish, like me, and Japanese as a nice twist. I'd had a half-Japanese boyfriend once, a medical student, and had liked him a lot. But would a mixed race child be a mistake, an even greater disadvantage for this poor imaginary kid than being raised by a single mother? My heart raced, my Pergonal-enhanced ovaries ached, and my stomach took flight. This process was so preposterous. I knew love was supposed to be blind, but come on. 
 There was anguish when I opened the next file. His family's medical history seemed as bad as mine -- cancer all over the place, as well as poor vision, headaches and allergies. Ah, this was going to be a problem, this eugenics, where there ought to be emotion. The information in these files was so abstract, so sterile, so tinged with the depressing reality of paternal grandmothers with diabetes and fathers with heart disease. 
 What about personality, love, intellect, passion? All I had to go on was the hieroglyphics of handwriting. I couldn't visualize any of them. From what I understood they were mostly kids, college students in need of tuition money, with mothers who were probably younger than I. I'd probably be better off grading their college English papers and picking a father for my child on that basis. What was I doing here? 
 UNFORTUNATELY I was looking for love, still trying to make an intuitive selection, not a rational one. I tried to fall for something on each page, some soaring words in their short essays, but there was barely the flair of a crossed T to swoon over. 
 How, I asked myself, did I end up amid these worn blue files with numbers on them? How did this become my love life? Why hadn't I stuck with that medical student I liked in grad school? How was it that in my late 20's I spent four years with Allan, and upon my departure, when he offered commitment and a child, I knew I wasn't interested? Why all those years lost on that tall, fair-haired, but dark, damaged and brooding German? And of course the artists. Don't get me started on the artists.
 It's a good thing Shellie knocked on the door. She seemed used to exactly this type of crisis. She scanned the files I was considering and began giving me hints. ''This one here is very cute,'' she said. ''He's a popular choice.'' 
 I wondered if her hints were within regulation, what the rules were.
 ''This one looks the most like you,'' she said about another. 
 He was interested in the arts, just as I am. He probably can't get a job, I mused, suddenly screening for psychological characteristics and their economic impact. ''He seems too sensitive,'' I explained, rejecting him. I was on the brink of a nervous breakdown. 
 ''What about him?'' I asked Shellie. He said he had freckly skin -- not my favorite -- but I saw gorgeous handwriting, broad interests in the sciences and arts and, best of all, a high sperm count. 
 ''Not available until April,'' Shellie told me. ''But No. 537 over here is a professor of philosophy and has good coloring. And he's good looking, at least in my opinion.'' 
 Her opinion? An awful lot was hinging on her opinion, this woman in Birkenstocks, a brand of shoe I was never once tempted to buy. But she was all I had. And more important still, she'd at least laid eyes on these men.
 ''He doesn't seem to have much in the way of artistic leanings,'' I lamented.
 Shellie nodded like a patient therapist, not bothering to mention that I was contradicting myself. She was no doubt mindful that another client needed the room.
 ''He's smart and academic,'' she said. ''He ought to naturally appreciate the finer things.'' 
 But the freckly donor's lack of availability had caught in my mind and lingered there. I sensed, in a perfect metaphor for the rest of my romantic life, that it was precisely his unavailability that appealed to me. ''I still kind of like the freckly kid with the high sperm count,'' I said, trying to relieve the tension and the paralyzing uncertainty I felt. After all, I knew it was this paralyzing uncertainty that had landed me in a sperm bank in the first place. 
 Shellie just looked at me. 
 ''O.K., I'll take the philosopher this time,'' I said, relenting. ''But I would like to reserve the unavailable freckly kid for next time. And maybe the Japanese Jewish kid as the final backup?''
 Shellie nodded and smiled.
 I had made my choice. As inelegant as this process had been, as limp and emotionally exhausted as I was, the matter was done.
 What's more, I understood that whatever the outcome, success or failure, whichever father, baby or none, by going forward I at least ensured some of what I sought in an actual baby, a commitment to life. And what more fitting place to come to such an understanding than in this funeral parlor turned sperm bank?

HEADLINE: Fresh News May Weaken The Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
WILL this be the week that tests the dollar?
 Through Friday, the dollar is up 4.8 percent this year against the euro and 5.5 percent against the Japanese yen. The Federal Reserve's broad trade-weighted dollar is up 2.1 percent. While many forecasters still say the dollar will fall again, the rebound has lasted much longer than many people expected. 
 But with new reports due this week on the United States trade deficit and foreign inflows into American stocks and bonds, there is a chance for news that could weaken the dollar.
 The report on the trade deficit, on Tuesday, is expected to show that it grew in February, to $59 billion from $58.3 billion in January, according to Bloomberg News. But the report due Friday on foreign inflows could show a sharp slowdown for February, after a near-record net inflow of $91.5 billion in January.
 Even if the trade deficit is virtually stable, a severe slowing of foreign capital could still be bad for the dollar, especially if many speculators are looking for a reason to take profits.
 A bigger-than-expected jump in the trade deficit with a decline in foreign inflows could be worse, because a growing trade deficit means that flows from abroad have to increase to cover it.

FED-SPEAK -- The minutes of the March 22 meeting of the Federal Reserve policy makers will be released on Tuesday. They will be scrutinized to learn just how worried the policy makers are about inflation.
 In their statement after the March meeting, Fed officials said, ''Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident.'' 
 That open concern about rising prices sent the yield of the Treasury's 10-year note to 4.64 percent that day, its highest since June.
 But since then, the 10-year note has rallied, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, has slipped to 4.47 percent, raising doubts over how worried the bond market is about inflation. The right mixture of hints in the Fed minutes, however, could reignite inflation concerns and send interest rates up again. But with oil prices near record levels, many investors may think that growth will slow enough to offset price pressures. By the way, a rebound in inflation worries -- which for bond investors means higher interest rates -- could help the dollar if there is bad news on the trade deficit.

OTHER DATA -- Retail sales for March will be reported on Wednesday. Forecasters expect a 0.8 percent increase, after a 0.4 percent gain in February. With an increase, retail sales would complete their first six-month stretch without a decline since 1999.
 Industrial production data for March, due on Friday, is expected to show a climb of 0.3 percent, the same as in February. The preliminary April reading of the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence, also due on Friday, is expected to show a decline, to 91.8 from 92.6 in March.

HEADLINE: Trailer Trash? Not a Scent of It

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif. 

 BODY:
AFTER making a fortune with his skateboard company, World Industries, Steve Rocco could have lived anywhere he wanted. He chose Paradise Cove, a woodsy neighborhood on a cliff overlooking the Pacific, where he bought a home for nearly half a million dollars and then spent more than $1 million replacing it with a Craftsman-style cottage.
 But Mr. Rocco's place is not exactly on millionaire's row. Paradise Cove is a mobile home park.
 ''It's probably the best spot in the Southern California coast,'' he said. 
 Trailer parks may conjure images of retirees and low-income families in most of the country, but in Malibu parks that once drew the elderly, working class and bohemian are now being transformed into the new playground for the rich. Here new owners with the means to decorate with marble floors, recessed lighting and Sub-Zero refrigerators are replacing 1970's flat-roof aluminum metal-sided trailers with mobile homes in Craftsman, Cape Cod, Tuscan or Spanish villa styles that come with two-car garages. 
 In California, the most expensive housing market in the nation, the listings say it all.
 ''Stunning, drop-dead gorgeous, bluff top, custom architectural home, built in '05,'' read one recent ad for a 2,100-square-foot home with panoramic views of the ocean and the Santa Monica mountains. 
 The residence is not the detached single-family kind; that could go for more than $10 million around these parts, real estate agents said. The location is Malibu's Point Dume Club mobile home park, and the asking price is a mere $1.69 million.
 ''The world has changed,'' said Janet Levine, the developer selling this property and beautifying two others for resale at Point Dume. ''Spaghetti is now pasta. Religion is now spiritual. It's no longer a mobile home park. It's a fab park.''
 For mobile home buyers like Mr. Rocco, 45, a former professional skateboarder who is more into surfing these days, the main draw to Paradise Cove was the beach and a cozier style of living, he said. The lots are still slivers of land where homes sit a few feet from one another under a canopy of eucalyptus trees, pine and palms, and neighbors run into one another at the children's playground or laundry room.
 Among the eclectic mix of surfers, older residents, celebrities like Minnie Driver and affluent professionals and businessmen like himself, he said, many know one another.
 ''I know my neighbors' names, and I'm not the friendliest guy in the world,'' he said.
 But just like other newcomers in recent years, Mr. Rocco, who bought a trailer for $430,000 in 2003 in an oceanfront spot, discarded the old structure to build a new one with all the accouterments he and his wife needed to make it livable: walls, countertops and beams of mahogany and maple with veneer dyed in blues, greens, oranges and yellows; shiplike nooks and crannies that hold bathrooms, bedroom lofts and a workout room; a Yosemite stone fireplace; a grand piano in the living room; upstairs and downstairs decks.
 All in all it is 2,100 square feet, on a triple-wide lot where the only evidence of the home's humble origins are the raised foundation, a requirement for mobile homes, and the original trailer hitch, where Mr. Rocco plans to plant his mailbox.
 His home now sticks out amid the more traditional mobile homes in the park, but ''it's just a nice house,'' Mr. Rocco insisted. ''I don't have gold fixtures.'' But he was somewhat self-conscious; he did not allow pictures of himself or his place.
 If Paradise Cove is a throwback to more congenial times, the more upscale neighbors now welcome newcomers with a bottle of Champagne rather than pie. That is what Will Conrad, 37, an emergency room doctor from Santa Monica, said his neighbors did when a truck brought his new manufactured home up the hill to install in his lot last summer. It was the replacement, he said, for the $450,000 1,000-square-foot ''decrepit'' 1971 rollaway he had bought in 2003 as a second home.
 Dr. Conrad said he grew up in Malibu and remembers coming to the mobile home parks as a child for classmates' birthday parties. 
 ''The homes were considered a notch below everybody else's,'' he said. 
 But in adulthood Dr. Conrad has other priorities. A recreational surfer, he wanted the waves without the crowds, and Paradise Cove, with a guard booth at the entrance, restricts nonresidents' beach access.
 ''If I went to Palos Verdes, I'd get killed,'' he said, referring to a popular surfing area south of here. ''People getting into fistfights, damaging cars.''
 Old-time residents like John Tindall, 70, a retiree who bought in Paradise Cove 18 years ago and still lives there with his wife in his 1970 model, are reacting to the influx of new affluence with amusement.
 ''No matter how much they pay, the people seem very friendly,'' he said. ''But the more they pay, the less they're here.'' 
 Mobile homes account for less than 10 percent of the overall housing stock nationwide. Bruce Savage, a spokesman for the Manufactured Housing Institute, said that buyers pay an average of about $50,000 for the mobile home and another $45,000 for the land.
 But he and others in the industry say all bets are off in resortlike communities where prices reflect high demand. Robert Kleinhenz, the deputy chief economist for the California Association of Realtors, said that in a state where median price for the traditional house is $471,000, it is not surprising it is leading the trend toward the upscale trailer park.
 David M. Carter, an agent with Pritchett-Rapf & Associates here who specializes in mobile homes, said he sold his first million-dollar one last year but ''there's plenty now in the parks that would sell for over $1 million if they came on the market.'' 
 Craig Fleming, the vice president of sales for a manufacturer of upscale mobile homes, Silvercrest Western Homes Corporation, said that beginning three years ago, mobile homes on private property have sold for $1 million or more in prime areas of San Francisco, San Diego and Orange County.
 But mobile homes come with some drawbacks. Financing is hard to come by. and when people do get it, the loan amounts are smaller and the interest rates higher, real estate agents note. This is because buyers in mobile home parks lease their land space rather than own it (lease fees here in Malibu can range from $800 to $2,500 a month), a set-up that many of them overlook because of trade-offs like no property taxes and rent-controlled lease fees.
 But there is perhaps a bigger hump to overcome, agents say: the trailer trash stereotype.
 ''You still get the stigma, especially on the telephone,'' said Mr. Carter, the real estate agent. ''When you say it's a mobile home or manufactured home, they don't even want to listen to you.''
 ''But when they come out and try to price other things in Malibu, it's an easy sale,'' he said.
 Among the skeptical was Bobi Leonard, 54, an interior designer who had a lot of movie star clients as well as businesses who said that when she realized that the address for a date six years ago was in a mobile home park she almost made a U-turn to go back home.
 ''I said, 'Oh my God, I can't date a guy who lives in a mobile home park,''' said Ms. Leonard, whose previous homes were in the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom range.
 But the man (Greg Mooers, a life coach and spiritual guide who was once a monk) and the park won. In 1999 the couple married and bought a corner space in Tahitian Terrace, a mobile home park off the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades. Since then she has spent close to $400,000 turning her home into a tropical oasis of bird of paradise palm trees, animal prints and burning candles and has helped others redesign their mobile homes too.
 ''I realized this is a treasure,'' she said, pointing at 180-degree ocean views, quiet environment and 10-mile-per-hour speed limits just minutes away from the freeway and city life. ''No gardeners. No pool men. I began to realize it was a simpler way of life.'' (Although she does have an electronic garage gate and motorized awnings that react to wind and rain.)
 Dr. Conrad's wife, Deborah Conrad, 37, a Los Angeles lawyer, admits she had to warm up to the concept of having a mobile home as the couple's second home and still is ''not nearly as enthusiastic as he is.'' She likes Paradise Cove, she said, but even there the homes are still movable and too close together, many still look boxy from the outside and the public perception still comes from bad news about them. 
 ''Most of the time, when you hear about mobile homes, you hear about a hurricane that's hit them,'' she said.
 But it is the residents who bought their trailers at bargain prices as recently as a few years ago who are having the last laugh, real estate agents noted.
 ''In the last five years prices have been doubling each year,'' said Shen Schulz, an agent with Coldwell Banker here who last year moved his wife and 6-year-old twin sons to a mobile home at Point Dume Club.
 Now the new buyers who are transforming ugly ducklings into swans say they may never sell. Dr. Conrad, who drives a 2004 Jaguar but has rented a Ford pickup truck for his jaunts to his mobile home, said he hoped his wife becomes comfortable enough to some day retire there. 
 And Mr. Rocco and his wife are expecting their first child, whom they plan to raise in Paradise Cove. 
 ''I'm going to raise my kid in a trailer park,'' he deadpanned.

HEADLINE: Monaco Adjusts to a Bachelor Prince Without Heirs

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: MONACO, April 8 

 BODY:
While the television here plays vintage clips of the late Prince Rainier's storybook marriage to the American actress Grace Kelly, the unspoken question hanging in this tiny principality's crisp Mediterranean air is who the next princess will be.
 Prince Rainier's enigmatic son, Albert, who assumed Monaco's throne upon his father's death on Wednesday, is unmarried and has shown no public inclination to produce a royal heir. Choosing a bride to replace his mother, who died in a car crash 23 years ago, is an almost insurmountable task, people in the principality say.
 ''People will be very happy when Albert gets married,'' said Jean des Cars, a historian of the royal family, ''but everyone will compare his choice to Princess Grace.''
 Prince Albert's uncertain marriage plans, an echo of succession questions in Britain and many of the world's other modern monarchies, are just one of the ways in which his ascension to the throne is making people uneasy. His father was a fighter who stood up to President Charles de Gaulle of France and the Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis in defense of his tiny principality's independence. 
 That uneasiness is partly the skepticism faced by all newcomers to power. But it is also a mark of an age when accountants and consultants wield as much influence as royalty did when places like Monaco were taking shape. Prince Rainier transformed his less-than-square-mile realm on the French Riviera from a seedy marina and gambling den into Monaco Inc., a booming tax haven for the world's nouveau riche. Management is the order of the day now.
 Prince Albert, widely described as stuttering and shy, is not expected to rule with the firmness of his father, who reportedly decided everything from the color of parking attendants' uniforms to the make of motorcycle used by the police.
 ''What may change is the manner of governing,'' said Frederic Laurent, a Monaco native and the author of ''The Prince on His Rock.'' ''Prince Rainier was an autocrat, but Albert is more of a democrat,'' he said.
 The Grimaldis grew into their jewel and medal-bedecked costumes from less fancy garb: they began, basically, as pirates operating out of an impregnable Mediterranean fortress that forms part of the palace today. France took control of the rocky seaside swath of land after the French Revolution, and when Napoleon III restored it to the Grimaldis' control more than 60 years later, he stripped it of 85 percent of its land.
 Charles III, Monaco's reigning monarch at the time, won four million francs in gold as compensation for the lost territory and used it to build a casino on a vacant hillside overlooking the port opposite the palace. He named the hill Monte Carlo, after himself, and the casino, a belle epoque bauble with its companion, Hotel de Paris, drew the idle and the rich from all along the French and Italian Rivieras, where gambling was illegal. It quickly became the place to be.
 By the Roaring 20's, when Prince Rainier was a child, the name ''Monte Carlo'' was shorthand for glamour and sin. But the global financial collapse at the end of that decade hurt Monaco more than places with greater economic depth; World War II did not help, and by the time Prince Rainier took the throne the principality was a shadow of its earlier self.
 Under the prince, though, tax shelters became the new draw and money began flowing again into the principality -- so much so that by the early 1960's, de Gaulle wanted the principality to close the tax loopholes that were draining capital from France. Prince Rainier finally settled on a compromise under which French citizens alone were prohibited from benefiting from Monaco's tax laws. 
 Except for the unlucky French, there is no income tax, no capital gains tax and no inheritance tax, which explains the large number of wealthy, elderly women spending their golden years here.
 And it explains why thousands of apartments in the principality are empty, sham residences for people. Automatic timers turn on the lights at night to keep the electricity bills high enough for the owners to argue that they are home the requisite six months of the year to benefit from the principality's tax laws.
 Among Prince Albert's greatest challenges will be to defend this tax system, which is under increasing pressure from abroad. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development lists Monaco on a dwindling list of tax haven countries labeled ''noncooperative'' in exchanging information. Evading taxes somewhere else, as anyone in Monaco will tell you, is not a crime here.
 Already the principality has had to tighten loose banking regulations, which a decade ago allowed ''businessmen'' arriving by boat to deposit suitcases of cash in the principality's banks. ''There were deficiencies that were dealt with by the Monaco authorities,'' said Alain Damais, executive secretary of the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, an international organization that investigates money-laundering and terrorist financing.
 The fabled golden age, meanwhile, has long since given way to mass tourism. Monte Carlo's Edwardian casino is no longer a tuxedo-and-pearls affair, and the visitors these days are as often tourists in sneakers looking up at the gilt ceiling as gamblers looking down at the green baize. Across the harbor, retired couples in pressed linen pants with sweaters tied around their shoulders peer into gift shops along the immaculate cobblestone lanes of Monaco-Ville, the Disney-fied old town surrounding the royal palace.
 The casino, which brought in almost all of the government revenue when Prince Rainier took the throne, now accounts for only a small percent of that. The principality's economy is dominated by banks, corporate conventions and cruise ships -- as well as tourism tied to international sporting events like the Monte Carlo Formula One Grand Prix. There is even a small industrial zone with factories turning out pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and perfume.
 Luxury hotels and high-rise apartment towers climb barren hillsides honeycombed with subterranean garages filled with Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Ferraris. Prince Rainier increased the size of the principality by nearly a quarter with reclaimed land on the western end of the coastal strip; another major project envisions filling in the sea at the eastern end for yet more land.
 The fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, Ringo Starr and Gustav Hansen, one of the world's most renowned professional poker players, call the princely patch their home. The small harbor is dominated by a 344-foot-long Saudi-owned yacht, Lady Moura, that has a helicopter on board.
 There are policemen almost always within sight, and where they are not, surveillance cameras on street corners and in building lobbies and parking garages and underground passageways keep watch. Loyalty to the royal family is fierce, and while plenty of people in Monaco are willing to gossip, few want to be quoted saying anything but the most positive of statements.
 But no one would have paid much more attention to the principality than to Europe's other tiny tax haven states like Liechtenstein or Andorra were it not for the prince's famously wayward children: the Bad Girl, the Good Widow and the Nice Boy on a Bobsled, as the writer Peter Kurth once described them. (Prince Albert has been a member of Monaco's bobsled team in five Olympics.)
 Stephanie, 40 and the youngest, is the archetypal aristocratic wild child, a would-be rock star and fashion model with a penchant for love affairs with the most unsuitable of men. She once ran off with an elephant trainer and has been romantically linked to a royal gardener and her father's butler. In 2003, she married a Portuguese circus acrobat, though it is not clear if the marriage is still intact.
 She has had three children, two by her former bodyguard, Daniel Ducruet, whom she later married, in 1995. But they divorced a year later after he was photographed with the reigning Miss Bare Breasts of Belgium in his arms. The princess has never identified the father of her third child.
 Princess Caroline, 48 and the eldest, became first lady of Monaco after her mother's death but has had only slightly better luck with spouses. In 1978, she married the French playboy Philippe Junot; the marriage ended predictably two years later. She married the heir to an Italian oil fortune, Stefano Casiraghi, in 1983 and had two children by him. He died in a speedboat accident off France 15 years ago.
 The princess had a third child by her third husband, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, a German, who is now gravely ill.
 In recent years, Caroline has been widely regarded as the real power behind the throne. Some people in the principality say privately that they would like to see her as sovereign in her retiring brother's place, but others worry about the influence of her boorish husband, who has on occasion punched journalists and urinated in public.
 Prince Albert, meanwhile, has been linked to a long list of high-profile women known for appearing on the arms of middle-aged bachelors. There have been no signs of anything like a romance.
 ''Knowing Rainier, I am convinced he was sorry not to see his son marry a young Catholic princess and have children,'' said Claude de Kemoularia, a former chief of staff in the palace and a longtime friend of the prince. ''He was always reluctant to give the power to his son too early because he was waiting for his son to marry and have a male heir.''
 So reticent has Albert remained about marriage throughout the years of public speculation and private pressures that his father sought changes to the Constitution three years ago to allow the crown to pass to one of the princesses or their children if Albert abdicated or died without a child.
 But for now Albert is the ruler of this little land where the Alps run into the sea.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about succession rights to Monaco's throne after the death of Prince Rainier referred incorrectly to Princess Caroline's family. She has three children, not two, from her marriage to Stefano Casiraghi, and one by her current husband, Prince Ernst August of Hanover.

HEADLINE: Tenants Sound Off; Landlord Files Suit

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: Parsippany, N.J. 

 BODY:
TENANTS who rate their landlords online don't expect to wind up as defendants.
 But the owners of one apartment complex here reached the boiling point when tenants -- or perhaps people posing as tenants -- compared them to Nazis and rated the apartments ''horrible disgusting filthy.''
 Now the owners of Troy Hills Village are suing the anonymous reviewers -- identified in court papers as John Doe and Jane Doe -- claiming that the negative comments are hurting business. 
 The purpose of the suit was to force the removal of ''fraudulent and scurrilous'' comments, according to papers filed in state court. Carl J. Soranno, a lawyer for the partnership that owns the complex, said he believed the nasty comments had been posted by competitors ''trying to gain an unfair economic advantage'' over Troy Hills Village, rather than by tenants. 
 Some tenants are inclined to agree. ''From what I saw on the site, the apartment complex is definitely getting a bum rap,'' said Ken Kaplan, a commercial real estate broker who has lived in Troy Hills Village for 10 years.
 But since the comments are posted anonymously, the owners are first trying to force the Web site to identify the authors. Mr. Soranno said he is in the process of retaining Texas counsel to serve a subpoena on the Web site, apartmentratings.com, which is based in Austin. 
 Jeremy Bencken, who owns and runs the site with his wife, Katie, said that he would follow ''industry standard process'' in response to a subpoena. He said he would send e-mail messages to the anonymous users, who could decide whether to remove their postings or defend themselves in court. 
 Mr. Bencken said that this isn't the first time he has been subpoenaed -- it has happened in three other cases brought by landlords -- but that, so far, he has not been named as a defendant. The 1996 Communications Decency Act, he said, protects him from liability for comments posted by third parties. Eugene Volokh, a professor of constitutional law at U.C.L.A. School of Law, said that courts have ''overwhelmingly'' supported Mr. Bencken's view. 
 To discourage lawsuits, Mr. Bencken posts the Communications Decency Act on a section of the site reserved for landlords. 
 The Benckens had the idea for the site while they were living in an apartment complex in Silicon Valley in the 1990's. One day, Mr. Bencken recalls, a woman stopped them in the parking lot. She was thinking of moving in, and she had a lot of questions.
 ''We were both working for software companies at the time,'' Mr. Bencken said, ''and we thought the Internet would be a better place for information than a parking lot.'' There are now some 235,000 reviews on the site.
 ''Our goal,'' Mr. Bencken said, ''is to help consumers make better decisions.'' The site accepts advertising, but not from apartment owners. ''That would be a conflict of interest,'' he said. Advertisers include moving companies, roommate services and sellers of renters' insurance.
 The site, based in the couple's house, is ''profitable, but not extravagantly so,'' he said. Earlier this year, Mr. Bencken added a new feature to the site: rent data for more than 100,000 apartments. Mr. Bencken said he has been accumulating the financial data for years -- visitors to the site are asked the size of their units, how much they pay each month and how much of a deposit the landlord requested. Making the data available, he said, gives prospective renters an opportunity to compare the rent they're being asked to pay with that of current tenants.
 Tenants aren't the only beneficiaries. ''If I were a landlord, I would really be looking closely at what competing properties are charging,'' Mr. Bencken said. 
 The information, he said, should also be useful to investors who are looking for details on the rental income produced by various properties. There is no way to confirm the rent data, but Mr. Bencken said he couldn't think of any reason that tenants would lie in providing the information on rents. 
 While the rent data has been collected for years, the apartment ratings generally appear on the site within minutes. 
 Some companies like the publicity they get from the site. The building manager at Augusta Apartments in Oklahoma City, Tara Tomiska, said, ''It helps us out tremendously, because we have awesome ratings.'' Her complex is recommended by 71 percent of those who posted. 
 By contrast, Troy Hills gets a 28 percent approval rating. There are 83 ratings as of last Wednesday, some with titles like ''nasty management'' and ''very rude.'' 
 But during an unscientific sampling of Troy Hills residents, six out of seven said it was a good or great place to live, and the seventh said, ''It isn't bad.'' Mr. Kaplan, the long-time tenant, said: ''If I had problem, I would have left years ago. Nothing is perfect, but they honestly do a pretty good job here.''
 Nancy and James Curry, who have lived in the complex for six years, were eager to show a reporter their apartment. They had high praise for management -- which lets them plant their own vegetables and organizes events like an annual Halloween decoration contest. ''How many landlords do that?'' Mr. Curry asked.
 Apartmentratings.com deletes postings that are known to violate its rules -- for example, by infringing a copyright or trademark. 
 Posters are also told not to ''impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.'' That could be relevant in the Troy Hills case, but Mr. Bencken said that he has no way to verify that someone who posts a comment lives in the complex, any more than Amazon.com can verify that someone who posted a review read the book. The online community, he said, is by nature self-regulating. Managers, he said, have opportunities to post responsive comments on the site. 
 He said that the site occasionally receives requests to remove postings but has not received any requests from Troy Hills Village. 
 According to Mr. Soranno, that is because his client is not looking to suppress legitimate opinion. ''The goal is not to chill free speech, or restrict it in any way,'' he said. ''All my client wants is make sure the people who are posting comments are tenants or former tenants.''
 He said, ''It's unfair that people who don't live there can post opinions, and it is costing my client thousands of dollars to find out who they are.''

HEADLINE: Our Ratings, Ourselves

BYLINE: By Jon Gertner. 
Jon Gertner, a contributing writer for the magazine, wrote about Hollywood and the impact of DVD's last fall.

 BODY:

The Mismeasure of TV
One of the great contradictions of modern American life is that almost everyone watches television while almost no one agrees anymore about what it really means to watch television. True, we know that as spring gets under way, new episodes of ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''C.S.I.'' and ''American Idol'' will battle for prime-time supremacy in the overnight Nielsen ratings. We also know that local broadcast stations around the country will begin scheming -- just as they do every April -- to win the May sweeps, the tense weeks when rival stations pursue a fierce one-upmanship of flamboyance and hype and the Nielsen-measured audience sizes determine future advertising rates. But when it comes to figuring out how many of us are watching these shows, and whether we're paying attention while we're watching and even whether we're actually noticing the advertisements among the shows we may or may not be watching -- well, this is where things get tricky.
 For the past decade or so, watching television in America has been defined by the families recruited by Nielsen Media Research who have agreed to have an electronic meter attached to their televisions or to record in a diary what shows they watch. This setup may not last much longer. Just as programmers and advertisers are clamoring for a better understanding of the television audience, a wave of new consumer products has made it increasingly difficult to satisfy them. One day this January I sat in a Greenwich Village workroom with Bob Luff, the chief technology officer at Nielsen, as he pulled out gadget after gadget to show me what he's up against. Luff seemed to view the modern American home as a digital zoo where the lion is about to lie down with the lamb: radio is going on the Web, TV is going on cellphones, the Web is going on TV and everything, it seems, is moving to video-on-demand (V.O.D.) and (quite possibly) the iPod and the PlayStation Portable. ''Television and media,'' Luff said over the noise of five sets tuned to five different channels, ''will change more in the next 3 or 5 years than it's changed in the past 50.''
 It is Luff's job to think this way, of course -- to observe Americans' embrace of new technologies and respond with new ways for Nielsen to measure that. It is also the job of a Maryland company called Arbitron, which has counted radio listeners -- and, at various times, television viewers -- since the late 1940's. For the past few months, Arbitron has been taking a distinctly unorthodox approach to measuring audiences. Currently the company is recruiting a couple of thousand volunteers in Houston and asking these randomly chosen men, women and children to wear a black plastic box that looks like a pager, three inches by two inches by one-half inch, whose circuitry is roughly as complex as that of a cellphone. In the radio and television industry, this little box is known as the portable people meter, or the P.P.M. In both a business and a cultural sense, it also seems to be the equivalent of a large explosive.
 The Houston volunteers will clip the P.P.M.to their belts, or to any other article of clothing, and wear it all their waking hours. Before going to bed, the volunteers will be expected to dock the P.P.M. in a cradle so that overnight it can automatically send its data to a computer center in Maryland, where statisticians can download and review the information. There are still kinks to work out, but ideally the P.P.M. will tell Arbitron exactly what kind -- and exactly how much -- television and radio programming a person was exposed to during the day. Eventually the P.P.M. may also tell the technicians at Arbitron a host of other things too, like whether a P.P.M.-wearer heard any Web streaming, or supermarket Muzak, or any electronic media with audible sound that someone might encounter on a typical day.
 It may not be immediately obvious why this little gadget should matter much to anyone beyond East and West Coast media elites. But one indisputable fact about media measurement is that if you change how you count, funny things happen. Or maybe not so funny. Nielsen's introduction of new electronic television meters in the New York area last winter, for instance, prompted a torrent of criticism from Fox Television, which saw the local ratings (and potential revenue) of several of its programs suddenly plummet. But this may prove a modest dust-up compared with what comes next, if devices like the P.P.M. or data from millions of set-top digital cable boxes reveal that what Americans are seeing and hearing do not correspond to what the big measurement companies have long been claiming.
 Finding out whether ''C.S.I.'' beats ''Desperate Housewives'' is just the beginning. Change the way you count, for instance, and you can change where the advertising dollars go, which in turn determines what shows are made and what shows then are renewed. Change the way you count, and potentially you change the comparative value of entire genres (news versus sports, dramas versus comedies) as well as entire demographic segments (young versus old, men versus women, Hispanic versus black). Change the way you count, and you might revalue the worth of sitcom stars, news anchors and -- when a single ratings point can mean millions of dollars -- the revenue of local affiliates and networks alike. Counting differently can even alter the economics of entire industries, should advertisers (thanks to the P.P.M.) discover that radio or the Web is a better way to get people to know their brand or buy their products or even vote for their political candidates. Change the way you measure America's culture consumption, in other words, and you change America's culture business. And maybe even the culture itself.

The Code for All Media
Among the bedrock beliefs of the measurement business is the notion that a ''passive'' measurement device is more accurate than an ''active'' one. This is another way of saying that the more that volunteers have to do to actively chronicle their program choices, like pushing a button or writing something down, the less exact the information about the audience will be. For years, Arbitron's radio ratings and Nielsen's television ratings have depended on selectively recruited Americans who usually get between $2 and $15 to fill out weekly paper diaries in hundreds of local media markets around the country. The diaries are a highly active form of measurement, subject both to frequent errors of recollection (you tend to forget that you stopped on the Weather Channel for four minutes while flipping to another program) and to the human tendency to champion personal or habitual favorites (you might write down ''The Daily Show'' even if you were out of town that night). A diary can measure only what a person says he watched or heard. It can never reliably measure what everyone actually watched or heard.
 The distinction matters. It's why, in the late 1980's, Nielsen first began to switch to a new electronic meter, the People Meter, which automatically notes what channel a television set is tuned to and can also register who watches, as long as each viewer presses a log-in button. This gave Nielsen (and, in turn, television programmers and advertisers) a wealth of new information. Thanks to the company's recruitment techniques, which included interviews and surveys of every prospective household, Nielsen could match the shows each viewer watched to his or her age, income and ethnicity.
 In those days, Nielsen's only competitor in the television ratings business was Arbitron, which had already carved out a lucrative niche measuring radio audiences but was struggling to compete with Nielsen in local TV markets. In fact, by the early 1990's, Arbitron, which also built electronic meters to monitor television sets, was worried that the business was becoming prohibitively expensive. So in early 1992, Arbitron's top executives called in their chief engineer, Ron Kolessar, and asked him to come up with an answer to this problem. Could Kolessar find a less expensive way to measure television and radio audiences at the same time? Also, could he make the measurements better too?
 Kolessar gathered his staff in an office in the summer of 1992 to toss around ideas and to periodically scribble the good ones down on a white board. In the beginning, of course, the engineers in the room were simply trying to satisfy their bosses -- to find a cheaper and more efficient way to evaluate Americans' TV and radio habits. The engineers figured they might, if they were lucky, come up with a way to make Arbitron competitive with Nielsen again. But their thinking soon changed. As they worked on their project, Kolessar and his team could see that they were trying to understand, and perhaps to shape, the future of media and advertising in America. When Kolessar finally made a presentation to Arbitron's executives, he suggested that the company go even further in the direction of passive metering than Nielsen's People Meter. No button-pushing, in other words. Until then, companies had been trying to collect data about American television viewers by monitoring the set. ''We need to monitor the person,'' Kolessar declared. Not long after, Arbitron pulled out of the television ratings business altogether.
 One bitter, cold morning in January, Kolessar met me at the Arbitron offices, a four-story glass-paneled building in an undistinguished office park in Columbia, Md., not far from Baltimore Washington International Airport. Kolessar's lab is a small suite of rooms overflowing with computer parts and sound meters; he explained to me that it had taken him far longer and more money than he expected -- 13 years and $80 million and counting -- to actually transform the idea for the P.P.M. into a physical thing. In part that's because the technology behind the P.P.M. has proved formidably difficult. In the course of his brainstorming in the early 1990's, Kolessar and his colleagues came to the conclusion that the best way to capture an individual's media exposure was to bury a unique, repeating, inaudible digital code in the audio tracks of every radio or television channel in the country; the P.P.M. would recognize that code.
 So Kolessar began to work on psychoacoustic masking, which places a sinal just beneath the frequency of whatever is being transmitted. As Kolessar and his team worked through years of frustration, they discovered that the masked code's frequency could not be too low (where it would run into technical problems) or too high (where it would bother dogs and cats). Nor could it even modestly compromise the audio quality of a show or a song. ''We used 'Achy Breaky Heart' for a while for our tests, but then I just couldn't take it anymore,'' Kolessar said. So he switched to ''Don't Give Up,'' the Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush duet from Gabriel's album ''So.'' The song is an intricate work of sonic architecture (of some 26 separate tracks, according to Kolessar), which made it a challenge for the engineers. Kolessar led me into Arbitron's sound studio to listen to what his team came up with after a decade. He cranked a recording of the Gabriel song through a pair of $20,000 speakers and switched back and forth between coded and uncoded versions. ''You can't tell the difference,'' he said, more as a statement than a question. I agreed.
 Arbitron has begun to ask radio and television stations around the country to run their broadcasts through a patented Arbitron encoding device; at the moment, almost all of the radio and television stations that a listener can tune into in the Houston metro area -- including over-the-air, cable and satellite TV (though not satellite radio) -- are coded for the P.P.M. trial. The stations are not being paid for this; instead, Arbitron has convinced them, through literal door-to-door salesmanship, that encoded broadcasts will enable Arbitron to measure their audiences better and thereby ultimately boost their advertising sales. 
 To Steve Morris, the C.E.O. of Arbitron, encoding is as much a matter of logic as economics. In Morris's view, code is now the only plausible way to follow a piece of content to see if -- and how -- it reaches an individual. ''Media is following you not just when you consciously turn on your satellite radio in your car, or when you consciously flip open your cellphone and get some cable channel delivered to it,'' Morris told me. ''It's also coming at you when you walk through Grand Central station. It's on the floor and on the walls. It's coming at you at the malls, where the L.E.D. screens are all around you along with the piped-in music. Advertising is becoming incredibly ubiquitous, so you need measurement that is equally ubiquitous.'' Can everything with sound be coded, I asked? ''Yes,'' Morris said. Will everything with sound be coded? ''Yes,'' he said.
 In all likelihood, the Houston trial will show that people are exposed to far more media and advertising than they think, or remember. Some P.P.M. tests in Philadelphia have already indicated that wearers tune into twice as many radio stations on a typical day as they ever note in their diaries. For better or worse, the P.P.M. changes the definition of ''media consumer.'' On the downside, there is of course the question of whether people are actually listening to the stations or watching the television channels registered by their P.P.M.'s; Arbitron's P.P.M. will never be able to measure how intently a viewer concentrated on a televised Gap ad (but neither does Nielsen's People Meter). On the upside, the P.P.M. could reasonably establish that a person left the room during a commercial break, because the coded signal is interrupted when the device is out of earshot.
 More significant, the P.P.M. expands the boundaries of media consumption. That's because it passively registers media both inside and outside of the home -- what P.P.M. volunteers are exposed to in bars, airports, health clubs and hotel rooms. This is something that has never been done, according to David Poltrack, the head of research at CBS. ''Ten percent of viewing is now out of the home,'' Poltrack said. ''And for teenagers and young adults it's often as high as 20 percent.'' For a financial news station like CNBC, which probably has a large bloc of unmeasured viewers watching at work during the day, the P.P.M. could produce a significant boost. ''Nielsen does not measure offices,'' Alan Wurtzel, the head of research at NBC Universal, told me. ''Nor do they measure vacation homes. They don't measure hotels. They don't measure hospitals.''
 And Arbitron plans for the P.P.M. to do more than establish new standards of measuring television and radio audiences. In Houston, for instance, the P.P.M. will register advertisements that run in theaters before movies; if Arbitron can persuade the entertainment industry to go along, the P.P.M. could also detect the use of everything from DVD's to video games to MP3 music files. (Arbitron has a special P.P.M. attachment to track headphone radio and iPods, though iTunes music and podcasts are not yet encoded.) In addition, Kolessar told me, his bosses recently asked him to experiment with adding Global Positioning System capability to the P.P.M. so that the company could determine when a person drives by a particular billboard or walks by a particular superstore on a given day. And he has been tinkering with radio frequency identification (RFID) so that a P.P.M. could track a reader's interaction with magazines and newspapers. A tiny chip embedded in a page like this one, perhaps the size of a pencil dot, would tell a P.P.M. that a reader picked up or opened the Times magazine. It might even register, with other P.P.M.'s, whether a majority of readers continued to the end of this article or stopped right here. ''We've got all sorts of things we're playing with in preparation for a world that is probably a couple years away,'' Kolessar said. ''But it's going to happen. And it's going to happen because the advertisers are pushing this. It's them. They want to know more.''

The Counting Business
One of the most striking aspects of the P.P.M. has nothing to do with the technology: it's the fact that Arbitron and Nielsen are doing business together. If the P.P.M. proves to be good at quantifying the radio and television audiences in Houston this summer, Nielsen and Arbitron together could introduce the P.P.M. into various local markets across the country. In the view of the two former archrivals, Arbitron brings the P.P.M.'s patented technology to the table, and Nielsen brings its knowledge of the television industry and its expertise in recruitment. A few years ago, Steve Morris, Arbitron's C.E.O., toyed with the idea of using the P.P.M. to challenge Nielsen, but he ultimately decided against it. ''We looked at this and saw that there's a long history of people taking runs at the incumbent,'' Morris told me. ''But there's no halfway here. If we were to go after Nielsen, it would be war, and at the end of the day there would be one person standing. And believe me, there are skeletons littering the trail.''
 How the P.P.M. fits into Nielsen's present television ratings system, or how it could change the way Nielsen conducts its business, is a hot topic of speculation in the industry. Over the past decade, Nielsen has maintained its monopoly even as the company itself has changed hands -- evolving from the homespun creation of Arthur C. Nielsen and his son, Arthur Jr., to a hugely profitable business that brings in revenues of close to $700 million a year for its parent company, the Dutch media conglomerate VNU. Nielsen clients -- networks and independent stations, and also a number of advertising agencies and advertisers -- pay the company substantial amounts for a steady stream of viewer data. NBC Universal and Viacom, for instance, probably each pay Nielsen around $50 million a year. In return for a long-term contract, Nielsen will customize viewer data to suit the needs of any client. What a media-buying agency, for example, wants to know about a particular program's audience may differ from what a station executive wants to know; the information national networks need isn't the same as what local stations need (to attract hometown advertising, for example).
 In fact, while Nielsen ratings have a knack for anointing the winners and losers in our pop culture -- from Ruben and Clay on ''American Idol'' all the way back to Johnny Carson and Lucille Ball -- Nielsen's role as the arbiter of our cultural democracy happens to be a sideshow. The function of the company is to put a value on time itself, in terms of the commercials that use it. Nielsen's ratings are the single standard, the so-called currency, that allows its clients to characterize a program's audience (its size, age, sex and economic status) and then set a price. Some $60 billion worth of television advertising looks to Nielsen for guidance each year. The company's ratings are really just another way for people in the TV business to talk about money.
 According to Nielsen, on a typical weeknight, somewhere between 103 million and 108 million Americans watch prime-time television. The average American household now sees 8 hours 1 minute of TV every day and has access to more than a hundred channels and several different sets -- often tuned to different channels in different rooms. Industry types call this phenomenon audience fragmentation. The days of a family gathering together on the couch are dying out for good. We're in pieces. Or as Steve Morris, the Arbitron C.E.O., put it more gently, ''People are dividing.'' Every age group, every cultural group and every demographic group, Morris added, is in the process of getting media packaged expressly for its members. 
 In the next few years, this ''personalization'' will become only more and more pronounced. The television industry is in the process of updating its means of distribution by converting to digital signals, a changeover that presents new opportunities for networks to create multiple new lineups and channels (for example ABC, ABC HD, ABC Family) to serve all the new fragments. Within a few years, you should be able to, if you can't already, satisfy any impulse, passion or modest enthusiasm through your television. Meanwhile, that typical Nielsen family that now has a hundred channels to choose from may soon have many hundreds more.
 Whatever this transition means for TV viewers, it has different implications for advertisers. In recent months, in fact, a host of executives from big corporations, most notably Jim Stengel of Procter & Gamble, have begun publicly demanding that measurement companies like Nielsen and Arbitron provide better information about audiences. These advertisers don't mind talking to smaller groups of Americans. In fact, companies like fragments. The more specific an audience, the more confident they can be of reaching out to and persuading its constituents. Specifying like this makes it easier to justify advertising expenditures. ''What we're looking for is not just ratings but the receptivity to the message,'' Beth Uyenco, the U.S. director of strategic research at OMD, one of the big media-buying agencies, said. To Uyenco, HGTV is an ideal place for home products, for instance, just as ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' on Bravo offers a good place for grooming products. ''Fragmentation can be a challenge,'' Uyenco added, ''but if you have a very niche brand, it can be a blessing.''
 Yet to receive that blessing, an advertiser has to understand any fragment of television viewers -- understand it, that is, in all its mind-numbing, granular detail. Much like a poll that measures the popularity of presidential candidates, Nielsen currently uses representative samples of Americans (all ages, incomes, races, regions) to stand in for the enormous audience that watches television each night; it is almost certainly among the most sophisticated companies in the world at figuring out whom to contact for a reliable sample and getting those people to participate. For the moment, many Nielsen families in these samples use the company's set-top People Meter, which registers viewership regardless of whether a family has cable, satellite or rabbit ears on their television sets.
 Nielsen has endured plenty of criticism during the past year over whether it works hard enough to include minorities among its People Meter families -- charges that are almost certainly unfair. The more legitimate concern is whether Nielsen's samples can measure a country, and a medium, that has become so fragmented. Nielsen's nightly group of national viewers is about 8,000 households; in about a year that will expand to about 10,000 households. In the local New York market, Nielsen's nightly viewers number about 800 households. Getting an accurate reading from these Nielsen families on a dominant program like the Super Bowl or the Academy Awards isn't so hard. It's those programs or channels where a slice, or a sliver, of Americans are tuning in. In other words, how do you draw meaningful conclusions if only a few Nielsen households watched Court TV or the Food Network or Telemundo late one night? What percentage were single African-American women older than 49? What percentage were young white men? What percentage were Hispanic teenage girls? The marketers -- the people who want to make sure they're reaching the right fragment with the right ad -- would love to know. But it's been getting hard to say. And as the number of channels grows, and the number of sets in every home increases, and the number of devices that can carry television signals multiplies, it's going to get even harder.

Where the Data Go
Late last year, the Nielsen company moved into a dazzling corporate campus 20 minutes northwest of Tampa in Oldsmar, Fla., a place that seems less like a town than a hasty arrangement of strip malls, office parks and juvenile palm trees set between the Tampa Bay Downs racetrack at one end of town and a dense patch of swampland on the other. The Nielsen Media Research Global Technology and Information Center, as it's called, is an impressive pile of glass next to the swamp. Nielsen spent $123 million in Oldsmar on three interconnected buildings, which is far less interesting than the way they constructed them: with redundant electrical circuitry, high security barriers and warning bells on top of warning bells. The point was to create a fortress so that no computer virus or sparking wire would compromise its ratings system. Ditto for any possible competitor. ''This particular part of the campus is capable of withstanding winds of over 150 miles per hour,'' Alan Donnelly, who runs day-to-day operations in the main data building, told me in February as we walked through the computer room. ''It's built to sustain a Category 5 hurricane.'' There were also fuel tanks and backup generators on the ground floor, Donnelly pointed out, that could power things for several days just in case. Donnelly took me through a security door and into the main control center.
 It is a strange, and somewhat disorienting experience, to observe the Nielsen process at work -- to watch the people who watch America watching television. Nielsen still measures a large number of regional markets with written diaries. But the data from the 8,000-home national People Meter panel are tabulated in the Oldsmar control center, where a half-dozen employees face a 22-foot-wide screen that can tune in to any channel in the country at any time. The process is similar to what will happen soon with the P.P.M. in Houston, except the scale (and the implications) will be exponentially larger. At night, while Nielsen families around the country sleep, the data from the People Meters on their televisions are sent here automatically, over telephone lines, beginning at about 3 a.m. The technicians in Oldsmar collect the details about the shows the Nielsen families watched. They check it; they slice and dice it -- by demographics and geography and any criteria their clients would like. By late morning, they publish their list of the top shows for television executives in New York and L.A.
 Fragmentation isn't Nielsen's only headache in all this. As its recent battles with Fox in New York show, putting new technology into old markets stirs up an industry that abhors any kind of volatility. ''We're being simultaneously told to speed up the change to electronic measurement, and to slow down,'' Susan Whiting, Nielsen's C.E.O., told me. There's certainly some truth to this. And yet in the course of my interviewing nearly a dozen advertising and television executives, almost all of them faulted Nielsen for languor rather than aggression. Virtually every network and cable company I spoke with voiced frustration with Nielsen's tardiness in measuring ''time-shifting'' -- which happens when viewers rely on video-on-demand or TiVo-like devices (also known as digital video recorders, or DVR's) to ''shift'' the times at which they watch their chosen programs. If a Nielsen family watches ''Dateline'' from its DVR three days after its broadcast, in other words, those viewers aren't counted, and NBC gets no credit. Which may seem like a minor thing, except 6.5 million Americans already have these devices, according to Forrester Research, and 17 million might have them by the end of next year. Nielsen has announced that it intends to track time-shifting starting next January, supplementing the People Meter with the Active/Passive Meter, which uses sound encoding much like what Arbitron uses for the P.P.M. (Each company has patented its own version.) Next year, prime-time shows will receive three national scores: ''Dateline,'' say, would get a rating for viewers who watch it during its normal time slot, a second rating that includes viewers who see it later the same evening and a third rating of total viewers over the course of a week.
 Nielsen is no slouch when it comes to technology. Its problem seems to come from implementing that technology in timely fashion. One advertising-side media executive, asking that I not name the firm because it frequently negotiates with Nielsen, put it this way: ''They're very good at stifling innovation and managing the environment. They slow the pace of change down. And they're very good at making sure that their monopoly will continue.'' In this regard, some players in the television industry fear that Nielsen has agreed to support the P.P.M. only because it allows the company to slow down or squelch its acceptance. Susan Whiting told me that the issues are wholly technical, and that she won't be able to know whether Nielsen can proceed with a joint venture with Arbitron until the P.P.M.'s Houston test shows results that Nielsen feels comfortable with. 
 In the meantime, Nielsen continues to pursue other alternatives. One morning in Oldsmar, Bob Luff, the company's chief technology officer, led me through a tour of a different possible future for measurement, one with voice-recognition and face-recognition meters that the company is testing along with other devices. Luff then took me into his engineering department, a matrix of cubicles where a small army of Nielsen technicians take apart the newest televisions on the market, so that the company understands the circuitry well enough to attach a People Meter in the event that a prospective Nielsen family has a new model in its house. The Nielsen offices in Florida actually have storerooms full of brand new TV's and DVR's and video-game consoles for no other purpose than research and deconstruction. Luff and I paused by a desk where one of his engineers had pulled the bowels out of a huge new flat-screen television. ''He'll reverse-engineer this,'' Luff explained to me, ''and he'll figure out where we can connect. He might also take close-up digital photographs for the field technician to use on his laptop.'' Nielsen, Luff added, has blueprints and plans of some 10,000 televisions on file.
 You have to wonder if this is a losing battle -- whether keeping up with the technology curve has perhaps left Nielsen with little time or inclination to get ahead of it. There is, moreover, an aroma of sweaty exertion to the Nielsen process. And that comes not just from the ripping apart of new televisions. The company also puts prodigious efforts, and tens of millions of dollars a year, into maintaining its representative sample of Americans. Hundreds of field reps knock on hundreds of doors every month to invite them into the Nielsen sample. Then those same reps monitor the volunteer households, which entails maintaining intimate, day-to-day oversight, often for several years, to ensure each Nielsen family complies with its rules and pushes the correct buttons on the People Meters. 
 Whether this can continue depends, in large part, on economics. The more America fragments, the bigger the sample you need to represent the country. And the bigger the sample you need to represent America, the harder and more expensive it is to maintain in a door-to-door, labor-intensive manner like this. ''I wouldn't predict that Nielsen is going out of business,'' said Richard Fielding, the head of research at Starcom Media Worldwide, one of the big media buying agencies. ''But they are at a crossroads. And it's almost as if their business model is evaporating overnight.''

You Are What Your Cable Box Says You Are
At some moments, trying to discern the business of companies like Nielsen and Arbitron gives way to the question of whether America is becoming weightless, an agglomeration of data about who we are and how we behave that seems to have more substance (and certainly more financial value) than our actual selves. It was hard to avoid this thought early one evening last winter as I drove over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay toward Bradenton, about 60 miles south of Nielsen's Global Technology Center, on my way to ErinMedia. Several years ago, a few computer geeks and new-economy types started this company in pursuit of something no measurement company has yet pulled off: tapping into cable set-top data to get a complete picture -- not a sample -- of what viewers in a particular city or region are tuned in to at any second of any day.
 Though known to media planners and many broadcast and cable executives, ErinMedia does not seek attention; in a business sense, it's pretty much off the grid. When I turned into its nearly vacant parking lot, fronting a mostly empty office building set amid empty fields and dark stretches of forest along Route 301, the company seemed to exist not only on the edge of Bradenton, but on the very edge of reality. ErinMedia has no People Meters, no P.P.M.'s, no gadgets, no embedded codes. A few dozen employees, a couple of computer servers and a number of patents pending in Washington, that's all. The business is less a conventional company than a pure expression of mathematics.
 Digital cable set-top boxes are already connected to sets in the homes of 25 million Americans (a number expected to nearly double by 2010). When you get your television signal through one, you receive programs, or ''downstream'' data, from your cable company. But the cable companies can also get a transmission back from you; they can find out what you watch. And they can also find out when you watch it. Federal privacy laws and various technological challenges (especially with older, analog set-top boxes) have made the cable companies reluctant to use that information so far. But some third parties have tried to come in and calculate, through some very complicated software applications, whether viewer information can be tabulated while still protecting privacy. ''We figured out how to get the data and how to figure it out demographically without knowing who you are,'' Frank Foster, the president of ErinMedia, said as we sat down in a conference room in the company's office building. Foster maintained that his company can offer its clients -- cable operators, television stations and media buyers -- a detailed breakdown of a regional television audience at any given time. If a city's digital cable company allows ErinMedia access to its data, in other words, ErinMedia could deconstruct the audience for any show, Foster said. He could tell a producer that 44,312 sets were tuned to the first 4 minutes 7 seconds of the local news. Or that 11,812 cable households surfed channels during the commercial break in the N.C.A.A. semifinals. He could track the viewers as they tuned in and out and precisely where they came from and where they turned to. A few weeks after 9/11, ErinMedia tested some data from Comcast to see what its television audience did that day and in the weeks afterward, compared with viewing patterns in the weeks before. The company charted precisely how many households tuned in and when. It found out what caught viewers' eyes. 
 Foster was sitting across the table from Frank Maggio, the company chairman. When Maggio chimed in, he pointed out that a second-by-second census of actual viewers might even do more than what Foster described. It could tell the producer of a local news show that the audience preferred the sportscaster on a competing channel -- and ErinMedia could prove it by showing how many viewers switched channels at the relevant time. Perhaps most important, ErinMedia could use set-top data to register small numbers. The chief of a future microchannel, in other words, could tell advertisers exactly who is in its tiny but enthusiastic audience. If only 300 households tuned in out of 300,000, they would still be counted. And if an advertiser suddenly wanted to show an ad for Wolf stoves or Volkswagen Passats specifically tailored to those 300 homes (and be assured, that day is coming soon), it would be able to. ErinMedia, both men said, could give a programmer or cable company a detailed picture of an audience within 24 hours.
 Maggio, a young entrepreneur, says he firmly believes that Nielsen is the relic of a simpler time, an era of three networks and a less diverse America. He ascribes no bad intentions to the company. But he relishes the potential for an outfit like ErinMedia to destroy it. ''I believe I could go into Nielsen and quadruple their profits,'' he told me. ''It's so much more efficient to use our technology.'' Then Maggio said he was willing to keep his company going as long as necessary with millions of dollars from his real-estate projects. ''We can pick up where Nielsen leaves off, but we can do more than that,'' he said -- the implication being that ErinMedia could not only give cable operators, stations and advertisers detailed insights into their audience, but even, under the right circumstances, also help establish a new ratings currency in place of Nielsen's old one. To many people in the industry, this would seem preposterous. But Maggio had a counter: ''I'm kind of brash,'' he said. After a short pause, he shrugged. ''Actually, I'm a maverick.''
 To be sure, Nielsen has already seen the light on set-top data, even as it publicly defends the aging technology of its People Meters and the methodology of its samples. In fact, both Nielsen and Nielsen's biggest global competitor, a European company called TNS, have been in discussions for some time with various U.S. cable operators about using set-top information. It may eventually come down to what the cable operators decide is in their best interests. They're the ones with the data -- our data -- which is tantamount to saying that they're the ones sitting over the diamond mine. ''It's a fairly simple process to take set-top boxes and capture anonymous viewing information,'' Steve Burke, the chief operating officer of Comcast, the country's largest cable system, told me. ''But it's not what we do. If you're a cable company, you don't get up in the morning and think: how can I create a competitor to Nielsen? You get up and think: we'd like to get V.O.D.-rated and grow our business and wonder when Nielsen is going to hurry up and get off the dime.'' Nevertheless, Burke admitted, it wouldn't take much at this point for those on the cable side to force a drastic change. ''The obvious consortium would be you get some cable companies, a satellite company and a couple big advertisers together to start a Nielsen competitor,'' Burke mused. I asked him if they were near to doing that yet. He let out a frustrated laugh. ''We're getting closer,'' he replied.
 Whether a cable consortium ends up choosing a partner like ErinMedia, or whether cable companies get together and then choose an established partner like Nielsen, probably matters less than the net effect of changing the way viewers get counted. When the music industry's charts switched from surveys to actual sales data in 1991, they shook up longstanding assumptions (country and rap were more popular than realized, for example). And to be sure, a change like that can't happen overnight: any new way of counting, put suddenly into effect, would wreak havoc on TV-industry finances by elevating the value of air time on some shows and deflating others, thus forcing stations and networks to offer advertisers ''make good'' ads when audience sizes don't meet their expectations. (When Nielsen introduced People Meters in the New York region, for instance, the size of the audience for ''The Simpsons,'' on Fox, turned out to be 30 percent smaller, while Comedy Central's audience increased by 225 percent.) Frank Maggio at ErinMedia makes a persuasive case that the set-top data is bound to come into play sooner or later, even if it turns things upside down in the process. ''What America is paying for advertising now,'' Maggio said, ''is based upon people who are going to come into your house and take apart your TV.''
 As Maggio see it, ratings have to come as close to the full truth as technology allows, and the fact that Nielsen uses samples to represent him is, he said, ''infuriating.'' Of course, such fury happens to suit his company's best interests; Maggio clearly seemed to understand that in making his point, he had located Nielsen's sore spot. ''It's the American way,'' he said, comparing the use of set-top data with Nielsen's methods. ''We only accept elections that represent all our votes. Why is this different? We don't have to do it Nielsen's way anymore. And we really shouldn't do it that way anymore.''

All About the Advertising
In the view of television executives like David Poltrack, the head of research at CBS, there is no one-size-fits-all way to get true ratings. The P.P.M., for instance, is portable enough to capture any television that can be heard in an increasingly portable world -- but it still relies on a representative sample of Americans to wear it. And while set-top data can give nearly complete insights into what a vast number of household televisions are tuned to, it cannot capture media outside the home or even data from households that lack set-top boxes, and it cannot yet register whether it's the grandmother or the young mom (or both) in front of the television. ''I believe that the P.P.M. is a part of the measurement system of the future,'' Poltrack told me one day in his office at CBS, ''but it isn't necessarily the entire measurement system of the future. I can envision a system where you've got one database of hundreds of thousands or even millions of homes with set-top boxes feeding information into a measurement system. You also have these people carrying P.P.M.'s, feeding information into that measurement system. And you may have a traditional Nielsen household sample feeding information, too.'' As Poltrack sees it, the end result would be a ratings system that comes razor close to reflecting what the country now actually watches. It would also, in effect, be a mass cultural election, every day and night.
 I discovered that Poltrack's vision seems to be a fairly popular one in the industry, regardless of which side you're on -- advertising, programming or measurement. ''I go to bed at night feeling very good,'' said David Verklin, the C.E.O. of Carat Americas, one of the biggest media-buying agencies. ''I feel the world is coming our way. The world of digital television, the P.P.M., the set-top boxes will give us the data we want.'' 
 The worlds that executives like Poltrack and Verklin ultimately want, however, are quite divergent. Both desire better ratings. But Verklin wants them for more than just television. His clients, the companies that pay for ads, want to know everything about how we use every medium. They don't think of television as the future. Programs are the future. Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania who's probably the reigning academic expert on media fragmentation, takes a similar view. ''Television has to be thought of not as a box anymore but as a social role, and I think that advertisers have begun to see it that way,'' he explained. Turow said he now sees little difference between television and the Internet. Nor do his students at Penn. They watch ''The O.C.'' wherever and whenever -- on their laptops, at home on TiVo and by swapping the show (perhaps illegally) through a Web-based file-sharing program called BitTorrent. The coming generation is accustomed to the idea of watching or listening to anything on any device that's nearby, Turow said. In the meantime, his generation (he's in his 50's) ''still thinks of media in these compartmentalized ways.''
 The P.P.M., of course, ignores those compartments. The endless tinkering at Arbitron is creating something to measure any piece of media, whatever form it takes. That's what Carat's Verklin wants. But that's not all he wants. People in Verklin's camp don't necessarily spend their days worrying about who is watching what. They worry about who is watching their clients' commercials, especially now that fast-forwarding or clicking past them is so easy. So for Verklin, the evolution in measurement can't stop with improved ratings. The next step, and the more lofty ambition, is to measure advertising's impact.
 There is a dream within the counting industry that has been around for decades, called single-source measurement, but it has never been successfully realized. Recently, thanks to the P.P.M., this goal has been resurrected under the name Project Apollo, which is a joint effort between Arbitron and VNU (Nielsen's parent company). ''Apollo is basically something that's been the holy grail of measurement since people were drawing woolly mammoths on the side of caves,'' David Verklin said. It's a closed-loop system that will measure the media people absorb -- and then what they buy.
 To this end, Apollo will track 70,000 people across the country who wear the P.P.M. all day. But not for the sake of ratings. The advertisements and messages these 70,000 people see, hear, read, encounter will be matched to the purchases they make. You could say it's a massive scientific trial of cause (marketing) and effect (buying). Or you could say with some trepidation that it's about creating a more perfect, more efficient consumer society. Linda Dupree, who is in charge of Apollo at Arbitron, put it to me this way: ''For those who have worked in advertising a long time, we think advertising works, we just don't know how.'' Apollo (the name came from someone in the project enamored of the history of early NASA launchings) should settle that.
 At the moment, representatives of Arbitron and VNU are making presentations around the country to encourage big companies to sign up for the service, which should be available sometime next year. The price is high (up to $1 million per company), and many businesses are reluctant to invest in an untested product. So Arbitron and VNU are trying to stress the practical appeal: Apollo should allow companies to understand which advertisements get consumers to buy their products, but could also offer insights into the connection between their tactical approach to advertising and the urge to buy. Moreover, Apollo could give advertisers a clearer understanding of whether radio, TV or even the Web (the Internet usage of those 70,000 people will be monitored) gives them the best rate of return on their ad dollars. For instance, if Apollo demonstrates that advertisements for lemonade have a higher success rate on radio than television -- that is, the radio advertisements seem more successful at getting Apollo volunteers to buy the lemonade -- it would help companies figure out how to reallocate their marketing dollars.
 So far, only Procter & Gamble has made a public commitment. But many people in the measurement industry told me they regard the ultimate success of Apollo, or some variation of Apollo, as inevitable. ''What we're talking about with using the P.P.M. for ratings is a significant change, along a fairly predictable continuum, going back 10 or 20 years,'' Steve Morris, Arbitron's C.E.O., told me. ''You want to talk about something that's discontinuous? Apollo is discontinuous. That will change the way people think about how we buy. Not right away. It will take time. But I believe that it will.''
 Since Morris's company would benefit from the success of Apollo, with the P.P.M. as an essential element in the project, he has good reason to talk up its potential. Still, Morris, a soft-spoken and studious man, is hardly the sweet-talking salesman, and I found his logic airtight. ''Discontinuous, disruptive things do come along,'' Morris said, ''and you don't have a choice whether you follow them or not. They're driven by need. I think if you talk to advertisers, Apollo is exactly what they want. And the advertiser is the top of our food chain. So if that's something they want, and the technology will allow us to produce it, then you have to assume that's going to be a big part of the future.''
 What Morris couldn't say -- indeed, what all of the advertisers, measurers and programmers couldn't say -- is what this means for the other parts of the food chain. Marketers often make the point that the consumer is king; one consultant for Procter & Gamble told me that that company's chairman, A.G. Lafley, never hesitates to say that the consumer, and only the consumer, is in charge. Apollo and all the other measurement services might give credence to that contention: corporations that are serious about selling products to a fragmented nation barraged by media messages will come to us for a deeper kind of understanding and approval. You could, however, see Apollo, along with the P.P.M. and encoded signals and set-top data, as a stealthy realignment in the marketplace. 
 What we did in the evenings, what we bought, what we desired -- wasn't that always a riddle to be guessed at by advertisers and programmers? The window-shopper, the TV watcher, the radio listener, the Web surfer -- we were all so unpredictable, so capricious and terribly human. We were king because we were somehow mysterious. Who will wear the crown now?

HEADLINE: The Artist's Tale

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
A RAINBOW has settled over regional museums and art centers. It may just be a byproduct of the economic storm they have weathered the last couple years, or it may be a sign that positive changes are afoot. I think it is the latter.
 One good development is a new camaraderie among regional institutions. In New Jersey, for instance, the Princeton University Art Museum recently lent artworks to the Montclair Art Museum's Edward Weston exhibition, while, more ambitiously, the plucky Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts in Long Branch and the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan, Conn., are collaborating on ''Characters,'' on view at both sites until later this month. 
 Regional museums can achieve much by working together. Collaboration cuts costs, permits loans of expensive equipment (like video projectors) and increases access to collections. And it helps open these institutions to different kinds of audiences.
 ''Characters,'' organized by Helianthe Bourdeaux-Maurin, an independent curator, explores the role of storytelling in contemporary art. Narrative has been the backbone of visual art since Paleolithic artists scrawled roaming bison, horses and deer pursued by matchstick figures on the walls of the Lascaux caves. But in the 20th century, this style retreated to the periphery, replaced by more formal, abstract, minimal and conceptual art forms. It was really only with Pop that narrative-based art returned to museum walls. (It was, of course, always popular in the art market.)
 ''Characters'' endeavors to flesh out this thesis, mustering examples of the work of about two dozen well-known and emerging artists from the United States, Asia and Europe. The show offers only a snapshot of its theme, but the curator has nonetheless found works worthy of attention for their individual aesthetic merits and for their ability to illustrate the wider point.
 The show is divided between the sites, with each artist represented by a few works in both places (except for Cindy Sherman, who is showing only at Silvermine after some crucial loans fell through). This creates a sense of two complementary if occasionally overlapping exhibitions; the videos, for example, are the same in both spaces. 
 But you will not have seen the complete exhibition unless you visit both sites.
 The essence of a good story is character, and both shows abound with imagery of real and imaginary characters. Various artists fuse their life experience with characters from history and mythology to create fantasy characters, while others engage popular stereotypes. Still others play with archetypes, or mine fairy tales, comic or children's books, film characters and cartoons.
 There is a preponderance of diligent, colorful and often funny graphic work. Many of the artists also resort to a naive, childlike drawing style to beguile the viewer. This at times results in superficial work that is too cute, say, in Yoshitomo Nara's pastel lithographs of bratty guitar-playing girls, or everything by Takashi Murakami.
 But all is not so wholesome. There is a sado-erotic streak to quite a bit of the imagery, like Kyung Jeon's kinky fusion of characters from old Korean children's books and the Kama Sutra, or Chitra Ganesh's dynamic drawings of figures with multiple heads, arms and orifices.
 Jeremy Bronson's short animated video ''Timekeepers'' (2005), a fantasy narrative, is an exhibition highlight. For this piece, he used hand-crafted and painted sets and models (made with wire, foam, latex and found objects) to create a narrative-based stop-motion animation picture show. 
 James Bewley is one of the artists who take their own lives as a starting point. His gouaches depict a character in a bat suit whose bumbling adventures are based loosely on his life. He places his antihero in ridiculous situations, like trying to chat up women, smoking a cigar or riding a motorcycle to church.
 Then there are the video artists, like Shannon Plumb and Julian Stark, who not only use their lives for inspiration, but also perform in their works. To some extent, the sculptor Nina Levy also does this. A merry prankster, Ms. Levy is showing life-size versions of her naked torso at each site. At Silvermine, the work is ''Spectator,'' representing the viewer, I guess, busy puzzling out the rest of the exhibition.
 ''Characters: Scene I'' is at Shore Institute of the Contemporary Arts, 20 Third Avenue, Long Branch, through April 26. Information: www.sica.org or (732)263-1121. ''Characters: Scene II'' is at Silvermine Guild Arts Center, 1037 Silvermine Road, New Canaan, Conn., through April 21. Information: www.silvermineart.org or (203)966-9700.

HEADLINE: College Admissions: It's Not What You Know, It's 'Who Knows How?'

BYLINE: By FRAN SCHUMER

 BODY:
A WEEK ago Thursday, Dana Lazarus, a senior at Livingston High School, knew that the odds of her having a good night's sleep were slim. Friday, April 1, was the day that she, like thousands of high school seniors throughout New Jersey, would find out whether she had been admitted to some of the top colleges to which she had applied. 
 Given that so many students from New Jersey apply out of town -- ''Our biggest export is students,'' one college adviser said -- and given the national feeding frenzy that college admissions has become, the odds of Dana's getting a good night sleep were even slimmer than the odds of her getting into Harvard where, in fact, she had applied.
 Dana's story had a happy ending. At 5:30 p.m. the next day, she made so much noise that her younger sister thought she had seen an animal in the backyard. 
 ''I was so shocked,'' she said after opening her e-mail messages. ''I'd been deferred by Yale. I hadn't expected to get into Harvard.''
 Not every college admissions story has an equally happy ending.
 College advisers throughout New Jersey usually know at least one case in which an applicant gets rejected or wait-listed by every school. One student was so devastated she couldn't attend school the next day.
 But even that story has a happy ending -- sort of. Six weeks after a concerted effort by the school and the family, she was admitted to two of the schools, accepted one and is now thriving.
 Win or lose, almost everyone who undergoes the process uses similar terms to describe it -- ''It's disgusting,'' said a parent whose son had just gotten rejected from Princeton -- and yet, for all the fear and loathing the process inspires, everyone buys into it.
 When a representative from Harvard told an audience at Ridgewood High School they would be surprised to discover where their most successful neighbors did -- or did not -- attend college, the audience wasn't happy. It wasn't the message they wanted to hear.
 ''We're a sticker society,'' said Peggy Loonam, the director of guidance at Ridgewood. ''We go by the label. And yet, we all know that some of the most successful people either didn't complete their degrees or went to no-name universities.'' 
 For the record, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard, and half the current United States senators attended no-name colleges like Chico or Colorado State.
 The madness is a result of factors I couldn't even begin to delineate -- status, anxiety, an industry that cries out for regulation. But the bottom line are the numbers: too many youngsters as talented as yours -- ''There are a lot of 1590's out there,'' one college adviser lamented -- and too many from New Jersey.
 Of the 4,003 students who applied early action to Georgetown this year, for example, the largest number, 469, were New Jersey students.
 At the same time, colleges have ratcheted up their desire to admit students not only from different racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds, but from different geographic backgrounds -- Sri Lanka instead of Holmdel.
 ''You mean I have to move to Salt Lake City to get my child into college?'' I asked the director of admissions at a New York area private school.
 ''You'd have to move farther out than that,'' he said. 
 A psychologist from Montclair said: ''I'll tell you two things I couldn't do if I were a young person today: I couldn't buy a house and I couldn't get into college.''
 Before he came to New Jersey, Robert S. MacLellan, the director of college counseling at Pingry, worked at a private school in the Midwest. ''There was the same level of expectations, but the approach was different,'' he said. ''The word I want to use is trust. People had a belief in the system. The student did a good job, let's see what comes of it. Here, the environment is: 'What more can we do? Why didn't they take him? What happened?'''
 Parents are looking for the thing that went wrong, and yet often there isn't any. Wisconsin took too many students one year and the next, ran out of housing, an admissions officer told a parent whose daughter was deferred yet accepted at Michigan, historically the more competitive school.
 ''There are times you feel really angry,'' said the counselor at the New York area private school. ''You know the students better than the colleges do. When a student isn't recognized by the process, you feel bad for the student.
 ''It's not Panglossian -- it's not the best of all possible worlds -- but the bottom line is, it doesn't screw up anyone's life. A kid you know who is great might not go to his first choice, but to his third or fourth. That kid is going to be great. It's still the U.S. of A. Nothing is going to hold a kid like that back.''
 A student may not suffer because of where he or she goes to school, but what that student had to do to get there. 
 A friend, a professor with a teenager going through the process, writes: ''What especially hits home is how the process corrupts everything. I don't know if students who are grounded but also reasonably ambitious can even distinguish what they really want to do from what's good for the process. And then I read about Arthur Miller's upbringing, or William Wordsworth's deciding that he didn't want to read for Honors. It'll be amazing if anyone coming from the upper middle class ever does anything worthwhile because of their conforming to the process.''

HEADLINE: Rem Koolhaas Learns Not to Overthink It

BYLINE: By Nicolai Ouroussoff

DATELINE: OPORTO, Portugal 

 BODY:
FEW people would question the quality of Rem Koolhaas's mind: he has long been celebrated as one of architecture's most audacious thinkers. But his recently completed Casa da Musica here is something new for him -- a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty. 
 Set at the dividing line between the city's historic quarter and a working-class neighborhood, the building houses a 1,300-seat performance hall, rehearsal space and recording studios for the Oporto National Orchestra. Its smoothly chiseled concrete form, pierced by the rigid rectangular box of the main hall, is the most overtly seductive form Mr. Koolhaas has created yet. 
 The project's sculptural qualities will inevitably draw comparisons to Frank Gehry's exuberant design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Both were commissioned as part of a broader effort to revive industrial port cities that have long been in decline; both are dazzling displays of virtuosity. 
 But if Mr. Gehry's masterwork evokes the eruption of an unbridled id, Mr. Koolhaas's creation is a more self-contained experience -- one that vibrates with emotional and psychological tensions. Its surprises reveal themselves slowly, as if to draw you into a deeper unconscious experience. In originality alone, it ranks with Mr. Gehry's 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and Hans Scharoun's 1960's-era Berlin Philharmonic as one of the most important concert halls built in the last 100 years.
 Strangely, the project started with a search for that most prosaic of human needs: closet space. Mr. Koolhaas says the design originated in a commission for a house he was designing in suburban Rotterdam several years ago. The client, whom he describes as ''a typical Dutch Calvinist,'' was obsessed with order and demanded a pure uncluttered living area. The architect responded by creating a faceted concrete block with a void drilled out of its core. The void was intended as the family area, with the surrounding spaces absorbing the messiness of everyday life. 
 But the client dropped the project just as Mr. Koolhaas was entering a design competition for the concert hall. Rather than abandon his design, he blew it up in scale and adapted it: the core became the main performance hall, with the foyers, rehearsal halls and offices packed into the leftover space around it. The extreme shift in scale transformed an expression of a single client's obsessions into a more dynamic communal experience. Even so, the central themes remain the same: a rationally ordered environment animated by the chaotic social and psychic forces whirling around it. 
 Mr. Koolhaas begins by emphasizing the building's isolation. The structure is set atop a carpet of soft pink travertine, like a cut jewel displayed on a luxurious piece of fabric. At various points, the travertine curves up to cover the structures scattered around the plaza -- a bus stop, a cafe, the entrances to an underground garage -- as if these practical elements were literally being swept under a rug.
 Seen from a late-19th-century park across the street, the building has an almost formal elegance. Yet as you circle around it, its canted walls distort your sense of perspective, making it hard to get a sense of its dimensions. From other angles, its faceted form juts out unevenly, so that the entire structure seems oddly off balance. 
 As always, Mr. Koolhaas is inspired by a range of influences here, from Oporto's rich Modernist tradition to the generic shopping malls that have taken over the globe since the 1970's. The exterior's restrained elegance nods to local architects like Alvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto de Moura, whose abstract compositions also tend to reveal themselves gradually as you move through them. But the concrete shell is also a mask -- a near-blank container that conceals a richer imaginative experience inside. 
 As soon as you slip through the entrance, a narrower staircase leads to the lobby, which is punctuated by a window overlooking a row of town houses. A videotaped panorama of the city flickers across a wall behind the coat-check area. A second stairway sweeps up several stories before disappearing behind the form of the main hall, hinting at unexpected pleasures. Heavy concrete beams crisscross the space above, heightening the sense of compression. 
 The layering of images, coupled with the sense that you are constantly slipping around the building's edges, imbues the space with a subtle erotic charge, as if the purity of the architectural spaces were being infected by unconscious images, a swirl of fragmented memories and repressed desires.
 The main hall seems hyperrational by comparison. Since conventional wisdom holds that acoustically, the world's best concert halls -- Symphony Hall in Boston, say -- are built in the shape of a shoebox, Mr. Koolhaas gives us a shoebox. Similarly, the seats are arranged with the precision of an assembly line, in simple repetitive rows. 
 The relentless sense of order snaps us to attention, until we slowly begin to notice the outside world gently seeping in once again. The walls are clad in raw plywood decorated with a pattern of gold wood grain enlarged to several times its natural size, once again distorting the sense of scale. Oddly shaped windows cut into the walls afford glimpses of silhouetted figures flickering by in various bars and V.I.P. rooms. A replica of a Baroque organ decorated in ornate gold-and-blue swirls is mounted on a wall near the stage, like something that was picked up on a whim at a luxurious flea market.
 Most breathtakingly, the walls at either end of the hall are made of enormous sheets of corrugated glass suggesting the folds of a curtain. The curved glass gives a distorted view of the city outside, so that the entire room feels as if it is floating dreamily in the middle of the city.
 But they also hint at Mr. Koolhaas's love of the forbidden corners and social frictions that animate all cities. As you ascend the various foyer levels, you pass through a series of rooms that could well have been culled from the surrounding cityscape. A V.I.P. room, for example, is clad in the elaborate blue-and-white tiles characteristic of the bourgeoisie's traditional courtyards. Higher up, a more informal gathering area is topped by a canted glass roof that slides back to reveal a spectacular view of the city and the distant Atlantic Ocean. A trapezoidal terrace is carved into a corner of the structure's roof. 
 Set in the odd leftover spaces between the form of the main hall and the exterior shell, these rooms evoke pieces of the city that have broken off and embedded themselves in the building's skin. Like the characters and objects swept up by the tornado in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' they bring to mind the psychological and emotional residue spinning around in your head, the scattered fragments of memory that shade experience.
 Such fragments reflect Mr. Koolhaas's rebellion against the aesthetic purity that was once a central part of the Modernist agenda, and the perfectly engineered life it implied. Like many architects of his generation, he views such purity as a form of repression. For decades, he has sought to explore what the Modernists sought to ignore -- the messy social, psychological and economic realities outside the walls of the rationalist modern boxes.
 In the Oporto concert hall, the architect has found a perfect expression for his vision. And the result suggests he has reached the full height of his powers.
 It could not come at a better time. Like many great talents, Mr. Koolhaas has had mixed luck transforming his ideas into reality. Over the years, his most beautiful work has often been for small private commissions. And although he now seems to be breaking out of this trap, most noticeably with the recent completion of the dazzling Seattle Public Library, even his recent career is strewn with evocative designs that are likely to end up only on museum walls. 
 His only significant project in Manhattan, for example, remains the $40 million shop he designed for Prada in SoHo, an overwrought space that had the misfortune of opening a few months after the attack on the World Trade Center. By comparison, a stunning design for a major addition that would have given the Whitney Museum of American Art -- and the city -- a much-needed creative jolt was rejected two years ago on the ground that it would have been too expensive to build.
 To get a grasp on what they are missing, New Yorkers will now have to board a plane to Oporto.

HEADLINE: Maybe We're Not Robbing The Cradle

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
SOCIAL Security spending is growing fast. The cost of Medicare is out of control. Companies across the country are buckling under the weight of providing pensions and medical care to a growing pool of retirees. Cities are slashing public works budgets to deal with ballooning pension costs. 
 As more and more of the nation's resources are diverted toward those over 65, policy analysts are worried about the country's ability to bear the weight of a mushrooming elderly population. In short, are old people going to hog the resources, leaving children today with nothing but a few crumbs? 
 Certainly, the elderly are sopping up a lot of the money. According to Ken Dychtwald, a marketing and strategy consultant on aging, federal spending on people over 65 is seven times the amount spent on kids under 18. It grows more lopsided by the year. Spending on children's programs like Head Start is mostly discretionary, subject every year to the collective whim of Congress.
 Federal spending on the old, on the other hand, is mandatory and booming. The nation's spending on health -- mostly directed to the old -- will rise to $3.4 trillion in 2013 from $1.8 trillion last year. Public money will pick up a third of the tab. Spending on Medicare will balloon in 2050 to about 7 percent of the nation's total output from 2.6 percent last year, and that doesn't even include the new prescription drug benefit. And if no cuts are made, spending on Social Security is projected to grow to 6.25 percent of gross domestic product in 2050, up from 4.25 percent today. 
 ''It's a zero-sum game about who gets what,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who is a co-author of ''The Coming Generational Storm,'' which portrays a rather bleak future for today's children. ''Ever bigger amounts are being taken from the young and given to the old. The old are doing what the bumper stickers in Florida say: 'I'm spending my kids inheritance.''' 
 It's not like the young couldn't use the money: 17.6 percent of children under 18 live in poverty, compared with 12.5 percent of the total population. Poverty among people over 65 is only 10.2 percent. Yet it's the elderly who received the Medicare prescription drug bill, which will cost nearly $600 billion between 2004 and 2013, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Meanwhile, the young received No Child Left Behind -- a bill festooned with good intentions about improving educational standards, but little money.
 ''The old have extraordinary mechanisms and tools to get their needs met, unchecked and unrivaled by any other group,'' Mr. Dychtwald said. By comparison, the young are nonvoting political weaklings. ''When seniors go into the political arena,'' he noted, ''it's no contest.''
 But some economists are sanguine about the country's ability to support the elderly and at the same time provide for the young. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that the decline in fertility rates since the 1960's means that the burden of caring for the young has decreased dramatically -- freeing resources to channel to the old. 
 The overall burden on the employed will grow, but not to unprecedented levels. The ratio of people of working age to those either under 20 or over 65 will decrease to 1.2 in 2050 from about 1.5 today. But this is still an easier load than in 1965, when the country was awash with children, and the ratio of the working-age population to each dependent was only 1.1. 
 True, the young are cheaper to maintain than the old. In 1990, economists at Harvard and M.I.T., including David M. Cutler and Lawrence H. Summers of Harvard, estimated that people over 64 consume 76 percent more than children. 
 Still, Mr. Burtless estimated that in 2050 a worker will have to sacrifice 49.6 percent of his or her wages -- through taxes or other means -- to maintain society's dependents. That is nearly 6 percentage points more than in 2000, but it is merely 0.8 percentage points more than 1965. And the percentage could well be smaller if people work later in life to pay for more of their keep. 
 The notion of incredible competition between what the public spends on the aged and what it spends on the young is driven by fear, Mr. Burtless said. ''But so far the fears have not been grounded,'' he said. ''In fact, we seem to be able to do both kinds of things. Increase spending on aged and protect spending on the young.'' 
 Indeed, total spending on education -- the biggest item of public spending on the young -- rose to 7.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2001, up from 6.1 percent in 1965. Mr. Burtless pointed out that for the last 100 or so years, real spending per student has been increasing, regardless of whether the population is booming or shrinking.
 Mr. Cutler, the Harvard economist, argued that the aging of the population would probably require people to work a little longer in life and perhaps get a bit less in Social Security benefits. But, he said, there is no reason to be alarmed over the country's ability to finance everybody's needs as the population ages, even if the medical bill is growing at two to three times the rate of inflation -- much faster than spending on education. 
 And, some scholars argue, older people are not selfish; they will not vote for politicians or programs that starve succeeding generations.
 ''The elderly are also grandparents,'' noted Eric A. Hanushek, an economist at the Hoover Institution. Moreover, he added, they will support spending on the young because they also see that a functioning economy is needed to support Medicare and Social Security.
 Yet others are not so sure. As the political clout of the old grows in tandem with their numbers, they might block anything that diverts money toward younger generations or otherwise cuts into their financing stream. 
 ''Having more older people will make it tougher to do things like increase the retirement age or cut waste out of health spending,'' Mr. Cutler noted. ''And older people will not spend on services used by kids.''

HEADLINE: Those Hot Real Estate Funds Cool Off

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
AFTER years of stellar performances, real estate funds are finding it difficult to stage another encore in 2005. The funds ended the first quarter down by an average of 6.6 percent and ranked near the bottom of all mutual fund categories, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund research company.
 It was a striking turnaround for a group that has consistently eclipsed most equities in recent years and whose fortunes have been tied to the strength of the housing and commercial markets. Real estate funds returned roughly 32 percent in 2004 and have had a 19.3 percent annualized gain over the five years through March. By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 10.8 percent last year and lost 3.2 percent, annualized, over the five-year stretch. 
 Fund managers and analysts were neither surprised nor entirely disappointed that the sector's long advance had come to a screeching halt. 
 ''It's not unusual to have some kind of pullback after an extraordinary run,'' said Martin Cohen, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Cohen & Steers, which specializes in real estate investments like the Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, a fund that has about $2 billion in assets, down 7 percent for the first quarter. ''They couldn't have gone on like this,'' he said. 
 But he and others were quick to dismiss speculation that the shifting performance might be an ominous sign for real estate over all, even though some economists have expressed concerns about the run-up in housing prices. 
 ''There's a lot of talk about a bubble; it doesn't feel like a bubble to me, in a sense like the tech bubble was in 2000,'' said Daniel McNeela, a senior analyst who follows the real estate industry for Morningstar. 
 Mr. McNeela characterized the decline in real estate funds as ''a cooling-off period, a correction.''
 Donald L. Cassidy, a senior analyst at Lipper, another mutual fund research firm, said that many investors waited until the first quarter to lock in profits, especially as the stock market became volatile. ''When a market decides to take a correction,'' he said, ''people tend to sell the things that have done relatively well.'' 
 Yet Mr. Cassidy, too, cautioned that some housing markets were showing signs of overheating and could become vulnerable to an economic downturn, especially as interest rates continue to rise. Higher rates could also hurt the stocks of publicly traded home builders. 
 ''I think we're in a slight bubble'' with some high-end single-family homes, particularly in Florida, California and the Northeast, he said. ''But that's not the stuff that REIT's buy,'' he added, referring to real estate investment trusts, which make up the bulk of many funds' holdings.
 Most real estate funds, in fact, owe their success to the strength of REIT's, publicly traded companies with portfolios of real estate -- from shopping centers to hotels to apartment buildings -- that pay out most of their income in dividends. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts composite index soared 30.4 percent in 2004, and was up 20.1 percent, annualized, over the five years ended March 31. But in the first quarter this year the index lost 7.6 percent. 
 Michael Grupe, a senior vice president for research and investment affairs at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a trade group, predicted that REIT's would turn around this year, ''though I don't expect anything near last year's total return.''
 Not surprisingly, real estate funds with a limited exposure to REIT's managed to buck the downward trend in the last quarter, according to Morningstar. Among them were Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity, up 3.2 percent; Alpine International Real Estate, up 2.2 percent; and Third Avenue Real Estate Value, up 1.2 percent. 
 ''I think REIT's will be a little boring this year,'' said Samuel A. Lieber, the chief executive of Alpine Management and Research and the fund manager for Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity and Alpine International Real Estate. He said that REIT holdings made up just 15 percent of his domestic fund. 
 The Third Avenue Real Estate Value fund, meanwhile, has around 25 percent of its portfolio in REIT's. The fund has about $2 billion in assets.
 Mr. Lieber likes stocks of builders like Pulte Homes, Standard Pacific Homes and Toll Brothers, the top three holdings in Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity. The three together total 14 percent of the portfolio, which has around $370 million in assets. Mr. Lieber says he sees continued growth in Pulte, particularly in its Dell Webb division, a major developer of adult communities, and he is pleased with the national expansion of Standard Pacific and the solid earnings of Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes. 
 The top holdings of Alpine International Real Estate, which has assets of around $200 million, include JM, the Swedish commercial and residential developer; Gecina of France, which develops high-end office and apartment buildings in Paris, and the Midland Realty Group, a big real estate broker in Hong Kong. The companies have had strong earnings or increases in their stock prices, according to Mr. Lieber. 
 But he isn't writing off REIT's, either. In particular, he says he likes Vornado Realty Trust, which owns and manages commercial real estate and is one of the biggest landlords in New York City. He also sees growth potential in some REIT's that are invested in hotels. 
 Mr. Cohen, too, says he thinks that many REIT's remain fundamentally strong. Looking at the top holdings in Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, he said, ''I like this list,'' which includes Boston Properties, AvalonBay Communities, Host Marriott and Vornado. 
 But Mr. Cohen's enthusiasm is tempered by what he calls economic ''headwinds,'' namely the Federal Reserve's determination to keep inflation in check by raising interest rates. Higher rates will hurt some REIT companies that borrow to finance their projects, he said, and tighter credit could also significantly cool off the economy.
 ''You need a strong economy to keep shopping malls going, to fill up office buildings,'' he said.
 David Joy, capital markets strategist at American Express Financial Advisors, for one, says he thinks that the real estate sector's heady days may be behind it. Last December, he said, he and other managers of the American Express Builder Series of funds decided to lower to 3 percent from 5 percent their funds' level of real estate holdings. 
 ''The fact that interest rates are rising will make it difficult for real estate,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Statistical Holy Grail: The Search for the Winner Within

BYLINE: By DAN T. ROSENBAUM. 
Dan T. Rosenbaum is an assistant professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

 BODY:
A glance at ordinary statistics -- points, assists, rebounds -- suggests Jason Kidd and Dwight Howard are two of the league's better players. Kidd, the Nets' starting point guard, is considered one of the league's silkiest passers, and Howard, a rookie forward for the Magic, is one of the top rebounders.
 Yet a closer look reveals they are players of vastly different value. The Nets are much better -- 14 points better per 48 minutes -- when Kidd is on the floor than when he is not. The Magic is slightly worse when Howard is on the floor. Orlando is outscored by 2 points per 48 minutes when he plays, and plays its foes even when he sits, according to 82games.com. 
 That traditional statistics and the increasingly popular plus-minus differential can measure players so differently highlights the difficulty in designing a rating system for the N.B.A. 
 Unlike baseball, with its repeated encounters between pitchers and batters, basketball is not a series of one-on-one contests. In baseball, the game's essence is captured remarkably well by box scores.
 In basketball, statistics in box scores focus almost entirely on the player with the ball. This omits critical aspects of the game, like teamwork and defense.
 These blind spots have made many fans and old-school basketball disciples skeptical of statistical analysis. Dean Oliver, author of ''Basketball on Paper'' and a statistical consultant for the Seattle SuperSonics, has likened attempts to produce an overall player rating to the quest for the Holy Grail. 
 But the statistic du jour in the N.B.A. -- the plus-minus statistic -- offers an opportunity to remedy many drawbacks of the traditional box score, even if it is limited. More teams are now using plus-minus as an important part of their front-office work. 
 In their most common form, plus-minus statistics measure how a team performs when a given player is on the floor versus when he is on the bench. When Stephon Marbury is on the floor, the Knicks lose by 0.1 points per 48 minutes. Put Marbury on the bench and the Knicks lose by 12.7 points. Marbury's net impact is a positive 12.6 points per 48 minutes. 
 Because plus-minus statistics depend on team performance, they capture almost every contribution a player can make. The good pick, the solid help defense, the threat of a 3-point shooter -- all these contributions are captured by net plus-minus statistics. In theory, they are an ideal measure of a player's effectiveness.
 But interpreting what plus-minus statistics tell us about players requires care and knowledge. For example, the impact of Joe Johnson, a Phoenix Suns guard, is overstated because he shares the court with several All-Stars. So is the impact of players, like Marbury, who have poor substitutes.
 These factors can be mitigated by further refining plus-minus statistics to account for the quality of a player's teammates and opponents. Surprisingly, few teams use these adjusted plus-minus statistics.
 Plus-minus statistics are especially difficult to interpret when the analysis is applied to a small number of games, a point not well understood by many proponents of the statistics. Stable results take more than half a season; stable box-score statistics require only about 10 games. 
 Small samples of plus-minus statistics are probably more distracting than useful. For example, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett had the league's best net plus-minus in 2003-4 but one of the worst over the past month.
 People in the game often claim to know instinctively how to measure intangibles, but salaries suggest otherwise. Teams pay for little more than the glory statistics (points, rebounds and, to a lesser extent, assists).
 Although steals, blocks, shooting percentage and an ability to avoid turnovers are crucial to a team's performance, players proficient in these aspects are rarely rewarded with bigger paychecks.
 Consider our most underrated players, whose adjusted plus-minus statistics most exceed their glory statistics. (The most overrated players are those whose glory statistics most exceed their adjusted plus-minus statistics.)
 The underrated list has many role players, as well as Utah's Andrei Kirilenko and San Antonio's Manu Ginobili, stars who are strong defenders with well-rounded games. The overrated players include three Olympians and several maximum-salary players.
 The overrated list is dominated by high-volume shooters who commit lots of turnovers, like Richard Jefferson and Carmelo Anthony. Many are also low-percentage shooters, like Allen Iverson and Antoine Walker. 
 Scorers like Jermaine O'Neal, Zach Randolph and Michael Redd who generate few assists are less valuable to their teams than is generally understood.
 More can be learned by analyzing adjusted plus-minus statistics. With analysis, they can shed light on the age-old question of what kind of player helps a team win.

HEADLINE: Ready to Buy? Look Beyond the Label

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MANY investors would abhor the notion of picking a stock based on its price without paying attention to fundamental measures like earnings and sales. 
 Yet, without realizing it, many people are choosing mutual funds on the basis of little more than their price histories.
 That's because the major rating services rely almost exclusively on what has happened in the past to fund prices when they issue their mutual fund evaluations. To be sure, the services churn out a number of sophisticated statistics about each fund, using terms like beta, Sharpe Ratio and correlation with the overall market. But while those measures can be useful, each ultimately derives from the fund's price history. 
 A recent study shows that investors can improve performance by looking beyond price histories and analyzing the valuations of the stocks that the funds own. It was conducted by James Squyres, the president of Buyside Research, an investment research firm based in Darien, Conn., that has a patent pending for software it has designed to conduct its analysis. Though the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, its results are encouraging.
 Mr. Squyres refers to his approach as fundamental analysis of funds, because it is based on the fundamental values of the stocks a fund owns. It isn't initially obvious why it should be so difficult to accomplish this. When comparing the price-to-earnings ratios of two funds, for example, why can't we simply average the individual ratios of the stocks each fund owns?
 There are two major problems, Mr. Squyres said. First, companies have different fiscal years over which they report results. So if the earnings reflected in the P/E ratios are based on fiscal year results, the comparisons will be apples to oranges. That can be an especially big problem when the economy is bottoming or topping out, because the mere inclusion or exclusion of a given quarter's earnings can cause large changes in a company's P/E.
 A second hurdle arises when a fund owns stocks of money-losing companies. Because it is impossible to calculate meaningful price-to-earnings ratios for such stocks, the averaging technique simply ignores them. Yet this causes the total earnings per share of a fund's stocks to appear higher than they really are, which in turn causes the fund's P/E ratio to be too low. That is particularly the case if it owns a number of companies with negative earnings.
 Solving these problems involves several steps, Mr. Squyres says. First, when focusing on the same four quarters for all companies, add the earnings per share of all companies in the fund and reduce that total by any losses experienced by those companies. Second, calculate the average price at which each of these stocks trades. Only then can the second number --the average price -- be divided by the first -- the average earnings -- to arrive at a fund's true P/E ratio.
 The software designed by his firm not only calculates the P/E ratio of funds in this way, but it also averages any of the hundreds of other accounting variables contained in Standard & Poor's comprehensive database of companies' operating performance. 
 To illustrate the benefits of his approach, Mr. Squyres teamed up with S.&P. to analyze more than 2,000 equity funds over the four years through 2003. Among his initial findings was that mutual fund ratings services often assign funds to the wrong style categories. For example, many so-called value funds own shares of companies that, upon deeper analysis, look more like growth stocks. The reverse is true for many so-called growth funds.
 Wrongly categorizing a fund can be costly, because the stocks it holds may not be the kind you originally wanted. Such a fund could also cause your portfolio to be less diversified than you thought it would be when you decided to invest.
 Placement in the wrong category affects a fund's rating, because most ratings services compare a fund to others in its category. If a value fund mistakenly lands in the growth category, and growth funds generally are outperforming value funds, that fund's rating will be lower than it should be.
 A fundamental analysis of mutual funds will do more than put funds into the correct categories, Mr. Squyres says. It can also result in higher returns. To show how, his firm, in conjunction with S.&P, backtested strategies for choosing mutual funds according to various fundamental variables.
 Under one strategy, for example, an investor starts each year by buying funds whose earnings growth rates for the previous year were above the median of all funds and whose P/E ratios were below the median. From the beginning of 2001 through 2003, according to Mr. Squyres, this produced a return of 6.2 percent, annualized, versus an annualized loss of 2.5 percent for the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index.
 ENCOURAGING as those results are, they covered just three years. More research is needed, not only into the value of using earnings growth rates and P/E ratios to pick mutual funds, but also into other fundamental variables. But based on these results, Philip Edwards, the managing director of S.&P.'s Investment Services unit, who is responsible for fund research, says the analysis by Mr. Squyres ''has a good deal of merit.''
 ''We're very interested in what he came up with,'' he said.
 Mr. Squyres's fundamental analysis for mutual funds is not yet available publicly. So what can you do for now if you are considering a fund for your portfolio? One important move is to verify that the fund is classified properly. Study the classification particularly closely if the fund owns stocks of several companies that are losing money or whose fortunes have recently taken a strong turn for better or worse. In such cases, there is a good chance that the ratings services are comparing it to the wrong fund group.

When the earnings growth rates of funds' stock holdings are calculated in a consistent way, there is little difference among the funds assigned to ''growth'' and ''value'' categories.Average growth in annual earnings per share, 2000-03, by category, as classified by Standard & Poor'sLarge-cap growthBOTTOM QUARTILE: -1%TOP QUARTILE: +99Large-cap valueBOTTOM QUARTILE: +3TOP QUARTILE: +95Mid-cap growthBOTTOM QUARTILE: -5TOP QUARTILE: +181Mid-cap valueBOTTOM QUARTILE: +2TOP QUARTILE: +188(Source by Buyside Research)

HEADLINE: Active Management, in a Land of Indexing

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

DATELINE: Malvern, Pa. 

 BODY:
AS chief investment officer of the Vanguard Group, George U. Sauter presides over the country's biggest, best-known family of index mutual funds. But as he'll tell you, indexing experts like him get little respect from other investing professionals and the public. 
 ''There's a misconception about indexing,'' Mr. Sauter said in a conversation at Vanguard's headquarters here. ''You hear all the time that even a monkey could do it.'' 
 Index funds -- the country's biggest is the Vanguard Index 500 -- invest passively by strictly tracking major stock market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500. 
 Perhaps because of the Rodney Dangerfield-like plight of indexers, Mr. Sauter, 50, manages a thimbleful of Vanguard's clients' money by what are called active methods, too. (He has loved picking stocks since he was 12, when he bought a small stake in the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. ''I'm probably the only person who ever lost money owning a professional sports franchise,'' he said.)
 The amount of money that Mr. Sauter and his staff invest actively has quadrupled in the last five years, to about $13 billion. That may sound like a lode, but it's hardly a jigger -- about 1.6 percent of total assets -- for Vanguard, the mutual fund giant. It manages more than $825 billion, including $350 billion in index funds; historically, it has handled indexing internally and farmed out active stock-picking to companies like Wellington Management. 
 Mr. Sauter's group exclusively captains the investments of only one active fund, Vanguard Strategic Equity. This $4.1 billion fund focuses on small and medium-size companies; its biggest holdings on Feb. 28 were J.C. Penney and Coventry Health Care. The fund returned 10.4 percent, annualized, over the five years through March. 
 The rest of the active money invested by Mr. Sauter's group is in big Vanguard funds like Windsor II, Explorer, Morgan, Equity Income and Variable Insurance-Equity Income Portfolio. In these funds, the group is part of a team of money managers; Vanguard hires the rest from other management companies. 
 In managing Strategic Equity and the rest of Vanguard's in-house active money, Mr. Sauter and his team follow a strategy that goes by the inelegant name of active-quantitative management -- or, as it is more commonly known on Wall Street, ''active quant.'' 
 Quants are the methodological antitheses of stock pickers like Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway. Where Mr. Buffett pores over corporate reports looking for a few good investment ideas, quantitative managers use computer programs to screen thousands of stocks a night. Strategic Equity typically holds about 400 stocks, while the average actively managed fund might have 100, Mr. Sauter said. 
 Mr. Sauter and his staff wrote the two computer programs used for building their portfolios. One seeks out stocks; the other monitors risks. ''We have about 40 years' worth of data on every stock, every price, every fundamental factor,'' he said. 
 Sonya G. Morris, a Morningstar analyst, lauds Strategic Equity's risk management. Vanguard's computer program weighs considerations like total investment in each economic sector and in small-capitalization stocks more carefully than some nonquantitative managers do, she said. In contrast, ''sometimes active nonquant managers can make unintended bets,'' she said. They pour too much money into a single sector and lose the benefits of diversification.
 Computer programs like Vanguard's also check the extremes of pessimism and exuberance that many investors fall prey to, said Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Following a computer's recommendations can prevent a manager from overreacting to a stock's, or the market's, zigzags.
 Mr. Sauter and his team buy and sell shares based on their computer programs' recommendations. ''The only time we'll override the model is if we think there's something that the data isn't picking up,'' he said. ''Suppose the chairman just ran off to Costa Rica. Or when Tyco blew up. It takes a week or so before the data picks that up.'' 
 The main disadvantage of an active-quantitative fund is that it probably will never perform at the top of its category, said Alex Greyserman, a principal at Hite Capital Management. Most aren't designed to do so. Instead, a typical one uses an index as a benchmark, overweighting some stocks and underweighting others. 
 ''It's not going to outperform by ridiculous amounts, but it shouldn't blow up either,'' Mr. Greyserman said.

HEADLINE: Why Hard Work + Low Pay = More Anxiety

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, in his quiet moments, Jose Ortega daydreams about what life would be like with his family here. He'd be able to have the fresh corn tortillas his mother makes every Sunday. 
 He'd help look after his teenage sister, watching to make sure she wasn't spending too much time with the boys who chase after her. And he'd be able to hang out with his younger brother, maybe playing catch like the other brothers he sees in the park here.
 Most of the time, Mr. Ortega, 22, tries not to indulge himself in this way. He just goes about his day. He tries to avoid dwelling too much on his loved ones, who remain in a small town near Puebla, in southern Mexico. 
 But something happened early last year to cause these dreams, and since then it has been hard to rein himself in. What happened was that Mr. Ortega heard about President Bush's new immigration plan. 
 ''I thought it would make everything better, much better,'' he said one recent afternoon, heading to the restaurant where he works as a dishwasher. ''We got so excited. I was making plans to save money to bring everyone here fast.'' 
 What he caught wind of, specifically, was something called the guest worker plan, which the administration has fitfully discussed with the Mexican government over the past year, and which the news media have episodically reported on -- but which remains mostly in the realm of theoretical possibility.
 Very little is known about it -- just that it would match employers to potential employees, who would be allowed to stay in the United States for up to three years but would then have to return home. Critics on both sides seem to agree that the plan could very quickly attract thousands of low-wage Latin American immigrants. 
 Beyond that, there are only questions. Mr. Ortega, for his part, wonders what it would mean for people like himself, who immigrated illegally but have been living here for years. Would the sudden influx of new immigrants shut him and others out of jobs? Would the newcomers be able to bring their family members with them? If he signed on among their number, to work here legally for several years, would he still be able to apply for citizenship later? Would the working years he has already put in here count for anything? 
 The last time such a state of anxiety and hopeful confusion manifested itself among Hispanic immigrants was in the mid-1980's, just before the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provided amnesty for an estimated 2.7 million people, most of them Mexican. 
 But since the amnesty, there has been no major change in status for illegal immigrants, and critics today see the Bush administration proposal, at least so far, as unresponsive to the fate of those millions who have moved here to work, generating Social Security and Medicare tax revenue estimated in the billions of dollars -- but unable to benefit from that revenue because of their undocumented status. 
 ''There's no way people who are already here are going to go back,'' said Robin A. Bikkal, a White Plains lawyer who has helped hundreds of immigrants gain citizenship over the last two decades. ''For them, it's an absolutely worthless plan. There's no incentive to go back.''
 IN the 2000 census, the Hispanic population of Westchester was put at 144,000; in 1990 the figure was 96,500. Today, immigration lawyers and other experts in the county believe that the number could be nearly double the 2000 census estimate. 
 Latino immigrants -- especially from Mexico, but also from Ecuador, Guatemala and elsewhere -- have settled everywhere from Yonkers to Peekskill and Mount Kisco to Mamaroneck. In 1990 they made up more than 50 percent of the population in a small swath of Port Chester. A decade later there were 10 such neighborhoods, in parts of Yonkers, Ossining and Eastchester, according to census data. 
 The men continue to follow the established pattern of taking day-laborer jobs in construction and landscaping; the women are usually domestic workers. (At the county level, there are no clear statistics showing the percentage of those immigrants in low-wage jobs. But national studies indicate that immigrants make up about 11 percent of the population and 20 percent of the low-wage work force.) 
 ''The evidence is overwhelming that there has been a dramatic shift in the last several years,'' said Dean Hubbard, who holds the Joanne Woodward chair in Public Policy at Sarah Lawrence College. ''We are living in an era of capital mobility and labor mobility. The capital goes with cheap labor and the labor goes where the job is.''
 In Westchester, he said, this has meant that several town councils have been forced to grapple with the presence of increasing numbers of day laborers. Debates on the subject have in certain cases engendered bitterness. Officials in Mount Kisco and Port Chester have supported the creation of indoor hiring sites where workers can be sheltered while waiting for the day's job, but other governments have been reluctant to approve such sites. Some say such plans are too costly; others argue that they only encourage a greater influx of undocumented workers. 
 But because day laborers' larger numbers are already a fact of life in the county, sophisticated support groups now exist to help them. Lawyers like Ms. Bikkal and organizations like the Westchester Hispanic Coalition in White Plains offer counseling, tackle immigration questions and advise workers how to collect unpaid wages -- essentially navigating the system for a large group of the otherwise disenfranchised.
 LABORERS these days work for around $10 an hour. In the busy spring months, they find as much as six full days of work a week. At other times, they can go for several weeks without finding a single job, as several said they did this winter. Some say they worry about seeking a job without a Social Security number, but others say they would most likely have to work two or three minimum-wage jobs to make the same amount of money. 
 Every morning around 7:30, as many as 300 men begin to gather along a quarter-mile stretch of Yonkers Avenue, just off the Cross County Parkway. There, they wait for landscapers, contractors, even private homeowners who may be looking for help for a few days. 
 ''You don't know what you can count on,'' said Juan Macedo, 50, who immigrated from Guerrero, Mexico, 12 years ago. In recent years, Mr. Macedo has organized Obreros Unidos, or Workers United, which is asking Yonkers City Hall to create a hiring site. ''Of course it is better to find permanent work,'' he said, ''but that is not usually possible.''
 Mr. Macedo shares a two-bedroom apartment in Yonkers with three other men, a typical arrangement for many of the men who live in Westchester while their families remain in their home countries. After paying his $300 rent, Mr. Macedo says, he typically sends up to $300 a month back to his wife and three teenage sons. 
 ''If they have a better education, they can do better than this,'' he said of his sons, then pointed to a blister in the middle of his right palm. ''They are in school and they study very hard all the time.''
 Because Mr. Macedo has a green card, he is able to return to Mexico once a year, usually around Christmas, when work is slow anyway. Farther down the street, an undocumented worker who gave only his first name, Eliseo, said he had not been back to Guatemala to see his family since he arrived here in 2002.
 Such a journey could take several weeks. If Eliseo hired coyotes, as the people who help others cross the border illegally are known, it could cost thousands of dollars. 
 ''Of course I miss them,'' he said of his loved ones, looking down at his feet. ''But what can I do? There is no choice about this.'' 
 It is not uncommon for undocumented men such as Eliseo and Mr. Ortega to live just below the radar. Both say they rarely venture from the neighborhoods they live in, mostly spending time with cousins and others they may know from their hometowns. Neither has a bank account, a driver's license or even a permanent home address. And above all, they both said, they try not to complain or cause trouble. 
 ''I know if I do one thing wrong, they will kick me out of here,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''I don't want to do anything to get sent away. If that happens, everyone will be in trouble. I can't get kicked out.'' 
 The ultimate goal is citizenship. Typically, being sponsored by a family member who already has it is the quickest and easiest way for immigrants to start the legal process. 
 For those without close relatives already living here, finding an employer to sponsor them is the next best option. To do so, employers must prove that they have enough money to pay workers' salaries and that there is no American citizen able, willing or available to do the job they require.
 Single men in their 20's and 30's far outnumber female immigrants living in Westchester. The women who do live here are often even further removed from the wider society than the men, experts say. 
 ''The men you see everywhere on the streets, doing landscaping, the masonry work, those kinds of things,'' account for about 80 percent of her clients, Ms. Bikkal said. ''The women are in jobs behind closed doors, which makes it even more difficult.'' 
 At the start of each case, Ms. Bikkal said, she routinely asks the men if they have a serious girlfriend. 
 ''Does she have papers? No. Are you living with her? Yes,'' she says, without pausing for a breath. ''O.K., time to get married.'' 
 ''That's the best way to help the women, to get them the same rights and benefits that the man is getting,'' she said. ''Otherwise, they can sit and wait forever.''
 WHILE politicians and advocates in Washington argue about details of the still-theoretical guest worker plan, immigrants in Westchester chew over what little they know, with a little hope and a lot of confusion. Many rely on Spanish-language television news, which has been fascinated with the subject for months now. They glean information and trade it. Often, in the retelling, the information becomes misleading. 
 After he heard about the plan, Mr. Macedo said, he immediately thought of bringing his family to the States, only to have his hopes dashed upon learning that such move could only be temporary. 
 ''We want to live here as a family, but I don't want them to come illegally,'' he said. ''That's no way to live.''
 Mr. Ortega, too, started with the wishful assumption that the proposal could mean nearly automatic amnesty for him and his family. He calculated how much it would cost to get flights for his mother and siblings. Soon afterward, he started to look for affordable apartments suitable for the whole family. 
 ''At first, nobody could stop talking about it,'' said Graciela Heymann, executive director of the Hispanic Coalition. ''Anytime there's anything mentioned about immigration, there is either a lot of hope or fear.''
 Like experts nationally, she and Ms. Bikkal say there is almost no doubt that if the worker plan was approved, many more immigrants will come to American shores, pushed on by the promise of economic security.
 All the more reason for workers already here to be concerned: the plan could theoretically force them to register in order to get work. They would then, presumably, be asked to return to their home countries. 
 A survey conducted earlier this year by the Pew Hispanic Center indicated that more than half of Mexican immigrants would be willing to return after receiving a three-year temporary work visa, as the president's plan calls for. But Mr. Ortega, like dozens of others interviewed, said there was little chance that he would ever willingly give up the chance to earn money in the United States and send some back to his family in Puebla.
 From the viewpoint of advocates in the field, Ms. Heymann said, another major problem with the guest-worker plan is the impact of coping with a new wave of inexperienced immigrants every three years. 
 ''We want to import labor,'' she said, ''but we get people. People bring with them all kinds of issues. They have to learn the language, they have to learn the schools, they have to learn health care and they have to learn their rights. All of that takes time, so if you have one group constantly moving in and out, that's never going to happen.'' 
 As an example of a concept that is tough for new immigrants to accept, she cited labor rights that many were too fearful or suspicious to exercise. For years, she has worked to convince workers in low-wage jobs that they can enlist the government's help in recovering unpaid wages or fixing unsafe working conditions. Under state and federal laws, all are entitled to pursue claims for back wages, regardless of immigration status. 
 Michael Higgins, an assistant attorney general who works with the state's day laborer task force, says that in recent years more men have been willing to press their cases. He handled about 100 cases in the New York City region last year and expects the number to grow this year. 
 ''Typically, I'll see guys who've worked for someone for two or three days and then been told, 'Sorry, I can't pay you now,''' Mr. Higgins said. Usually, a worker will go to a community-based organization first, and caseworkers there will contact the federal Department of Labor or the attorney general's office. ''It's usually not that much money, and most employers turn around and pay pretty quickly,'' he said. 
 At the Westchester office of the Labor Department, Susan Rivera deals with similar cases of back pay for many minimum-wage earners, mainly people in the food service industry. Last year, she said, she was able to get final paychecks in 59 cases, for a total of $29,090.55 in wages. 
 MARIA ELENA BUSTOS remembers harboring hopes of a better life when she first came to the United States in the early 1990's. Though she had relatives from Puebla elsewhere in New York City as well as in Los Angeles, she decided to settle in Yonkers, after hearing that housing was cheaper and jobs were more plentiful. She worked in a hotel for several years, but quit when the early morning hours became too difficult to manage with young children.
 Now, with a son in his 20's and a daughter finishing high school, Ms. Bustos has two jobs cleaning office buildings --one in Stamford, Conn., and the other in White Plains. Both pay about $8 an hour, giving Ms. Bustos about $300 in take-home pay each week. 
 With the Bee-Line bus strike dragging on, Ms. Bustos has spent recent weeks worrying about how to get from her home to at least one of her jobs. Usually, her son drives her there and she finds a ride back with a friend, but on several occasions she has had to pay as much as $20 to get to White Plains. 
 She says she considers herself lucky: ''My work is for my children. I want them to be here and get a good education and be able to succeed. That's what everyone has done, right? It was the same for the Italians who came here, right? They worked hard and then the children benefited.''

HEADLINE: Local Reading, for the Rich

BYLINE: By JEFF GROSSMAN

 BODY:
IN the autumn of 2002, Grace Bennett had an idea and the experience to put it into action. A magazine editor, Ms. Bennett had taken time off to raise her children, but had become restless. She began knocking on merchants' doors along King Street and South Greeley Avenue in her native Chappaqua, asking if they would be interested in advertising in a new magazine just for local residents.
 ''I got a little more serious about it, because I was getting really great positive feedback,'' said Ms. Bennett, who had held jobs at Woman's Day, McCall's and Sesame Street Parents. ''I had set up a budget, basically. I had gotten estimates from printers. I understood what it would take to mail. I wasn't going to launch it if I wasn't going to break even.'' After an initial outlay of about $500 for stationery, cards and a prototype cover, the premier edition of Inside Chappaqua rolled off the presses in April 2003. 
 Today, the magazine, of which Ms. Bennett is editor and publisher, is mailed to 6,300 homes in and around North Castle six times a year. The current issue has 100 advertisers. Although it is sold for a cover price of $3.95 at the Second Story bookshop in Chappaqua and the Drug Mart in Millwood, subscriptions are free and automatic with local home ownership. 
 Printing was originally only in blue and black inks, but full-color pages are now being phased in. Every page should be in color by this September, Ms. Bennett said, and each issue averages about 50 pages. ''One issue really does continue to pay for the next,'' she said. ''That's getting better, there is a buildup now, and I'm not worried that I can't get out my next issue if my bills don't get paid.'' Besides herself, Ms Bennett has a part-time designer and one primary advertising representative. 
 Inside Chappaqua and other similar magazines covering Westchester are sharing in flush times for hometown magazines across the country, experts say. The key to these magazines' survival is that they appeal to local residents who tend to go to the same restaurants and shop in the same stores, and they are most likely to attract affluent readers whom local advertisers covet, according to those who publish them. Business has been flourishing nationally for the last six years, said Jim Dowden, executive director of the City and Regional Magazine Association, based in Los Angeles. In 1993, during ''the last big advertising recession,'' the association had 36 member publications, he said. There are now 100 magazines on the group's roster.
 A strong consumer economy with plenty of ready advertisers means that magazines will be viable in smaller markets, Mr. Dowden said. The number of businesses in the area willing to come on board determines how narrowly a magazine can tailor its geographic focus. ''A lot depends on the community and the business skills of the people running the enterprise,'' he said. ''What you need is enough mass to support the kind of advertisers that will in turn support the magazine.''
 Other local general-interest magazines, of which there are five in the county, include Bedford -- which besides Bedford covers the surrounding communities from Armonk to North Salem. Scheduled to come out six times a year, Bedford had its first issue on Thanksgiving Day. Another local magazine is Westchester, which with 244 pages in the April issue, is the thickest in the magazine's five-year history, according to its publisher, Ralph Martinelli. 
 Bedford is the sister publication of Ridgefield, which was started in Fairfield County in late 2002. Bedford has a local office at the village green, and its editor is Christopher West Davis of Bedford. The two magazines share a business staff, including their advertising sales team.
 Bedford reaches out to neighboring towns as well. ''It's a distinct region,'' said Geoffrey James Morris, publisher. ''You're not going to waste a story on somebody because it's not relevant to them. Bedford, Armonk, Pound Ridge, Katonah, the Salems -- it's sort of like an extended family almost. They have the same concerns, they go to the same restaurants, they shop in a lot of the same stores.''
 The goal is to have 5,000 to 6,000 paid subscribers and a newsstand circulation of 1,500 by the end of the year, Mr. Morris said. The cover price is $3.95, and the subscription rate is $15 a year. Two advertising representatives make up the magazine's only business staff, and all the writers are freelance.
 Not coincidentally, most of the county's local magazine coverage is clustered around its wealthier neighborhoods.
 ''Our readers tend to be more affluent, we have more people in Scarsdale and in Rye that are reading the magazine than in Yonkers,'' said Mr. Martinelli, who grew up in Yonkers and whose father, Angelo, was the city's mayor for 12 years. The magazine's readers have a mean household income of about $350,000, he said. Westchester has a circulation of about 70,000, according to Mr. Martinelli, and 60,000 magazines are mailed out to subscribers, 6,000 to newsstands and 2,000 to hotel rooms. The cover price is $3.95, and the subscription rate is $18 a year. The magazine has about 40 people in its Elmsford office. 
 There is another office in Poughkeepsie with 20 people, but that is for Hudson Valley magazine, a general interest magazine that Mr. Martinelli also publishes. It covers the entire region, but focuses primarily on the mid-valley area, and only 20 percent of its circulation comes from Westchester, he said.
 Nationwide, local-magazine readers tend to be wealthier than the average readers of mass media, Mr. Dowden said. ''City magazines, their advertising base, their reader base are people who have the resources to enjoy all that a region has to offer in terms of dining, vacation, lifestyle. The kind of advertisers attracted to such an audience obviously are those that are selling to the high-end demographic.''
 Mary Ann Liebert, publisher of the monthly Westchester Wag, which just moved its offices to New Rochelle from Larchmont, keeps tight wraps on her circulation numbers and the content of her distribution list. She is forthright, though, in her mission for the paper to be read by the county's richest and most famous residents. 
 Her magazine's regular content includes columns by Susan Weber Soros, founder and director of the Bard Graduate Center in the Decorative Arts in Manhattan and wife of George Soros, the financier, and Seema Boesky, the former wife of Ivan Boesky. The magazine's cover articles have featured Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ari Fleischer. In an interview with Senator Clinton, Ms. Liebert asked whether she keeps her own checkbook. (She does not.) The Wag has three dedicated staffers who are all on the editorial side. The business side is shared with Ms. Liebert's other publications: as head of Mary Ann Liebert Inc., which publishes more than 70 medical and scientific journals, she has about 100 employees in total, she said.
 Ms. Liebert also looked for affluent readership when she put together a list of people who would be sent the magazine. She wanted, she said, people ''with money to spend, who were living the good life, and were giving the parties and the kinds of things other people wanted to emulate.'' 
 Because the readership of the county's magazines can overlap, she said, it's essential that the editors all ''stick to their own knitting.'' 
 That kind of niche thinking is reflected in articles in Bedford, which uses the town as a starting point, Mr. Davis said, but then aims for a broader slice of life. The current issue has a gardening theme, but also includes an interview with Ian Baker, who grew up in Bedford and is a professional mountain climber who discovered an elusive waterfall in the Himalayan wilderness. 
 Another local magazine, Westchester Parent, focuses on a subject dear to the county's heart. It has a circulation of 70,000 copies and is part of the Family Communications chain, headquartered in Manhattan. The company also produces magazines in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. There are four people in the North White Plains office, including two advertising representatives.
 Covering the whole county ''makes the magazine more interesting,'' said Renee Cho, editor. ''It's good for people who live in wealthy towns to realize that just over the border of the town there's a completely different perspective. You really can't shut yourself out from that.''

HEADLINE: Closed Loophole Hasn't Cut Subsidies for Student Loans

BYLINE: By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
Months after Congress unanimously passed a law to cut back on what it called excess subsidies to student loan companies, federal payments to lenders are as high as ever and will probably remain that way for months to come, according to federal records and officials.
 There is, however, disagreement in Washington as to the precise cause.
 For the last few years, student loan companies have taken great advantage of subsidies that Congress thought it had done away with more than a decade ago. Through creative use of a loophole in federal law, lenders have amassed huge portfolios of loans carrying 9.5 percent interest rates, guaranteed by the government, at a time when students are paying a little more than a third of that. 
 Most lawmakers became aware of the loophole only because lenders began taking such vigorous advantage of it. In the last fiscal year alone, they billed the government for almost $900 million in subsidies at the guaranteed interest rate -- more than four times what they received under it just three years before. 
 The stepped-up billing prodded Congress to close the loophole last October. Yet, even after doing so, payments to lenders have continued to increase, reopening an issue that many lawmakers thought had been resolved.
 ''Taxpayers continue to be gouged,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been trying to eliminate the guaranteed 9.5 percent interest rate for more than a decade. He added, ''It's time to stop guaranteeing this rip-off, and start guaranteeing that college loans help students.'' 
 After Congress closed the loophole, payments to lenders at the guaranteed 9.5 percent interest rate rose to $262 million for the first quarter of the 2005 fiscal year, federal records show. That is about $22 million more than in the last quarter of fiscal year 2004, when the loophole was open. And the payments will probably remain ''fairly consistent'' for the next several quarters, according to the Department of Education, which administers the subsidies. 
 There are competing theories on why payments to lenders went up after the law was changed. The Education Department said the increase mostly stemmed from what it called corrections, normal bureaucratic adjustments, including mistakes, that are made when students leave school or defer their loans, for example. 
 A Republican Congressional staff member speculated that the increase could be a result of the ''death spasms'' of the loophole, meaning that lenders raced in to issue new loans with the 9.5 percent guarantee shortly before the window of opportunity closed. Democrats, on the other hand, contended that the payments remained high because Congress took a compromise position, closing the loophole it considered most vulnerable to abuse, while leaving others open. 
 The government would presumably be spending even more had the loophole not been closed, as lenders continued to stockpile loans carrying the higher interest rate. Still, many lawmakers and policy experts expected more substantial savings after Congress took action, and the delays in reaping them could reignite the debate over government subsidies. 
 ''The fact that we have not seen a reduction in these payments, even though Congress took action, means that we need to take a look at the whole student loan program,'' said Robert M. Shireman, a member of the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, which was created by Congress to advise it on higher education. ''It is far too easy to take advantage of taxpayers.'' 
 Despite the rise in payments, the Education Department noted that the total portfolio of loans carrying a 9.5 percent interest rate had decreased slightly since Congress changed the law, a sign that payments would eventually go down. Precisely when that will occur, the department added, is unclear. 
 Government payments to student loan companies are a cornerstone of the federal financial aid system, enabling lenders to offer students unusually low interest rates while still making their profit margins. But throughout the 1980's, when interest rates were much higher than they are today, some lenders, particularly states and nonprofit groups, were granted fixed interest rates of 9.5 percent. 
 Congress eliminated the guarantee by 1993, eventually moving to a system that is more closely tied to the market, but it allowed some lenders to keep collecting the higher interest rates on money they had already raised. What Congress did not anticipate was that interest rates would fall so low, making the promise of a 9.5 percent return a potential windfall at a time when students are paying less than 3.4 percent in interest on their loans. 
 Moreover, some of the lenders that originally qualified for the guarantee have been converted into profit-seeking companies, or have been subsumed by them, putting greater emphasis on profits. In recent years, lenders have begun using some creative financing tactics to issue new loans with the old guarantees, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. It found that the guarantees had given lenders at least $1.7 billion more in federal subsidies than they might have otherwise received, and most of that has occurred in the last few years.

HEADLINE: Why Is Monaco A Country?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

 BODY:
Like Las Vegas, Monaco is really a dream -- largely the dream of Rainier III, the prince who ruled it from 1949 until his death Wednesday at 81.
 Monaco is little more than a rock on the shore of the Mediterranean near the French-Italian border, smaller than Central Park in Manhattan or the Mall in Washington. Monaco has no mineral resources, arable land, army or income tax, and with 498 police officers for 33,000 residents, practically no petty crime. Its government is named by the ruling prince, now Rainier's son, Albert II, 47, though there is a 24-seat elected Legislature. 
 Why is it a country? Because, like Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, it is a relic of Medieval Europe that more powerful neighbors allowed to survive. The House of Grimaldi, the clan that seized control of Monaco in 1297, adroitly played Italy, France and Spain against one another over the centuries and remained sovereign -- to a degree.
 Tourism and gambling, with the kind of gamblers who arrive by yacht, were long the mainstays of the economy. Rainier's great-grandfather, Charles III, started the first of the gambling casinos in the section now known as Monte Carlo in 1863, and the prince is the major shareholder in the company that controls them.
 Rainier faced a crisis in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle grew fed up with French citizens' taking residence in Monaco to avoid paying income tax. He threatened to isolate the principality and cut off its supply of French francs, the principality's currency until the advent of the euro. In 1963, Rainier agreed to a treaty that decreed that the French citizens who live in Monaco (currently there are some 12,000) have to pay income tax to Paris.
 Prince Rainier's storybook marriage to Grace Kelly in 1956 increased the principality's popularity as a resort, and the prince used low business taxes to lure more than 100 service companies and private banks, mostly foreign-owned. He also built a huge convention center on a landfill in the harbor.
 The 5,000 or so native Monegasques who live there (thousands more live abroad) speak, look and act like their French neighbors on the Cote d'Azur. Another 5,000 or so residents are Italian. Among the principality's attractions is the annual Formula I Grand Prix race, from May 19 to May 22 this year. CRAIG R. WHITNEY

HEADLINE: Glitches in Booking First Class Online

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE Internet is perhaps the only place where first-class fliers are treated like second-class citizens.
 A report issued last month by Consumer WebWatch, a division of Consumers Union, said that people who spent the most money on airline fares must at times overcome serious technology failures in their quest to book premium tickets. According to Forrester Research, an Internet consultancy firm, nearly 19 percent of Americans who booked tickets online last year bought domestic business or first-class tickets. 
 William J. McGee, the report's author, said sites had ''straightened out most of the early problems they had with straight domestic fares, like functionality or showing wacky itineraries.'' 
 ''So I was surprised, but not pleasantly, at how many basic problems we ran into when we tried to book something a little more complicated,'' he added.
 For instance, the report said that Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity each experienced problems with ''fare jumping,'' when consumers in search of premium fares select a fare from search results, only to find that the price changes after they click on it and try to book it. One first-class fare on Expedia increased by $748, from $641.19 to $1,389.19, in less than 30 seconds. When flights are booked by phone, the price quoted is generally the price the consumer pays. 
 Travelocity was responsible for first-class fare jumps in 4 percent of the searches Consumer WebWatch conducted, with Expedia at 3 percent and Orbitz at less than 1 percent.
 ''Prices changing in real time is not accepted in any area of commerce,'' Mr. McGee said. ''This is a problem that has to be corrected.''
 If Web sites do not correct the problem, which is due to both ticket demand and the inability of the technology involved to track inventory changes efficiently, Mr. McGee said, Consumer WebWatch would consider pressuring sites to honor the prices 
 ''We've been pointing out fare jumping for two years,'' he said. ''Each time we did, the sites responded by saying it's a technology problem and it's being addressed, but unfortunately, it hasn't been addressed.'' 
 Tracey Weber, Travelocity's senior vice president for air, car and last-minute deals, did not dispute the Consumer WebWatch findings, but she said that Travelocity was addressing the problem of fare jumping. ''We know it's not a good consumer experience, so we've worked on that a lot,'' she said.
 Ms. Weber and other travel executives and analysts said fare jumps happened because the online travel agents were not directly linked to the inventory systems of the airlines. Rather, they go through intermediaries that keep airline seat inventories in giant databases. 
 Those inventory systems, called global distribution systems, do not always have the freshest price information, which in some cases changes so frequently that between the time the travel agency site queries the distribution system for a requested fare and the consumer actually clicks on that fare, the prices could have changed.
 Airline Web sites are generally free of fare jumps, analysts said -- the three airline sites tested by Consumer WebWatch exhibited no fare jumps during premium-class queries primarily because the sites are directly connected to the carriers' inventory systems.
 Aside from fare jumps, travelers booking first-class tickets online must confront situations where sites mix lower-class tickets into the first-class search results. According to the report, all three e-travel agencies mislabeled or failed to label fares on ''multiple'' occasions. In some cases, the sites presented first-class fares on carriers, like ATA, Spirit, AirTran and USA 3000, that do not provide first class.
 Ms. Weber, of Travelocity, said the WebWatch testing happened during an overhaul of the site late last year, which could account for the glitches. Kendra Thornton, an Orbitz spokeswoman, said her company could not account for the mislabeling.
 David Dennis, an Expedia spokesman, said the fare class switches ''came as a surprise to us.'' He continued: ''Two years ago we put a lot of work into making sure that doesn't happen.''
 For instance, Mr. Dennis said, if a visitor searches Expedia for a first-class fare and the site finds itineraries for which only a certain leg of the trip is first class, the site will prominently display a note to that effect. ''So we know that this shouldn't have happened, and we're digging into it deeper,'' he said.
 For first-class ticket bookers looking for bargains, the Consumer WebWatch report said Expedia performed particularly well against the competition, returning the lowest fare 40 percent of the time, compared with 31 percent for Travelocity and 28 percent for Orbitz. 
 But Orbitz scored the biggest savings on a single first-class ticket, on a flight from Dallas to Newark on American and Continental. The Orbitz fare, $950 round trip, was less than half the $2,300 fare quoted on the American Airlines site and Travelocity. Expedia did not return a first-class fare for the itinerary.
 And while the Consumer WebWatch results may have been disappointing to researchers, consumers can probably expect improvements in first-class services in the future, as more wealthy customers look to book premium tickets online.

HEADLINE: Decision Time On Cement

 BODY:
Because the mills of bureaucratic procedure grind exceedingly slow and fine, the bitter struggle over a proposed cement plant on the east bank of the Hudson River just south of Hudson, N.Y., is now well into its sixth year without a resolution. On one side is St. Lawrence Cement, a Canadian-based company with majority Swiss ownership that wants to close an old cement plant west of the river and build a giant new plant that would announce itself with a 40-story smokestack and dominate an 1,800-acre tract (including a 1,200-acre limestone quarry) running to the town's waterfront. 
 On the other side is a growing cohort of determined citizens organized by three advocacy groups -- Scenic Hudson, Friends of Hudson and the Olana Partnership -- who argue that the plant would unleash a plume of pollutants, damage the region's considerable scenic and cultural resources and discourage the small businesses, tourists and second-home residents the local economy has increasingly come to depend on. These critics also regard as inflated the company's claim that the plant will create many new jobs -- especially if St. Lawrence closes the old plant once the new one is built.
 And in the middle, as is always the case when a big new plant seeks permission to build, is New York, in particular Gov. George E. Pataki, whose government must approve the necessary permits. 
 Until now, the opponents have focused most of their pressure on the State Department of Environmental Conservation, which last fall ordered a series of judicial hearings on various critical issues surrounding the plant, as mandated by environmental law. This process could go on for some time.
 Last month, however, Scenic Hudson and its confederates opened a second line of attack, filing a detailed brief with New York's secretary of state. The brief asserts that the plant would violate at least a half-dozen protections for scenic resources, as well as air and water quality, provided by the state's coastal management plan. The company had claimed in an earlier application that the project was fully consistent with that plan.
 A ruling from the secretary, Randy Daniels, is expected soon. A negative decision would deal the project a heavy blow because the Army Corps of Engineers could not then issue important permits without which the company cannot proceed, whatever the outcome of the other reviews. St Lawrence could appeal the ruling to the United States Department of Commerce, which oversees state plans for managing coastlines, but reversals are rare.
 Whatever he does, Mr. Daniels will not be acting entirely on his own. The real decision here lies with Mr. Pataki. This page has urged Mr. Pataki on several occasions dating back to 2003 to block the project, not least because it is so obviously inconsistent with his vision for the Hudson River and, more broadly, his sound record of environmental stewardship. Here is another chance for him to do so.

HEADLINE: Those Baby Pickups Are Grown Up and Ready to Move Out

BYLINE: By BOB KNOLL

 BODY:
FOR years, while the Detroit-based automakers groomed their cash cows, the full-size pickups and S.U.V.'s that generated much of their sales revenue, Japanese companies concentrated on cars. By the time the Americans turned their attention back to automobiles -- Ford called 2004 ''the year of the car'' -- the Japanese were deploying new trucks in their assault on Fortress Detroit.
 Now that both Toyota and Nissan have established a toehold in full-size pickups, the companies have set their sights on the single most neglected sector of the automotive market: pickups that aren't truly large but have clearly outgrown their old ''compact'' label. Sales of less than full-size trucks have fallen by a quarter since 2000, to around 670,000 last year, partly because the offerings have been rather drab and outmoded.
 But for 2005, Toyota and Nissan have replaced their old trucks. Dodge has a new Dakota and Honda is selling its first pickup, the Ridgeline. This flurry of activity began last year, when General Motors brought out the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon. 
 Ford is now the only leading truckmaker without new midsize pickups. Its Ranger, and the similar Mazda B-Series, continues largely unchanged. These are the only true compact pickups left in showrooms.
 The new midsize trucks show big gains over their predecessors in sophistication, performance, size and, unfortunately, cost. Base models start around $15,000, but prices jump with optional engines, enlarged cabs and long lists of options. Well-equipped versions can top $30,000, putting them close to full-size trucks in price as well as size.
 Nissan and Toyota were among the first to slug it out in small trucks, so it is fitting that they both have new models out now. Here are driving impressions of each:

Toyota Tacoma Double Cab
 The previous-generation Tacoma was introduced as a 1995 model, replacing a line of crude workhorses whose main virtue was their reliability. That Tacoma was larger, Americanized and built in California, but it was also fairly crude and uncomfortable, and it had a stiff ride. A makeover was due.
 The 2005 Tacoma has a new chassis, two new engines, two new transmissions and a body that is wider, taller and longer. The truck's structure is based on the one used for two respected S.U.V.'s, the Toyota 4Runner and Lexus GX470.
 But the Tacoma is not simple. In an effort to be all things to all truckers, it comes in 18 configurations. There is the regular cab with no back seat and a six-foot box; the Access Cab with small rear-hinged doors and jump seats, also with a six-foot box; the Double Cab with four conventional doors, a full rear seat and a five-foot box; and the Double Cab with a six-foot box. For enthusiasts, there is the sporty PreRunner trim package and the X-Runner with performance enhancements. Prices range from $13,980 to more than $30,000.
 Beyond the different body styles, you can choose rear drive or four-wheel drive. There are two engines: a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder (164 horsepower) or a 4-liter V-6 (245 horsepower). A five-speed manual transmission is standard on four-cylinder Tacomas, and a four-speed automatic is optional. On V-6 versions, a six-speed manual is standard and a five-speed automatic is optional. 
 There is a new four-wheel-drive transfer case, but no all-wheel-drive setting that would permit full-time use on dry pavement.
 Antilock brakes are especially important on a pickup, given the tendency of rear brakes to lock up when the truck isn't loaded. All Tacomas have a four-wheel antilock system that includes electronic force distribution, to balance braking force among the wheels, and a brake-assist feature that increases the force in panic stops. 
 Other high-tech features that have migrated from passenger cars are electronic traction control, to maintain traction on slick surfaces, and stability control, to guard against spinouts. 
 Suspensions range from the base version to the aggressive X-Runner and the TRD offroad package. Downhill assist, which lets the truck crawl down a slope at a constant speed, is part of the off-road package.
 My test truck was a Double Cab 4x4 SE5 with the V-6 engine. The base price, $25,315, ballooned to $29,498 with options: stability control, side curtain air bags, JBL audio system and running boards, plus smaller items. This SR5, although close to a base model, was well trimmed inside. The center instruments were nicely arrayed, though the fake metal trim was a bit garish.
 The gauges were clear and the center console was large and useful. The steering wheel both tilts and telescopes, a welcome and unexpected feature in a truck like this.
 The four-door Double Cab has a roomy and surprisingly comfortable rear seat. Unfortunately, it folds in an awkward manner to make room for cargo: the bottom cushion is tilted forward to rest against the front seats, and the backrest folds down flat. To accomplish this, the head restraints must be removed and stored in the bottom cushion.
 This design also leaves less height for cargo behind the front seats. 
 Steel cargo beds are easily scratched and dented, so beds of composite materials or with durable spray-on linings are a welcome innovation. Among midsize trucks, only the Dodge and G.M. models still have steel beds. The Tacoma's composite bed has adjustable tie-downs and four built-in storage boxes. 
 Pickups ride more harshly than sedans, and the Tacoma is no exception. But the ride was not as bouncy as some 4x4's and was quite pleasant on the highway. On rougher roads, especially accelerating up hills, the rear end occasionally tried to step to the side. The brakes felt hard and not progressive. (Some Tacomas have been recalled to check the tightness of bolts in the parking brake.)
 With 245 horsepower, acceleration was more than adequate, aided by the smooth-shifting automatic. The V-6 was quiet at moderate throttle, but roared under acceleration. Wind noise was loud and constant.
 Over all, I found the new Tacoma, built in Fremont, Calif., vastly superior to the old one. It now has a comfortable and attractive cab with some welcome shoulder room. The Double Cab's rear seat is useful, though its design is inferior to the Frontier's and Dakota's. The smaller Access Cab is just too tight for rear passengers.
 Toyota's trucks have been remarkably reliable, and there is no reason to think that will change.
 Also, the Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced last week that the two-door Tacoma (and the two-door Dodge Dakota) had earned the highest rating -- five stars -- in front and side crash tests. No other Tacomas were tested.

Nissan Frontier Crew Cab
 While the Tacoma can justifiably be called ''all new,'' the Frontier is a true clean-sheet redesign. Only the name was carried over from the old truck.
 Having recently made a big investment in its full-size truck, the Titan, Nissan borrowed the Titan's structure for the enlarged Frontier. The Frontier even shares the Titan's hulking look, slightly downsized.
 The most important factor in a truck's design is its frame, and the Frontier shares the Titan's very stiff ''fully boxed'' steel frame as well as bits of its suspension.
 The Frontier is built at Nissan's sprawling plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and offers two engines: a 2.5-liter in-line 4 (154 horsepower) on the base XE model only, and a 4-liter V-6 (265 horsepower) in the SE, LE and Nismo (for Nissan Motorsports).
 A six-speed manual transmission comes on all models except the base XE, and a five-speed automatic is optional. The four-wheel-drive system, like the Tacoma's, has a low range but cannot be used all the time.
 Unlike the Tacoma, the Frontier does not offer a regular two-door cab; nor does it come with a six-foot bed. Its King Cab has rear-hinged back doors with folding jump seats that are terribly uncomfortable, but at least they fold up neatly out of the way.
 The four-door Crew Cab seats three in the rear fairly comfortably, though the seatback is too upright. The bottom cushion folds up against the back wall, providing excellent access to the floor for cargo storage. The seatback also folds down, offering access to a storage compartment. There are also two neat compartments, covered with mesh to hold items in place, under the seat.
 The Frontier offers all the safety equipment one expects in upscale passenger cars, either as standard or optional items: antilock brakes, dual-stage front air bags, side bags for the front occupants and roof-mounted curtain bags for side and rollover protection. The four-door Frontier received the highest five-star rating for side impacts in the government's recent crash tests, but only four stars for front impacts.
 Like the Tacoma, the Frontier offers an electronic stability control.
 Nissan provides only one size of cargo bed, a nominal five-footer. It has a sprayed-on bed liner with channels in the bed and adjustable cleats for tying down cargo.
 The Frontier I tested, an XE King Cab 4x4, was a preproduction model, so it had no price sticker. But a Crew Cab equipped like the tested Tacoma would have been $27,980, slightly less than the Toyota. Prices range from about $16,000 to just over $30,000. 
 Right away, I could tell that the Frontier is the most powerful truck in the class -- outpacing even the Dodge V-8's. With the slick-shifting automatic, acceleration was impressive, yet easily controlled by the electronic ''drive by wire'' throttle. There is a lot of engine noise with the throttle wide open.
 The Nissan's economy ratings are about average for the class; both Nissan and Toyota recommend premium fuel, but it is not essential. My average mileage, in mixed town and highway driving, was 16.7 m.p.g.
 The test truck had a jittery ride on most roads, partly because of its off-road equipment. But I liked its on-road handling, especially the superior straight-line tracking.
 Space in the cabin certainly felt generous, in sharp contrast to the old Frontier. The seats were generally comfortable, though with too much thigh support for my taste.
 The instrument panel was nicely trimmed with good-quality materials and narrow gaps between panels. Storage is ample.
 The gauges were all easily readable, including (notably) a voltmeter and an oil pressure gauge. A tiny trip computer is packaged with the trip odometer, operated by a slim stalk behind the steering wheel. Groping for it, I inevitably brushed the adjoining stalk and switched on the wipers. 
 If the new Tacoma is a big improvement over its predecessor, the Frontier is a giant leap ahead. Its best features are its powerful engine and responsive powertrain. Its ride and handling are fully competitive. Its cabin is roomy and comfortable, and its folding rear seat is clearly superior to the Tacoma's. The cargo bed's versatility adds to the appeal. Indeed, I would give the Nissan a slight edge over the Toyota.
 Last year, I concluded a review by saying G.M.'s Colorado and Canyon were ''the new leaders -- for now -- of the midsize pickup pack.'' Well, things have already changed. The Tacoma and Frontier have stepped ahead of the G.M. twins, which also have new competition from Dodge and Honda. 
 With all these trucks vying for attention, one question remains: What happened to the year of the car?
