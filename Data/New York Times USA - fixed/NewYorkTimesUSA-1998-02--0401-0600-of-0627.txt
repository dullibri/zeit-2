HEADLINE: 4th-Quarter Net Soared 52% at Dell Computer

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation reported quarterly earnings yesterday that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates, as the company's strategy of selling computers directly to consumers continued to fuel torrid growth.
Revenue at Dell rose for a 16th consecutive quarter, even as competitors started to emulate its build-to-order strategy. Though both the Compaq Computer Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company have adopted portions of Dell Computer's business model, their efforts have had little impact on Dell. 
 By selling its machines direct to customers, with no dealers or distributors as middlemen, Dell is able to minimize inventory and maximize return on capital. Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard still sell primarily through dealers, but have made steps to reduce inventories by building only machines for which they have orders.
Dell announced its results after the market closed. Shares of Dell closed at $113.1875, up $1.875, a new high, in Nasdaq trading. Dell also announced today that its board has declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 1, Dell reported earnings of $285 million, or 81 cents a diluted share, up 52 percent from $188 million, or 50 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 55 percent, to $3.74 billion, from $2.41 billion in the fourth quarter of the 1997 fiscal year.
"They had astonishing revenue growth," said Charles Wolf, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "They obviously were not affected by any competitive strategies of Compaq or Hewlett-Packard. It's proving more of a challenge to implement a build-to-order model than these guys have thought."
Dell said it saw strong revenue gains in the United States, Latin America and Europe. Despite the economic crisis in Asia, Dell said it achieved profitable fourth-quarter results in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes Japan. Revenues in that region exceeded $240 million, a 79 percent increase from a year earlier, the company said.
Michael S. Dell, the chairman and chief executive of Dell Computer, said that the company's outlook for 1998 was positive. He cited pending transitions to new computer chips and reductions in the costs of other components as factors that could continue to drive demand for new machines.
Also, the Microsoft Corporation plans to introduce the updated version of its personal computer operating system, Windows 98, this year.
Dell's direct model allows the company to rapidly pass on lower costs for components like memory chips or disk drives, giving it a further competitive advantage when technology changes.
For the year, Dell had earnings of $944 million, or $2.56 a diluted share, up 82 percent from $518 million, or $1.32 a diluted share, in the 1997 year. Revenue grew 59 percent, to $12.33 billion, from $7.76 billion in the previous year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Climbs by 52.56 to Reach Its 6th Consecutive High

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The indefatigable Dow Jones industrial average rose to another record yesterday, as investors shrugged off the conflict with Iraq and Asian economic concerns and took heart from technology earnings.
The industrials gained 52.56 to close at 8,451.06, their sixth consecutive high, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.30 points to end at 1,032.06, also a high. While much of this week's rally can be traced to merger frenzy among stocks as varied at Beneficial and, one stock has been particularly active despite no real news: Nike. 
 For Nike investors, the recent run-up amounts to deja vu.
In the last two days, Nike's stock has risen 9 percent, mostly on market rumors that Warren E. Buffett is adding to his 2 percent stake in the company. Of course, Mr. Buffett, one of the country's leading value investors; his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, and Nike, the maker of athletic apparel and footwear, are not talking.
Much the same thing happened last May. Unconfirmed Buffett-buying rumors lifted Nike's shares 6.4 percent on May 28. But the stock dropped with a thud -- losing more than 13 percent of its value -- the next day when the company warned that earnings for the quarter about to end would fall short of Wall Street estimates.
Wall Street stock analysts are not ruling out a repeat performance in coming days.
Nike's stock rose $3.50 on Tuesday, with 6.5 million shares traded. It opened sharply higher yesterday, but ended the day with a gain of only 25 cents, on slightly less volume, to close at 44 5/8.
While the stock may be cheap by some measures -- it's a far cry from its high of $75.75 reached a year ago -- many analysts warn that sales growth is slowing in the United States and Asia and that inventory is swelling, which means Nike's situation could worsen before it improves.
The company is even considering ways to cut costs, which could include layoffs and reduced spending on advertising and promotions.
For Nike, "I don't see any positive things in the near term," said Maureen Carini, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor's. "In the next six to 12 months, it's not something that earnings-wise is going to take off."
A pickup in sales of "brown shoes," or rugged outdoor styles, as well as increased competition from other manufacturers, like Adidas, has cut into Nike's business. But the most pressing concern is the slowdown in Asia, which represented about 13 percent of fiscal year 1997 sales.
Dwindling demand for Nike's athletic shoes, particularly its higher priced basketball shoes, has led to an inventory buildup, Ms. Carini said. New shoe styles, which could reinvigorate sales, are not expected before early next year, she added.
The company is expected to clear up the domestic inventory buildup without much trouble, using discounted prices and discount outlets. But the excess in Japan, where a buildup is just beginning to appear, will be much more difficult to move.
"Japan doesn't have a factory outlet distribution system, so that presents more challenges for us," said Rick Anguilla, Nike's director of investor relations, who conceded that the company was caught off guard by the weakened Asia sales.
The smaller shoe sizes in Japan make it difficult to distribute the shoes elsewhere, said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter based in Glen Mills, Pa. "Japan is going to be a a serious problem," he said, because it is not clear how big the inventory pileup will be or when demand will return. Japan accounted for about 7 percent of sales last year but was expected to grow rapidly. Nike has already taken a hit. In its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30, Nike earned 48 cents a share, below both the 55 cents forecast and the 60 cents recorded in the period a year earlier. Since then, analysts have lowered their estimates, to $2.02 for fiscal year 1998, from the $2.60 previously forecast, and from the $2.68 earned last year.
Nike itself has said in recent weeks that it is "looking at its cost structure based on our outlook for the business," which some analysts take to suggest that a restructuring is imminent.
"Here is a company that was expecting dramatic growth from Asia, and now Asia is shrinking," said Shellly Hale Young, a stock analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. Asian sales could be flat, she said, instead of 30 percent higher as previously projected. To cut costs, the company may be forced to restructure, cutting staff as well as advertising and promotional spending, she said.
Nike, which has enjoyed 40 percent sales growth the last three years, must adjust to a slower rate of growth, said Ms. Young, who expects the company to earn about $1.50 a share annually for the next few years. She says the stock should trade at about 25 times its earnings for the coming year. That would put it at about $37 a share.
"Right now the fundamentals of the company are deteriorating," she said. "Until the fundamentals stabilize, I would not be putting money into Nike stock based on a rumor."
Elsewhere in the market yesterday, technology stocks led a modest surge. The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.30 points, to 1,715.73, rebounding from a selloff the previous day.
Dell Computer reported fourth-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations as revenues rose for the 16th consecutive quarter on strong gains in the United States, Europe and Latin America.
Hewlett-Packard's stock also rose, as investors barely penalized the stock for logging flat fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday that fell slightly below some analysts' forecasts.

HEADLINE: Suharto's Choice as No. 2: Whiz or Loose Cannon?

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 18

 BODY:
He has designed submarines and railway carriages. He believes that economic growth can be engineered by rapidly bouncing interest rates up and down. He likes to refer to his boss, President Suharto, as S.G.S., for Super Genius Suharto.
B. J. Habibie, 61, who is now almost certain to become Vice President next month -- and the potential successor to the 76-year-old President -- is viewed by many here and abroad as Indonesia's loose cannon. A technological whiz, political naif and economic eccentric, he has struck fear into the hearts of international investors. 
 Today, the influential military fell into line behind him as Mr. Suharto's evident choice for the post, after his nomination by all three political parties, despite longstanding antagonism toward him within the armed forces.
Though Mr. Habibie is set to become the constitutional successor to Mr. Suharto, he does not have a strong power base beyond the President himself, and political analysts have raised questions about his ability to hold on to power on his own.
One scenario being discussed here is the possibility that if Mr. Suharto dies or is incapacitated, an electoral assembly would convene to hammer out a succession. There are also suggestions that Mr. Suharto might at some point name another person as his chosen successor.
But there is also a common view that the President has no intention of dying or leaving office before his term is up in 2001 and that the question of succession that obsesses Indonesians is not foremost on his mind.
The nomination appears to reflect the President's stubborn insistence that it is he -- and not the financial markets -- who makes the decisions in Indonesia. It comes at a time when Mr. Suharto is pushing ahead with plans for a fixed currency-exchange rate, over the objections of the International Monetary Fund and the United States.
When Mr. Habibie's name was first floated for Vice President a month ago, investors panicked and the value of the currency, the rupiah, fell 35 percent in one week.
The monetary fund showed its concern when its first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, described Mr. Habibie as a man "whose devotion to new ways of doing things is limited."
Many Indonesians also view his ascendancy with alarm. "My own view is that it would be a tragic mistake for him to become Vice President," a political analyst said. He is undeniably brilliant, but impractical, the analyst said.
An American businessman who has dealt with him said: "Habibie is amazing. The guy thinks and talks a mile a minute, and he is quite impressive." But the businessman added, "He loves grand projects that make people feel better but cost a lot of money, and this is a country that can't afford to waste money."
When the monetary fund pressed Mr. Suharto to sign an austerity package last month, one of the wasteful programs it insisted on scrapping was Mr. Habibie's money-losing $2 billion project to build a national aircraft.
Mr. Habibie tends to dismiss his critics as uninformed. "They don't understand," he once said, "and I don't have time to explain what I'm doing to everyone."
Mr. Habibie is known here as "the busiest man in Indonesia" for his energy and his many projects, and political analysts expect him to have a greater impact on the running of the nation than the current Vice President, a low-key former general named Try Sutrisno.
The five-year terms of Mr. Suharto and Mr. Try end next month. Mr. Suharto, who has been in office for 32 years, has said he plans to stay on for a seventh term, which would end when he is 81 years old.
Mr. Habibie's chief asset appears to be his closeness to the President, with whom, by many reports, he shares an almost giddy relationship, demonstrating computer tricks to him and bursting into his office unannounced for long personal discussions.
Their relationship goes back 48 years, to the time when Mr. Suharto was a military commander and virtually adopted the 13-year-old boy when his father died.
Since then, Mr. Habibie has received a doctorate in engineering in Germany, worked for 18 years for a German aircraft manufacturer and joined Mr. Suharto's Government as a personal adviser and then Minister of Research and Technology, his current post.
In this position, he has devoted his energies to what many analysts see as unrealistic projects like the development of a national aircraft, promotion of nuclear power and the purchase for $13 million of used East German warships that were in need of $1 billion in repairs.

HEADLINE: Auto Makers to Buy More From Minority-Owned Companies

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has reached an agreement with the Big Three auto makers to increase their purchases from minority-owned companies by nearly $3 billion by the year 2001, officials from the Administration and the auto makers said today.
According to these officials, representatives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler will sign an agreement on Thursday committing the auto makers to increase purchases from minority contractors to 5 percent of total procurement from the current 4.2 percent. The amount of contracts is to increase incrementally over three years starting this year. 
 The program, which will increase the amount of contracts from the Big Three auto makers to minority companies to $8.8 billion a year from the current $5.9 billion, comes as programs extending breaks to minorities and women or setting aside contracts for their companies are increasingly coming under attack.
Two years ago, voters in California approved a ballot initiative that forbade granting "preferences" based on race or gender in admission to state colleges and universities, hiring by state agencies and contracting by state departments. A similar referendum will be voted on in Washington State this year.
In addition, court challenges against Federal contracting programs that give preferences to minority-owned companies have been filed -- and in some cases won -- in Federal courts.
In the face of this mood, however, the Clinton Administration is seeking to have three of the country's largest corporations enlarge their affirmative action contracting programs.
Among those affirmative action programs that have been successfully challenged in the courts are those in Richmond, Va., and one run by the Federal Department of Transportation that set specific goals for contracts to go to minorities. But one executive said he did not think this new initiative would be overturned.
"Those were government programs," said this executive, who spoke only on condition that neither he nor his company be identified. "We are private sector and we can do business with whom we want."
The three-year pilot program is scheduled to be announced on Thursday. It is being touted as part of President Clinton's Initiative on Race, though discussions between the auto makers and the Small Business Administration on increasing minority contracting first started three years ago.
In a statement that is to be delivered on Thursday, Judith A. Winston, the executive director of the President's Initiative on Race, said the companies are recognizing "the economic value of reducing the opportunity gap between minority- and majority-owned businesses." The program being announced on Thursday is an expansion of current efforts. Federal law requires that auto makers that sell vehicles to the Government have a program to insure that minority-owned companies are used as suppliers. Each year, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler submit plans to the Small Business Administration outlining their goals for procurement from minority companies.
In recent years, however, the number of minority companies winning contracts from the Big Three auto-makers has been falling because the auto companies have increasingly used what is called "system sourcing," buying whole units, such as an instrument panel from a supplier, rather than individual parts like speedometers or tachometers.
Often minority-owned companies are too small to compete in this kind of business environment.
Under the agreement that will be signed on Thursday, the auto makers want the Federal Government to give them credit for getting prime contractors to buy parts and services from minority subcontractors. The agreement also, for the first time, would let the auto makers count contracts they award to publicly traded companies as long as a member of a minority holds at least 10 percent of the stock and controls the operations of the company. Federal regulations now say that a member of a minority must own 51 percent of the company in order for it to qualify as a minority-owned.
The agreement calls for the auto makers to send at least 10 executives of minority-owned companies to business schools and provide technical assistance to Small Business Administration programs for small, minority-owned businesses.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE BROADWAY -- A special report.;
Gambling on a Trip From 'Ragtime' to Riches

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Garth H. Drabinsky likes to visit the theater he just finished building in Manhattan and watch the crowds stream in to see the musical he just finished producing.
"I stand in the lobby, and I try to look nondescript," he said in a recent interview. "I'm wearing just a sweater and a pair of cords. And so many people have walked over and said, 'Thank you for this gift.' The theater and the show, they call it a gift." 
 Mr. Drabinsky is the president of Livent Inc., the Toronto-based entertainment company. The theater is the opulent Ford Center for the Performing Arts, and the musical is, of course, "Ragtime." And if Mr. Drabinsky's picture of himself is perhaps self-consciously humble, it's a bit incomplete. For the accomplished theater producer is also a high-rolling entrepreneur. And in presenting his new show in his brand-new theater, he is himself the star of a high-stakes epic going on in the wings.
Much of Livent's future depends on "Ragtime," a show he first presented in Toronto 15 months ago and that has cost upward of $12 million to put on in New York. The show represents a bold foray into the relatively new world of corporate theater financing, and it comes with considerable risk.
Should "Ragtime" not become a mega-hit, selling out the house for months, if not years, to come, then the growth of Mr. Drabinsky's highly leveraged, expanding theater empire could be imperiled.
Mr. Drabinsky and Livent are part of what is beginning to look like a corporate takeover of Broadway that is tearing down the old order. The Disney Company, with its productions of "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King" is, of course, a highly visible part of the theater landscape. And less well-known partnerships and joint ventures, like Dodger Endemol Theatricals and Jujamcyn-Pace are also helping to transform the anachronistic live theater business with the resources of contemporary corporations. Still, Livent (pronounced LYE-vent), which operates without partners, remains the world's only publicly held company whose main business is live theater production. If its shows falter, its safety net is small.
Now nine years old, Livent has systematically broadened its range of productions. By now it has presented musicals it has acquired ("Phantom of the Opera," "Kiss of the Spider Woman," "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"); it has produced revivals on its own ("Show Boat," "Candide"), and it has made one successful venture into original drama ("Barrymore").
But before "Ragtime," it had not entered the notoriously high-risk arena of original musical production, and that is where the company has staked its future: it has four more new musicals in development. And with "Ragtime," it has leaped in without a shred of wariness. A second production has been running in Los Angeles since last May, will move on to Vancouver in the spring and then open this fall in a theater Mr. Drabinsky is building in Chicago. A third is to open in April in Washington, then tour nationally. A fourth is to open in Sydney, Australia, next year.
To do all this, Livent has borrowed heavily, which means that the success of "Ragtime" will be measured by extraordinary standards. It will not be enough if the show draws an audience simply to pay for itself and turn a profit. Rather, Livent is counting on the New York production to propel the others, and thus to create a "Ragtime" revenue stream to help the company retire its debt and finance future projects.
"Historically, Livent has put on far more restorations of previously mounted shows than newly originated ones, and new productions entail far higher financial risk," said Edward Lawrence, an entertainment industry analyst with Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency that last fall gave Livent a double B-minus rating, warning investors that as a bond issuer, the company is a risk. In the near future, the agency concluded, the overall outlook for the company is negative.
"Over the next three years there are aspects of the company that could lead to its deterioration," Mr. Lawrence said.
 
Financing
Little Trouble Winning Backers
Mr. Drabinsky's vision is essentially to spurn the long-standing and increasingly enervated methods of financing and producing new shows and to bring sharp-elbowed corporate business practice to an arena where it is more or less untried. What makes the offstage drama particularly interesting is that so far, he has had little trouble winning financial backers.
In the fall, when the company wanted to restructure its debt and floated a $125 million bond offering, it was oversubscribed, despite the Standard & Poor's assessment and an equally ominous one from Moody's, which considered it a high risk. Despite a lagging stock price -- it closed at $8.81 yesterday -- equity analysts have been generally bullish, with Paul Marsh of Cowen & Company recently predicting that shares could rise to $18 by the end of the year.
"What 'Ragtime' means is many things," said Roy Furman, vice chairman of Furman Selz, an underwriter of the bond offering. "First it will be a validation of Garth's uncommon producing style, his unusual taste and vision. Second, it will be a validation of him as an individual, that he was able to build this theater at the same time he's doing the show; that would have drained anybody. And financially it's immense. It's going to be a gold mine."
Mr. Drabinsky has thus far kept all his promises. Last winter, when he announced that he would open the Ford Center by the end of 1997 -- and thus qualify for several million dollars in tax abatements -- there were many skeptics.
The chosen site, owned by the State of New York, a midblock span on West 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues where the Lyric and Apollo Theaters stood, was presumed unsuitable, too small for his plan of a grandly appointed 1,800-seat house. (The only Broadway theater larger is the 1,900-seat Gershwin, less of a theater than a canyon.) He had not given himself enough time or, at $30 million, allotted enough money. But as with many things, Mr. Drabinsky, who is 48, felt differently.
On Dec. 26, the Ford Center opened its doors for the first preview of "Ragtime," which Mr. Drabinsky brought to New York with equal bravado, having spent more than $2 million to advertise it.
 
The Man's Image
Beyond the Big Talk, Attention to Details
This is Mr. Drabinsky's style, big-talking, grandiose, even hubristic. He protests such characterizations, however, preferring to emphasize the personal aspects of theater producing. "At the root of everything is my interest in maintaining harmony in the collaborative process," he said.
But comments about his larger-than-lifeness are hard to avoid, invoked even by those whose loyalty and admiration he has won. He is willing, even eager, to lavish money and braggadocio on projects he deems worthy; his "Show Boat," at upward of $10 million, not including the advertising costs, was almost certainly the most expensive Broadway revival. (It recouped its cost and has toured with three companies.) And his attention to the details of his productions -- he spent a recent day in Chicago overseeing auditions for ensemble roles in the planned production of "Ragtime" there -- is disputed by no one.
Nor is the ambition he has for his business. In less than a decade, Livent has grown from a base of one theater and one show to an expanding empire that by the end of next year will own or operate six theaters; it has already begun a total of 15 productions, 8 of which are active in theaters across the United States and Canada. Five musicals, including one revival, "Pal Joey," are to open between now and the year 2000. The term one hears applied to him, over and over, is "impresario."
"I think there must have been more people like Garth years ago, more impresarios," said E. L. Doctorow, author of the novel "Ragtime," from which the show was adapted. "He certainly defines the term, the ability to organize a series of ambitions and make them come out the way he planned. The bluster is there, no question, but basically, at a very early point I had no doubt that he would do everything he said he would. He promised me there would be no stinting about what he put into the show, and he kept his promise."
Still, as Mr. Drabinsky continues to keep his promises, the questions about how he does it continue to follow him, largely because of his well-established iconoclasm. A large man, shaggy-haired, a little jowly, he walks with a pronounced limp from a boyhood bout with polio that left him, he wrote in his 1994 autobiography, "Closer to the Sun," "with a hunger for life that has never left me." He was a virtual unknown on Broadway when his first New York show, "Kiss of the Spider Woman," won a Tony Award for best musical in 1993.
But he began raising eyebrows in the theater world, and questions about his financial acumen, when he stubbornly kept the show running for months after it began losing money. This was the start of what some Broadway veterans think of as Livent's financial game-playing. They wonder, for instance, why it doesn't include advertising costs when it tallies the cost of a show, as every other producer does. ("Ragtime" is routinely referred to as having cost a mere $10 million.) They wonder about how the company reports its ticket receipts. Livent reported that on the day after "Ragtime" opened in New York, for example, it sold $2.3 million worth of tickets, a huge figure rivaling the $2.7 million achieved in November by Disney's "Lion King."
 
Livent's Method
Delaying Accounting Of What Is Spent
 But Livent's figure, unlike Disney's, included group sales as well as single-ticket buyers; it is single-ticket sales that are generally regarded as the measuring stick of public interest (the actual first-day single-ticket sales figure for "Ragtime" was $964,000, which is high, just not that high). And they wonder about the justification of not including a show's preproduction costs on Livent's profit and loss statements until a show opens. Although it is a legitimate accounting method, they say it sends a cloudy signal about the company's finances.
On Livent's books, the costs of any show are amortized for up to five years after opening night, as long as it continues to run. In other words, there is a presumption, financially speaking, that a show will run for five years. This is actually an incentive to keep a money-losing show, like "Kiss of the Spider Woman," running, because once it closes, all remaining costs must be accounted for. Nearly $100 million that Livent has already spent on productions has not yet appeared on its balance sheets, including the $10 million it cost to develop "Ragtime."
This is a significant number for the following reason. In 1996, the last year for which audited figures are available, the company reported net income of about $8.2 million (11 million Canadian dollars). Even assuming that Livent doubled that last year, it has spent far more than it brought in. Though in corporate terms this is not unusual, particularly for young, expanding companies, in theatrical terms it is unheard of.
This is a subject that infuriates Mr. Drabinsky, who vigorously rebuts that Livent is known for aggressive accounting, arguing that the company is, in fact, conservative. The law allows it to amortize preproduction costs over 5 to 10 years, he said; they presume the strictest approach.
"This is clearly a proper accounting policy," he said. "We're not even talking about legitimacy. Accounting is matching revenue and costs on a proper basis. We're very comfortable with our accounting. We know the company continues to grow in cash flow areas and revenue, and our asset strength is significantly enhanced over where it was last year."
In other words, Mr. Drabinsky's argument is that because the company is growing, its revenue is increasing fast enough to cover these expenditures on the amortized schedule. Mr. Drabinsky, who takes a $1.5 million annual salary, will not divulge his private expectations of how long "Ragtime" will run, but the optimism is in the accounting. His assumption is that "Ragtime" and Livent's forthcoming shows will be successful; this is the hubristic gamble, and it has traditional theater producers and investors scratching their heads, particularly if they are aware of Mr. Drabinsky's history.
In Mr. Drabinsky's previous show business incarnation, he founded Cineplex Odeon, the movie theater chain, beginning with an 18-theater multiplex in Toronto in 1979 and building it into an 1,800-screen empire throughout the United States and Canada. But the rapid expansion, financed with long-term borrowing, brought the company perilously close to bankruptcy; in 1986, he took on a partner, MCA, which resisted his expand-on-debt philosophy. After a fierce battle it ousted him in 1989.
Some questions during litigation in the dispute are similar to those raised now. One concerned a Cineplex Odeon net income report that some analysts viewed as misleadingly positive; another, the company's practice of writing off capital improvements in its theaters over a period that some analysts considered too long.
Mr. Drabinsky left Cineplex Odeon in possession of the company's live entertainment division, consisting of one theater, the Pantages, in Toronto, which he had renovated in spectacular style, and the rights to present one production in it, "The Phantom of the Opera." That was the foundation of Livent, which he and his partner, Myron Gottlieb, took public in 1993. Like Cineplex Odeon, it is also pursuing aggressive expansion on the strength of borrowed money.
Last fall's bond offering left the company with $216.3 million of total indebtedness and $141 million of shareholders' equity. In other words, about 60 percent of the company's worth is borrowed. That is high even for a young company, though not necessarily threatening.
"He honestly believes he was something of a victim at Cineplex Odeon, and he has a huge drive to prove that the mistakes there were not his fault," said Christopher Dixon, an entertainment analyst at Paine Webber who says he thinks Livent's future is bright. "He learned a great deal from that, and he has been using those lessons to prove to the investment community and the entertainment community that they shouldn't have counted him out."
On Broadway, Mr. Drabinsky has operated almost entirely outside the hoary tradition of theatrical producers, refusing, for example, to join the League of American Theaters and Producers, which, among other things, negotiates contracts with theater unions, including Actors' Equity. Livent negotiates its own contracts, and Mr. Drabinsky has angered his fellow producers by lavishing high salaries on actors that they must struggle to match.
 
Setting Standards
A Series of Firsts, Like the $75 Seat
It's a measure of his influence on Broadway that his "Show Boat" was the first to charge $75 for a regular orchestra seat. Much grumbling ensued, but most other musicals eventually followed suit. ("Phantom of the Opera" -- on Broadway, not a Livent show -- has jumped to $80.)
Livent might also be said to have opened Broadway's gates to big business. Long guarded by individual producers who enjoyed power over individual shows and by the theater-owning groups led by the Shubert Organization, which controlled many of those producers and shows through real estate, the theater business had its own arcane and anachronistic system for decades. But Livent -- which arrived on Broadway a year before Disney, in 1993 -- and Disney built theaters of their own. And other theater groups have formed joint enterprises so they can pump more resources into productions.
"I pretty much like Garth," said Michael David, whose company, Dodger Productions, has produced many hit musicals on its own, including "Guys and Dolls" and the King and I." In reaction to competition from Livent and Disney, it recently formed a partnership with a Dutch company, Endemol Entertainment, to produce, among other things, "Titanic" and the upcoming "High Society." "But he's an easy target for people. No question."
Mr. Drabinsky's stated goal, to create a theater company based on the model of the old movie studios, where he would control production, distribution and presentation, is clearly in opposition to the theater's current system, in which producers raise money for individual shows and negotiate with theater owners to have them presented.
And because Livent is publicly held, none of its shows, individually, is accountable to investors; rather, the company has to perform well enough overall to persuade investment banks to lend it money and to safeguard the investment of s stockholders. It shares this advantage with Disney; the difference, of course, is that because of Disney's other profitable interests, it could lose everything it has invested in its two shows, "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Lion King" and barely feel it.
Bankers -- enough of them, anyway -- have bought into Mr. Drabinsky's vision. This is partly, they say, because his previous shows have given them faith in "Ragtime" and Livent's future products and partly because Livent has established concrete assets; in addition to the Ford Center in New York, Livent owns big musical houses in Toronto and Vancouver and is building another one in Chicago and a second, smaller house in Toronto.
"If 'Ragtime' works, with two or three companies generating a stable cash flow that buys them time to develop new work, it's great," said Mr. Dixon of Paine Webber. "If it doesn't, they get revenues out of the theaters."
In any case, no other producers have such a network, and of the major theater-owning groups only Jujamcyn Theaters is as active in development of new work. But unlike Livent, Jujamcyn tends to do so in partnerships with other producers, like Pace Theatricals, the country's largest touring-show presenter. Livent also casts its shows, markets them, builds the scenery and creates the costumes in house. Only Disney, which also declined to join the league, also does all this.
Operating on that scale requires substantial cash flow, and the economics remain murky to Mr. Drabinsky's fellow producers.
"What's always been a great difficulty is figuring out how he's doing it financially," said Paul Libin, producing director of Jujamcyn Theaters. "He's got a lot of people envious of him. A guy borrows $125 million in our business? That's unbelievable."
For his part, Mr. Drabinsky is tired of hearing accusations that he is ego-driven, operating on a financial high wire, interested only in grandiose productions.
He points to "Barrymore," a Livent production of Christopher Plummer's one-man show, and "Parade," a modest-size musical that Livent will open in the fall at the Geary Theater in San Francisco, as evidence that his interest is in producing shows "according to the size the show demands."
"This is not a company that can afford to be, ever, irresponsible about how it approaches its expenditures," Mr. Drabinsky said. "Why are we producing in Canada? It's a dollar that's 45 percent cheaper than an American dollar. It's one advantage we have."
 
'Ragtime'
The Measure Of Success
Which brings the story back to "Ragtime." With all of the advertising, all of the attendant hoopla, Mr. Drabinsky more or less promised his investors that "Ragtime" would be a hit in New York. Is it? By many standard measures, yes. "Ragtime" opened previews with advance ticket sales of $15.2 million -- more than four months' worth of full houses -- and in the week after its opening on Jan. 18 sold $4.3 million worth of tickets. Both figures are extraordinary.
Yet since the opening, the price of Livent stock, which jumped more than 16 percent, from $8.62 to $10 a share between the start of previews and the official opening, has fallen back to $8.81. Why should this be? For one thing, the reviews were unusually split. Many critics and other media figures (notably Rosie O'Donnell, on her television talk show) waxed ecstatic. But several reviewers, including Ben Brantley and Vincent Canby of The New York Times, registered sober disappointment. Naggingly, "Ragtime" has not lived up to box office expectations during its Los Angeles run.
Wall Street has noticed it all. The question about "Ragtime" is not whether it will be a hit but whether it will be a gigantic enough hit. On Broadway the show can earn $800,000 to $900,000 in revenues each week, provided it nearly sells out, but that is never a guarantee. For the first two weeks after opening, 10 percent of the available seats were empty, an ominous sign, with net receipts reported at just over $800,000 a week.
Mr. Drabinsky will not divulge his operating costs, but a fair approximation for a show its size is about $500,000 a week. There are many variables, and he declined to discuss the show's budget, but by ordinary Broadway reckoning, it would take about 40 weeks -- at $800,000 in weekly revenue -- to return the $12 million, including advertising, that it cost to put on the show.
By that time, two more "Ragtime" productions will be up and running, adding to Livent's revenue stream; the cost of each of those productions, Mr. Drabinsky said, will be $8 million, and they will have to sell enough tickets to pay for themselves before turning a profit.
But as the acknowledged chief revenue producer for the company (Livent's other shows, obviously, can aid the cause) it has much else to support, namely debt service and the costs of developing new shows.
Potentially, the four productions of "Ragtime" could bring Livent $4 million to $5 million a week in revenue, more than $1 million in profit. But in the theater business, who knows? "No assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully evaluate the commercial potential of a theatrical production," the prospectus for last fall's bond offering warned, "and the failure to do so could have a material adverse affect on the company's financial condition or results of operations."

Stocks Keep Climbing, Paced by Nike Shares
Stock prices rose again, sending the Dow industrials to their sixth consecutive record. While strong earnings at technology companies have supported the rally, merger activity -- and speculation about possible deals -- has also helped.
The most intriguing of the talk has centered on Nike, whose stock has risen 9 percent in two days amid market rumors that the investor Warren E. Buffett is adding to his 2 percent stake in the company. Page D9. 

While Mr. Buffett has been mum on his reported interest in Nike, he has acknowledged an interest in silver. But since the disclosure two weeks ago that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had been buying huge amounts of silver, the price, which first rose sharply, has receded. So what is the world's foremost precious commodity? Gold, which has been losing luster? Silver? Air Jordans? Market Place. D10.
 
Treasury Prices Slip a Bit
Treasury securities ended lower despite a report showing that producer prices fell in January, as investors worried that another report, showing a robust housing market, suggested that inflation may not have been banished permanently. The 30-year bond's yield rose to 5.83 percent from 5.79. D9.
 
Evidence Seized in Columbia Case
In the first seizure of evidence from the company since July, Federal law enforcement officials served a new search warrant at Columbia/HCA Healthcare's corporate offices in El Paso, participants in the case said. Federal agents obtained a computer hard drive; it was not immediately clear what was on the drive. D2.
 
No Deal for Christie's
Christie's, the London-based auction house, announced that talks with a consortium led by SBC Warburg Dillon Read about a possible takeover had ended. Christie's put itself on the auction block in December. Talk of a possible deal had been sending Christie's stock sharply higher in recent days. E1.
 
Lucent Plans Stock Split
Lucent Technologies, whose shares have more than tripled since its spinoff from AT&T, said that it would split its stock 2 for 1, lifting the shares again. Lucent also formed a $100 million venture capital fund to invest in wireless, semiconductor and software technologies. D6.
 
Indonesia's Enigmatic No. 2
B.J. Habibie, the potential successor to President Suharto of Indonesia, is considered a technological whiz but an economic eccentric, and his views on how to engineer a rebound in the country have struck fear into the hearts of international investors. A3.
 
Computer Publisher Plans Offering
Ziff-Davis, the computer magazine publisher, expects to raise $460 million through an initial public offering of stock in the United States, Ziff's Japanese parent said. D2.
 
Goldman Seeks an Image Change
Goldman, Sachs, which caters largely to big corporations and rich investors, has hired the same ad agency that does work for Burger King, Compaq and U.P.S. to conduct research on its public image. The move could lead to a multimillion-dollar campaign to raise Goldman's profile among working stiffs and the merely well-to-do, markets that the firm is finding harder to ignore. Advertising. D8.

HEADLINE: Arrest Is Made in the Killing Of a South Amboy Schoolgirl

 BODY:
A man described by the police as a transient was arrested last night in the bludgeoning death of a 15-year-old New Jersey schoolgirl.
Acting on a phone tip, investigators took the man, Thomahl S. Cook, 24, into custody Monday evening on an outstanding trespassing warrant. After two days of interrogation, Mr. Cook, whose last known address was a rooming house in Somerville, N.J., provided some details of the murder, the police said. 
 The schoolgirl, Katrina Suhan, a freshman at South Amboy High School, was found on Sunday evening in a ravine near a wooded area in Old Bridge, N.J., about 3 miles from her home in South Amboy. She had disappeared early Saturday morning while walking home from a roller rink.
At a news conference last night, the Middlesex County Prosecutor, Robert W. Gluck, said that Mr. Cook beat the teen-ager with a 2 by 4, rocks and his fists behind the Galaxy Diner along Route 9, where her body was found.
Mr. Gluck refused to say whether Mr. Cook had confessed to the murder.
According to investigators, Katrina was repeatedly struck in the head and face. Autopsy results showed that she had not been sexually assaulted, but Mr. Gluck said that she may have been fighting off a sexual assault.
"With the bludgeoning, it's hard to determine which wounds may be defensive," Mr. Gluck said.
Mr. Cook has been charged with murder and will be arraigned sometime today at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick, said John T. O'Leary, the Mayor of South Amboy.
The authorities said that Mr. Cook was something of a fixture at the Rollermagic Rink. Though he was a man a little too old for the teenagers who spent their weekends at the rink, the authorities said, the youths were friendly with him. Katrina's friends told the police that she had at least an acquaintance with the unemployed laborer. And Mr. Gluck said that Mr. Cook was seen near the skating rink on Friday night.
Mr. Gluck said he could not provide a motive for the crime, or an explanation of how Mr. Cook carried the girl along Route 9, across the Garden State Parkway and into the grassy ravine three miles from the rink without the aid of a car and without being seen.
The authorities are not ruling out the possibility of an accomplice and are also awaiting the results of forensic tests that could place other people at the scene of the crime. Those results are expected in a few weeks.
Mayor O'Leary said that the tip that led to Mr. Cook's arrest was called to the Somerville police on Monday by someone who was familiar with Mr. Cook and his movements. That person's identity is unknown. Mr. Cook was taken on Monday evening to the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center in New Brunswick, where he is still being held.
"We are outraged that someone could come into our community and pluck a 15-year-old girl off the street and murder her," Mr. O'Leary said last night. "We're not accustomed to that, to living in fear, and I'm not entirely sure that we are ever going to get over this."
The arrest brought some sense of relief to local people who describe their community, located just south of Staten Island across the Raritan River, as a calm and uneventful place where people have come to live to escape big city crime, and the nagging fear that goes with it.
Still, one neighbor said, such horrors are probably never forgotten. "Nothing like this ever happens around here," said Stephen Sciallo, who lives in the same apartment complex as the Suhans. "Everybody is worried for their kids."

HEADLINE: Hot Issue in Northern New Mexico: Fine Print of an 1848 Treaty

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TRUCHAS, N. M.

 BODY:
In a roadside shop filled with weavings and Spanish religious art, tourists browsed unattended recently as the shopkeeper and his friends excitedly talked in a back room about an obscure historical document.
"It's our Bible," Luis H. Sandoval, a retired teacher, said as he thumbed through a copy of the peace treaty signed 150 years ago between Mexico and the United States. "One day, that treaty will allow us to get our land grants studied, to have justice served to our people." 
 On the national level, the Feb. 2 anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo passed virtually without notice. Although the treaty allowed the creation of the American Southwest, there were no commemorative stamps and few official speeches.
Facing the possibility of an attack on Iraq, few Americans looked backward to the nation's first war of territorial expansion. The treaty expanded American territory by one-third, adding all or parts of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
Official silence over the treaty anniversary stemmed in part from diplomatic reluctance to offend Mexico, which is now the United States's third-largest trading partner. Many Mexican-Americans in the United States quietly resent a document that cut their ancestral nation in half after the 18-month-long Mexican War.
But here, the 150-year-old treaty is as hot a topic as on Feb. 23, 1848, the day President James Knox Polk sent it to the Senate for ratification. People in this community and others across the region fervently support a Republican-sponsored bill to create a Presidential commission to review claims by thousands of old Hispanic families who say their lands were stolen by corrupt lawyers and local officials in violation of the 1848 treaty.
Adding urgency to action on the measure, the dry, pine-covered hills around here are seeing a low-level guerrilla warfare against the United States Forest Service, owner of much of the disputed land. In recent anonymous actions against the Forest Service, shots have been fired at workers, an office and a radio tower have been bombed and a government truck and barn have been burned.
On a peaceful level, music, dance, poetry, the unveiling of a mural and a series of educational seminars marking the treaty anniversary are to be capped this spring with the public display in Santa Fe, 40 miles south of here, of pages from the original treaty. In Albuquerque, Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, recently posed with beaming Hispanic leaders in front of poster-size replicas of treaty pages.
The treaty mania revolves around land, votes and regional identity. Hispanic residents hope to use the document to wrest from the Forest Service as much as 1.5 million acres that they say were granted to their ancestors, largely by Spain, in the 18th century.
Republicans hope to use the land- grant issue to break a half century of Democratic political control of Northern New Mexico. Already the bill, the Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Act of 1997, is creating strange political bedfellows. At the Gingrich news conference, Roberto Mondragon, a longtime Democrat and member of the state's Green Party, gave hearty abrazos to the Speaker and to the bill's sponsor, Representative Bill Redmond, this district's new Republican Congressmen.
"There is an old Spanish proverb: 'If you love me, show me you love me -- don't just tell me,' " Mr. Mondragon said.
Hispanic residents here argue that the treaty, with its clauses stipulating respect for Spanish and Mexican land grants, is a powerful legal lever for winning back lands usurped after the Civil War by "the Santa Fe Ring," a corrupt alliance of American lawyers, judges and territorial governors who manipulated a court system alien to Spanish-speaking farmers. Much of this land, after heavy use by timber and cattle companies, ended up in the hands of the Forest Service in the 1920's and 1930's.
"The United States Government likes to go by paper, crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's," said Mr. Sandoval, the retired teacher who is a grant claimant. "Well, let's honor the treaty."
He accused American surveyors of illegally lopping off about one-third of the 22,000 acres granted to Truchas families by Spain in 1754. The land is now part of a national forest, he said.
Here and across Northern New Mexico, Hispanic families are seeking return of the land for communal use by descendants of the settler families.
Descendants of Spanish colonists do not share the overall resentment of the treaty routinely expressed by Mexicans and Mexican-Americans.
In this region's four centuries of European settlement, Mexican rule was a brief interlude -- 25 years sandwiched between 223 years of Spanish rule and 152 years of American rule. Numbering in the hundreds of thousands, the clannish descendants of Spanish settlers seldom socialize with recent Mexican immigrants. In Santa Fe, Spain's red and gold colors are more commonly seen than Mexico's green, white and red bunting.
Although the region has some of the poorest counties in the United States, residents here seem content to be on the wealthy side of the border. Indeed, 150 years of American rule in the Southwest has brought such economic success that the Immigration and Naturalization Service now devotes half of its 12,400 agents to preventing illegal immigration from Mexico.
"People in Northern New Mexico are very patriotic Americans," said David Roybal, who organized seminars to educate people on the treaty. "When you find discontent with the treaty, it's when parts relating to the land grants were broken."
Although the Forest Service officially follows a policy of "co-managing" public lands with local Hispanic communities, many rural Hispanic residents say they increasingly feel harassed by Federal employees who demand permits and impose fines for hunting, fishing, swimming, grazing cattle and cutting timber.
"Before, the man in the green truck used to be from the community," David Cordova, a weaver here, said of Forest Service employees. "Now, it is someone who just transferred here from Seattle."
Judging by the dozens of land- grant leaders who carried petitions to Mr. Gingrich's news conference, the bill enjoys wide support. Under the bill, a five-member review commission would study land claims and then forward a report to the President and Congress with recommendations for action. The commission would be modeled after the Indian Land Claims Commission, which paid about $2 billion to Indians who said their lands had been seized in violation of treaties between tribes and the United States. The claimants were paid over a 30-year period ending in 1978.
"This is really an economic development issue," said Michael Quintana, an aide to Representative Redmond. "These people have remained in poverty because their land was taken away from them."
But some environmentalists see the revived land-grant movement as a threat to public lands. The American public would lose hiking, hunting and camping access to large areas, asserts Sam Hitt, president of Forest Guardians, an environmental group.
"A commission would be the first step on a slippery slope toward the privatization of a lot of Northern New Mexico," said Mr. Hitt, who is running in November for state land commissioner on the Green ticket.
At present, he said, American taxpayers subsidize National Forest lands, paying for maintenance of fences, hiking trails, camp sites and for management plans that limit grazing and logging. Hispanic communities would squeeze the most dollars out of their communal lands, leading to rapid degradation, he said.
"It's a sacred text around here," Mr. Hitt lamented of the treaty. "It's insignificant to most Americans. But, in Northern New Mexico, it's a daily topic of conversation."

HEADLINE: Former New York Official To Lead Philadelphia Police

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Reacting to criticism that Philadelphia's police force is ineffective, sometimes corrupt and in dire need of new blood, Mayor Edward G. Rendell reached outside the city today and hired a new police commissioner, John F. Timoney, former first deputy commissioner in New York.
Mr. Timoney, who was second in command on the New York force in 1995 and 1996 and helped carry out many of the street patrol programs and other efforts credited with sharply reducing that city's crime rates, will succeed Richard Neal. 
 Mr. Neal resigned last week to become a private security consultant after struggling for five years to improve the performance of a 7,000-officer force that has been troubled over the years by numerous accusations of brutality, graft and, particularly this year, ineptitude.
The latest accusations of ineptitude, still heard almost daily, stem from widespread dissatisfaction in the city with the police department's limited success in reducing crime rates, particularly the murder rate. Tha murder rate has been dropping sharply in most other major cities, especially New York, and Philadelphia compared unfavorably.
The accusations also come from Philadelphia residents who contend that the police department has been making only a half-hearted effort to rid the city of such everyday nuisances as panhandlers, graffiti and, more seriously, purse-snatchers and petty thieves.
So vocal and widespread has the complaining been that it was threatening to blemish the record of a Mayor whose administration has otherwise been mostly praised for good management of a major American city.
In announcing the appointment of Mr. Timoney to Philadelphia's top police job, which pays $113,000, Mayor Rendell called him "perhaps the best available candidate in the nation to lead the police department here and to reclaim the city's rightful reputation as the best police department in the nation."
"When you review Commissioner Timoney's record," the Mayor continued, "it is clear that he is well-versed in every aspect of police operations and, indeed, that he is a dynamic commander."
Accepting the appointment effective March 9, Mr. Timoney promised results. "I guarantee you that," he said, adding that he would be a "hands-on" commissioner and that Philadelphia police officers and residents would see him on the street day and night, walking the beat with officers and riding with them in their patrol cars.
"I think the next 22 months are going to be a lot of fun," Mr. Timoney said, alluding to the amount of time Mayor Rendell has left to serve in his second and final term.
Mr. Timoney, 49, spent 29 years with the New York Police Department and as first deputy commissioner was instrumental in redeploying its street patrols around the city to increase pressure on criminals, particularly drug dealers and others who victimize homeowners, shopkeepers and other ordinary citizens. That redeployment, police experts say, was a major factor in the strikingly sharp decline in the city's crime rate in recent years.
Mr. Timoney resigned in 1996 when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani chose Fire Commissioner Howard Safir to replace, William J. Bratton, as the Police Commissioner of New York City. Mr. Bratton subsequently became a part-time police adviser to Mayor Rendell and is said by City Hall aides to have been instrumental in getting his former top aide hired.
Mayor Rendell had high praise today for Mr. Neal, a 57-year-old veteran of 36 years on the Philadelphia force who has been hired as a security consultant by Drexel University and the Penn's Landing Corporation, a Philadelphia development group.
Mayor Rendell, who has given some thought to running for Governor and who has repeatedly denied finding Mr. Neal another job to speed his departure and avoid further criticism of the city government, said the Police Commissioner had done good work in carrying out a "comprehensive series of reform and deployment initiatives."
During Mr. Neal's tenure as the city's top police officer, the city has been sorely embarrassed by a scandal involving physical abuse and money shake-downs by some officers -- none of it was ever linked to the commissioner -- and half a dozens officers were eventually convicted and some sent to prison.
The city has never been classified as one of America's more dangerous big cities. But that was not the issue with Mr. Neal's critics, some of whom have an eye on Mayor Rendell's job. What they kept pointing out was that at a time when many major cities were enjoying a steady decrease in crime, in part because of the healthy national economy but also because of innovative and aggressive policing, Philadelphia was a laggard in many areas, with its murder rate especially stubborn.
The critics said the force was a laggard in adopting modern technology, particularly computers. They said the force was poorly trained and equipped. And, most serious of all, they warned that unless the city charter was changed to permit the Police Commissioner to appoint and dismiss all top department managers, the force would remain trapped in a bureaucratic morass.
The Police Commissioner can now appoint and dismiss only his two deputies. The rest of the force is protected by civil service regulations that are often restrictive.
Mayor Rendell, who until recently resisted departmental changes and deflected criticism of the police department, now says he favors a ballot referendum to change the city charter and give the Police Commissioner far broader powers.
Despite the praise and expectations for Mr. Timoney, Richard Costello, the president of the Philadelphia chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, the police union, expressed concern that the morale of the force might be hurt by the choice of an outsider.
"We're disappointed that he wasn't from our ranks," Mr. Costello said.
Michael Nutter, a member of the City Council, said he was concerned that the Mayor did not consult with the Council before making the appointment, given the current mood in the city about the Police Department's performance.
"He should have sought our input for something this big, even though he technically didn't have to," Mr. Nutter said. "Certainly Timoney is facing a big, serious challenge, coming from the outside as he is. The troubles in this Police Department run deep and go way back, for decades."
In the years shortly after World War II, the Philadelphia Police Department was considered one of the most innovative and progressive in the country. It was among the first to aggressively recruit black officers and its city charter was written so as to limit political interference in its day to day management by putting most officers under civil service protection.
Then Frank L. Rizzo, first as Police Commissioner from 1967 to 1971 and as Mayor from 1972 to 1980, advocated a hard line against crime. The eventual result was brutality. Then came incidents of ineptitude, culminating with a police standoff with the radical group Move in which 62 row houses were ignited and 11 people were killed in a black working-class neighborhood in 1985.
In the 1990's six officers were convicted of brutality and graft. During this decade, there were also incidents in which detectives were accused of beating confessions out of suspects, undercover officers were discovered framing innocent people, vice squad members were caught taking payoffs from prostitutes and gamblers, narcotics officers became drug addicts themselves and demanded bribes from dealers and officers turned their dogs loose on people with little or no provocation.
Many other cities have had similar problems, though few have endured the police scandals that have taken place in Philadelphia.
"This is a city in which the culture of policing is often out of whack," said James Fyfe, a former New York police officer who teaches criminology at Temple University here. "It's the only city I've ever been in where even the white people don't like cops. That's a sad commentary. The good news is that now things are at the point where they can do something about it -- if they will."

Tough Questions on Iraq For U.S. Officials at Forum
The Clinton Administration rolled out its top foreign policy officials at Ohio State University in Columbus to make its case on Iraq, but Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger were greeted with tough questions, catcalls and a lot of anxiety about American goals from protesters and supporters alike. A1 

The forum was broadcast around the world exclusively by CNN, much to the aggravation of other networks, which gave the Administration's performance dismal reviews. A9
 
Soldiers in Fort Stewart, Ga., appeared strikingly casual about their being sent to the Middle East. The relative ease of the last war against Saddam Hussein seems to have given American troops a remarkable self-confidence. A8
 
Former Zambia Leader Charged
Kenneth Kaunda, the former President of Zambia who has been in custody since December, was formally charged with concealing information about a failed coup last October in the southern African country. Mr. Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 27 years after independence in 1964, was charged along with his security chief. A4
 
Mexico Limits Chiapas Travel
The Mexican Government is clamping down on foreigners in the troubled State of Chiapas who show support for the Zapatista guerrillas or monitor events in Indian regions where the rebel movement is active. In recent days, Mexican immigration authorities have ended a longstanding tolerance for foreigners who travel to Chiapas with tourist visas and then participate in Zapatista meetings or marches, or visit villages where the tension between rebel and pro-Government factions is active. A6
 
Israeli Officials to Visit Jordan
Three top Israeli officials will soon visit King Hussein of Jordan in an effort to repair ties after a report this week on the botched Israeli assassination of a Hamas leader last year in Amman, Israeli public radio reported. The officials are Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky. (Agence France-Presse)
 
Police Reforms in Belgium
Belgium announced sweeping changes in its police forces in response to public outrage over a child sex and murder scandal. After a special Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said that a unified national police force would be created, combining paramilitary gendarmerie and the judicial police. Blaming a rivalry between the forces, two reports harshly criticized them for bungling the hunt for the abductors of four girls found dead in 1996. (Reuters)

Stage Set for Legal Test Of Executive Privilege
The deputy White House counsel, Bruce R. Lindsey, President Clinton's closest friend, spent nearly five hours before the Federal grand jury investigating Mr. Clinton's relationship with the former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Mr. Lindsey's lawyers and prosecutors interrupted the proceedings for 45 minutes to consult with the judge supervising the grand jury in anticipation of formally arguing the issue of executive privilege today, officials involved in the case said. Democrats close to Mr. Clinton announced the creation of a new legal defense fund for the Clintons. A1
 
More than 40 percent of the early news reports on the investigation of Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky consisted of analysis, opinion and speculation, not factual reporting, said a watchdog group composed largely of journalists. A14
 
Fund-Raiser Is Indicted
A Federal grand jury indicted a Democratic fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, on charges that she laundered illegal contributions through a Buddhist temple in California to the re-election campaigns of President Clinton, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other politicians. A13
 
Museum Director Forced Out
The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum forced the resignation of its director, Walter Reich, ending an acrimonious tenure highlighted by an embarrassing on-again-off-again invitation last month to Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. A10

Federal and state experts said that the F.B.I. and state laboratories had set new technical standards for testing DNA strands, aiding the development of a national system of quicker, cheaper testing. A1

Government health officials said they were suspending use of dummy pills in a series of controversial overseas experiments on pregnant women because they had found a cheap way for developing nations to use the drug AZT to reduce mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus. A16
 
New Police Officials Named
John Timoney, left, a former first deputy police commissioner in New York, was named Philadelphia's new police commissioner. He succeeds Richard Neal, who resigned after five years of struggling to lead a force accused of brutality, graft and ineptitude. In Chicago, Terry Hilliard, a detective popular among uniformed officers, was named the superintendent of police. He takes over a department beset by corruption, charges of brutality and dissension in the ranks. A16

Strong Sales in U.S. Lift Honda Earnings

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Despite the economic slowdown throughout Asia, the Honda Motor Company posted a small rise in third-quarter profits as a result of relatively strong car sales in the United States and Europe. Profits for Honda rose 5.3 percent, to 65.2 billion yen ($515 million), in the three months that ended Dec. 31. 
 Honda, Japan's third-largest auto maker, said revenue rose 16.6 percent, to 1.6 trillion yen. Strong sales of its CR-V sport utility vehicle in the United States and Europe fueled the growth, Honda said. Car sales in Japan have slowed since last April, when the Government raised the national sales tax to 5 percent from 3 percent. Honda said it sold 601,000 automobiles in the quarter, up 7.7 percent from 1996.

Delay in State Ruling On a Utility's Rates

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Niagara Mohawk will have to wait at least a few more days before finding out whether state regulators will approve its plan to revamp its rates.
Yesterday, the State Public Service Commission delayed action on the utility's Power Choice proposal, citing several unresolved issues. It is the second time this month that the commission has put off a decision on the two-year-old plan. 
 The Power Choice plan would reduce rates for large industrial and commercial customers up to 25 percent, which proponents say will in turn stimulate the economy throughout the utility's upstate New York service territory.
Residential and small commercial customers would get rate decreases of less than 3.5 percent, but critics say the bills of almost half the utility's customers would rise because of a planned "customer charge."
Niagra Mohawk has threatened to file for bankruptcy protection if Power Choice is not approved by the commission.
Niagara Mohawk provides gas and electricity to two million customers in upstate New York. The plan to revamp the rates will open competition and allow Niagara Mohawk customers to buy electricity from cheaper sources. In return, Niagara Mohawk would be allowed to branch out into other lucrative business ventures.

The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures the cost of raw materials and semifinished goods before they reach the consumer, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent last month. 
 A second report, by the Commerce Department, showed construction of new homes and apartments fell slightly in January from December, but the annual rate of construction was still healthy at 1.53 million units.
A 3.7 percent drop in energy prices, the largest since they fell 5 percent in February 1991 with the conclusion of the Persian Gulf war, was responsible for much of the overall drop in producer prices. Food prices also declined, by four-tenths of 1 percent. Even omitting these often volatile components, prices were lower, albeit much more modestly.
And since indexes measuring prices at the crude and intermediate stages of production also declined, analysts said there were few reasons to anticipate a sudden surge in inflation.
In January, the Producer Price Index, excluding food and energy, declined by one-tenth of 1 percent. For the 12 months ending in January, this core rate declined one-tenth of 1 percent as well.
"This is more of the same good news," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Nationsbank Montgomery Securities. "Not only is current inflation on a year-over-year basis basically stable, but the pipeline for inflation suggests there are no mounting pressures."
John M. Galvin, assistant commissioner for industrial prices at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the producer price data, said that "these are very different numbers we are reporting now than a couple of years ago, that is for sure."
Most analysts had predicted the general trends of the producer price and housing reports. The actual data changed no opinions about the course of monetary policy: most analysts continue to say the Federal Reserve Board will probably leave interest rates unchanged, perhaps for much of the year.
The initial reaction in financial markets was positive, as stocks and bonds rose. As the day progressed, prices came off their peaks. Nevertheless, propelled by a late surge, the Dow Jones industrial average registered its sixth straight record high.
Although the housing starts figures were somewhat weaker in January, the Commerce Department revised the December figures sharply higher. Moreover, the January number represents the fifth straight month that housing starts have run at an annual rate exceeding 1.5 million, regarded as vigorous growth.
"If this is a leading indicator of a downturn, and housing often is, we are not seeing it yet," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Due to unusually mild weather, housing activity was by far the busiest in the Northeast last month, where starts rose by more than 18 percent. They declined in every other region. However, Mr. Fine and other analysts cautioned against reading too much into the housing figures because winter construction rates can be deceptive.
Economists expect growth to slow as the year progresses and for inflation to remain subdued, largely as a result of the Asian financial crisis. However, the ripple effects of that crisis were not terribly evident in January's producer price figures.
"Falling demand in Asia is one of the things keeping energy prices soft, but it is only one factor," Mr. Galvin from the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. "We made an effort to look for an Asian effect, but we didn't see any real change in our indexes from four to six months ago."
Mr. Galvin said he did learn of anecdotal evidence about steep declines in the export prices of a few relatively esoteric items -- cattle hides and metals like steel scrap -- to the four Asian nations at the epicenter of the crisis. "Suggested prices are really plunging for these commodities, which means that demand is falling," he said.
Such falling demand is expected to result in a widening trade deficit in the United States, which can hurt the economy as exporters reduce production and cut jobs. Still, economists said the expected drag from a bigger trade deficit was likely to be at least partly offset by other helpful consequences of the Asia crisis such as falling interest rates, which would further stimulate demand for housing and household goods.
"All of this means the composition of economic growth will change," Mr. Levy said. "But financial shock absorbers here should work to mitigate the impact of Asia on the American economy."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 20, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the Labor Department's report on producer prices in January referred incorrectly to the report's most widely followed index. It measures the prices that manufacturers, farmers and other producers pay for finished goods, not the cost of raw materials and semifinished goods. The index fell seven-tenths of 1 percent last month.

The Cars Were Big and Elvis Was Young

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
The year 1950 was a landmark on the march to the millennium. Although halfway marks have limited value for doomsayers, and no one had reason yet to predict that the failure of computer clocks would bring about the fall of civilization, half a century was used up, and experience suggested that the second half was likely to bring some changes. As, in fact, it did.
The beginning of the 50's promised happiness and togetherness for Dick and Jane, their picket fence and the Ford in their future. The war was over and prosperity had already bestowed fedoras and white gloves and a carefully groomed aura of calm security. Harry S. Truman was followed by eight years of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was rumored to have died early in his term without there being any visible change in his style of governing. 
 There were tremors nonetheless. In 1949, the Soviets exploded an atomic bomb. In 1950, the Korean War began, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy began his war against Communists in America and Charles Schulz introduced "Peanuts," a comic strip dedicated, however sweetly, to insecurity and anxiety. A really good psychic would have predicted that bomb shelters and rock-and-roll could not be far behind.
"Flashback: The Fifties," at the Bonni Benrubi Gallery on the Upper East Side, crowds together 70 black-and-white photographs from that decade, some telling, some amusing, some virtually unknown, almost all American. They make the decade look almost as good as it wished to -- no Korea, no McCarthy, no poverty -- and merely drop a couple of pointed hints that not everything was exactly as it seemed. The darkest hint is Harold Edgerton's photograph of the first microseconds of an atomic bomb explosion, taken at one-100,000,000th of a second, when the cloud was still a great irregular ball pockmarked with darker disks.
John Chancellor once wrote about the 50's that "if you weren't looking for work, black or getting shot at in Korea, it was a very nice time." The car ruled the world, there were two in every garage, and they became make-out parlors with a ticket to the drive-in movie. Mickey Pallas photographed the ur-family of suburbia -- mother, father, son and daughter -- posing in their big Buick convertible before their ranch house and range garage. Louis Faurer framed three black cars with aggressive tailfins in a lightless parking garage where chrome outlines gleamed like private fortunes.
For the most part, celebrities -- lots of them show up here -- were still wholesome and well behaved. During a campaign ride in an open convertible, photographed by Carl Mydans, Jacqueline Kennedy listened avidly while her husband, the Senator, explained something to her and fans cheered. Richard M. Nixon jumped and smiled, as stiff as rigor mortis, for Philippe Halsman's camera. The decade tried hard to keep its image up to snuff, with white polish on its saddle shoes and crab-grass-killer on the lawn.
The gallery flashes back to Elizabeth Taylor's very first wedding (how young she was, how beautiful, how embellished with tulle furbelows), to Hula-Hoops, teen-agers crowding into telephone booths, drive-in restaurants and the crushing elegance of high fashion (which shows up here in some truly classic images). The decade worked hard at conformity: Elliott Erwitt photographed young couples seated at tables in Bermuda, every man absorbed in the identical action of lighting a cigarette for his date.
The near absence of controversy in "Flashback" has some relevance to the state of photography at the time. The Photo League, organized by committed photographers in the 30's to address the social issues of the day, had come under suspicion of being leftist, which it was, and Communist, which a couple of members probably were. Political pressure finally drove the league to disband in 1951, whereupon a pall settled over street photography and the photography of causes.
As American artists, writers and filmmakers fearfully withdrew into abstraction, silence or politically neutral cheeriness, photographers did, too. The burning issues were turned over to the big magazines and the newspapers, which had plenty to do. A trace of their task shows up here in photographs like Arthur Rickerby's of rowdy teen-age white boys at a school in Tennessee, some making obscene gestures, and a black girl, impeccably neat, sitting alone and apart.
A lot of the other material is journalistic in one way or another, not inappropriately, as art photography was still a limited field with a specialized audience. Journalists proved that the rituals of life and love repeat themselves relentlessly in every decade. In George Zimbel's photograph of an Irish dance hall in the Bronx, a lone young man with tousled hair and loosened tie wears an expectant smile, knowing something good will come his way, while at the side five young women stand around morosely, hoping someone will ask them to dance.
Despite Alfred C. Kinsey's best-selling reports, sex was still officially bottled up, under pressure, ready to burst out. Men found a raunchy pleasure or two at the burlesque, which television would soon drive out of business. Garry Winogrand snapped the famous stripper Lili St. Cyr at an uncommonly domestic moment as she knitted pasties backstage, working away in a darkness that almost covered her and a tiny bra that almost did not.
But sex, exhibitionism and an open sense of enjoyment were edging into the mainstream. Not one but three pictures of Marilyn Monroe with her dress blowing up on the subway grating are in this show. Photographers milled about in the background, eager to record a possible sighting of Marilyn's panties for the public's delectation. Then there was Elvis, most memorably here in Alfred Wertheimer's "Kiss," where the young heartthrob laughingly touches tongues with a young woman.
Against the odds, some photographers observed the decade's undertones. The very darkness of certain photographs by Mr. Faurer, Mr. Zimbel, Robert Frank, William Klein and Louis Stettner seems to mirror a mood more felt than openly expressed. Introspection was becoming a photographic approach as well as a subject: Mr. Zimbel observed a well-dressed woman sullenly drinking by herself at a bar, and Mr. Stettner peered through the window of a parked train at a sailor lost in the pensive sadness of a man with no company but his thoughts.
In the decade of togetherness, there were islands of isolation. A very young Diane Arbus portrayed a young woman hopelessly alone on the boardwalk where people gather. Ida Wyman snapped a man in an empty cafe standing by the jukebox in search of some response.
While many Americans experienced their first post-Depression sense of trust in an enticing economic future and splurged with credit cards, that exciting new way to spend, some writers and photographers looked askance at society and materialism. Mr. Frank breached the general rule of contentment with a picture of couples at a formal reception trapped in their cummerbunds and fur capes and stolid expectations. Mr. Klein went him one better, blurring the moneyed types at the Waldorf past recognition, as if to say that their pleasures were indistinct and fleeting and not even photography could preserve them.
These photographers also broke the academic rules of photography, throwing clarity, sharp focus and balanced composition out the window. The lid was about to blow on many of the old social verities. Photography, which recorded the established patterns, would record their breakdown too, and in the 50's it was already devising expressive means to suit new circumstances.
"Flashback: The Fifties" remains at the Bonni Benrubi Gallery, 52 East 76th Street, Manhattan, through March 7.

She Smolders, He Fumes: Gee, It's Hot

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
The opening scenes of Volker Schlondorff's juicy film noir, "Palmetto," evoke semitropical rot in southern Florida with such a deliriously sensual appreciation of evil that when the movie eventually runs amok, you can almost forgive it for becoming a shrill, comic self-parody.
The film, adapted from a novel by James Hadley Chase, aspires to out-noir every other film noir that has been lumped under that popular term, including "The Big Sleep" (which it resembles), in plot trickery and steaminess. Like "The Big Sleep," "Palmetto" finally gets lost in a haze of increasingly farfetched plot complications. But unlike its forerunner, it also amps up the horror to such a degree that by the time a character finds himself strung up and dangled over a vat of acid, you will be more inclined to giggle than to hold your breath. 
 At least "Palmetto" should lay to rest any complaints that they don't make screen vamps like they used to. When Elisabeth Shue, wearing a too-tight dress, sidles into the telephone booth of a seedy south Florida bar and ostentatiously "loses" a cash-stuffed purse, the screen begins to sizzle. From her spectacular arrival to a final glimpse that suggests Gloria Swanson's mad descent down a staircase in "Sunset Boulevard," Ms. Shue hams it fabulously, smirking and shimmying and casting tough come-hither looks as scorching as hot coals.
Her character, Rhea Malroux, is the greedy, bored, hot-blooded wife of a wealthy but frail businessman three decades her senior. With her equally seductive stepdaughter, Odette (Chloe Sevigny), she has hatched a fake kidnapping scheme to wrest a quick half-million dollars from the old miser. To help carry it out, she propositions Harry Barber (Woody Harrelson), a bitter unemployed ex-newspaper reporter who has just returned to town. Harry, whose journalism career skidded to a halt after his expose of an extortion scheme involving the local power brokers was blocked from publication, has plenty of reason to fume. His efforts to expose corruption landed him in jail, where he served for two wasted years before his conviction was overturned.
Returning to the scene of the crimes, a Florida seaside town called Palmetto, Harry has resumed his domestic partnership with Nina (Gina Gershon), a sculptor whose career has begun to take off. Once he is seduced into going along with Rhea's scheme (for which he is promised a 10 percent commission), everything that could conceivably go wrong does.
When "Palmetto" is following its main characters' criminal and erotic shenanigans, it is as deliciously over-ripe as you could hope for a film noir set in an area whose sultry climate, real-estate boom and spiritual torpor outclass Los Angeles in glamorous decay. Filled with steamy tropical downpours, shots of dripping palm leaves and glistening cockroaches, the movie makes the most of the location, and after a while you feel the heat and humidity begin to settle over you.
If "Palmetto" is a dramatic leap into pop moviemaking for the director of "The Tin Drum" and "The Handmaid's Tale," it is also a change of pace for Mr. Harrelson. Instead of his usual hyperkinetic wild man, he plays a glowering passive-aggressive whiner. As you sense the character chewing on his own accumulated resentment, Mr. Harrelson makes you understand why Harry, against his better judgment, allows himself to be used by unscrupulous women. Ms. Shue is nearly matched in sinister glamour by Ms. Sevigny, who creates a disturbing portrait of selfish, precociously sophisticated depravity.
Not all the casting is so fortuitous. Ms. Gershon, wasted in the role of Nina, has little to do for most of the film except ask Harry what's bothering him, and when dragged into the action late in the film, she seems befuddled. Michael Rapaport, in a departure from the hearty streetwise roles he usually plays, is badly miscast in the crucial but underdeveloped part of Rhea's lover and co-conspirator, Donnelly. The character's lack of focus throws the movie off balance and makes the story hard to follow.
"Palmetto" begins to go seriously haywire when Harry accepts a job as the police press spokesman for the very investigation that will soon implicate him. It may be a nifty plot device, but it's one too many twists in a story that takes so many hairpin turns it begins to reel from its own desperate desire to be surprising.
"Palmetto" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, strong language, sexual situations and nudity.

From Shetl to Fiesta, A Painter's Wanderings

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
It's often better to be a big frog in a small puddle, and so it was for the painter Lasar Segall (1891-1957). Born in the Jewish quarter of Vilnius, Lithuania, he left for Germany at 15, developed an Expressionist style and later migrated to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he spent the rest of his life. He was a leading light in the development of modern Brazilian art, and he is commemorated by a Lasar Segall museum in Sao Paulo. But as a painter he was uneven and derivative.
The evidence is on view in his first major United States retrospective, at the Jewish Museum. Organized by the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago and the Lasar Segall museum, the show contains a vast 200 paintings, watercolors, drawings and prints, most never exhibited in New York. They range from early works in an Expressionist mode to later Holocaust themes to the vividly stylized evocations of Brazilian life and landscape that are his most interesting legacy. 
 Segall's unusual odyssey is part of his claim to fame. The son of a Torah scribe who occasionally allowed the boy to illuminate the capital letters of manuscripts, he made a surprising leap -- at a tender age -- from his provincial Orthodox community to the worldlier art milieus of Berlin and Dresden. Vilnius, an old center of Jewish culture swept by the winds of Russian revolutionary fervor and anti-Semitism, was obviously a place to leave.
In art schools in the two German cities, he found filtered-down Impressionism the prevailing mode, where his inclination was Expressionism. But teachers in Dresden supported his more emotional style, well suited to his subject, the rigors of shtetl life. The early part of this show is rife with scenes of his hometown. "Vilnius and I" (1910), a strong, Munch-like lithograph in sharply contrasting black and white, shows the artist with furrowed brow, spiffy in a European suit, a backdrop of huddled houses behind him. Munch's influence is also apparent in Segall's 1909 lithograph "Pain," a graphic close-up of a woman's head thrown back, mouth open, as she clutches at her chest.
More Segall's own is "After the Pogrom," a 1912 lithograph depicting a sprawl of bodies on the ground surrounded by tall, crazily angled walls of buildings that lean oppressively in on them. He was apparently the first Jewish artist to depict the organized massacres known as pogroms. But a more avant-garde venture of this period, "Russian Village" (1912), an ungainly meld of Cubism, Futurism and Expressionism with triangular planes, distorted figures and cliche colors, is singularly unimpressive.
In Dresden, Segall gravitated to vanguard artists and honed his Expressionist style. He helped found the Dresden Secession group, and his circle of friends included the painters Lyonel Feininger and Kandinsky, the critic and historian Will Grohmann and the dancer Mary Wigman. He maintained his Russian Jewish identity, but a new emotional urgency gripped him, the plight of local workers and the poor. One of the better works of this period is "Self Portrait II" (1919), a powerful,brooding head of the artist done in Cubist style in ruddy shades of brown.
Another is "Interior of Poor People II" of 1921, a scene of muted browns and milder Expressionist distortion, that shows four melancholic occupants of a room. One, wearing a fedora, looks like Segall. As an evocation of poverty, however, it is not very convincing. The room seems more posh than poor, what with a handsome painting on the wall and decorative objects on a table. "Eternal Wanderers," a 1919 tableau of troubled figures in a cliched but more integrated Cubist-Expressionist style, was among the paintings later confiscated by the Nazis from the Dresden City Art Museum. It was exhibited in the infamous "Degenerate Art" show of 1937 in Munich.
In 1913, Segall had made a successful yearlong trip to Brazil, where he visited siblings and arranged a couple of one-man shows. A decade later, affected by the political unrest, inflation and open anti-Semitism of life in the Weimar Republic, he decided to abandon the career he had established there and emigrate to Brazil.
A thoroughly urban European, Segall was drawn to the primitive and the exotic that Brazil embodied, its lush landscapes, brilliant colors and rich folk traditions. Besides, Sao Paulo was beginning to develop a modern art scene, and his sister, married to an influential businessman, made sure that he was properly introduced. He exhibited almost immediately after his arrival in 1924, and became a Brazilian citizen three years later.
Segall and Brazil were a happy match. His early paintings of Brazilian themes, recording his impressions of the country in a new and lighter vein, are certainly among his best works. He painted black people, coffee and banana plantations, prostitutes of the Mangue district of the city, religious rituals and fiestas. One of his most impressive compositions from this period is "Red Hill" (1926), a highly stylized rendition of a black mother and child looming large against a stagey backdrop of houses, imperial palms and curvaceous clouds. For it, he appropriated and reworked the triangular composition traditional to Brazilian paintings of the Madonna.
Even his slighter vignettes have a catchy narrative or rhythmic vigor to them. A 1929 drypoint etching, "Two Sailors with Companions," appeals with its deliberately klutzy rendition of sailors ill at ease with their restless women. A sharp woodcut of a black man's head and another of black people dancing by moonlight show Segall well in tune with the different beat of Brazilian life..
During the turmoil in Europe of the 1930's and 40's, Segall often commented on the plight of Jews and other victims. In 1937, he produced the prophetic "Pogrom," a well-known painting that depicts a tumble of massacred bodies lying in a field, but other works, like the notebook "Visions of War" (1940-43), with its vignettes of herded prisoners and skeletal figures, are too sketchy and pallid to be convincing.
As Segall aged, his Brazilian work seems to have softened. He did sensuous landscapes of the Brazilian countryside, likening mountains to curves of the body, and he painted benign nature studies, like "Cattle in Forest" (1939), a scene of cows contentedly browsing in a glade of trees, notable for its mix of warm, earthy colors with a muted Expressionist palette. Trees, in fact, as symbols of survival, became an obsessive motif of his later work. Eventually he began to strip them down to bare essentials, and the 1954 "Forest with Glimpses of Sky," a dense lineup of tall trunks, is virtually an abstraction of color and light.
But overall, this crowded retrospective is too large and unselective. It reveals as many of Segall's weaknesses as his strengths.
"Still More Distant Journeys: The Artistic Emigrations of Lasar Segall" is at the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, through May 10.

Rich yuppies are lapping up all the great wines. No price is too steep for a Wall Streeter when his palate craves vinous delight. A restaurant wine bill can run to thousands of dollars when these conspicuous consumers are in the bibulous vein. 
 I have it from The New York Times. I had been searching the paper with prurient eye, seeking Interngate gossip, and I was looking on the bright side, as I always do. "Son," somebody told me back in Nineteen-aught-seven, "always look on the bright side, especially when there isn't any."
Well, there was plenty of bright side to Interngate. First of all, nobody was calling it "Interngate."
Second, it was going to be a good long time before we would again have to listen to politicians run on about "family values." The President's rising popularity had made it clear that most Americans thought "family values" was an issue strictly for saps.
This rosy frame of mind was shattered by the headline at the bottom of Page One: "After Vintage Year, Wall St. Orders the Really Good Stuff."
What followed was as bad as the news can be if you honed your palate on Gallo's jug red before treating it to Romanee-Conti and Leoville-Las-Cases.
These last two have been unaffordable to this complainant for several years, but, being determined to look on the bright side, I have been waiting for a worldwide depression that would bring their prices back down to sensible levels.
With Wall Street now guzzling it in tank-car lots, we can forget about ever tasting such wines again.
The full horror of the situation was encapsulated in two sentences by a wine-wise editor named Thomas Matthews: "I think wine has taken over from the toys of the old days like watches and cars. Wine shows you have money, but it also shows you have taste."
The money results from the big bull market of 1997, which, according to The Times, produced a windfall of several billion -- that's billion, not million -- dollars to be parceled out in bonuses. These range from millions for the big cats to thousands for small fry.
What results from this Wall Street gravy is not always wonderful. As Mr. Matthews noted, the appetite for toys is channeled into goods the spender thinks will show he has good taste as well as plenty of money.
Trophy houses spring up, uglifying beautiful landscapes and boasting of plenty of money and no taste at all. Chris Shipley, head wine man at the "21" Club, says Wall Streeters drink "trophy wines," big red wines with big prices and big names on the labels.
He told of a small party one night drinking five bottles of a wine that cost $1,975 a bottle.
Reading this in the paper brought me close to tears. It is not that I can't afford $1,975 for a bottle of wine. I could by refinancing the mortgage. What crushed me was the suspicion that I couldn't bear to pay that kind of money for a wine, even if I were as rich as a Microsoft vice president.
The problem is, the Great Depression is lodged in my bones. It has crippled my power to find happiness in this era of excess galore. It has left me with a stunted sense of values. I still bend down to pick up pennies. Given a single penny in change at a cash register, I refuse to leave it behind.
We are not talking cheapskate here. We are talking a psyche so warped by the Depression that it is probably unfit to be allowed out in today's economy. It could no more pay $1,975 for a bottle of wine than it could offer $16 billion to buy a competing corporation, if I had a corporation to be competed with.
It is why I don't have a corporation. I am too busy picking up pennies to get a corporation under way.
The Wall Street wine story is especially painful because it reveals me to myself as a small-time penny-picker-upper. I am extremely fond of wine, and have drunk some of these wines now pampering Wall Street digestions. They are excellent.
For an extraordinary occasion I might pay as much as $40 for the best of them, but $250 to $2,000 a bottle? They're not worth it, you Wall Street guys. You can do almost as well for less than $20 a bottle.
But hey, stupid! Wine's not the point.

Blue Chips Take a Breather From Setting Record Highs

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market was generally lower yesterday, ending a blistering run that had repeatedly sent most major indexes to record highs.
 Technology stocks, however, bucked the trend, soaring a day after Dell Computer, a leading maker of personal computers, reported its eighth consecutive quarter of record earnings.
 And so even though the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 75.48 points, or 0.89 percent, to 8,375.58, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index inched closer to a new high.
Shares of Dell soared 9 9/16 yesterday, to a record 122 3/4, helping lift many technology stocks on optimism that the computer industry would continue to grow in 1998. Investors, who have been heavily buying technology stocks this year, bought into Intel, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, which trade on the Nasdaq.
As a result, the Nasdaq rose 11.28 points, or nearly seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,727.01, just 18 points off its Oct. 9, 1997, high of 1,745.85. For the year, the index is up 10 percent, far and away the best-performing major indicator.
And even though the broader market slid yesterday, with many more shares falling than rising, Wall Street analysts termed the drop a welcome breather after a surprisingly strong run-up in prices.
Analysts say that the market has been powered in recent weeks by optimism that the Asian economic crisis has eased, and that the American economy remains strong, with few signs of inflationary pressure.
After months of worrisome commentary on the fate of American companies that do business in Asia, analysts are again talking about America's pre-eminent economic position and about a domestic outlook often described as the best of all possible worlds.
Even Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, who two months ago forecast a "huge brutal hug of a bear market" in 1998, is now talking about the American economy being in a "sweet spot," and about share prices going even higher.
The optimism is reflected in the market's recent performance; until yesterday, the Dow had climbed for six consecutive trading days, and it had risen nearly 550 points, or 7 percent, since the end of January. During that run, the Dow last week topped 8,259.31, the record it had set last Aug. 6, and one that looked awfully distant after the index plunged 554 points, to 7,161.15, on Oct. 27.
The recent gains, which have benefited large companies more than smaller ones, have surprised many analysts, many of whom had forecast share price gains of only 6 percent to 8 percent for the entire year. Already, the Dow is up 5.9 percent on the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which slid 3.80 points, to 1,028.28 yesterday, is up 5.96 percent.
"This market is a lot stronger than I had expected," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company. "It's like watching a force of nature. I've been following markets for more than 30 years and I've never seen anything like this."
The gains have come amid a general rally in world stock prices, which have been driven in part by a belief that the world's central banks and the International Monetary Fund have been effective in helping stabilize the Asian situation.
In much of Europe, stock prices have risen between 6 percent and 10 percent, while shares have soared between 12 percent and 40 percent in many parts of Southeast Asia, where stock prices had collapsed at the end of last year. That optimism -- like the earlier pessimism -- leaped across oceans and touched off similar activity in the United States.
"The mood has turned to where people are putting Asia on the back burner," said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "We had a lot of pessimism in January, about Asia, Iraq and the President. But the big picture is: This is still a bull market."
Mr. Goldman, however, said he was worried that the market may run into trouble in the months ahead as corporate profits, which have been growing smartly for several years, are slowed by the Asian crisis.
"Emotionally, Asia has had its maximum impact, but fundamentally, it has not," he said. "Analysts' profit projections are still too high."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall Slightly in Light Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices declined modestly yesterday. Trading was light as many investors chose to await next week's appearance of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on Capitol Hill, as well as an auction of new Treasury notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 8/32, to 103 28/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, edged up to 5.85 percent, from 5.83 percent on Wednesday. 
 The market largely shrugged off reports on manufacturing, jobs and trade. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index on regional business activity fell to 12.8 percent in February from 17.3 in January, only slightly more than market forecasts of 12.5. But its index of orders for new merchandise shot up to 24.2 from 13.3 last month. Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, saw the Philadelphia Fed report as a mixed bag. The components of the report suggested that economic activity was somewhat stronger than the decline in the general business conditions index would imply, he said. Still, the report's price data continued to indicate that inflation was not a problem for manufacturers.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 2,000, to 301,000 last week, which showed, Mr. Platt said, that there was no slackening in the labor market.
Gains in the dollar in the foreign exchange market early in the session, along with some short-covering, lifted Treasury prices off their lows. But with Mr. Greenspan scheduled to deliver his semiannual Congressional testimony on the economy, market participants elected to take a cautious approach in strategy.
Also weighing on bonds was concern over the market's ability to absorb new supply. The Treasury plans to auction $26 billion of new two-year and five-year notes. The two-year notes will be sold on Tuesday and the five-year notes on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit For 1997 Hit 9-Year High

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
The nation's 1997 trade deficit reached its highest level in nine years, the Government reported today, and a jump in December suggested the deficit would surge again this year because of Asia's financial crisis.
The widening of the annual deficit was more a reflection of the strength of the American economy than an indication of a fundamental problem. But trade tensions at home and abroad could be aggravated in coming months as the deficit expands more quickly and American exporters find it more difficult to sell products and services in Asia. 
 Imports of goods and services exceeded exports by $10.8 billion in December, an increase in the deficit of $2.1 billion compared with November's figures. Economists had expected December's deficit to be about $9 billion.
The monthly figures showed the first tentative signs of Asia's effect on trade patterns. The trade deficit with economically ravaged South Korea, for example, expanded by $300 million in December, to $343 million.
Some analysts said the monthly figures might also signal some general weakening in what has been a strong export performance. Although exports were up $1 billion in December, to $80 billion, the gain came only because of a big jump in shipments of airliners, a notoriously volatile component of trade statistics. Without aircraft, exports in December would have declined.
The figures for January and ensuing months are expected to show sharper declines in American exports to South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and much of the rest of Asia as companies and consumers there curtail purchases. The strength of the dollar relative to the Asian currencies, which makes Asian goods less expensive in the United States, is also likely to stimulate an increase in imports to the United States, further widening the trade gap.
"The crisis in Asia is just starting to be reflected in the trade statistics," said Stan Shipley, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "We expect an ever enlarging trade deficit in the first half of 1998 as U.S. exports to Asia decline."
For the year, the overall deficit in goods and services totaled $113.7 billion, up from $111 billion in 1996. It was the largest deficit in goods and services trade since the $115.9 billion shortfall in 1988. The deficit peaked at $153.4 billion in 1987.
The deficit in trade of goods alone set a new record of $198.9 billion last year but was offset by a surplus in services trade of $85.2 billion, which was also a record.
Although the deficit edged up last year, it was less than half the size it was in 1987 relative to the size of the economy.
Because the trade deficit for December was higher than the Commerce Department had expected in estimating fourth-quarter growth of 4.3 percent in gross domestic product, economists said they expected the growth rate to be revised sharply downward, to about 3.5 percent.
The trade deficit is the only broad measure of economic performance that has not improved over the last several years. But its deterioration mainly reflects the prosperity of American companies and consumers, enabling them to buy more of what other countries produce.
Clinton Administration officials said today that the rise in the overall deficit had masked a steady increase in exports, one of the primary sources of new jobs and corporate profits. Exports last year grew 10 percent, said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and exports of manufactured goods grew 13 percent.
Still, Ms. Barshefsky said, the Asia crisis will hurt export growth this year. Economists project that the slowdown in exports could cut as much as a full percentage point off the nation's economic growth rate this year, and labor unions are warning that as many as one million jobs could be at risk as export markets shrink and manufacturers face increased competition from imports.
"The countries of Asia have been a source of strong U.S. export growth in the past, but the sharp decline in economic activity in the region is likely to reduce, at least temporarily, U.S. exports to the region and increase the trade deficit in 1998," Ms. Barshefsky said.
Besides endangering jobs, declining exports could hurt the profitability and stock prices of some companies. But a rise in imports would provide consumers with a broader selection of lower-priced goods and force domestic producers to restrain price increases, thereby helping to control inflation.
The annual figures showed improvement in the nation's trade deficit with Mexico but sharp deterioration in the deficits with Japan and China. The deficit with Japan rose to $55.7 billion last year from $47.6 billion in 1996. The deficit with China rose to $49.7 billion from $39.5 billion. The deficit with Mexico, where the economy has been bouncing back, narrowed to $14.5 billion from $17.5 billion.
The Administration has become increasingly strident in recent months in criticizing Japan for not doing more to stimulate its domestic economy and spur more demand for imports.
At a meeting of finance ministers from the seven largest industrial nations in London this weekend, the United States plans to bring more pressure on Japan to deregulate its economy and open its markets to prevent trade from becoming an even bigger source of friction.
The growing deficits with Japan and China, and the likelihood that the overall deficit will rise this year as Democrats and Republicans prepare for midterm Congressional elections, raise the prospect that trade could become a more potent political issue.
"There's already been a creeping backlash against free trade," said Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a research organization.
"It's hard to say where it all will end up," he added.

HEADLINE: Yes to Voluntary School Uniforms

 BODY:
Under current policy, parents and administrators at individual New York City schools can vote to require students to wear uniforms. It is entirely a matter of local initiative and choice. That would not be the case under a proposal by the Board of Education president, William Thompson. He would make uniforms mandatory for students up to sixth grade, unless planning teams at the schools vote to opt out of the plan. With Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and others urging schools to generate independent proposals for reform, the Thompson plan sends a coercive message.
The proposal has already spawned threats of lawsuits and divided parents at a time when serious education problems make unified community support more necessary than ever. 
 The Thompson plan would require uniforms for grade school beginning in the fall of 1999. If the policy became mandatory, the city might eventually be required to purchase uniforms for families that could not afford them -- driving up costs at a time when some schools do not have enough books. Under the plan, students who came to school out of uniform would be subject to penalties under the school disciplinary code. New York state courts have ruled against some cases like this in the past.
The new plan appeals to board members who see uniforms as a means of eradicating the economic differences between rich and poor children and controlling student behavior. Some schools have adopted uniform plans voluntarily and have found them salutary. But parents in other schools see uniforms as an infringement on their children's individuality and have refused to participate.
Advocates of the plan argue that schools that do not want to comply can simply vote not to participate. But the current voluntary policy is a better one because it allows schools to address the uniform issue affirmatively, without having to beat back edicts from the central board. The strongest argument against the mandatory uniform plan is that it violates the fundamental premise of the new school governance law, which holds the schools accountable for safety and student performance while letting parents and local administrators run the schools as they see fit.

HEADLINE: Men's Group To Lay Off Entire Staff

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Only four months after drawing hundreds of thousands of men to a prayer gathering on the Washington Mall, Promise Keepers, the evangelical men's movement, said yesterday that it would lay off its entire 345-person staff on March 31 because of financial problems and rely on volunteers at least temporarily.
Although the move raised immediate questions about the future of an organization that had come to seem a formidable religious force, Promise Keepers said it would not shut down, and would continue plans to hold 19 rallies across the country, beginning in Detroit on May 15. 
 The layoffs follow a decision by the organization's board in September to stop charging an admission fee for the rallies -- two-day events featuring prayer, hymn singing and preaching -- held in sports stadiums and arenas. The $60-a-person fees provided the bulk of the organization's income, covering, for example, 72 percent of its $87 million in expenses in 1996.
Roger Chapman, a Promise Keepers spokesman, said money problems had been widely expected at least since November.
"We've been talking about this for a while, so it was not like a great, big surprise," Mr. Chapman said, adding that the organization had also expected to see donations decline after Christmas, a perennial falloff affecting nonprofit organizations.
Mr. Chapman said that in November, Bill McCartney, the Promise Keepers founder and chief executive, told staff members that if the organization lacked the money to pay some of them, then no one would be paid. Mr. Chapman said he thought Mr. McCartney was telling employees they would face the situation as one.
"It was a coaching philosophy," he said, "sort of to pull the team together."
Mr. McCartney, a former football coach at the University of Colorado, could not be reached for comment. A Promise Keepers statement quoted him as saying he had a "broken heart," but not "a discouraged heart," because he felt hopeful. It said creditors would be paid in full and restaffing would occur when donations allowed.
Promise Keepers, based in Denver, has experienced financial problems before. In July, as it became evident that fewer men were attending the stadium events, the organization reduced its staff to about 360 from more than 400.
The events, at which speakers urge men to be loyal to their wives, loving to their children and devoted to Jesus, drew an average of 50,000 men in 1996. But an average of only 36,000 men turned out for the gatherings last year. The events also drew criticism, most recently from the National Organization for Women, which accused Promise Keepers of promoting male dominance, an accusation the group rejected.
On Oct. 4, Promise Keepers drew several hundred thousand men to its "Stand in the Gap" rally in Washington. But in an interview two weeks later, the president of Promise Keepers, Randy Phillips, said individual donation envelopes, intended to help pay the organization's 1998 costs, did not reach everyone there as planned. The envelopes were put in commemorative Bibles, but many men did not pick them up, because they had taken their own Bibles, he said then.
Throughout its history, Promise Keepers officials have said they believed that the organization's future, including its finances, was in God's hands.
"If you looked at us as you looked at an oil company announcing layoffs, there would be no comparisons," said Steve Ruppe, another spokesman. "The people at Promise Keepers feel called by God to be working here.
"We've just begun to seriously pray and ask for God's leading in this."
Randall Balmer, a professor of religion at Barnard College, said he believed that Promise Keepers was following a familiar trajectory among American religious movements: rapidly growing as a force outside traditional institutions, then losing steam as it became widely known and seemed to be moving closer to the mainstream.
He likened Promise Keepers to a revival or evangelistic meeting, saying, "You have this kind of burst of energy and emotion, and then it dissipates."
Professor Balmer also said he thought the robust national economy sapped a certain protest element from the movement, which he said had appealed to men who felt marginalized in society.

HEADLINE: Island Life Not Idyllic For Youths From U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
Drugs. Gangs. Guns. Like many other Dominican immigrants in the New York metropolitan area, the parents of Lizza Santos were distressed by what they saw going on around them. So just before their daughter started high school in September, they sent her to live with her grandparents here while they remained in the United States.
At first, the 14-year-old from Yonkers wasn't sure what to expect. But she soon discovered that at least 20 percent of her 425 classmates at the Santiago Christian School are American-born reverse immigrants like herself, part of a rapidly growing group of what are known as "Dominican Yorks" in local parlance. 
 "I don't want my kid growing up in a drug-infested area where I am always worrying that somebody is going to drive by and shoot him any time he goes out on the street," said Betty Cruz, a vacationing resident of Sunset Park in Brooklyn who was visiting her son Carlos, also a student here. "I wanted him away from all of that, and that's the reason every parent moves kids here."
The New York City Board of Education said it has not compiled figures on the number of students who have transferred to Dominican schools. But educators and Government officials here estimate that as many as 10,000 students from public and parochial schools in the United States, most of them from the New York City metropolitan area, are now enrolled in the country's schools.
Officials also say that the phenomenon, though not new, has grown markedly in the last two or three years. They attribute the increase in part to reforms made to the Dominican Constitution in 1994, broadening the concept of dual citizenship to include people of Dominican ancestry born in the United States, and to a spurt of economic growth that has created new opportunities here.
But they say the example of the country's 44-year-old President, Leonel Fernandez Reyna, also seems to be a factor. Born in the Dominican Republic, Mr. Fernandez was taken to New York by his immigrant mother, a seamstress and nurse's aide, as a third grader, and studied at Emily Dickinson Elementary School, Joan of Arc Middle School and Brandeis High School in Manhattan.
When he was a teen-ager, however, his mother sent him back home to finish high school. The success he has achieved, parents and educators suggest, has encouraged other families to follow suit.
Many of the teen-agers themselves, however, describe the return to their parents' homeland as a wrenching experience. Some do not speak fluent Spanish and many find the food and culture unfamiliar, feel they are missing out on such institutions of American high school life as proms and sports teams and long to return to their families.
"I know I'm getting a better education here, but I really don't get to see my parents, and that makes me feel like moving back up there again," Miss Santos said.
In addition, some chafe at stricter rules imposed by the grandparents, aunts and uncles and godparents with whom they now live. Furthermore, outside the family circle, they are often viewed with suspicion.
"A significant percentage of parents here are afraid to let their children associate with these kids," said Pedro Juan del Rosario, director of the Center for Urban and Regional Studies at the Pontifical Catholic University here. "Parents associate New York Dominicans with social problems such as drugs and with fashion styles that are not accepted here, such as strange haircuts and the use of earrings by boys."
Some schools here openly discriminate against the Dominican Yorks. At the Colegio Padre Fortin, for instance, the handbook spelling out admission requirements states that "students who have lived in the United States in the last three years will not be accepted."
"We have wonderful discipline here, and we don't want them coming from the United States to disrupt things," said Sister Josefina de Jesus, principal of the school's elementary division. "We'll take in the little ones, up to fifth grade, but not the teen-agers, because they don't adapt, don't want to accept the rules of the school, and give us a lot of work."
Even among their peers, the Dominican Yorks encounter some resistance. Many Dominican teen-agers argue that by the nature of their upbringing, the New Yorkers are simply louder, brasher and more menacing than everybody else.
"They think they're better than everybody else just because they have the blue passport," complained Karina Benitez Galindo, a 16 year old sitting with two friends at a Burger King here.
The comments of many of the Dominican Yorks suggest that they view their time here as merely an interlude. "I'd like to go back," said Luis Tavares, 17, who attended Public School 65 in Brooklyn before being sent here for high school. "The day after I graduate, I'm outta here."

HEADLINE: Another Leader of the Navajo Nation Resigns Under a Cloud

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Albert A. Hale took office as president of the Navajo Nation, promising to end corruption and rancorous internal politics at a reservation the size of West Virginia. Yesterday he resigned under fire for personal and political misdeeds, and apologized to the quarter-million people who live in the nation's largest Indian reservation.
"I am sorry for my shortcomings and the wrongs I may have committed while in office," Mr. Hale said, addressing the tribe in English and Navajo in a broadcast over the tribal radio station. "I ask for your forgiveness and the forgiveness of the Holy People." 
 Mr. Hale, a lawyer and one of a new style of Indian leaders who move freely from White House meetings to United Nations speeches, was one of the most forceful advocates for the rights of tribes as nations within a nation. He had recently suggested that the Navajo, whose 12 million-acre reservation touches New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, close the roads into the reservation for one day as a demonstration of Indian sovereignty.
But in the end, he was facing potential criminal charges from a special prosecutor looking into accusations that he misspent tribal money and that he had a sexual affair while in office. Under the terms of his resignation, hammered out on Wednesday at the Navajo capital in Window Rock, Ariz., the investigation into the money was dropped.
To some people, Mr. Hale's resignation shows that the politics of Indian Country are no different from those of any other part of the country, except that everything is magnified by family links and overt spirituality.
"Albert Hale became the point person for spreading the issue of Indian sovereignty throughout the world, and he was quite effective at it," said Dr. Lee Francis, a Laguna Pueblo Indian who is a professor of Native American Studies at the University of New Mexico. "His resignation says to us throughout Indian Country that we have got to stop shooting ourselves in the foot."
Mr. Hale is the second Navajo leader in the last decade to resign under a cloud. The tribal leader from two terms ago, Peter MacDonald, was convicted by a tribal court in 1992 of bribery and conspiracy charges and sentenced to seven years in jail.
The Navajo have twice rejected casino gambling and, under Mr. Hale, had been trying to build tribal businesses while taking an assertive stance on sovereignty.
"He was a very good leader on sovereignty," said Ron Allen, president of the National Congress of American Indians, "on trying to explain to Congress and the President and the rest of the world that we are Indian governments, not just tribes."
But under Mr. Hale, unemployment on the reservation remained near 30 percent, and nearly 3 out of 10 members still lived in homes without running water or electricity.
"I have seen a lot of suffering," Mr. Hale said after being elected president in 1994. "We have to end that."
The tribe has an aggressive newspaper, The Navajo Times, which recently published articles about Mr. Hale's personal life and about his alleged misuse of a tribal credit card. After the articles surfaced, the Navajo attorney general named a special prosecutor, who for five months has conducted an investigation into accusations that Mr. Hale improperly charged the tribe for more than $52,000 in expenses in 1995 and 1996. The special prosecutor, Fred C. Smith, a lawyer in Santa Fe, N.M., was also looking into complaints that Mr. Hale spent tribal money on the woman with whom his wife has accused him of having an affair.
Mr. Hale, in his resignation statement, seemed to blame political factions for his downfall.
"I have never put a cent of tribal money into my pocket," he said. "Yet, there is a continuing vendetta against me on the basis of my expenses."
He said he was resigning to spare his family further agony.
But Robert E. French, director of the Navajo Nation ethics office, said the evidence was strong.
"It came down to two choices for him," Mr. French said. "He could agree to the charges and resign, facing no further investigation, or stay in office and face criminal charges by the special prosecutor."
In his statement yesterday, Mr. Hale said his push for greater sovereignty had resulted in "new respect for our heritage and our language" both on and off the reservation.
"In the future," he said, "the corn pollen bag and the law school diploma can hang side-by-side on an office wall."
In the Navajo tradition, other tribal leaders yesterday offered spiritual support for Mr. Hale.
"Through our clan system, President Hale is my son," said Kelsey A. Begaye, speaker of the 88-member Navajo Nation Council, the legislative body of the tribe, "and we all know as parents that when our children hurt, we also hurt right along with them. At this time, we all need to remember that we are all Navajo brothers and sisters. We are all united."
Mr. Hale will be replaced by his vice president, Thomas Atcitty, until new elections are held.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fell 2,000 Last Week

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
New jobless claims edged lower in mid-February, the Government said today, in the latest sign of a strong job market and a strong economy.
The number of new claims for state unemployment insurance fell to 301,000 last week from 303,000 a week earlier. The reading was the lowest since Jan. 24, when new claims stood at 300,000. 
 Claims have hovered between 300,000 and 304,000 for the last four weeks and the four-week average, considered a more accurate barometer of the labor market, fell for the fourth consecutive week, to 302,000 from 308,500.
"As long as the jobless claims can stay close to that 300,000 level it is a very encouraging sign of a very healthy economy," Gary Thayer, senior economist for A. G. Edwards, said.
The latest reading was below the 305,000 in new claims that analysts had forecast.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE ARABS;
Iraq Neighbors Fear a Burden If U.S. Strikes

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 19

 BODY:
To the Pentagon, the term "collateral damage" has long been a euphemism for the loss of civilian life and property. But the phrase has taken on a broader meaning in the Arab world. Today it is used widely, from people in coffee shops to columnists in newspapers, to mean that Americans do not care about Arab lives, governments or economies.
"I feel insulted and baffled when I hear these American generals talk of 'collateral damages' as though it is a few pieces of furniture that will be damaged as they battle that big devil Saddam Hussein," Taher Kanaan, a Jordanian Senator, said in a conversation today, as people sipping coffee at the Intercontinental cafeteria here nodded their agreement. 
 "When this Madeleine Albright talks about her war 'against Saddam,' the attack 'on Saddam,' putting 'Saddam in a box,' does she not understand that Saddam happens to live alongside another 20 million Iraqis," said Lubna Khalil al-Salem, a pharmacist. "What about their lives, their economic conditions, our economic conditions here in Jordan?"
Such concerns are real in this country of five million, which suffered heavily during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The same is true in other neighboring countries that are allied with the United States, but dread the new costs -- political, social and economic -- that will be exacted if the United States attacks Iraq.
The atmosphere is different from what it was in 1990. For one thing, Iraq has not invaded a country, as it invaded Kuwait. For another, Arab allies that stuck by the United States in the gulf war are keeping their diplomatic distance, at least publicly, with the exception of Kuwait and to a lesser extent Bahrain and Oman.
There is little question that an attack would bring another wave of panicked refugees from Iraq to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey. And there would be a heavy toll in lost business, flight of capital and growing deficits
In 1990 and 1991 nearly three million people were displaced from Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar emptied their cash reserves to foot a $120 billion bill for the liberation of Kuwait. Egypt saw an influx of half a million Egyptians evicted from Iraq and a drop in tourism.
But Jordan paid the heaviest price, absorbing some 300,000 Palestinians evicted from Kuwait. And after Iraq was bombed and sanctions imposed, Jordan lost its most lucrative market for food and manufactures.
"If the Americans go through with this strike, our economic situation will be disastrous," said Leila Sharaf, a member of the foreign affairs committee of the Jordanian Senate. "The whole area's political and economic situation will be disastrous. Turmoil will not be confined to Iraq alone. It will spill over here, in the West Bank, among the Kurds in Iran and Turkey."
"When American generals talk of limiting collateral damage from their missiles, do they think of all this social and political upheaval? Do they have solutions for what will transpire, or are we going to be left with the cleaning-up job," she said, her words reflecting the arguments and worries of many decision-makers in the Arab world .
"I fear the Americans are mobilizing forces against them that were not mobilized before," Senator Sharaf said.
Jordan has sought more than a billion dollars in compensation for housing, feeding and moving the last wave of refugees. Countries that made claims to the United Nations have received only a small fraction of what they were seeking; the compensation is to come from the money generated by the oil-for-food program. This time Jordanian officials say they will simply shut the borders to refugees by force of arms.
Jordan and Turkey, another American ally, stand to pay in other ways. A bombing campaign is sure to cut off oil from Iraq to both countries.
Every dawn, scores of trucks loaded with Iraqi oil make their way to Jordan carrying 96,000 barrels of oil. At current prices this is worth $1.3 million a day. But Jordan pays Iraq a third of that amount in the form of manufactured goods under a plan authorized by the United Nations. Jordan, which has a heavy burden of foreign debts, would have to pay full price to replace the daily supply, which is its sole source of oil for producing its electricity, heating its homes and moving its vehicles.
Turkey stands to lose if Iraq cuts off the limited sales permitted under the United Nations oil-for-food program because the oil travels through a Turkish pipeline, bringing in substantial taxes and transit fees.
"If the oil stops, Jordan and Turkey will be big losers," Sherif Ghalib, an economist with the Kuwait-based Gulf Investment Corporation said in a telephone interview.
An attack on Iraq would not be good news for Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, either. Both countries might come under pressure again to help defray the costs of military preparations and movements.
The Saudis have served notice that they will neither allow attacks on Iraq from their territory nor help pay the costs, a Saudi official said, although they probably will supply some logistical assistance that will cost tens of millions of dollars.
Kuwait, which has agreed to allow American planes to stage strikes from bases there, has managed to rebuild some of its foreign currency reserves since the gulf war, but it is certain to dip deeply into them again if it helps pay for an attack.
Even though no hostilities have begun, economic activity in the region is slowing down. Stock markets in the gulf region have fallen. Tourists are canceling plans to visit Jordan, Israel, Egypt and even places as far away as Morocco. And capital is again flowing out of gulf nations.
"Instability and the fear of Iraqi retaliation are affecting investments and the private sector's behavior," Henry Azzam, chief economist for the National Commercial Bank of Jidda, Saudi Arabia, said in a telephone interview.
Political ramifications are palpable too. Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have banned all demonstrations in support of Iraq, but demonstrators have hit the streets and campuses anyway. The Jordanian police arrested scores of demonstrators last week.
While Saddam Hussein has lost a great deal of popularity in the streets of Arab countries, there is a conviction that any attack on Iraq is meant not so much to remove him but to humiliate Iraq as a country and a people and as a strategic Arab asset against non-Arab adversaries like Iran, Turkey and Israel.
In an opinion that is overwhelmingly reflected in daily conversations throughout the Arab world, Mohammed Hassanein Heikal, an influential Egyptian political writer and commentator, told the BBC Arabic radio program on Wednesday: "The purpose of the arms inspection regime is no longer to find weapons. They have had seven years to do that. Now they are looking in professors' drawers, invading universities and looking for papers. The purpose is to humiliate, to insult and to break the regime and the people of Iraq."
Another well-known Arab commentator, Hazem Sagiegh of the daily Al Hayat, based in London, wondered the other day whether bringing down the Government of Mr. Hussein could prove far more disastrous that leaving it alone.
"There is no point to an American assault if it does not lead to the collapse of the regime, which pushes us to examine the ability of various Iraqi ethnic, political and popular substitutes to his rule," he said. "Unfortunately, the answer is known."
He asserted that in the last six years Kurdish rebels inside Iraq have proven more adept at fighting one another than Mr. Hussein's leadership, and that the Shiite opposition in the south has shown itself more servile to neighboring Iran.

HEADLINE: Tennis Open Drops Caterer After Food Complaints

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Few tennis fans lucky enough to have attended last year's United States Open finals are likely to remember the score of Patrick Rafter's remarkable victory. Yet fewer fans are probably able to shake the memory of the price of pizza in Flushing.
With $4.50 slices, hamburgers going for $6.75 and service often as slow as a golf game, the food fault was the talk of last summer's Open at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens. 
 Yesterday, the United States Tennis Association said it was replacing its current food service provider. It is likely to bring back the restaurant company that served the Open famously from 1976 to 1995 with such courtside delicacies as quiche, panini and baguettes.
Sportservice Corporation, a Buffalo sports-event caterer that had replaced Restaurant Associates in 1996, will not be returning to the U.S. Open this fall. The company had a seven-year contract to provide food at the Open and had done so for the last two years in an association with two of the biggest names in New York's food firmament: the Joseph Baum & Michael Whiteman Company in Manhattan and Glorious Food, the upscale New York company that caters to society, celebrities and art galleries.
Through the years, the food at the Open has become nearly as legendary as the tennis. "I never went to a sporting event for a meal, yet there's such incredible preoccupation with the food at the Open," said Alan King, the comedian, who has attended the tournament for more than 40 years. "It's as if food is the new sport."
In 1996, the tennis association's decision to replace Restaurant Associates after 19 years generated seismic waves of food-world gossip, thanks to the fame of the restaurant companies involved.
The winners in the 1996 bidding included Sportservice and Mr. Baum, who created the original Windows on the World and refurbished the Rainbow Room. They replaced Restaurant Associates, which first made its mark by starting trend-setting restaurants like the Four Seasons and the Brasserie.
The rejection of Restaurant Associates in 1996 was all the more significant because Mr. Baum was once an executive at Restaurant Associates before he left to head his own company.
The association would not say why it was changing its food providers. "We came to a mutual agreement with Sportservice to terminate the contract," said David Meehan, director of operations for the association, who said the organization was "in serious negotiations" with Restaurant Associates.
"The whole contract proved not to be economically viable for us," said Brenda H. Follmer, a spokeswoman for Sportservice. "We exercised the exit clause in our contract. It was a mutual, amicable parting."
The U.S. Open "is an extraordinarily high-profile corporate event, and so the food contract is important," said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads an independent restaurant consulting firm that bears his name. "But it's so enormously complex, it's very hard to do well."
Mr. Knapp estimated that food revenues at the Open were $10 million last fall, when the Open attracted 556,000 paying customers during the three-week event, virtually all of whom bought food or drink.
In addition to food courts for tennis fans as well as luxury suites and hospitality tents for corporations, the new tennis center has three exclusive restaurants.
Last year some tennis fans, as well as the holders of corporate boxes and suites, objected to the prices and the service.
"I do a lot of events, and the Open was even more expensive for us than the Olympics or the Super Bowl," said an executive of a large Wall Street brokerage firm. He insisted on anonymity, saying he feared reprisal from the tennis association.
As for the Open's upscale restaurants, "There was a lot of hoopla about how great the food was going to be, but it was squarely average, and the service was horrendous," he added. "It took an hour and a half just to get salad and soup."
Bill Williams, a tennis pro at the Manhattan Plaza Racquet Club who attended the Open for seven days last fall, said: "It was a disaster. The lines were longer than ever, as if they were serving slowly or they hadn't got the logistics right."
Liz Boyle, the event coordinator for the Citizen Watch Company, said that "on our big night, the food wasn't ready on time." More than 200 guests had been invited to a party at the company's hospitality tent. "They ended up lowering our bill," she said.
Another executive from a major Fortune 500 company, who also insisted on anonymity, described a luncheon so interminable that "we finally had to send our clients up to the seats without dessert or coffee, because the service was so below standard."
He added: "I tipped the waiter a minimal $10, and when the credit-card receipt arrived I discovered that the waiter had altered it to $40."
Mr. Meehan of the tennis association acknowledged, "We did receive complaints," adding: "We welcomed them. No one would ever be penalized because they criticized the U.S.T.A. That would never happen."
"We will re-examine every aspect of our food operations," he added, "so we can give our customers superior service next Open."
Ms. Follmer of Sportservice said, "We did hear some complaints toward the beginning of the Open, until we got the kinks out of our operations."
David Emil, a partner of Mr. Baum's, said of Sportservice that "we respect our partner's decision to terminate the relationship," he said, adding, "We found that it was not a profitable operation to run the restaurants alone."
As for Glorious Food, "we have nothing to say until we've been notified by the U.S.T.A.," said W. Sean Driscoll, a partner. "But they told us they were quite pleased with what we did."
Nick Valenti, the chief executive of Restaurant Associates, said his company was negotiating with the tennis association. "Our plan would be to lower some of the prices," he said.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Developers Join in Project on East Side

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
It is just a hole in the ground now, but over the next 15 months, a luxury rental building with 156 apartments will take shape on the southwest corner of 82d Street and First Avenue, the third project on the Upper East Side by one of New York City's newer development teams.
Named Wellington Tower, the building will replace a parking lot and four brownstones with an 18-story structure designed by Hartman-Cox, a firm in Washington. Its lower seven stories will extend along 82d Street, and the tower will rise along the avenue. 
 The $75 million project is being built by Trevor Davis, president of Davis Partners, in a joint venture with Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, who head RFR Holding, both Manhattan companies. The partnership gets most of its financing from banks in Germany, where Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs, who were born in Germany, also have real estate interests.
"We thought there would be a new wave of residential construction," Mr. Rosen said, "so we started purchasing sites and targeted the Upper East Side because it is an established and desirable neighborhood with little downside."
They are not alone on the East Side in responding to the improved leasing market. The Related Companies, a large rental developer, is constructing a 22-story, 246-unit building at 230 East 86th Street between Second and Third Avenues. At 150 East 57th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues, Bernard Spitzer, a developer and civil engineer, is building a 34-story tower with 145 rentals.
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fuchs had been acquiring office properties in Manhattan before they joined forces three years ago with Mr. Davis, who was doing commercial development nationally, to pursue residential development. They have since built a 103-unit rental at 300 East 64th Street at Second Avenue and are nearing completion on a 227-unit building at 33d Street and First Avenue. They hope to have about 1,000 apartments built or under way by 2000, Mr. Rosen said. They also are negotiating to buy two additional Upper East Side sites where they could build 480 more units.
The partners are among the few builders constructing rentals without public benefits. These include city-sponsored tax incentives offered to builders to convert office buildings in downtown Manhattan to apartments and tax-exempt bond financing that developers secure through the so-called 80-20 program.
Under that program, the city or the state issues bonds to provide permanent financing to builders, who are also eligible for tax abatement from the city. In exchange, builders must reserve 20 percent of the apartments for low-income tenants. But by not using the program, Mr. Rosen said, the partnership has greater flexibility and an edge over competitors.
He said they also build on sites that do not require special zoning approvals or permits. But their projects have faced local resistance. An example is the high-rise condominium the partners want to build on Third Avenue between 77th and 78th Streets.
There, they have been involved in a tug-of-war with residents and neighbors of the Cottages, eight one-bedroom residences facing a landscaped courtyard that sit behind a row of 1930's storefronts, which now occupy the site. The five residents of the Cottages and tenants in an adjacent building have filed lawsuits to preserve the residences and garden. The lawsuits have not been resolved.
In acquiring land, the partners look for corner sites that have been abandoned or are in the hands of owners who can not or choose not to develop them. They bought the 82d Street site as part of an estate sale.
With land prices rising and available sites dwindling, the task has become more difficult and has started to slow the pace of rental production, brokers said.
Rents for all size apartments on the Upper East and West Sides rose 6 percent over the last year and are higher than at the crest of the market in the late 1980's, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage concern. Barring any economic change, they should continue to rise, she added.
Construction began on Wellington Tower three weeks ago after the developers relocated four tenants from the brownstones, which were razed along with the parking lot. The building will have a facade of brick with precast stone and concrete details. It will also have high-tech wiring and amenities like a health club and children's playroom.
The apartments will range in size from 450 square feet for the smallest studio to 1,900 square feet for the largest three-bedroom unit. Rents have not been set, but Mr. Rosen said they would be competitive. Average monthly rents for comparable Upper East Side units range from $1,595 to $5,309, according to Feathered Nest.
Leasing is to start next February.

HEADLINE: 3 Governors Shifting Focus To Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
A few years ago, the newly elected Republican Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were in the vanguard of the movement to cut state taxes and rein in spending.
But this year, even as lawmakers around the country rush to follow their lead, George E. Pataki of New York, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and John G. Rowland of Connecticut have changed directions. Rather than talking about fiscal discipline, they are seeking the largest spending increases that their states have seen since before the 1990-91 recession. 
 Blessed with record surpluses, thanks to the Wall Street boom, all three Governors have proposed budgets that would lavish money on education. Mr. Pataki's budget also calls for large increases in spending on medical care for the poor, while Mrs. Whitman's seeks more money for open-space acquisition, aid to cities and public transportation.
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Rowland, who are both up for re-election in November, are following the classic practice of incumbents fattening budgets to please voters. Mrs. Whitman, who barely won a second term -- by law, her last -- in November, faces a different set of political imperatives. She needs to bolster her stature with a public that sent a clear message that tax cuts alone were not enough.
Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Pataki may also be looking ahead, as each has been mentioned for the Republican national ticket in 2000. The enviable combination of tax cuts and spending increases could widen their home-state popularity and that, in turn, would make them more attractive as ticket-balancers.
In favoring education this year, the region's three Governors are joining colleagues nationwide in spending on schools to please voters.
Hal Hovey, the editor of State Policy Reports, a publication that tracks the activities of state governments, said, "At least 35 states will have elementary and secondary school spending that increases faster than the budget as a whole."
Mr. Pataki, who tried to cut education spending in his first two years in office, has called this year for an increase in aid to primary and secondary schools of more than $600 million, along with smaller increases for public colleges and universities. Across the river, Mrs. Whitman has asked for a $540 million increase for education, while a pending court case may force the state to spend still more on schools in poor communities. And although Connecticut has a two-year budget in place, Mr. Rowland has proposed amendments to increase education spending by $87 million in the second year of the plan.
Medicaid, which has also been a target of Mr. Pataki's, will essentially be left untouched this year, guaranteeing a large spending increase as medical costs rise. And the Governor wants to use some of the surplus to pay cash for $450 million in lawmakers' pet projects rather than borrowing the money.
Mrs. Whitman, on the other hand, wants to put $650 million of her state's surplus into a "rainy day" fund, a move that, in the event of an economic downturn, might forestall unpopular budget cuts.
In New York, where the surplus is projected at $1.8 billion, Mr. Pataki has proposed a $71.6 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, an increase of 7.2 percent, or almost $5 billion. But he will have to negotiate some compromises: the Democrats who control the State Assembly want a far larger increase for education; the Republican majority in the Senate is calling for more tax-cutting.
Mrs. Whitman's proposal for the fiscal year that starts on July 1 takes advantage of a projected $1 billion surplus to increase spending to $17.9 billion, up 5.4 percent. The Republican-controlled Legislature is expected to approve a budget largely along her lines.
Connecticut has a $180 million surplus. Under the state's two-year budget, it is scheduled to spend $10.5 billion in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, but Mr. Rowland wants to raise that by $400 million, for a 3.5 percent increase over the current fiscal year. He will face a fight with Democrats in the legislature, who say that his plan for a one-time tax rebate favors the wealthy and who want some of the surplus to go into an emergency reserve fund.
In 1994, Mrs. Whitman's first year in office, New Jersey cut taxes more deeply than any other state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Mr. Pataki's first year in office, 1995, New York ranked first in tax cuts and New Jersey was still among the leaders. In 1996, New York was first again, and Connecticut was second.
"In New York and New Jersey especially," said Corinna Eckl, the fiscal program director for the Conference of State Legislatures, "they've had several years of serious tax cuts, so that they are already at a point that a lot of other states are just now approaching with their reductions."
Although analysts expect significant tax cuts in at least half the states in the nation, Mrs. Whitman has not proposed any major new ones.
In New York, several taxes -- notably property and estate taxes -- will continue to drop over the next few years under laws passed last year, and Mr. Pataki has proposed using some of the surplus to put some of those cuts into effect ahead of schedule.
Governor Rowland has abandoned his pledge to eliminate by 2000 the income tax put in place by his predecessor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Mr. Rowland proposes giving about two-thirds of his state's surplus back to residents, through tax-rebate checks of up to $200 that would be sent out just before he stands for re-election in November. But even that is viewed by budget experts as a fairly cautious move, because it is a one-time measure that would have no effect on future tax collections.
All three Governors benefited politically from the tax increases their predecessors made during the last recession, making it far easier to cut taxes once economic recovery began. Most of the tax-cutting that Mr. Pataki, Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Rowland did in their first years in office was simply rolling back those increases.
In the last three years, the three states have reaped a disproportionately large share of the Wall Street boom, since they are home to many of the nation's stock and bond traders, as well as many wealthy people with heavy investments.
The states' tax structures help, because all three rely heavily on a progressive personal income tax -- one that taxes higher incomes more heavily. Thanks to Wall Street, most of the income growth in the region has been among wealthier people, so it has been taxed in the highest brackets. That means that state tax collections have gone up faster than incomes, producing the huge surpluses.
"The largest windfalls have been to the states, like New York, where the tax structure is most progressive," Mr. Hovey of State Policy Reports said. "In the early 90's, they were seeing the downside to being so heavily tied to the financial markets. Now, they're seeing the upside."

HEADLINE: Murder Suspect Is Held on $1 Million Bail

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 19

 BODY:
A rootless, unemployed 24-year-old man charged with murdering a 15-year-old high school freshman last Saturday was held on $1 million bail today as the authorities pressed a search for others possibly involved in the slaying.
While the suspect, Thomahl S. Cook of Somerville, N.J., stood silently in handcuffs during a court appearance here and as grieving family members and teen-age friends mourned the victim, Katrina Suhan, at her wake in South Amboy, detectives questioned two men who live in a boardinghouse with Mr. Cook and seized items from the car of another resident there. 
 The Middlesex County Prosecutor, Robert W. Gluck, said his staff was still trying to establish how Mr. Cook traveled the 40 miles from the Somerville rooming house Friday night to a roller-skating rink in South Amboy where Miss Suhan spent several hours with friends before she vanished while walking home alone early Saturday morning.
"We've got a gap in the case," Mr. Gluck said after Mr. Cook was arraigned on murder charges. He said that Mr. Cook did not own a car and that detectives were looking for anyone who might have lent him a car or driven him to the rink. Mr. Gluck said detectives were also trying to learn how the young woman was transported to the ravine behind a diner in Old Bridge, about three miles from her home, before she was beaten to death there with a two-by-four and possibly some rocks.
Detectives are also still trying to establish a motive for the crime, Mr. Gluck said. An autopsy has found that Miss Suhan was not sexually assaulted.
Officials and relatives of Miss Suhan also said today that the girl did not know the suspect, even though some reports had said they were acquaintances from the roller rink.
"There is absolutely no truth to rumors that she even knew this guy," Michael Sciavolino, a cousin of Miss Suhan, said after a wake this afternoon. "They go to the same skating rink. That doesn't even make them acquaintances."
About 600 family members, teen-age friends and teachers and school officials paid final respects to Miss Suhan during the wake, held at the Gundrum Home for Funerals in South Amboy. At times this evening, the line of mourners waiting to view her body stretched out the door and onto the front sidewalk.
During Mr. Cook's brief appearance in New Jersey Superior Court, Judge Robert P. Figarotta asked his lawyer, Regina Sauter, a public defender, if she wanted to enter a not guilty plea for him.
"Absolutely," Ms. Sauter said.
Judge Figarotta then continued a $1 million bail that another judge imposed Wednesday night after Mr. Cook's arrest.
The suspect, a slightly built man in green T-shirt and green pants, stood in handcuffs in the jury box and said nothing during the brief proceeding.
The criminal complaint filed here today against Mr. Cook said his arrest was based on a statement he had given to the authorities after they questioned him earlier this week. He was picked up late Monday night after a resident of Somerville called the police there and suggested that Mr. Cook had a role in the murder.
Mr. Gluck declined today to offer details of the statement or say whether Mr. Cook had confessed to the crime. The caller, he said, told the police that Mr. Cook was in the South Amboy area Friday night and "may have been involved," Mr. Gluck said.
Two men at the boardinghouse, Robert Poquette and Richard Rivera, said in interviews early this evening that Mr. Cook had told them last Thursday and Friday that he wanted to get to the South Amboy skating rink, Rollermagic Rink, a popular gathering spot for young people from South Amboy and the working-class communities near it.
Both men said detectives questioned them today and they said they told them they did not know what transportation Mr. Cook used.
Since graduating from high school in Red Bank, N.J., in 1993, Mr. Cook has drifted from town to town and from job to job in central New Jersey. The authorities said they believed he was currently unemployed. He has had minor brushes with the law in the past, officials said, including a charge of trespassing on a boat docked at a marina in Red Bank in 1993.
He served 20 days in jail in 1994 in the case and a warrant was issued for his arrest last January after his repeated failure to pay all of a $250 fine levied against him, officials said.

HEADLINE: A District Good Times Forgot;
Once Invincible, Connecticut Congresswoman Faces Tough Fight

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn.

 BODY:
The withered heart of this once proud Yankee mill town tells the story of Representative Nancy L. Johnson's political troubles.
A red Stanley Works sign shines brightly into the city sky, but a tool factory below has been dark for years. A battleship-size lot is all that remains of a bearing plant that once employed thousands. Even the few living factories are shadows of their former selves, the desolate streets and shuttered buildings nearby as forlorn as a Hopper painting. 
 The region's inability to pull out of its long, slow tailspin while the nation's economy continues to soar has made Ms. Johnson, once considered among Connecticut's most durable and popular politicians, a rare breed: an endangered incumbent.
In an election year when the political ether seems devoid of overarching themes, when neither major party seems able to gain the upper hand and when a strong economy is keeping many voters content, challengers across the country are groping for inspiration and strategies, political analysts say.
Not here. In Connecticut's Sixth Congressional District, which encompasses the state's northwestern corner from Hartford's suburbs to New Britain's industries to the plush lakeside homes of the Berkshires, three Democrats are off and sprinting against Ms. Johnson, an eight-term Republican.
Already, two of the three have raised nearly as much money as the Democratic challenger, Charlotte Koskoff, did in all of 1996, when she lost to Ms. Johnson by just 1,600 votes despite a shoestring budget of $230,000 that kept her from running a single television commercial. Already, three powerful organizations have vowed to help oust the incumbent: the A.F.L.-C.I.O, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Emily's List, the national fund-raising network for women.
"The last cycle, people believed Nancy couldn't be beaten," said John W. Olsen, president of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Now there is an opportunity to win."
Not to be outdone, Ms. Johnson, 63, who got her start in politics as a parent advocate, has shifted into campaign gear. She has been tirelessly criss-crossing her district meeting business and constituent groups. From late December until mid-January, she ran campaign-like commercials promoting her role in enacting a health insurance law for children last year. And she has been aggressively raising money, with $450,000 in the bank.
Possibly to offset charges that she is too close to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, she has also been wrapping herself in President Clinton's mantle, profusely praising his State of the Union Message in January and splashing cold water on Republican talk of impeaching the President amid allegations that he had a sexual relationship with an intern and then asked her to lie about it.
"Bill Clinton is very important," she told a group of fifth graders at a New Britain school recently. "He and I have been allies on many things. Sometimes party labels aren't that important."
Fueling the Democrats' hopes of biting into the Republicans' narrow 11-vote House majority is the sense among many here that this once unbeatable politician -- before 1996, she routinely won elections with well over 60 percent of the vote -- has become aloof from the gritty problems of her blue-collar district.
Democrats played on that theme two years ago when they accused Ms. Johnson, then the chairwoman of the House ethics committee, of stalling an investigation into Mr. Gingrich. Many Democrats believe the Speaker's conservative views clash with Connecticut sensibilities, andMs. Johnson acknowledges that their broadsides wounded her at the polls.
This time, the Democrats are attacking Ms. Johnson's efforts to promote legislation in 1996 that would have allowed the Stanley Works, among the region's largest employers, to continue marketing tools partially produced overseas as "Made in the U.S.A."
After her measure failed in the Senate, it was reported that Ms. Johnson owned more than $100,000 in Stanley stock, sparking charges of a conflict of interest. (Her husband inherited the stock from his father, who was a Stanley foreman.) But Democrats have framed the issue more in terms of jobs: the policy that Ms. Johnson was trying to protect would have helped Stanley move jobs to Asia, they charged.
"The fact that the district is falling apart doesn't seem to tear at her the way it does others," said Jim Griffin, a Bristol businessman who is running for the Democratic nomination. "There's a sort of 'let them eat cake' aspect to her attitude."
Ms. Johnson denies that vehemently, saying she has worked very hard for local industry.
The other Democrats seeking their party's nomination are Ms. Koskoff, a lawyer and former political science professor at Central Connecticut State University, and State Representative Demetrios Giannaros, an economics professor at the University of Hartford.
For all her obvious political woes, Ms. Johnson may be harder to defeat than the Democrats realize, political analysts say. Charges that she is too comfortable with conservative House leaders may not stick because she is clearly a moderate who has defended poverty programs and abortion rights. They also note that the Democrats may face a bloody primary fight and that Democratic turnout may be down, without a popular President running at the top of the ticket.
"I don't see what the message of a challenger is this year," said Amy Walter, the House analyst for the Cook Political Report, which has rated Connecticut's Sixth District as leaning Republican. "The real issue is: Do people in that district feel she is more responsive? If they feel she got the wake-up call in 1996, and that Congress isn't doing anything bad, well, she'll be tough to defeat."
That view was echoed by Toby Geiger, a United Parcel Service delivery man who greeted Ms. Johnson as "our first woman president" when he saw her on a New Britain street recently. "We like her a lot," said Mr. Geiger, who professed ignorance about the Stanley stock flap. "She's honest and fair. Even Democrats feel that way."
It is sometimes hard to see the seasoned politician in Ms. Johnson. She is earnest almost to a fault, using public appearances to explain dense policy matters to sometimes perplexed audiences. Her large-frame glasses, conservative business suits and short, softly waved hair might seem out of place in a back-room meeting of world-weary politicians. She speaks in a soft, assuring voice that seems ill-suited for making rousing stump speeches.
And unlike so many in her profession, she gets easily flustered. When a New Britain fifth grader asked her recently how much money she makes, her answer -- $133,000 a year -- sent a collective gasp through the room of children. "It is a lot of money," Ms. Johnson said, her face flushing slightly.
But colleagues say her motherly style masks a hard interior that has made her effective on Capitol Hill. "Don't be fooled," said a Connecticut congressional aide. "She's tough as nails."
Ms. Johnson was born and reared in Chicago. Her mother was a high school history teacher and her father a law professor turned Republican state legislator. After graduating from Radcliffe College with a bachelor's degree in art history, she married her college sweetheart and they moved to his hometown of New Britain after he completed his medical degree.
After giving birth to three daughters, she became a leader of the local parent-teacher association, then won a seat in the State Senate, which she held for six years. In 1982, after Representative Toby Moffett, a Democrat, resigned to run for the Senate, she won his seat in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans.
Ms. Johnson makes no bones about her closeness to Mr. Gingrich. Though she says Mr. Gingrich has made mistakes, he energized "a stuffy old party" when he joined the leadership, she said. And she proudly defends her efforts to help the Stanley Works.
In 1996, the company and its executives contributed at least $6,000 to her campaign and financed a $1,189 trip for one of her aides to Texas. But that had nothing to do with her efforts to help Stanley, she said.
"My goal in all of this was jobs, good jobs, manufacturing jobs," she said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
A Chef Who Lost It All Is Finally Off the Streets

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
On good days, when Michael Geda lived on the street, he slept in a cheap motel on the West Side Highway. On bad days, when his panhandling yielded less than the $44 it cost for a room, he rode the A train until dawn. But during his eight months of homelessness, he rarely slept more than a few hours on the train, one of the few lines that remain underground, and warm, along most of their routes. "Either the police harass you or, on bad nights, thieves try to rob you," said Mr. Geda, 61, a thickly bearded man with leaden eyes and hands that never stop fretting. "I don't like to remember this."
There are many things Mr. Geda prefers not to remember, people he will not talk about. Like the son he lost in the Israeli army or the wife who died seven months later. The past, it seems, carries as much pain as the present. 
 Mr. Geda, an unemployed chef, is a ghost of his former self, a man broken by grief. He has a home now, thanks to a garment industry executive and a half-dozen social service agencies that are paying the rent on his Brooklyn apartment. But he has no phone, no friends and, on most days, no money in his pocket. Because he is an illegal immigrant, no one will give him a job; for the same reason, welfare will not help him either.
He spends his days collecting alms in Manhattan's Garment District. When he sees an office or showroom with a mezuza on the door post -- a small scroll of religious text -- Mr. Geda knows the owner is Jewish and likely to help a fellow Jew. It is a shameful existence, he said, "not fit for an animal." But still, he is glad to be off the streets and appreciative of the furniture and clothing he has received from the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. Both agencies are affiliates of the UJA-Federation of New York and supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Sitting in his apartment in Flatbush yesterday, smoking the last of his cigarettes, Mr. Geda described his journey from Egypt, where he was born and raised, to Israel, where he worked as a chef, and, in 1983, to New York, "where I lost my soul," he said.
He said he never had any desire to leave Israel, but an American friend enticed him with a job, a plane ticket and the promise of easy money. At first, Mr. Geda did well running the kitchens of two kosher delicatessens on Kings Highway that were owned by his friend. But one day the man vanished, the delis closed and Mr. Geda found himself jobless. When his friend disappeared, so did his chance of being sponsored for a green card, and as a result, the $2,000 that Mr. Geda had spent on an immigration lawyer was wasted.
He found work at a restaurant, but a few months later, in 1988, his world fell apart when his 24-year-old son, David, was killed during a training exercise in Lebanon. David's body was never recovered, and the loss -- two weeks before the son's wedding -- was too much for his wife, who died that same year from a heart attack while in Israel, Mr. Geda said.
The years since his wife and son died have been a blur. For a while, he supported himself driving a livery cab, but his car was stolen. After that, diabetes and depression sapped his will to go on. He lived off his savings, and when that ran out, fell into a life of panhandling. "I often begged God to let me die," he said. "But somehow, I survived." He refused to return to Israel, he said, because "there is nothing there for me except more sadness."
Last year, one of the businessmen who gives him weekly handouts inquired about his life. When the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, learned that Mr. Geda was sleeping on the subway, he decided he had to do more. "I was shocked at how Michael had suffered," he said. Last summer, the man found Mr. Geda an apartment and called several charities, asking them to pay part of the $500-a-month rent. He also persuaded several of his friends to chip in. "At least we now have a roof over Michael's head," the man said.
When he moved into the apartment last August, Mr. Geda said, he slept an entire week. "I was so hungry for a bed I did not want to get up," he said, revealing a rare smile. These days, his most cherished possession is his lease, which stays tucked deep within the breast pocket of his tattered pin-striped suit.
Gabriela Popovici, a case manager at Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, has been trying to help him track down his initial green card application, which could help him establish legal residence. The agency, another beneficiary of the Neediest Cases Fund, also paid a month of his rent.
Mr. Geda said he wants to remain in New York and is desperate to work. "I would even clean toilets if I had to," he said. "I just want to do something useful, to have someone to talk to during the day."

HEADLINE: Clinton Trip To New Jersey Raises Funds For Democrats

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: WEST ORANGE, N.J., Feb. 19

 BODY:
As President Clinton dined tonight at a $25,000-per-couple fund-raiser in the private home of a major contributor to the Democratic Party, dozens of antiwar protesters demonstrated outside the well-guarded gates of the exclusive Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, chanting, "We don't want a bloody war," and holding signs that urged, "No Bombs, No War Against Iraq."
During his formal remarks at the dinner, in the Georgian mansion of David Steiner, a real estate developer, and his wife, Sylvia, Mr. Clinton did not mention the situation in the Middle East and instead focused on domestic policy issues, reiterating many of the themes of his State of the Union Message last month. But during informal conversation over beef filet and potato terrine, Mr. Clinton said that more could have been done in the 1991 Persian Gulf war to weaken Saddam Hussein. 
"One thing he did say is during the Desert Storm war, if our troops had stayed there another half a day, they really could have disabled Saddam Hussein," Mrs. Steiner said, recounting the conversation at the table where she and her husband sat with the President.
"Of course," Mrs. Steiner said, "the people at our table are very supportive of how he feels about Iraq." The Steiners are staunch supporters of the Democratic Party and of Israel, and Mr. Steiner once was president of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group in Washington. Israel has solidly supported the use of military force against Iraq should Mr. Hussein not yield to United Nations weapons inspectors.
Nearly 50 guests were at the dinner, including Senator Frank R. Lautenberg; Representative William J. Pascrell Jr.; James E. McGreevey, a former Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor; Thomas P. Giblin, the state Democratic Party chairman, and Steve Grossman, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The event raised more than $400,000 for the party's national committee, which is still about $9 million in debt from the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Over dinner, Mr. Clinton and the Steiners also spoke about Stanford University, where Chelsea Clinton is a freshman and where two of the Steiners' children received their undergraduate educations. "He said his daughter loves Stanford," Mrs. Steiner said. She added that the guests were charmed by the President: "Everyone gets a high meeting him; he's so warm and very likable."
Mr. Clinton's motorcade entered the wooded enclave of Llewellyn Park through a rear entrance and did not pass the demonstrators. "I don't have the time, but I feel it's important," said Richard Franke, 53, of Montclair, who is an anthropology professor at Montclair State University and a member of the New Jersey Green Party. Mr. Franke was standing on a sloping patch of grass holding an antiwar placard, near the driveway of the gated entrance to Llewellyn Park, an affluent enclave where Thomas Edison once lived.
The standoff with Iraq was not the only issue on protesters' minds. Stephen Bauer, 43, a janitor from West Caldwell, carried a sign that said, "Impeach Clinton Now," and gave a phone number, "1-888-LEAVE-DC." Mr. Bauer said that he was part of the North Jersey Impeach Clinton Action Committee and that he disliked the President because of allegations of improper fund-raising by the Democrats.
Across Main Street and on the other side of the political spectrum, Dennis Cassidy, a carpet cleaner from West Orange, said he had come out on a chilly evening because he is a dedicated supporter of Mr. Clinton. "I think he is a great man," he said. "Why do these people want him impeached? He's done a lot of good for this country in the last six years."
Mr. Cassidy said he supported the use of force against Iraq. "I think every country looks to this man to do the job that they don't have the heart to do," he said of Mr. Clinton.
In a 23-minute speech, Mr. Clinton spoke to the dinner guests about his record and about the economy and education. He said he had tried to change the Democratic Party and "caused a little bit of controversy along the way." He spoke about international trade as the last remaining ideological battle within the Democratic Party, although Congressional leaders have said that there will likely be no action on trade legislation this year.
He spoke of the possibilities afforded to the United States as a country where religion and government are separate. "The United States has an unbelievable opportunity to sail against the tide of racial, ethnic and religious conflicts dominating the world," he said. And though he did not mention the money raised tonight, he told them, "I am proud to be a Democrat and I am proud of your support."

HEADLINE: Budgets and Asterisks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
John Cogan (Op-Ed, Feb. 18) might have tempered his criticism of President Clinton's budget proposal had he first reviewed the budgets he helped prepare as a deputy budget director in the Reagan Administration.
Included in the 1981 budget was the "magic asterisk," the footnote in a long table of numbers suggesting that the Reagan budget would be balanced shortly on the basis of "additional savings to be identified later." Shortly turned out to be not two, but almost 20 years and two administrations later, after an accumulation of an additional $3 trillion in national debt. 
 The Clinton budgets have typically included conservative economic assumptions, a crucial element in putting our fiscal house in order. Conditions are more favorable to a resolution of the impending Social Security crisis than they have been in years.

HEADLINE: Charles Cogen Dies at 94; Led Teachers in New York

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Charles Cogen, the first president of the New York City teachers' union and the leader of a one-day strike in 1960 that won bargaining rights for the city's public-school teachers, died Wednesday. He was 94.
Mr. Cogen died of Parkinson's disease in a retirement home in Washington, family members said. 
 After heading the city's teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, he was elected president of its parent, the American Federation of Teachers. As head of those two organizations, Mr. Cogen played a pivotal role in forming a vigorous union and a strong voice for the nation's teachers, who before 1960 rarely had the right to negotiate contracts through collective bargaining.
In 1960, Mr. Cogen spearheaded the first citywide teachers' strike, and two years later, he led a short strike that pressured Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. to agree to salaries and other contract terms that made teachers elsewhere envious.
Mr. Cogen inspired teachers with his fiery speeches and forceful arguments, and under him, the city's teachers won contracts and demonstrated militancy that served as models for teachers around the nation. He did this in an era when many teachers thought it unprofessional to strike and when the leaders of most other unions looked askance at teachers' forsaking their pupils and taking to the streets. In addition, state law then, as it does now, barred walkouts by public employees
Indeed, Mr. Cogen was often attacked for urging teachers to strike, facing accusations that he, and the teachers, were greedy lawbreakers who set a woeful example for American schoolchildren. Defending himself and teacher militancy, he said in a 1959 interview, "Students will have more respect for teachers who stand up and fight for their rights."
Mr. Cogen often related that he developed his love for labor early in this century when he went to union rallies with his father, a garment worker and ardent unionist.
Mr. Cogen called for national education standards to prod all American schools to improve their performance. Three decades ago, he proposed merging the American Federation of Teachers and its larger rival, the National Education Association, which the two unions finally -- and tentatively -- agreed to last month.
"Charlie was an extraordinary leader, truly ahead of his time," said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "He helped win bargaining rights for teachers in New York City, and under his leadership, many other teacher unions secured that right."
Charles Cohen -- he changed his name to Cogen around 1930, family members said -- was born on Manhattan's Lower East Side on Oct. 31, 1903, the son of Joseph and Bessie Cohen.
Mr. Cogen, who said he was shy as a child, went to Boys High School in Brooklyn and won a scholarship to Cornell University, where he majored in economics, graduating in 1924. He became an elementary-school teacher by day in Brooklyn, and at night attended Fordham University Law School, from which he obtained a degree in 1927.
Dissatisfied with teaching conditions, he started practicing law in 1930, intent on being a lawyer for the working man, but after three years of struggling during the Depression, he abandoned the law. During those three years, he obtained a master's degree in economics from Columbia University. In 1930, he married Tess Schnittkramer, a lawyer and educator who became a professor at Pace University.
After leaving the law, Mr. Cogen returned to teaching, taking a "teacher in training" position for $4.50 a day in Queens, with no vacation or tenure. He became a substitute and then a regular teacher, spending 5 years at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens and 13 years at the Bronx High School of Science.
In 1959, he was elected president of the New York City Teachers Guild, a 2,000-member division of the American Federation of Teachers. It was one of the 100 different, competing groupings representing the city's 44,000 teachers.
In March 1960, the Guild merged with the High School Teachers Association to form the United Federation of Teachers, which elected him as its president.
Later that year, the new union asked the New York City Board of Education for recognition as the bargaining agent for the city's teachers. But the board balked, and Mr. Cogen led a one-day strike by 5,500 teachers.
Mayor Wagner appointed a committee to investigate the dispute, and the committee recommended a representation election, in which Mr. Cogen's union bested two rivals to represent all the city's teachers.
When contract talks deadlocked in 1962, the union went on strike and 22,000 teachers walked out. The next day, the strike ended, and the city soon agreed to the the first comprehensive teachers' contract in the nation.
It provided a $1,000 salary increase, establishing a salary scale of $5,300 to $9,970, and it also provided a grievance procedure with binding arbitration. The next year, Mr. Cogen signed another agreement that provided a new wage increase and placed the first limits ever on class size.
Mr. Cogen was elected president of the American Federation of Teachers in 1964. In his four years as president -- he retired in 1968 -- the teachers' federation grew rapidly, as it poured money and energy into organizing drives to attract teachers who were warming up to unionism.
After his retirement, he continued to advise union leaders and served on numerous boards, including the Jewish Labor Committee, Americans for Democratic Action and the United States National Commission for Unesco. He and his wife moved to Washington in 1991. His wife died in 1993 at 89.
Mr. Cogen is survived by 2 sons, Joel, of New Haven, and Edward, of Washington; 4 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be held Sunday at 12:30 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: North Light In Winter: Sibelius

BYLINE: By James R. Oestreich 

 BODY:
Here are some favorite Sibelius recordings of the classical-music critics of The New York Times. Compact disks range in price from $15.99 for a single disk to $25.98 for a two-disk set or $40 for a four-disk package. (An introduction appears on page 1 of Weekend.)
 
James R. Oestreich
SYMPHONIES NOS. 1-7. -- Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste (Finlandia 4509-99963-2; three CD's). 
 SYMPHONIES NOS. 1, 2, 3, 5; "TAPIOLA"; OTHER WORKS. -- London Symphony Orchestra and unnamed orchestra, conducted by Robert Kajanus (Finlandia 4509-95882-2; three CD's).
"KULLERVO." -- Marianna Rorholm, soprano; Jorma Hynninen, baritone; Los Angeles Philharmonic and Helsinki University Chorus, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen (Sony Classical SK 52563; CD).
ORCHESTRAL SONGS. -- Mari Anne Haggander, soprano; Mr. Hynninen, baritone; Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jorma Panula (Bis 270; CD).
VIOLIN CONCERTO. -- Gidon Kremer, violinist; London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky (with Alfred Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No. 1; RCA Victor 9026-60957-2; CD).
I AM sorry to have missed Colin Davis's performances of several Sibelius symphonies with the London Symphony in December at Avery Fisher Hall. I am sorrier still to have missed Jukka-Pekka Saraste's performances of all seven symphonies with the Finnish Radio Symphony over four days in May 1993 at Philharmonia Hall in St. Petersburg, Russia. But I know that only because Finlandia has documented the occasion with live recordings, economically packaged in a three-disk set.
In general, these versions are more compelling than the studio recordings of symphonies and other orchestral works by Sibelius that Mr. Saraste and the orchestra made for RCA. The conductor shows a consistent involvement and sense of spontaneity here, and the orchestra, not surprisingly, plays with a ready responsiveness to Sibelius's style, at times lean and transparent, at others lush and billowing, yet with never a loss of incisiveness or clarity.
Other recordings of individual symphonies may be preferable to some here. Osmo Vanska's recent version of the Fifth with the Lahti Symphony, cited above by Paul Griffiths, for example, surpasses even Mr. Saraste's in capturing Sibelius's trademark evolutionary process. Still, Mr. Saraste is a reliable guide through these works, and more: a stimulating companion.
Another valuable perspective on several of the symphonies and other works is offered in recordings from 1930 and 1932 by Robert Kajanus, an older friend and drinking companion of Sibelius's. Apart from Sibelius's own remarkable recording of the "Andante Festivo," also cited by Mr. Griffiths, these documents are as close as we can get to the source in terms of Sibelius performance.
Kajanus was also a composer, and, typical of the breed, not a virtuosic conductor. Several of these items are therefore less valuable as finished performances than as models to reopen a range of possibilities in Sibelius performance (with, among other things, more extreme tempos than we are now used to). Still, some of them, like the mercurial reading of the shamefully undervalued Third Symphony, hold up well.
An obvious exception to that slight of conducting composers is Esa-Pekka Salonen, a podium virtuoso indeed, as he shows in a powerful account of the youthful symphonic poem with voices, "Kullervo." Given the present popularity of Sibelius's symphonies, it is surprising that this rich and fascinating work is not better known.
Another superb disk combining orchestra and voices features the fine conductorial hand of Jorma Panula, the guru now in residence at the Carnegie Hall workshop. Not incidentally, it also features the work of two excellent singers, Mari Anne Haggander and Jorma Hynninen, including Mr. Hynninen's stunning rendition of the saga "The Rapids-Shooters' Brides."
Listeners' tastes in the Violin Concerto will run toward their favorite fiddlers. But everyone should appreciate Gidon Kremer's latest version, with Gennady Rozhdestvensky and the London Symphony. Mr. Kremer's seemingly cool sensibility opens into a deep well of subtle warmth and keen intelligence, and thus matches Sibelius's perfectly.

HEADLINE: Paid Maternity Leave Can Punish Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "U.N. Surveys Paid Leave for Mothers" (news article, Feb. 16), you point out that the United States is one of only six countries not "requiring paid maternity leave." In contrast, 146 countries mandate such benefits by law. Despite this legal protection, one author of the United Nations study complains that discrimination against pregnant women remains widespread. Why? 
 By making it more costly to employ young women, such misguided laws lead to lower wages and restricted job opportunities for women. Compare the United States' 4.7 percent unemployment rate to those of some more "generous" countries: Canada, 10 percent; Italy, 12 percent, and Spain, 22 percent.
As a woman of childbearing age, I am happy to trade a legally imposed guarantee of paid maternity leave for a greater chance of landing a well-paying job.

HEADLINE: H. Gardner Ackley, 82, Dies; Presidential Economic Adviser

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
H. Gardner Ackley, an economics adviser to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and a United States Ambassador to Italy, died in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Feb. 12. Professor Ackley, who retired in 1984 after 43 years as a member of the economics department at the University of Michigan, was 82.
Appointed to the President's Council of Economic Advisers by President Kennedy in 1962, Professor Ackley was named chairman of the council in 1964 by President Johnson, serving four years. 
 Although a believer in the Government's ability to manage the economy through fiscal and monetary fine-tuning -- a belief disputed by classical economic theorists -- Professor Ackley did not favor unlimited Government involvement. As chairman of the council, he did not shy away from publicly chastising business and labor for price increases and wage increases exceeding the Government's guidelines, but he said the damage that would be done by the imposition of direct wage and price controls would outweigh that of continued large wage and price increases.
Further, in an interview shortly before becoming president of the American Economics Association in 1982, he defended the Government's role in the economy as constructive, but added, "Substantial further regulation would be a step backward."
Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate and professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, "He was one of the leading macro-economists of the time." His textbook, "Macroeconomic Theory" (1961), was widely used by graduate students.
But Professor Ackley's finest moment, according to Professor Samuelson, was in telling President Johnson in 1966 that the nation could not afford the escalation of the Vietnam War and the Great Society programs without a tax increase -- an increase that was not enacted until 1968, and for which delay, Professor Samuelson said, "We paid dearly in the inflation of the 1970's."
"He never told the press what he told the President," Professor Samuelson said, "but President Johnson included it in his memoirs. I can't think of a better epitaph than that. It took guts, because usually people tell a President what he wants to hear."
Writing of that incident in 1983, Professor Ackley said the basic responsibility of the Council of Economic Advisers was to provide the President with policy advice based on the best available economic knowledge. The council chairman, he added, "should privately give him his best professional judgments, along with appropriate cautions about the inherent limitations of his knowledge."
Born in Indianapolis on June 30, 1915, H. Gardner Ackley grew up in Kalamazoo, Mich., where his father was a professor of mathematics at Western Michigan University. His mother was a high school Latin teacher. After majoring in history and English at Western Michigan, from which he graduated in 1936, he switched to economics at the University of Michigan to get a fellowship, which he was told was more readily available than fellowships for history or English.
"I also had a general resentment against the Depression," he said, "and felt there must be a way and that economics must be it."
Soon after earning his Ph.D. in 1940, Professor Ackley joined the economics department at the University of Michigan. In 1941 he joined the staff of the Office of Price Administration, beginning an on-again, off-again relationship with official Washington that was to last three decades. His last position was two years as Ambassador to Italy, to which he was appointed in 1968. He had previously spent 1956-57 as a Fulbright scholar in Italy, and 1961-62 there on a Ford Foundation faculty research fellowship.
His other Washington duties included consultant to the Economic Stabilization Agency in 1950 and assistant director of the Office of Price Stabilization in 1951-52, during the Korean War.
Professor Ackley is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Bonnie Lowry, of Ann Arbor; two sons, David, of Bologna, Italy, and Donald, of Williamsburg, Va.; one sister, Margaret, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: IN KUWAIT;
Little Fear Is Shown By Troops Near Border

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ABDALI, Kuwait, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Sipping cardamom coffee in his tent just two miles from the Iraqi border, Sgt. Saad Ashban of the Kuwaiti interior forces said he had no fear that an American-led attack on Iraq would put him or his men in danger.
It has been five years now since Sergeant Ashban took up his post at the edge of the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait. In that time he has watched tensions in the region reach crisis level three times, with the United States sending heavy reinforcements to the emirate in 1994, 1996 and again this year. 
 But perhaps more now than ever before, Kuwaitis appear confident that if Saddam Hussein fails to heed United Nations resolutions, the United States is determined to deliver the kind of military punch that would make it difficult for Baghdad to retaliate against Kuwait.
All around this tiny outpost, buildings reduced to rubble by Iraq's 1990 invasion provide reminders of the destruction then, and the miles of berms and trenches on either side of the border are proof of Kuwait's lingering uncertainties that Baghdad might one day send its troops south again. But on a day when Secretary General Kofi Annan began a last-ditch mission to Baghdad in a bid to persuade Iraq to comply with United Nations demands, the mood among Kuwaiti troops near the border was decidedly relaxed.
"We have a saying in Islam that the Muslim never gets punched twice," Sergeant Ashban said, adding that the 1990 invasion had convinced Kuwait that it could insure its security only with the help of the United States.
To be sure, as the prospect of war has grown nearer, other Kuwaitis have turned somewhat jittery. In the last week there have been long lines at grocery stores, banks and gas stations as people stock up on supplies in case they need to make a run for the Saudi border as so many did eight years ago. Televised announcements offering instructions on how to prepare for an air attack have added to the apprehensions. Fears that Iraq might try to lob chemical or biological weapons toward Kuwait have prompted heavy demand for protective masks, for which private citizens must pay about $200 each.
Special security units have manned roadblocks across Kuwait and new positions outside the American and British embassies.
But today Abdali offered mostly visions of tranquillity. The vast, flat desert, left a delicate green by winter rains, was almost devoid of American and Kuwaiti troops. And the few Kuwaiti soldiers who could be found setting up a position well south of the border expressed no urgency.
"I think they will sort it out today," a Kuwaiti lieutenant who would identify himself only as Ahmed said, referring to the Secretary General's mission to Iraq..
American and Kuwaiti officials have said the devastation wrought by the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the punishing economic sanctions have almost certainly left Iraqi forces too weak to contemplate retaliating against an American air strike with any kind of ground attack on Kuwait. But in what seems mostly an exercise in reassurance, the United States is sending what officials now say will be a total of 5,000 additional soldiers, marines and airmen to supplement the 1,500-member Army task force that is already here.
There are three dozen American combat planes -- including 12 F-117A Stealth aircraft, six F-16's and 18 A-10 tank-fighting jets -- now in place at Ahmed al-Jaber air base. Eight British Tornado bombers arrived early this week at another Kuwaiti base.
But Kuwaiti officials have expressed sensitivities about visits to those bases by American journalists, so the massing of military might is less apparent to visitors driving around the country than the sheep fattening themselves on fresh grass.
"There's nothing to be afraid of," Sgt. Nawaf Khalaft, another Kuwaiti border guard, said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall as Many Investors Stay on the Sidelines

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell for the second consecutive session in light trading yesterday.
Apprehension about a weekend meeting of finance chiefs of the leading industrial nations and next week's scheduled testimony from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, kept many investors on the sidelines. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 8/32 , to 103 20/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.87, from 5.85 percent on Thursday. Trading volume was about 36 percent below normal for a Friday this quarter, said Govpx, a bond pricing service.
Finance ministers and officials of the Group of Seven nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- are meeting this weekend in London. Some market participants were concerned yesterday that the meeting might produce a plan to help the Asian economies. For the Treasury market, which has been supported in recent months by foreign investors fleeing the turmoil on Asian markets, such a plan might stem the flow of money into United States bonds.
Bond investors were also waiting for Mr. Greenspan to give his semiannual testimony to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said he believed that Mr. Greenspan was likely to find vindication in December's widening trade deficit. The trade data, Mr. Chan said, may be a preview of the slowdown awaiting the United States economy because of the problems in Asia.
Still, Mr. Chan said, "The Fed chairman is likely to tell investors that the Fed will not be able to act in a pre-emptive fashion to head off the growth-dampening effects of the Asian crisis due to the ever tightening state of the U.S. labor markets."
The market is also bracing for new supply next week. On Tuesday the Government will sell $15 billion of new two-year notes, on Wednesday $11 billion of five-year notes and on Thursday $12 billion of a new 52-week bill.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.38 percent and the five-year at a price to yield 5.47 percent.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE U.N.;
U.N. Expands Quota for Iraq's Oil Sales

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Security Council today more than doubled the amount of oil that Baghdad will be allowed to sell to buy food, medicine and other goods desperately needed by the 22 million Iraqis living under United Nations sanctions.
The Council voted unanimously for a resolution initiated by Secretary General Kofi Annan on Feb. 2 that raises the current limit of $2 billion in oil sales every six months to $5.2 billion and allows some of the revenue to be used to pay for repairs to Iraq's dilapidated electricity, water and sanitation systems. 
 The resolution acknowledged that "the population of Iraq continues to face a very serious nutritional and health situation" after living with sanctions for seven years. A number of Council members also pointed out that Iraq's full cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors would make it possible for the sanctions to end.
The United States and Britain voted for the resolution, though they have threatened to resort to military force if Saddam Hussein does not comply with a Security Council resolution from 1991 that obliges Iraq to grant total access to the weapons inspectors.
The United States deputy representative, Peter Burleigh, said, "The United States is deeply concerned about the welfare of the Iraqi people, and we want to do everything we can to make sure their basic needs are met."
Several Security Council members complained about Iraq's lack of cooperation in drafting a new distribution plan.
Iraqi officials withheld comment on Mr. Annan's proposal for several days, then rejected portions of it, in part because the distribution of commodities is kept out of their hands, and because repairs to the electrical grid are confined to an area of northern Iraq under Kurdish control.
The Iraqi officials also contend that aging equipment and a lack of spare parts make it impossible to pump as much as $5.2 billion of oil in six months.
The resolution instructs the Secretary General to empanel a group of experts to determine how much oil Iraq can produce.

Under Pressure, Indonesia Halts Currency Plan

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Pressed by foreign governments and by the power of the international marketplace, Indonesia retreated today from a highly criticized plan to strengthen its ravaged currency.
The pullback came in a carefully worded statement from Finance Minister Marie Muhammad, who made clear that the nation would not immediately proceed with the creation of a currency board. 
 President Suharto had embraced the plan as a silver-bullet solution to the country's economic crisis, despite criticism from the United States and other industrial nations that it could backfire and plunge Indonesia into even worse straits. The International Monetary Fund had indicated it might cancel a $40 billion financial rescue package if Mr. Suharto proceeded with the plan.
A currency board would have sought to stabilize the foreign-exchange rate of the Indonesian rupiah, which has lost more than 70 percent of its value since the Asian financial crises began last summer and left many Indonesian debtors unable to repay foreign loans.
The board would have pegged the rupiah's value at an artificial rate of 5,000 to the dollar, nearly twice its current worth, by increasing interest rates and intervening in the markets to buy rupiah with dollars. The I.M.F. and other critics contended that the Indonesian Government lacked the credibility and vast amounts of dollars required to make the plan work.
In a face-saving formulation that nevertheless indicated the power of foreign pressure, Mr. Marie said, "During this process of currency board system preparation, the President is carefully watching developments offshore and onshore."
He added, "In relation to this, the Government will always maintain relations with international institutions including the I.M.F."
The Finance Minister said that work was continuing to set up a framework for a currency board, and analysts said that one could still be put into effect when Indonesia's economy and politics were more stable.
Still, the sense that confrontation has been defused was evident at the I.M.F. in Washington, where officials interpreted the Indonesian statement positively. "I hope now that the currency board seems to be moving off the table -- that we can get back to doing what has to be done in that country," said Stanley Fischer, the fund's deputy managing director.
But Mr. Marie confirmed a retreat that had slowly been emerging in official statements, from early hopes for a quick solution. Such an outcome had been lobbied for aggressively by an American economist here, Steve Hanke. Mr. Hanke, a currency-board enthusiast who appears to have had the ear of Mr. Suharto for the last two weeks, had argued that a board had to be created immediately for it to work its effect on the economy.
His argument was that by artificially setting a rate for the rupiah around double its market value, businesses could begin to repay their debts and the economy could start to function more normally. The statement released today suggested that Mr. Hanke had lost that argument.
Indonesian analysts said the Government's concession to international pressure was a painful acknowledgment that the nation was no longer free to determine its economic policy independently of the will of foreign markets.
"They understand that foreign governments' role is going to be critical because we cannot go it alone," said Jusuf Wanandi, director here of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "This is a very critical period in which external pressure is a necessity to keep us from heading down the wrong path."
Since the rupiah began its slide in July, Indonesia's economy and politics have increasingly been influenced by foreign investors' sentiments and the dictates of the I.M.F.
When Mr. Suharto announced a budget early in January that was based on optimistic assumptions, the markets reacted with disbelief and the rupiah fell 26 percent in a single day, causing panic buying and calls for the President's resignation.
The following week, Mr. Suharto bowed to the verdict of the markets and signed a tough new austerity package formulated with the guidance of the I.M.F.
But he has seemed to resist the full application of much of the agreement, and the currency-board idea was seen as a new attempt to dodge the tough measures he had agreed to.
Yet one foreign analyst suggested that today's concession was as much a bargain with the I.M.F. as a retreat. Given Indonesia's importance, he said, the concessions must work both ways.
"The most realistic thing was always going to be a compromise," said the analyst, Rajeev Malik, an economist with Jardine Fleming in Singapore. "My own reading is that it was a big game of poker to try and get some concessions out of the I.M.F."
Mr. Malik suggested that President Suharto might be seeking to delay an agreed-upon timetable for eliminating price supports on basic commodities. Rising prices have already caused dozens of riots throughout the country.

Tokyo Stimulus Fails to Draw Rave Reviews

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 20

 BODY:
Japan's ruling party today announced its fourth package of economic stimulants in the last four months, but the initiatives ignored bolder steps to improve the economy that have been urged by the United States and other countries.
Analysts said the actions announced today would provide a modest lift for Asia but fell well short of what was needed at home. Japan's reluctance to stimulate domestic demand with big public works projects and tax cuts also set up a potentially awkward confrontation with the United States and other members of the Group of Seven industrialized countries, which are meeting this weekend in London. 
 The only significant economic support was $2.36 billion in emergency loans to other Asian economies, apparently aimed at answering criticism that Japan was not doing enough to help stressed neighbors.
"People were just hoping against hope that they would throw in a bone," said Peter Morgan, senior economist at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. "There were a lot of false hopes."
American officials have been particularly critical of the reluctance of Japan to aggressively stimulate its economy by putting more money into the pockets of Japanese consumers. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin suggested that tax cuts would be an option for Japan. The Government has already announced a one-time income tax cut worth $15.7 billion, but critics contend a temporary reduction is insufficient.
Today's package, the fourth devised by the Liberal Democratic Party since October, included measures to help ease the difficulty in getting credit and to revive the property market, devastated by a slide in prices that has bankrupted many builders and left banks holding hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans.
The package would encourage the purchase of second homes and make it easier for banks to divest themselves of property held as collateral for bad loans. The banks would be able to bundle these loans into bonds known as asset-backed securities, which investors and the Government would purchase.
One measure in the package would encourage companies to buy back their stock as a means to help lift the stock market, while another measure would allow banks to revalue their landholdings and fold unrealized profits into their capital base to increase their capital strength.
One element of the package that analysts said was promising was the consideration of changing corporate pension funds so that retirement payments were based more on returns on investment, rather than on a rigid formula.
But the measures failed to excite the Japanese stock market, which fell to a one-month low Wednesday in anticipation of disappointment and has barely moved since. Today the Nikkei 225 index rose 139.76 points, or 0.84 percent, to 16,756.24. In a further reflection of investor disenchantment, the yen fell to a one-month low against the dollar, which rose to 128 yen compared with 126.16 Thursday.
Announcement of the measures came one day before a meeting in London of finance ministers from the Group of Seven countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
Japan's Finance Minister, Hikaru Matsunaga, is likely to face questions from his counterparts over why the world's second-largest economy is failing to play a significant role in supporting economic growth in its region and around the world.
Japan has been trying to give its economy a lift with as little spending as possible to help reduce its large fiscal deficit.
But Masakazu Sakaguchi, chief of the research division at the Finance Ministry's Budget Bureau, said the Government was also flexible, adding, "Whether additional measures are necessary or not, we need to watch the economy very carefully."
The Government hinted today that it was ready to start drawing up a fiscal stimulus package in the form of a supplementary budget for 1998, according to Kyodo News Service.
It was difficult for the ruling party to financially back its proposals today because the general 1998 budget has not yet been passed by the Parliament. Any special stimulus for the economy would probably come in the form of a supplementary budget, which could only pass after the general budget was approved.

Stock Rally Resumes After One-Day Pullback
The stock market staged a comeback yesterday from a Thursday retreat that ended the Dow Jones industrial average's six-day streak of record highs. The Dow average recovered about half its Thursday loss, closing up 38.36 points at 8,413.94. 
 Broader averages also rose and the Standard & Poor's 500 index managed to close at a record high of 1,034.21, up 5.93 points. The Nasdaq stock market's marginal gain of 1.12 points, to 1,728.13, masked the voracious demand for shares in the initial public offering of Doubleclick, an Internet advertising company that is one of the technology-laden market's newest members. Its shares rose 57 percent from the offering price of $17 to close at $26.75 after trading as high as $31.75 early in the day. D3.
 
Open positions of short sales in stocks, which can be an indication of increased bearishness, rose during the most recent period on both the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange. D14
 
Treasury securities fell for the second day in light trading, reflecting apprehension about a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and Congressional testimony scheduled next week for Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond rose to 5.87 percent from 5.85. D3.
 
Theater Deal Scrapped
Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., the Dallas investment firm that has sought to expand its holdings of movie theaters, ended an agreement to buy the United Artists Theater Group for $850 million from an investment group led by Merrill Lynch. Hicks did not explain why it had ended the deal but said the decision would not affect its agreement with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company to buy Regal Cinemas for $1.5 billion. D2.

HEADLINE: Writer's Troubling Look at Face of Troubled Youth

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
The night she calls "the children's riot," was a turning point for Cristina Rathbone. She was living in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when she found herself in a liquor store among dusty, overpriced bottles, watching a retarded man flee a beating by a group of prepubescent boys. The man used the store as a sanctuary, and the door was locked against the boys throwing bricks and bottles.
"They were so small," Ms. Rathbone said. "They hadn't started shaving, and they had these high, baby voices. But they were the same boys who called me names as I walked to and from the subway. I realized that I, like a lot of New Yorkers, was becoming afraid of young people. I asked myself, who are these kids?" 
 Ms. Rathbone, a 32-year-old journalist, pursued that question by spending an academic year at West Side High School in midtown Manhattan, exploring the lives of its poor black and Hispanic students. She has turned her interviews and experiences into a book, "On the Outside Looking In: A Year at an Inner City High School" (Atlantic Monthly Press).
"I want to get people who aren't really interested in this subject to read the book," said Ms. Rathbone, who grew up in London, the daughter of an Englishman and a Cuban woman.
"On the Outside" uses pseudonyms to describe West Side's students, who must cope with homelessness, drug-addicted parents, their own children and gang violence.
Ms. Rathbone, a graduate of New York University film school who admits she had never even had a conversation with an inner-city teen-ager before her book project, said she admired the grace and strength of many of the young people as they tried to survive the chaos of their lives. Others bewildered her.
She writes about Lucille, for instance, a girl who had attempted murder at least once. During Ms. Rathbone's first days at West Side, Lucille persuaded Ms. Rathbone to borrow a pair of scissors for her. Although Ed Reynolds, the principal, was able to get the scissors back, Ms. Rathbone recalls "being scared to death," when she found out later that Lucille had intended to use the scissors to stab her mother.
During the year, Ms. Rathbone found herself waiting with a student during a pregnancy test, discovering that another was homeless, and hearing another brag about how much money he made selling chemicals doctored to look like heroin. She also heard their tales of being raped or beaten, as well as their dreams of marriage, finishing high school and learning to drive.
Those were the survivors. Mr. Reynolds told Ms. Rathbone shortly after she arrived about the students he had lost in the previous year. Six were shot, one died of AIDS, one had his leg sliced off by a subway car, running from police officers after a robbery attempt.
Ms. Rathbone, who came to the United States in 1984, said she believed she was well qualified to write about rebellious youth because of her own adolescent escapades. She sold drugs and was kicked out of five London high schools before she found herself in an alternative school where she fit. Because of her Cuban heritage, she was often the lone brown-skinned person in British social circles, she said.
Her sojourn at West Side, she said, made her realize that the difference between herself and the students was the safety net of a family with economic wherewithal (her father was a member of Parliament) and well-defined values.
Ms. Rathbone writes in the book about feeling nauseated as she made the daily subway trip to school, not quite knowing what she would find each day and feeling herself inexorably drawn into the lives of the students. She ended some days with a stiff drink, she recalls, and wondered how much of her own background and feelings she should share with students.
"By the end of nine months, I was fried," said Ms. Rathbone, who lives with her husband, Anton Mueller, a book editor, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. "I could never do what those teachers did. I was really involved with a number of kids, but I hadn't been able to have a visible, sustained effect on any of the kids' lives."
She was able to look at a group of young people and see individuals instead of statistics, she said, as opposed to the reflexive avoidance she practiced before and right after the children's riot. At the same time, Ms. Rathbone said, she came to realize that the complex problem of changing the schools hinged on first changing the social and economic realities of the students' lives.
How, for example, do you convince a 16-year-old girl not to have a baby when both her mother and grandmother were 16 when they had their children? Or how do you convince black and Hispanic young people that they can go as far as their abilities will take them when they don't know anyone who is economically successful?
"Our world is as hallucinatory to them as theirs is to us," Ms. Rathbone said.
For herself, the first step was writing a book that would allow the rest of America to understand who these young people are.
"This was the only way I could do it," she said.

U.N. Team Discounts Sites As Annan Lands in Baghdad
United Nations experts issued a report in Baghdad that portrayed the Iraqi sites off-limits to weapons inspectors as less threatening than Washington and the disarmament inspectors had indicated. American officials said the report was irrelevant. Secretary General Kofi Annan arrived in Baghdad for talks with Iraqi leaders that were seen as the last chance to avoid an American military strike.

The Security Council more than doubled the amount of oil that Baghdad may sell every six months to pay for food, medicine and some repairs. A4
 
New Figures on NATO Budget
A Pentagon report has found that the direct costs of absorbing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into an expanded NATO will be much lower than previously estimated, Clinton Administration officials said. Those critical of plans to enlarge the alliance contended that the new figures were a cynical ploy to muster support for a Senate vote. A3
 
Sinn Fein Expelled for 17 Days
The Irish and British Governments expelled Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., from the Northern Ireland peace talks. The Sinn Fein President, Gerry Adams, called the action "disgraceful." In an effort to stave off violent reactions from Roman Catholics in the north, the suspension was limited to 17 days, provided the I.R.A. did not engage in further violence. Hours later, a bomb exploded in a Protestant village outside Belfast. A3
 
North Korea Rejects Peace Call
North Korea rejected an idea being floated by new South Korean leaders for the United States, Russia, China and Japan to join the two Koreas in issuing a declaration of peace. Kim Jong-pil, the expected prime minister of the incoming South Korean Government, said the declaration was the idea of President-elect Kim Dae-jung, and that his Government would propose it after taking office next Wednesday.

Trucks Roar in Brazilian Park
Hundreds of farmers have invaded a national park in Brazil and illegally built a road near the monumental Iguacu falls that straddle the Brazil-Argentine border, Brazil's environmental agency said. The Government was said to be considering evicting local people by force after receiving news that heavy trucks were crossing the park with goods including agrochemicals. (Reuters)
 
Push for Affirmative Action
The South African Government vowed to press ahead with planned affirmative-action laws. The laws are intended to force companies and government departments to reshape their work forces by hiring blacks and others who were oppressed under white rule and are still underrepresented in many areas of South African life. Though no quota system is planned, opposition parties say that the economy will suffer if skilled white workers lose jobs to less experienced replacements. (AP)

Jordan Told Clinton of Aid To Lewinsky, Lawyer Says
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the President's close friend, kept Mr. Clinton informed of his efforts to find a job and a lawyer for Monica S. Lewinsky after she became a potentially damaging witness in the sexual misconduct case against Mr. Clinton, according to a lawyer who knows Mr. Jordan's version of events. Mr. Jordan has told associates that neither the President nor his lawyers told him that Ms. Lewinsky had been named a potential witness in the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit, and that when Mr. Jordan did learn of her subpoena, the President assured him that he had had no sexual relationship with her. A1
 
Government lawyers deliberated on multiple fronts over how to shield witnesses from testifying fully before a grand jury investigating the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. A8
 
Ex-Governor Pleads Guilty
Former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge of engaging in a sham bankruptcy to avoid paying Federal income tax, and he agreed to assist Whitewater investigators examining the business dealings of the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton before they came to Washington.

More Tests in Toxin Case
Two men arrested in Nevada on charges of possessing a deadly toxin remained in custody. A preliminary test did not rule out the possibility that the substance was anthrax, F.B.I. officials said, but further tests were needed to confirm the precise nature of the material. Associates of the men painted opposing portraits of an unlikely pairing: a right-wing radical who associated with racist hate groups, and a former Rotary Club president and bishop in his local Mormon Church.

Judge Titone to Resign; Pataki Gets an Opportunity
Judge Vito J. Titone said that he would resign from the state Court of Appeals. Judge Titone, the longest serving judge on the court, is also one of the most liberal members on a panel that has been deeply split on matters like the rights of defendants and the powers of the police. The departure of Judge Titone gives Governor Pataki the opportunity to make his second appointment to the seven-member bench, which he has sharply criticized as being overly lenient. B1
 
Walking Into Trouble
Mayor Giuliani, whose recent announcement of a crackdown on jaywalking was met with derision among many pedestrians and indifference among many police officers, said that his policy had paid off in the arrest of a mugging suspect on the Upper West Side. There was no doubt of the man's arrest, and that jaywalking was a factor, but the Police Department offered a somewhat different account than the Mayor's. B1
 
Children With Nowhere to Sleep
Seven months after child welfare officials vowed to use their "best efforts" to stop housing troubled children in offices overnight, dozens of adolescents are still sleeping in fold-up cots in New York City's emergency placement building every week, even after the creation of more than 200 new foster care beds. Advocates for the children are asking a Federal judge to hold the city in contempt for failing to resolve the longstanding problem as promised. B3
 
Park Revenue, and Use, Are Up
Revenue from city park concessions last year was $36 million, a 20 percent increase from 1996 and a 51 percent increase over the last four years. Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said that more people were using the parks because they were cleaner and safer. B4

Short-Term Credit Rating Lowered for Hong Kong

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Hong Kong's short-term credit rating was cut yesterday for the first time in 14 years as Moody's Investors Service Inc. warned that the territory's financial markets faced more risk from Asia's economic turmoil. Moody's cut the rating to Prime-2, the first reduction since it assigned a Prime-1 rating to Hong Kong in 1984. The ratings company, based in New York, also cut its long-term Hong Kong outlook to "negative" from "stable." 
 The cuts, which are likely to raise borrowing costs for the Hong Kong Government, companies and consumers, reflect further volatility after Asian currencies tumbled.

HEADLINE: Why Drug Makers Court Consumers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 17 front-page article missed one important reason why the makers of psychiatric drugs are aggressively courting consumers. A company need not reveal to consumers what most doctors know: that its psychotropic drugs may differ very little from a competitor's drug. 
 For example, there is no reason even a highly educated individual with major depression would know that Prozac, a safe and effective antidepressant, is no more effective or economical than Zoloft or Paxil. The drug manufacturers are clearly banking on the consumers' lack of critical knowledge to gain a competitive edge in a very tight market.

HEADLINE: The Accidental Inventor of Today's Capitalism;
Jean-Baptiste Say, No Longer a Villain, Stands Guard Over Free Markets

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
He came of age in the French Revolution. In the spirit of the times, he greatly admired Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. And when the Bourbons managed to get their throne back in 1814, a discouraged Jean-Baptiste Say almost emigrated to America. He even wrote to Jefferson, asking how much he would have to pay to purchase a working cotton farm near Jefferson's own Virginia spread.
"I specify the neighborhood of Charlottesville," Say wrote from his home in Paris, "because it is neither so close to the seaports to make the land too expensive, nor so distant as to present the rigors of a new settlement." 
 The Say family -- there were five children -- never came to America. Say considered himself too old, at 47, to go through such a stressful relocation. (Jefferson agreed.) But the economic theory he popularized in a French best seller eventually made the journey. And today a pithy "law of markets" that bears Say's name has become American capitalism's guiding aphorism. It stands as a warning against undue tinkering with markets, even when they are out of whack, as they are now, in Asia, in a particularly Saysian way.
What is arguably the most famous "law" in economics is just five words: "Supply creates its own demand." Build a field and the players will come. Manufacture 10 cars and the buyers will materialize. That is how markets work. Just leave them alone, let them be free, and demand will automatically meet supply at a robust level. The people who make the 10 cars, or supply the metal and parts that go into the cars, earn from their efforts the income to then buy the cars.
Say certainly believed this. So did most of the other great thinkers in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, before recessions and slumps had been recognized as the downside of capitalism or had entered very much into anyone's thinking. In the opening sentence of "The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith, the father of free market capitalism, laid down virtually the same "law" as Say -- although taking 48 words to make the point.
Say, who died in 1832 at age 65, is one of the stranger figures in economic history. He never actually wrote "supply creates its own demand." His best seller, the "Treatise on Political Economy," published in 1803 -- seven years after Smith's great work -- is full of the concept, but not the famous five words.
"I do not see how the products of a nation in general can ever be too abundant, for each such product (through payment of wages, profits, etc.) provides the means for purchasing another," Say wrote. "The mass of products composes the mass of a nation's wealth, and wealth is no more inconvenient to nations than it is to private persons."
A century after the Frenchman's death, John Maynard Keynes attributed Say's law to Say, and made him famous. It was the Great Depression of the 1930's, and free market concepts were ripe for attack. Supply certainly was not creating its own demand. There was supply, but no buyers. And Keynes singled out Say, making him the foil for his own view of how markets work and the role government should play in keeping markets on track. Keynes was successful, but in making his case, he may have cut a corner or two, perhaps editing Say to suit his needs.
"Before Keynes, the way I would have heard about Say is not that supply creates its own demand but that overproduction is not possible," Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics, said in an interview. He was a graduate student in 1936, the year that Keynes published his most famous work, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," the book that elevated Jean-Baptiste Say to star villain status.
Mark Blaug, a British economist, agreed. "Say seems to us a tremendously important figure, but it is a case in which Keynes really elevated him," Mr. Blaug said. "What he was was a very good teacher of Adam Smith to French readers. In the 19th century, the French learned their Smith by reading Say. He was mainly a popularizer."
 
In Reality, a Model Of Flexibility
The irony is that of all the early 19th-century thinkers, Say was perhaps the most flexible. David Ricardo and James Mill were more dogmatic in their adherence to what is now known as Say's law of markets. And when Thomas Malthus objected to that law, Ricardo took him on far more than did Say, who could see two sides of an argument.
"If in a society composed of 10,000 families," Say wrote, "5,000 engaged in making crockery vases, and 5,000 in making shoes, this society would undoubtedly have too many vases and too many shoes, and would lack many things no less favorable to its well being. But it is also evident that this inconvenience would arise not from producing too much, but from not producing exactly what is wanted."
Say thought such distortions could occur, but not for long, not when people lack so much of everything. "I live at this moment in one of the richest regions of France," he wrote. "Yet of 20 houses there are 19 in which, on entering them, I see none but the coarsest food, nothing to serve the well being of families, none of the things that the English call comfortable; not enough beds for all members of the family to lie on, not enough furniture for them to sit at ease at their meals; not enough linen, nor of soap, for proper laundering, etc."
Malthus, the gloomiest thinker of his generation, is a pivotal figure in economic history, a sort of early Keynesian. He is most famous for his prediction that the demand for food would outrun the supply. He also argued that the supply of goods could outrun the demand for them, resulting in unemployment among the suppliers. Say eventually found some merit in Malthus's argument, and that angered Ricardo.
"The aphorism attributed to Say probably evolved over the decades after Say's lifetime," William Baumol, a Princeton economist and historian, said. "There is no one villain. But what is becoming increasingly clear to people who write about the history of ideas is that Keynes overstated what Say thought. Say in some sense is a victim of history."
Whatever the case, Ricardo won the great debate with Malthus. But nearly 200 years later, nothing is resolved. The central issue in economics is still this question: Will supply and demand balance on their own at a high enough level to put everyone to work? Or can the balance come at a much lower level, requiring government to step in with job-creating measures?
The 20th century opened with the Saysians in the great majority. From the early 1930's to the early 1980's, Malthus and Keynes, his spiritual descendant, held sway. A "mixed economy" became the standard -- part free market, part government intervention. Since then, however, Say's law has reasserted itself. Ricardo's initial victory is reflected today in deregulation, in the privatization of state enterprises, in the expanding global market and, most recently, in the commentary on the Asian crisis.
The Asian collapse is a result of too much government meddling, modern Saysians argue. The Korean Government, for example, pushed companies to borrow when they should not have borrowed and to manufacture too many cars, semiconductors, steel products and other things when there was no ready market for them. The markets, left to themselves, would have balanced supply and demand at a healthy level and Asia would not be in crisis today, the Saysians hold.
"If business people persist in producing the wrong things, for whatever reason, then you can have a situation where they cannot sell what they make," said Deirdre N. McCloskey, an economic historian at the University of Iowa.
 
Adjustments Made by Keynes
 Still, Keynes made a permanent dent in Saysian thinking. The argument evolved in this fashion:
Supply does create its own demand, as Say maintained, but under limited circumstances. When a farmer comes to market with a basket of eggs, a weaver with a bolt of cloth and a potter with a vase, each is offering his own "income" for sale to the others, in exchange for their incomes. Supply and income are interchangeable, and there cannot be too much supply, because the supply always generates the income to purchase it.
"For professional economists, there is this marvelous appeal of the nicely working model, the clockwork economy in which everything matches everything else," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics. "If you believe in Say's law, then you can believe that there is no need for public policy, for a government role in the economy. Just stay out of the market's way."
The Saysian model assumes, however, that people accumulate income with the intention of spending it right away, if not on consumer goods, then on investment in a new loom, for instance, or a new factory -- another form of spending, financed through savings. There are other built-in assumptions. Lacking a role of its own, money is mainly a reflection of the value of goods and services. And interest rates adjust to the needs of the marketplace with its automatic matching of supply and demand.
Keynes changed the assumptions. Money, he argued, does have a role, and spending isn't automatic. When people become uncertain, or panicky, they keep their money, their incomes, in their pockets. And investors hold back when they don't anticipate an adequate return on their investments, even if savings are plentiful and interest rates low. Indeed, investment is independent of savings, in Keynes's view, coming first and generating income and savings in its wake.
 
What if Spenders Don't Spend?
 Supply, in any case, exceeds demand when spenders hold back. Prices can drop to offset this reluctance, and supply and demand can once again move into equilibrium. But if prices get so low that they wipe out profits and fail to cover costs, the new equilibrium will foster layoffs, cost-cutting, bankruptcy and unemployment.
Out of this thinking came a role for government. The Federal Reserve's periodic adjustments of the nation's interest rates are a now standardized meddling in the marketplace with the stated intention of promoting full employment, among other goals. And for all the cutbacks in welfare and other public programs, the Federal Government, not the marketplace, is still entrenched as the provider of unemployment pay for the jobless, numerous subsidies for business, and health insurance for the poor and elderly.
Say would have been surprised. Government had become an obstacle for him. While he welcomed the French Revolution and the new freedom it brought, Napoleon was trouble. The two men differed on taxes and tariffs, both of which Napoleon imposed, and on trade, which Napoleon restricted over Say's objections. When Say's famous "Treatise on Political Economy" appeared, Napoleon suppressed it for a while.
The return of Louis XVIII to the throne, after Napoleon's defeat, seemed to promise more government meddling, and a discouraged Say thought of emigration to America. "I would rather live in a free country," he wrote to Jefferson, "and can hardly flatter myself that this country will ever become such."

HEADLINE: The Little Project That Couldn't;
Others Learn From a Failed Test in Worker Democracy

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: BOLIVAR, Tenn.

 BODY:
These days, the Harman Automotive Inc. rear-view-mirror factory here may seem like just another industrial casualty as it limps toward a final shutdown at the end of the month.
A quarter of a century ago, though, it was internationally renowned as the site of an audacious experiment in worker empowerment. The sad trail from then to now is filled with lessons about innovation, management and plain old human nature. 
 The Bolivar Project, as Harman's effort to tear down the adversarial walls between workers and management was known, attracted research grants from the Federal Government, leading universities and organizations like the Ford Foundation. The goals, considered revolutionary then, were to grant Harman employees increased job security and safety, recognize them as individuals with varying interests and needs and give them roles in decisions affecting work conditions and training.
So many corporate and labor union honchos trekked to this rural Hardeman County seat 90 miles east of Memphis to see the results that local managers finally set a quota of one group a week to limit the distraction. And Bolivar's early successes -- some carefully exaggerated by its backers -- soon encouraged the Big Three auto makers and others to begin drawing workers into a wide range of decisions formerly reserved for managers.
But while other companies have since absorbed and refined insights gained from the Bolivar (BALL-uh-ver) Project, the Harman plant itself fell victim to a fundamental misreading of how employees, especially managers, would react to the changes.
"I didn't recognize soon enough how critical a role the managers have to play," said Sidney Harman, the former owner and chief executive of Harman International Industries, the conglomerate that owned Harman Automotive when the experiment began. "You don't go anywhere unless you get those guys to passionately sign on."
Lacking the training and, in many cases, the will to lead without commanding, Harman's managers were in over their heads once key groups of workers decided to use their new freedom mainly to create opportunities to leave work early. Mr. Harman, who sold the factory in 1976, was not around to pull the project back to sanity. And the subsequent owners were happy to see it die.
The Bolivar Project started with a chance meeting in 1972 between Mr. Harman and Irving Bluestone, a top official of the United Automobile Workers union. Both men had been called to testify before a United States Senate subcommittee about anger and alienation in the workplace. Mr. Harman, whose company was best known for its Harman-Kardon stereo equipment, bluntly told the panel that the main problem was corporate America's habit of treating employees like replaceable pieces of machinery.
"Are you for real?" Mr. Bluestone, impressed, asked when they were introduced. The two men quickly agreed that Bolivar would make a suitably challenging testing ground for giving workers greater control over their surroundings. The ramshackle factory there had been fashioned by previous owners out of three huge, leaky Quonset huts. With its fiery metal casting lines, it was a hellish environment for many workers, and relations between management and the union were often tense.
By 1975, though, visitors here found eye-opening signs of cooperation. Workers were experimenting with redesigning their jobs to smooth out workloads and limit interruptions that sapped productivity. If they filled their production quotas early, they could attend an ever-changing array of classes right in the factory, from practical courses like welding to more artistic pursuits like sewing and piano lessons. They also had a new credit union, a pioneering stock-ownership plan and a free-wheeling plant newspaper called The Mirror.
Labor relations improved so much that the 1975 contract with the U.A.W. was actually completed four months before the old one was to expire, saving Harman the need to build inventory in case of a strike.
"What an experience to enter a factory where everyone is an adult!" Carla Eugster, an economist and union organizer, gushed in a letter to The Mirror after a visit late in 1975.
The fresh thinking about quality of life in the factory also began to have an effect on the town. Mr. Harman's proposal for an on-site day-care center evolved into a community day-care center at a church. Workers at the factory, more than half of whom were black, presented the community's first interracial gospel concerts.
But the Bolivar Project began disintegrating even as its legend spread. Management's biggest mistake was to agree to let workers who completed their daily production quotas go home early. The new policy, known as "earned idle time," almost immediately created tensions between those, like assemblers and polishers, who could finish three or four hours early by working in teams, and others stuck with jobs operating, say, metal-casting machines that required a human presence for the entire shift.
"We were too idealistic," said Michael Maccoby, a Washington-based consultant who was director of the Harvard University Project on Technology, Work and Character in 1972 when Mr. Harman and the U.A.W. handed him the task of designing and coordinating the Bolivar project.
The employees' freedom to leave also undercut the effort to draw workers into classes that could broaden skills or foster social ties. Worst of all, a shortened workday soon came to be viewed as an entitlement. Supervisors came under pressure to bend rules to let people go home. Some workers began to cut corners on quality or even put false bottoms on boxes so they could pack them with fewer mirrors and appear to meet their quotas early.
As complaints from customers shot up, Harman had to increase its spending on quality control. Absenteeism and false sick claims, which declined in the early years of the project, soared in the 1980's.
"It turned some employees into thieves," Lee Woods, a longtime union activist in the factory, said, referring to the lost working hours.
It also attracted the worst kind of job applicants. "When we hired people, the first question once they got in the factory wasn't 'Which machine should I run?' but 'When can I go home?' " said Martha Cooper, a quality engineer.
Managers whittled away at earned idle time as new technology and other changes provided openings, but it survived in parts of the factory well into the 1990's.
By then, the factory was probably beyond saving, though, and not just because of the project's missteps. As far back as the 1970's, Harman had been slow to move toward the plastic-based technologies that were taking market share from metal mirrors. When it tried to catch up, its marketing efforts were not as deft as those of its rivals, according to many longtime employees.
Some Harman employees say that both the Bolivar Project and the factory were doomed once Mr. Harman sold all of Harman International to Beatrice Foods upon becoming Under Secretary of Commerce in the Carter Administration in 1976. Beatrice was a highly leveraged conglomerate with operations ranging from food to luggage to chemicals. It paid little attention to the automotive group, which it finally sold in 1984 to Harvard Industries, the current owner. And Beatrice, which is now a unit of Conagra Inc., had no interest in the worker-empowerment experiment.
"It was a mistake to sell to them," said Mr. Harman, who bought Harman International's stereo-equipment business back from Beatrice when he left Government in 1979.
To be fair, the project had shown signs of losing momentum before Beatrice took over. Once the project had served the U.A.W.'s goal of persuading the Big Three to negotiate more power sharing with the union, the union's interest in preserving it waned. And though Mr. Harman knew many local managers were not completely on board, the resistance ran deeper than he realized.
"They put on a show when the big boys were down," said Paul Reaves, a plant supervisor from 1972 to 1993 who was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the project. "They said the right things, but they would admit in the back rooms they hoped it would be discontinued."
The long decline of the Harman factory has occasionally been masked by strong demand when auto sales were booming. But Harvard Industries, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time this decade, has never had the resources to update the plant thoroughly. Employment, now about 400 as the plant finishes orders and hands off business to former competitors in its last days, was near its peak of 1,250 as recently as 1992.
Would more support and better execution have saved the factory from closing? Not forever -- but that is not the point, according to those who backed the project. Mr. Bluestone, now a labor relations professor at Wayne State University outside Detroit, cited the case of the General Motors factory in Tarrytown, N.Y. It was scheduled to close in the 1970's, but an agreement to install labor relations programs inspired by Bolivar improved operations so much that the factory survived until 1996. "That was a whole generation of jobs," he said.
Moreover, many of today's most praised workplaces reflect values tested in the Bolivar project and refined by experience with product-quality programs imported from Japan in the 1980's. And because of changes Bolivar helped set in motion elsewhere, untold numbers of jobs have been salvaged or made more meaningful. Indeed, worker empowerment has almost become a cliche. At factories throughout the country, it is common to find workers who shut down production lines if defects or hazards appear and operate in teams to parcel out tasks. Some teams even deal directly with customers and suppliers on quality issues, schedule their own vacations and have the final say in hiring decisions affecting their group.
The Boliver project never got that far, Mr. Maccoby said, but its primitive successes reflected its birthdate. "Bolivar," he said, "was the industrial version of the computer built with vacuum tubes."

WAITING FOR A MIRACLE
 Why Schools Can't Solve Our
 Problems -- and How We Can.
 By James P. Comer.
 261 pp. New York:
 Dutton. $24.95. 
 For three decades, James P. Comer has been a field general on the front lines of the battle to improve the nation's schools. The template for school reform that he has helped to develop at Yale -- one in which parents, teachers, administrators and social workers come together to set priorities and to effect improvements -- has been adopted at 650 schools in 28 states. But progress at such schools has often come slowly, if it has come at all, and Comer has reached a sobering conclusion: until society fundamentally alters its approach to education, particularly in its expectations for minority-group children and their families, schools will be able to make only limited gains.
In "Waiting for a Miracle: Why Schools Can't Solve Our Problems -- and How We Can," Comer, a child psychiatrist who is the director of the Child Study Center at Yale, calls on the nation to devise a coordinated approach to support the education of minority-group youngsters by providing their families with better health care, economic opportunities and mechanisms to help stitch together a fabric of community. The paramount question, he writes, is whether Americans have the will to "make the necessary program and policy adjustments to prepare young people from all ethnic and class backgrounds to succeed."
A black man who grew up poor in East Chicago, Ind., and later graduated from Howard University Medical School, Comer devotes a large portion of his book to plumbing his own experience and seeking to understand how he was able to succeed on such a grand scale. He gives much credit to his father, Hugh Comer, a steelworker and janitor, and his mother, Maggie, a domestic worker who had only "a few days" of formal schooling. His parents, he says, worked hard to create a home environment that emphasized education and getting ahead despite the obstacles society might erect in his path. (His parents even gave him the middle name Pierpont, so that the achievements of the financier J. Pierpont Morgan would never be far from his mind.)
Too often, Comer argues, society sends an entirely different message to black youngsters. Their failure to achieve, in school and in life, is attributed to a lack of intelligence or initiative. But while white students and their families can find strength and support in a culture that was transported largely intact from Europe, he observes, the support system for black families is in tatters, a lingering remnant from the days of slavery. "Without assigning blame or being judgmental," Comer writes, "we must acknowledge and address the full effects of past policies and practices and the magnitude of today's task." For inner-city schools to achieve on a high level, Comer argues, the nation must find a way to sustain them with an interlocking network of services that replicates "what my parents brought about for me."
Empowerment zones and other programs intended to spur development in inner-city neighborhoods are a good start, he says, but their focus is too often on "bricks and mortar." What he calls for is a national expansion of programs like one in Baltimore called Step-Up, which provides public housing residents with yearlong apprenticeships in the construction trades, health- and child-care referrals, substance abuse counseling, opportunities to earn high school equivalency degrees and job placement assistance. By getting on their feet, graduates of the program are in a better position to nurture the next generation to make even greater strides, he reasons.
The nation's leaders, he says, should also commit themselves to shoring up the schools themselves by focusing, at least initially, on teacher training. Graduate schools of education, he suggests, could develop a relationship with schools similar to that between medical schools and teaching hospitals, with teacher trainers making periodic rounds to observe and coach teachers in their classrooms.
If there is a weakness in Comer's analysis, it is that in praising the boost he received from his family he minimizes how difficult it can be for the outside world to play a similar role. In seeking to emphasize society's responsibilities, he sometimes glosses over the responsibilities of the individual. Nonetheless, Comer's vast experience in the education reform movement demands that his plea for a sweeping change in mind-set be given serious consideration, especially by those who are only too ready to embrace the quick fixes so often billed as a solution to all of education's problems.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Philadelphia

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS; LAURA MANSNERUS, a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times, lives in Philadelphia.

 BODY:
Philadelphia has been flinging off old mood problems, and its new self should be brighter than ever in the spring, when parks and row houses are draped in blossoms. But every year, those who can't wait celebrate spring's precursor in the first week of March, the weeklong flower show known as the nation's biggest, best and surely most extravagant.
The 10-acre show is held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, a newish, hugely ambitious project meant to revive the city's downtown, known here as Center City. Convention Center or no, something worked. Center City has seen such an infusion of restaurants and hotels that Philadelphians are often startled by the new sheen that suddenly appears one day on dowdy spaces they've passed for years. 
 Philadelphia's reclamation is most obvious in Old City, a formerly down-at-the-heels 19th-century commercial district where coffeehouses, bars and supper clubs keep the neighborhood alive into the night.
Still, this is a city largely allergic to newness; almost always, old facades are respected and old habits undisturbed. Philadelphia's anchors -- from Independence Hall to the cavernous Reading Terminal Market to the Tudor boathouses behind the art museum -- have kept their looks over many generations. It all pretty reliably charms Americans from newer places -- which, of course, means almost anyplace.
 
Events
 The flower show, March 1 to 8, is an outsize, giddy occasion that spills far outside the Convention Center. This year's theme, "La Passion du Jardin," is inspiring French-flavored offerings at hotels, restaurants and museums stretching into the suburbs. The main exhibits will include re-creations of the gardens and topiaries at Versailles and the Chateau de Villandry; the garden of a leading French rose breeder; and the gardens at the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, with some sculpture from its collection. Information: call (800) 611-5960 or check the Web site, www.libertynet.org/flowrsho.
The Convention Center is at 12th and Arch Streets. Tickets, $18 for weekends, $16 weekdays and $15.50 in advance, are available through Ticketmaster offices or www.ticketmaster.com.
Later next month is the city's annual movable feast for foodies, the Book and the Cook Festival. The event, March 20 to 29, pairs cookbook authors and food and wine experts with chefs at about 80 restaurants, where they conduct demonstrations and circulate among diners to answer questions and sign books. Many of the visiting authors will also be at the Book and the Cook Fair, March 27 to 29 at the Convention Center ($15), with food and kitchenware vendors. Information: (800) 537-7676. Some hotels offer weekend festival packages; reservations can be made at (888) 726-6517, and those booking rooms can make dinner reservations at the same time.
A very different sort of exhibition, with appeal for 7-year-olds, paleontologists and many in between, is Dinofest, featuring dinosaurs, fossils and paleontological art. The show, in conjunction with the reopening of the Dinosaur Hall at the Academy of Natural Sciences next month, runs March 27 through April 26 at the Civic Center, 34th Street and Civic Center Boulevard. At a symposium of paleontologists, Stephen Jay Gould will be the keynote speaker. Tickets from Ticketmaster, (215) 336-2000; $15, $10 ages 3 to 12.
The Philadelphia Chamber Music Society has more than a dozen concerts in March and April, with the Mendelssohn Quartet, the Borromeo String Quartet, the pianists Garrick Ohlsson and Jean-Yves Thibaudet, among other performers. All concerts are at the Convention Center Auditorium, 13th and Cherry Streets. For information and tickets ($18 to $20), call (215) 569-8587.
 
Sightseeing
 Independence National Historical Park, the square mile of 18th-century institutions that made up the nation's first capital, is free, 365 days a year. A few sites sometimes overlooked in the rush for the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall: the Second Bank of the United States, 420 Chestnut Street, with its 18th-century portrait gallery (open 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily, $2); Carpenters' Hall, 320 Chestnut Street, where the First Continental Congress met in 1774 (open 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday), and the B. Free Franklin Post Office, 316 Market Street (open 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily), where you can even do most postal business as usual.
A different history is told in the Italian market (South Ninth Street between Christian Street and Washington Avenue). For decades a scruffy but vibrant center for produce vendors, fishmongers and butchers in the Italian-American heart of South Philadelphia, the market is now spiffing up its storefronts and welcoming new coffeehouses and restaurants.
Good eating can resume just one block east, on South Eighth Street, where almost all the shops are Vietnamese, and the restaurants offer splendid $5 lunches and $10 dinners.
At the northwest corner of Center City, the imposing Philadelphia Museum of Art crowns the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The museum's backyard is the Azalea Garden, where the flower show, beginning with the first blooms in late April, is free.
From the museum, Kelly Drive follows the Schuylkill River. The drive's southern anchor is Boathouse Row, the string of Victorian clubhouses familiar for their trim of white lights that glow on the river at night.
Winding along Kelly Drive is a 3.5-mile paved path for runners, cyclists and skaters. Walkers are welcome, too; they can all stop at picnic tables or at the sculpture garden, a collection starring Jacques Lipchitz's "Spirit of Enterprise."
 
Where to Stay
 The 200-room Warwick, 1701 Locust Street, (215) 735-6000, (800) 523-4210, fax (215) 790-7766, is one of Center City's originals, on a peaceful block just off Rittenhouse Square. Its Old World demeanor received a recent buffing-up, including the debut of a jacket-and-tie restaurant, the Prime Rib. Doubles are $195 weekdays, $119 weekends. (Prices do not include the 13 percent room tax.)
Penn's View Inn, Front and Market Streets, (215) 922-7600, (800) 331-7634, fax (215) 922-7642, is in the shadow of the glittery Benjamin Franklin Bridge on the Delaware River. It's a trek from the Convention Center but close to Old City's night life and the historic district. The five-story, 40-room inn is on the National Register of Historic Places. Rooms, outfitted with Chippendale furniture and chintz, start at $145.
Budget: The 166-room Holiday Inn Express, 1305 Walnut Street, (215) 735-9300, fax (215) 732-2682, is just a few blocks from the Convention Center and moments from the city's two major theaters, the Forrest and the Walnut Street. Doubles are $120; if you mention the flower show, $95.
The Clarion Suites, 1010 Race Street, (215) 922-1730, (800) 252-7466, fax (215) 922-1730, should be especially convenient for families: all 96 suites have kitchenettes; some have separate bedrooms. It is smack in the middle of Chinatown, so finding a restaurant or take-out isn't a problem. The building, formerly home to the Bentwood Rocking Chair Factory, has much of its original detail, like exposed brick walls and wooden beams in the suites. Suites are $169 (flower show special rate: $159).
Luxury: The 290-room Ritz-Carlton, 17th between Chestnut and Market Streets, (215) 563-1600, fax (215) 567-2822, is nestled next to Liberty One, the glamorous, glass tower that defined the business district's new skyline 10 years ago. The hotel, with comfortable rooms decorated in a traditional style, is an easy walk from the Convention Center. A flower show package is $215 during the week, $185 for Friday or Saturday night, including two passes to the show; otherwise, $189 weekends, $225 weekdays.
The Rittenhouse, in a slightly quieter quarter of Center City, looks out onto Rittenhouse Square, where, later in the spring, the fountain will flow and masses of daffodils and tulips will bloom. The sleek, contemporary hotel, (215) 546-9000, (800) 635-1042, fax (215) 732-3364, with 98 rooms and 37 suites, has flower show packages at $335 weekdays, $295 weekends. Two tickets to the show are included. Regular rates: $190 weekends; $340 weekdays.
 
Where to Eat
 The thoroughly opulent Deux Cheminees, 1221 Locust Street, (215) 790-0200, formal in both its French cooking and its Philadelphian reserve, occupies two 19th-century town houses designed by Frank Furness. It's impossible to think light here; the rack of lamb, for example, is served with a truffle-filled sauce Perigord, the duck breast with a griotte cherry sauce. During flower show week, the restaurant is open for lunch (three courses, $27.50, not including wine, tax or tip); at dinner, presenting flower show tickets will bring a credit of 100 francs ($18) a table. Dinner for two with wine, about $240, with tax and tip.
Striped Bass, 1500 Walnut Street, (215) 732-4444, a centerpiece of Walnut Street's restaurant row, is entirely seafood, starting with the raw bar and Petrossian caviar selection. Dinner for two with wine, about $200, including tax and tip; lunch, $70.
Fork, 306 Market Street, (215) 625-9425, is one of several well-appointed new restaurants in Old City. At this softly lighted brasserie, the menu changes nightly, offering a mix of seafood, lamb chops and steak, duck and chicken, with beautiful side dishes like creamed Brussels sprouts and roasted butternut squash. Dinner for two with wine, tax and tip: about $90.
Monk's Cafe, 264 South 16th Street, (215) 545-7005, a Belgian bistro, is all dark wood and dim lights. Sandwiches (a favorite is chicken and apple sausage) start at $5.75. Understandably popular are the mussels ($8.95 for a sizable bowl, $14.95 for a giant bowl), accompanied by skinny pommes frites. The exhaustive selection of Belgian beers includes a dozen on tap in the back bar. A meal for two with beer, tax and tip: about $50. No reservations.
Chinatown, which all but surrounds the Convention Center, has scores of restaurants. One small, unimposing place -- lace curtains, 10 tables, bring your own beer or wine -- with an impressive kitchen is Shiao Lan Kung, 930 Race Street, (215) 928-0282. The salt-baked squid and the beef dishes are good choices. Open until 3 A.M. Dinner for two with tax and tip: about $25.
The Reading Terminal Market, at 12th and Filbert Streets, has almost anything to go -- cheesesteaks and sumptuous roast pork sandwiches, Chinese and Lebanese food, soul food and trendy food -- in the neighborhood of $5. Seating is at tables in the center of the market or in the Beer Garden. The market is closed at night and on Sunday, but its sit-down restaurant, the Down Home Diner, is open until 9 nightly except Sunday. It is Southern (try the sweet potato chips), generous (the mashed potatoes) and usually costs about $25 for dinner for two.

HEADLINE: The Gore Guide to the Future

BYLINE: By Richard L. Berke; Richard L. Berke is the national political correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
On the evening of january 14, president clinton summoned his closest advisers to the Yellow Oval Room in the White House family quarters to map out how best to promote the upcoming State of the Union Message.The deliberations turned to a more urgent political matter: how to rescue the Vice President.
Al Gore has been hailed as the most enterprising Vice President in history, but by January, he was looking clumsier than Dan Quayle. For months, Gore had been buffeted by jokes about his mingling with Buddhist nuns with their hands out, his endorsement of a lesbian television character and his off-hand and only partly true suggestion that he and his wife were models for "Love Story." 
 Mindful of Gore's lackluster favorability ratings, the White House pollster Mark Penn turned to the President and his advisers with a brainstorm: On the day after the State of the Union, Gore could accompany Clinton on a triumphal tour of Illinois and Wisconsin. Why not have the Vice President soak up some of the Clinton magic? The President nodded approvingly, and Gore's advisers were absolutely giddy about the prospect. But in the next few days, Clinton's most protective aides resisted: they fretted that the joint outing would detract from the President's role as the great unifier. Finally, the idea was again put to Clinton, who once again endorsed it.
Then The Intern turned the White House upside down. Five days after the Illinois-Wisconsin trip was fixed on the schedule, the White House was thrust into panicked disbelief. Now the very qualities that threatened Gore's ambitions for the Presidency were in demand. Suddenly, it was Clinton who needed Gore to travel with him in a public show of support. Suddenly, Gore's biggest liability, that he was too dull, too much the Boy Scout to be President, had become his biggest asset.
Gore's aides had braced for a yearlong effort to restore the Vice President's popularity. Instead, they found, the recovery was already accomplished. No controlling legal authority? Gore's embarrassing defense of his phone solicitations for donations from the White House had been overshadowed by Clinton's own parsing of words: there is no sexual relationship. Even the most disastrous, if unlikely, scenario for Clinton -- that he will leave office ahead of schedule --would not be so bad for Gore.
In fact, Gore is now perfectly poised for his own run for President in 2000. Week by week for more than a year, he has been quietly transforming the political and policy apparatus of the White House into the most powerful campaign-in-waiting that has ever existed. "You can't be any more disciplined. You can't be any more focused" than the Vice President, says Andrew Cuomo, the Federal housing secretary and a Gore adviser. "You can't work the way he works unless you want this with 100 percent of your being."
The politics of a Gore candidacy arose in virtually every major decision made by the Vice President in the past year. Gore, for instance, insinuated himself into the negotiations over the balanced budget, emerging with measures to help him with vital Democratic constituencies. He has installed a shadow staff that extends into the President's office and the Democratic National Committee. He has forged friendships with elected officials who can help him in 2000, particularly those with similar backgrounds. If you are an up-and-coming politician with a powerful father in politics (Gore's own father was a Tennessee Senator), you're apt to get a call from your new pal, Al. And Gore has made certain that his immersion in policy will advance his Presidential ambitions.
While Gore still lacks the innate political gifts of the man who carried him into the White House, he makes up for it with painstaking planning, discipline and deliberation. That, his friends say, is why he believes he will be the next President. If Clinton, the instinctive political animal, brought the "permanent campaign" to the White House, Gore, the discreet calculator, is keeping it alive -- a point suggested even by his mentor.
"I think that it's a great mistake to understate the political skills of the man with the record he has established in his life," Clinton said in a December interview. Yet in the next breath, the President, not very reassuring, suggested that Gore's strength is other than as a candidate.
"But," Clinton said, "the most important thing is, I think, when people vote for him they don't vote for him because they think he's a great politician. They vote for him because they think he's a committed public servant."
Little did the President know that just a few weeks after that interview, some Democrats would be itching to get off Bill Clinton's wild ride. "Some of the polling I've seen shows that with the next President they don't want to go through this anymore," says Lynn Cutler, a White House official who is close to Gore.
Still, Gore is the Vice President. His power and influence derive from Clinton. So in the months ahead Gore must strike a careful balance. He does not dare distance himself from Clinton, lest he seem disloyal and expedient. Yet he also wants to insulate himself from the actual scandal. And unlike in past controversies, Gore has made clear to White House aides that he does not want to know too much about the scandal or become too involved in mapping strategy. Gore found himself in the uncomfortable position of bringing his own lawyer, Charles Burson, to two meetings where he was briefed about the scandal.
Even when he introduced Clinton at a rally on the trip they made together, Gore's comments were carefully calibrated. It may have been the only time a Vice President's introduction of the President turned out to be what made the evening news. Gore was so enthusiastic he was practically shouting, leaving no doubt about his loyalty. "He is the President of the country," Gore bellowed. "He is also my friend. And I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him and standing by his side."
But ever the deliberate strategist, rarely the instinctive politician, Gore's introduction was no off-the-cuff expression of support. He cast out to a half dozen advisers, on just how enthusiastic he should be. One suggestion was that he ask the country to stand by Clinton because of his policy accomplishments. Another was to blame unnamed enemies for trying to undermine Clinton. Scribbling the final version himself, alone in his office on Air Force Two on the way to the event in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., he decided not to be a judge or a partisan -- and not to give a character reference. He chose to be a friend, albeit a clever friend: Gore left no doubt about his loyalty, yet avoided any direct mention of the scandal: he knows to avoid leaving material for a sound bite some day in which Gore utters the name Lewinsky. This Vice President will make sure of that.
 
Navobs: Thinking About 2000
Al Gore would have you believe that the next Presidential election is the furthest thing from his mind. Ask him anything related to 2000 and Gore bristles at the impropriety. In this instance, sitting in a brown velvet armchair in his West Wing office, Gore responds to the inquiry with an arched eyebrow and a disappointing glance. "It's premature to speculate," he says. Next question.
But Gore thinks a lot about 2000 these days. Since last spring, he has convened secret meetings of a skeletal campaign operation in the Vice President's residence. (Gore cancelled one of the meetings during the frenzy over the sex scandal; his advisers worried that it might look like Gore was plotting Clinton's overthrow.) At these evening sessions every couple of weeks, participants dissect poll numbers and consider topics like reasons for Gore to travel to vote-rich California. These "residence meetings" are so hush-hush that Ronald Klain, Gore's chief of staff, does not entrust aides to make copies of the agenda. Even on Gore's internal schedule, the gatherings are listed under the code word "Navobs," short for the Naval Observatory, site of the Vice President's house.
Gore insists that the meetings are not exclusively about his Presidential ambitions. Then what are they about? "I don't want to get into them," he snaps. "And other people shouldn't either." But the gatherings are part of an elaborate infrastructure that has helped Gore thrive alongside a President who is awash in controversy in a way that other Vice Presidents, like Hubert Humphrey and Gerald Ford, could not. Just about every corner of the White House is stocked with employees who are as much geared to advancing the Presidential prospects of Gore as they were for Clinton in 1996.
The integration of personnel is highly unusual, given the history of sniping between Presidential and Vice Presidential staffs. Vice President George Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, did not begin attending regular staff meetings in the Reagan White House until the summer of 1988 -- after the Republican primaries. By contrast, Gore's chiefs of staff have been welcome at all major staff meetings for the last five years. "Historically, it was always thought the President's staff saw the Vice President as a reminder that their principal was mortal and there was little if any future for them in the success of the Vice President," says Tom Foley, the Ambassador to Japan and former Speaker of the House. The comfort level between the Clinton and Gore staffs, he says, is "of enormous value and importance" to Gore.
Increasingly, Clinton has allowed Gore to place loyalists in important jobs at the White House, in the Cabinet and at the Democratic National Committee. Gore picked Carol Browner to head the Environmental Protection Agency at the start of Clinton's first term and, after the 1996 campaign, he pressed for Cuomo as Housing Secretary and Franklin Raines to head the Office of Management and Budget.
Many Clinton loyalists in the Administration have been converted to the Vice President's cause. In some cases, those staff members have grown fond of Gore from working closely with him. But the implicit message from Clinton is unequivocal: It would be treacherous to back anyone but Gore for 2000. There was never an official purge, but White House officials who had been viewed as closer to Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader who is likely to challenge Gore, departed after the 1996 election. Even had they stayed, top aides like George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes say it is doubtful they would have strayed to another candidate. The result is that there is no one in the White House who supports a possible Gore rival.
Because Gore participates in vetting all major Presidential appointees, his empire extends far beyond his relatively small staff. Erskine Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff, has made special efforts to advance the Vice President's prospects. Few people remember that Bowles was a Gore delegate for President in 1988. At the height of the attacks on Gore's fund raising, Bowles pointedly reminded senior staff members to stick up for Gore in their public statements. (Gore ordered his staff to do the same for Clinton when the Lewinsky scandal erupted.)
White House officials say Bowles was especially aggressive last year in assuring that Gore got his way on an empowerment-zone program and on land acquisition for the Everglades, efforts he can present to inner-city voters, environmentalists and the battleground state of Florida in the 2000 primaries. "During the balanced-budget negotiations, Erskine knew what the Vice President's priorities were," says Klain, Gore's chief of staff, "and made sure they were negotiated as hard as possible."
Consider the contrast with President Reagan's second-term chief of staff, former Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee. Baker and his top aides were partial to Senator Bob Dole over Vice President Bush, who had competed with Baker for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980. On the eve of the 1988 primaries, Baker gave Dole a White House platform to announce his support for a treaty banning intermediate-range missiles.
Lower-level staff members are also helping Gore. Nicholas Baldick, a deputy in the White House political affairs office, devotes much of his time looking out for Gore in New Hampshire, where the crucial first Presidential primary is held. He has also been tapped to run Gore's newly formed political action committee. The Office of Intergovernmental Affairs is so stocked with the Vice President's friends that it looks like Gore campaign headquarters. The office is especially helpful to Gore because it handles White House outreach to minorities, local officials and other key players in Democratic primaries. After the 1996 election, Gore took responsibility for relations with state and local governments. Says one White House official, "I reminded him that Dukakis got the nomination in '88 because he had all the mayors and all the governors."
Gore's shadow campaign extends to the Democratic National Committee. White House officials say that while there is no formal litmus test, they have made sure that top officials are loyal to Gore or, at the very least, neutral in the Presidential race. Gore was the prime mover in the appointment of Steve Grossman, a longtime ally, as national chairman of the party. The party's general chairman, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, also must stay officially neutral but has told friends he expects to back Gore. In a little noticed triumph for Gore, party officials last year named Tina Flourney a co-chairwoman of the party's powerful Rules Committee. Flourney is a former assistant to Peter Knight, a longtime Gore confidant. From her position on the committee she can influence important decisions affecting the Democratic primaries and the selection of delegates.
Having devotees in high places helps Gore in many ways. Last year, during planning of the national summit on volunteerism in Philadelphia, White House officials feared that Colin Powell, the event's chairman and a potential political adversary, would overshadow Gore. After delicate negotiations, the outside organizers expanded the Vice President's role so he got an improved speaking time and presided over an event with Powell. It helped that the White House liaisons to the summit were longtime Gore allies, including Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy adviser.
Gore has expanded his influence in part because so many aides have graduated to the President's staff. Karen Skelton, once Gore's political director, is now Clinton's deputy political director. She is still a regular at Gore's secret residence meetings. Thurgood Marshall Jr., son of the late Supreme Court justice, headed Gore's legislative affairs office and is now secretary of the President's Cabinet, where he is Gore's (and Clinton's) emissary to every Federal agency. Gore even saw to it that Jeff Forbes, a whiz in the obscure but essential art of counting convention delegates, was hired in the legislative affairs office, ready to help Gore when the time comes.
One danger in all the moves is that Gore has depleted his immediate staff of aides who know him well and feel comfortable standing up to him. Only two staffers have known him long enough to address him as "Al" -- Leon Fuerth, his national security adviser, and Kathleen McGinty, who heads the Council on Environmental Quality. The Vice President still turns to a close-knit cadre for advice in discussing strategy for 2000. The attendee list at his residence meetings varies, but core participants include Klain, the 36-year-old former top aide to Janet Reno; three longtime aides who are now lobbyists, Knight, Roy Neel and Jack Quinn; and two other key advisers: former Representative Tom Downey of New York and Robert Squier, his media consultant. Tipper Gore is also an important participant. The meetings are often rescheduled to make sure that she and her chief of staff, Susan Liss, can attend. Another frequent participant is Douglas Schoen, Clinton's chief pollster, and occasionally Mark Penn, Schoen's partner. The only participant with extensive on-the-ground political experience in a Presidential race is a relative newcomer to Gore's inner circle, Michael Whouley, a street-smart operative from Boston who ran Gore's re-election campaign in 1996 and may run the overall campaign in 2000.
Still, the most important member of this shadow campaign is the President, whom more than one Gore aide describes as Gore's de facto campaign manager. When Gore and Lieut. Gov. Buddy MacKay of Florida stood before a cheering crowd at the Florida Democratic convention in Tampa last October, few in the audience knew that Clinton had choreographed the moment days earlier. The President had taken the unusual step of inserting himself in a primary battle by endorsing MacKay in the Democratic primary for Governor. Clinton planned to make the endorsement anyway, but aides say that he moved up the timing to assure that MacKay's supporters would give Gore a rousing reception just as Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington was preparing to extend the TK inquiry into Gore. If Clinton's maneuvers help MacKay become Governor, that could be enormously helpful to Gore in this crucial primary state.
A telling example of the exceptional integration of the Clinton and Gore teams came on that day last month when the Vice President traveled to the University of Illinois to stand with the President. That same day, I called Douglas Sosnik, a White House counselor, to ask about a rumor that Andrew Cuomo was advising Gore to distance himself from the President on the sex scandal. Sosnik said he had heard no such thing. (But he later admitted that he was alarmed enough to interrupt Clinton's game of hearts on Air Force One to tell him of the query.)
Within minutes, Cuomo himself called to say he had been alerted by Tom Downey about the question to Sosnik. Using expletives to emphasize his point, Cuomo denied the rumor. Then Ron Klain called. He insisted that Cuomo had not talked to Gore since the scandal erupted. Then came another call, from Michael McCurry, the White House press secretary, who was in Illinois with the President.
"It's McCurry," he blared cheerily on my answering machine. "All the Clinton brothers are trying to help out our Gore brothers right now and beat you back with a stick." He offered his help in shooting down the story and signed off, "Toodle-oo."
 
Ties That Bind: Clinton and Gore
Worried that Gore might be perceived as keeping distance from Clinton when the sex scandal erupted, White House officials and Gore advisers intentionally doled out tidbits to reporters about the Vice President's energetic role behind the scenes. How Gore called Clinton from the road and offered words of reassurance before the President first spoke to reporters about Lewinsky. The touching moment when Gore consoled Hillary Rodham Clinton with a long embrace at a reception after the State of the Union. His defense of the President at a closed-door meeting of House Democrats.
The scandal aside, navigating between standing on his own and remaining loyal to the President who has become his close friend will be one of Gore's most trying challenges. Gore advisers believe his greatest strengths are his reputation for rectitude and for holding firm on issues he cares about, like the environment. But, they acknowledge, Gore will have to take care not to anger the President by even remotely implying that he lacks some of those qualities. And while Clinton's aides talk about his determination that Gore carry on his legacy, Gore's advisers blanch at the idea that a Gore presidency would simply continue the Clinton agenda. For all his fidelity to the President, they say, Gore is proud of his accomplishments and does not want to be seen as a Clinton puppet.
In a December interview, Gore insisted it would be foolhardy to put distance between himself and Clinton. "I would like to dispel any notion that if I should run for President, one of my strategic objectives would be how to separate myself from President Clinton," he says. "Why would I? I have been by his side every step of the way." Tipper Gore is more emphatic. "I don't anticipate anybody being able to divide the Clintons and the Gores," she says. "Ever."
Indeed, one of Gore's chief appeals is that no on-the-job training would be required: the Vice President could simply move the 18 steps to the Oval Office, rewire the desk for his Compaq Pentium II computer (with built-in television and CD player) -- and take over. But Gore must be mindful that voters not write off his candidacy as Clinton III without the charisma. Even during peace and prosperity (and popularity for the incumbent Reagan Administration), George Bush differentiated himself as "kinder and gentler." So closely identified with Clinton, Gore could not possibly distance himself this directly. But he will have to figure out more subtle ways to offer the electorate the change it always seeks at election time.
The Vice President is not a Clinton clone. Except on a few marquee issues like the environment and investment in the inner city, Gore is usually just to the right of Clinton. He pressed Clinton to sign the welfare reform bill when the President seemed uncertain, for example, and argued for fiscal discipline before the President embraced full-fledged deficit reduction. Gore is also more of a hawk than Clinton. "When we went into Haiti," the President says, "when we went into Bosnia, when 80 percent of the people in a poll said we shouldn't help Mexico and we helped Mexico, he was always on the strong side."
But Gore may find that the requisites of Vice Presidential loyalty hamper his ability to articulate his own identity, particularly as his Democratic challengers intensify their efforts to shape their visions. Gore got a taste of these pressures in trying to satisfy two constituencies -- the President and labor -- when he addressed the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Pittsburgh in late September, in the heat of the Congressional battle over whether the President should be granted "fast track" authority to negotiate international trade agreements.
Advisers to the Vice President wanted him at least to insert a line in his speech defending the Administration's position on fast track, or telling the labor audience that they did not have to agree on everything. These advisers feared that Gore would appear to be ducking the issue, out of concern that he would get a hostile response from the union audience. But Gore insisted on silence. The pressures on the Vice President were complicated. The President had instructed Gore that he wanted to be the one who took on the powerful labor federation when he spoke at the meeting four days later. So Gore felt he had no alternative. "Clinton wanted to reserve for himself the argument he wanted to make," says McCurry, the White House press secretary, adding that "it would have a little more drama to it" if the Vice President did not challenge labor first.
As 2000 draws nearer, Gore will increasingly find himself in these predicaments. While there is no ill will toward the President for grabbing the attention for himself in Pittsburgh, there is some nervousness in the Gore camp over the degree to which Clinton will insinuate himself into their campaign. Some Gore advisers worry that Clinton may not understand that the Vice President has to wage a far different campaign than the insurgent effort that won Clinton the White House in 1992. Unlike Clinton in that race, they say, Gore cannot survive by squeaking out primary victories, or losing the New Hampshire primary. "Every politician is in love with their own campaign," says a close Gore adviser, referring to Clinton. "But you cannot take the Clinton playbook and say, 'Gore, do all the same things.' " Clinton's decision to designate his successor so early also carries political consequences that will be felt long before candidates even formally announce for 2000 -- both in how Clinton operates as President and how he works with Congress. (Reagan, by contrast, did not endorse Bush until shortly before the Republican convention.) "In no small measure, Clinton now sees the election of Gore as perhaps his primary legacy," says Harold Ickes, the former top aide to Clinton. "That has very profound implications about how the President will conduct himself."
The President risks fracturing the Democratic Party, because several candidates representing varying points of view think that they -- not just Gore -- should have a shot at the nomination. Privately, many Democrats say they resent that Clinton is essentially trying to anoint Gore, who already was from a privileged political background. They also grouse that rather than be liberated since he cannot run anymore, Clinton may feel inhibited on controversial issues like entitlement reform because they could hurt Gore down the line. Exacerbating the tension, some Congressional Democrats suspect that Gore does not want his party to take back the House and Senate in 1998. That way, he, like Clinton in 1996, could win over voters who feel more comfortable with a Democratic White House as a check on a Republican Congress. And if Democrats won the House, the credit would go to Gephardt, who could use it as a launching pad for his own White House ambitions.
For all his efforts to boost Gore, Clinton does not want to cede too much too soon. Asked about instances where he has increasingly assigned high-profile speeches to Gore, Clinton makes clear that he is still running the show. "I'm not consciously doing that anyway," the President says. "I'm still trying to pick and choose the things that I think are most important." While acknowledging that "in the last several months he's been out more than I have," he says that it is because negotiations on Capitol Hill and his knee injury kept him grounded last year.
For all of Gore's hope that he not be drawn into the scandal, some White House officials suggest that the crisis has brought Clinton and Gore even closer. In the interview weeks before the scandal broke, Clinton allowed how he often turns to his Vice President in the roughest times. "In the last five years, when I've had difficulties -- and there have been some," the President says, "I've always encouraged him to be absolutely candid with me and give me his best advice. We have a partnership and we're personal friends and we trust each other enough to be candid."
But friendship notwithstanding, there will inevitably be tense moments between a President who does not want his final years in office mired in scandal -- and a Vice President who cannot afford to soil his own Boy Scout image as he launches his own campaign.
 
Making Friends
When Gore faced the onslaught last year over his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign, the Sunday news programs had little luck finding fellow Democrats in Congress who would defend the Vice President publicly. Asked why, Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, laughed. "Warm and fuzzy he's not."
Indeed, while Gore served 16 years in the House and Senate, he was known as a loner and made few deep and lasting personal friendships. But as aptly demonstrated by Clinton, and Bush before him, you need to collect devoted friends -- lots of them -- to become President. Had more Congressional Democrats been willing to defend Gore last year, he may have had some success in countering the withering and prolonged attacks about the legality of his telephone solicitations from the White House.
Knowing that he needs more friends to win the Presidency , Gore has mounted an aggressive effort to expand his relationships. Building that network will help him scare off rivals by amassing the $35 million -- the maximum amount Presidential candidates can spend if they accept Federal subsidies -- he expects to raise for the primaries. But for Gore, unlike Clinton, making friends sometimes seems more like a strategic and deliberate enterprise than a personal imperative. Ask Clinton about New Hampshire, and he launches into a commentary about the coffee shop in Concord and reels off the names of a string of active Democrats in that primary state. Ask Gore, and he discusses Democratic constituencies in analytical terms, like how his message may work in growing high-tech regions of the state.
Gore has been most comfortable cultivating politicians with similar political and personal backgrounds. In many instances, Gore, who is 49, gets on better with the sons than with their fathers, some of whom he collided with during his brash bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. What better way to win the approval -- and political support -- of the fathers than by wooing the sons?
When Gore was running in the New York primary, Gov. Mario Cuomo condemned his campaign style as "terribly dangerous." But Gore has since become close friends with Cuomo's son, Andrew. "Who remembers that?" the younger Cuomo now says of Gore's 1988 campaign in New York. "2000 will be 12 years ago. In this business, that's three lifetimes ago." Gore's advisers say that as Housing Secretary, Cuomo will be especially helpful in winning over urban voters important in the Democratic primaries. They also believe that with Cuomo's New York connections, Gore will have an easier ride in the state than last time, when he came in a distant third behind Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
Gore has made a special effort to advise and campaign for Jackson's son, Jesse Jackson Jr., who was elected to Congress from Chicago in 1995. On a recent trip to Chicago, Gore instructed his aides to go out of their way to create a Vice Presidential event in Jackson's district. "When I did my first appearance on 'Meet the Press,' the first call I got was from the Vice President saying I did a great job," says the younger Jackson. Jesse Jackson senior is mulling over running for President again himself. But Gore's advisers say that if the Vice President at least maintains good relations with the family, Jackson will be less likely to attack Gore and erode his support among minorities.
And Gore, well aware that Clinton turned to a corps of veteran politicians in Chicago to help run his 1992 campaign, has also been cultivating a relationship with the sons of the late Mayor Richard Daley. Gore was instrumental in Bill Daley's appointment as Secretary of Commerce. Ever so quietly, Gore has been just as singleminded in establishing a friendship with another Daley son, Mayor Richard M. Daley, and his wife, Maggie. The Vice President and his wife flew to Chicago for what he describes as "a great weekend" last August. The agenda featured no public events -- only schmoozing. The Gores arrived on a Saturday, and kicked off their visit with the Daleys with a boat trip along the Chicago River. That evening the couples went to the Goodman Theater to see "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom." Sunday morning, they went to the House of Blues for breakfast and blues music. The payoff came earlier than even Gore's aides expected. They were stunned last month when Daley became the first big-city Mayor to endorse Gore -- even though the Vice President is at least a year off from announcing his candidacy. "I'm for Al Gore," Daley said off-handedly to a reporter. "I endorse him."
Gore has never been particularly close to the Kennedys. But in a move to build bona fides with liberals, he asked another famous son, Representative Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts, to formally nominate him at the Democratic convention in 1996. The Vice President has also befriended Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a young Tennessee Democrat who succeeded his father in 1996. Because of his friendship with Gore, Ford did something few other members would dare do, particularly at age 27. Last December, Ford publicly scolded Gephardt, who heads his caucus, for challenging the President and Vice President in a speech.
The Vice President also saw to it that Colin Powell's son, Michael, was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission last fall, taking in the unusual step of swearing in Powell himself. The gesture may be remembered should Colin Powell think again about running for President.
Gore's new friendship with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is the most unexpected. For years, Harkin aides say, the Senator privately referred to Gore as Prince Albert, the moniker created by cartoonist Garry Trudeau mocking the Vice President's pampered upbringing.
That was then. Now Harkin's wife, Ruth, is very close to Tipper Gore. And Harkin said the Vice President looked out for his wife when she was president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Harkin is returning the favor: he has practically turned over his Iowa campaign operation to Gore -- a treasure, given the importance of the state's caucuses.
 
Policy As Good Politics
Clinton says Gore should not "overabsorb" himself in politics, because his immersion in policy is his most important political strength. "In terms of his future," Clinton says, "his ability to continue to demonstrate that he has accomplished more in the position he has than anyone else who ever had that position in history is by far the most important thing. It's more important than today's headlines or who else is doing what -- or even who else decides to run."
The President says Gore would have "a good leg up" on the Democratic nomination. Head and shoulders would be more accurate. In this century, only two Vice Presidents sought and were denied their party's Presidential nomination: John Nance Garner in 1940 and Alben Barkley in 1952. And neither was very aggressive in harnessing the power of the Vice Presidency as a campaign vehicle.
With Clinton distracted by subpoenas and the drumbeat of relevations, the Vice President has had even greater opportunity to distinguish himself by advancing the White House agenda. Just days after the Intern scandal broke, Gore touted new funding for cancer research, flew to California to announce new jobs "for the 21st century" and announced plans to travel to South Africa next week.
"Bill Clinton is going to turn the Presidency over to Al Gore before he leaves," says Dick Morris, an architect of Clinton's re-election. "Areas where Al Gore makes the decisions -- and the President rubber-stamps -- are science, technology, NASA, telecommunications, the environment, family leave, tobacco, nuclear dealings with the Russians, media violence, the Internet, privacy issues and, of course, reinventing Government. That's about a third of the Administration." In recent months, Gore, who describes Morris as "a brilliant strategist," has claimed other issues. They include a proposed medical bill of rights, expanded after-school care, organ donor transplants, juvenile justice and working with civic organizations to help welfare recipients manage the transition to employment.
While Gore contends that he is driven by policy and not politics, others in the White House say he has gone out of his way to boost himself with important Democratic constituencies. Last year's budget accord had something for everyone: For governors, Gore fought to eliminate the Medicaid per capita cap, which they opposed. For the poor, he made sure that recipients of earned income tax credits got their full benefits. For labor, he won several provisions, including assurances that workfare jobs are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. And for mayors, he pushed for the financing of another round of empowerment-zone tax breaks in inner cities and the extension of credits for contaminated urban "brownfields."
"It was a pivotal moment in the year," says Klain, Gore's chief of staff, adding that it was critical that Gore "get recognition for important pieces of the balanced-budget agreement." Another White House official, speaking anonymously, is more blunt: "Gore walked away with blacks, Hispanics, mayors and governors -- all thinking he did them this great service."
With an eye to 2000, Clinton joined Gore last year in blocking a plan by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas intended to streamline applications for public assistance. More than denying a political victory to Bush, a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination, the move helped Gore woo labor groups. A crucial opponent of the Texas plan was Gerald McEntee, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Gore has focused particularly on the pivotal primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire. Last fall, he managed to unearth $250 million in Federal Medicaid money for New Hampshire that the state did not expect. In Iowa, Gore fought for but failed to convince Congressional Republicans to extend past 2000 a highly lucrative tax credit for producers of ethanol, the corn-based fuel produced in the state.
Gore's highest priority is California, No. 1 in population, political prominence and fund raising. Gore has been attentive to Georgia because its primary comes soon after Iowa and New Hampshire. Florida is also critical because Clinton moved it to the Democratic column in 1996. Gore visits New York frequently, not only because it is a big state and important for fund raising, but because he knows his showing will be compared with his poor showing there in 1988. Gore is also tending to the three Middle Western states so important in both the primaries and the general election: Illinois, Ohio and Michigan.
The Vice President has also become the Administration's No. 1 bestower of bounty from Washington. Whenever Gore arrives in a city, he holds a news conference and with fanfare announces millions in Federal spending. The result, typically, is flattering local coverage, as in Florida recently, when The St. Petersburg Times trumpeted in huge type "Gore Delivers Housing Funds."
 
The Future
Terence McAuliffe, a Washington lawyer who was Clinton's chief fund raiser in the 1996 campaign, is so close to Gephardt that the Congressman was in his wedding and on Christmas morning in 1993 appeared at his door with a golden retriever puppy. Even so, Clinton's aides winced when McAuliffe showed up for a meeting in the Oval Office with a leather binder embossed with Gephardt's name and a Congressional seal. The next day, Klain, Gore's chief of staff, delivered McAuliffe a new binder, this one with the Vice Presidential seal and Gore's name. "Dear Terry," read the note from Klain, according to McAuliffe, "The Vice President specifically asked that I send this gift to you so the next time you're meeting in the Oval, you have the appropriate equipment."
Gore's advisers were so intent on adding McAuliffe's name to the Vice President's Christmas card list last year that he received eight identical cards from Gore. The wooing may pay off: McAuliffe is not expected to run Gore's fund-raising operation, but he is not expected to help Gephardt either. For Gore, that is a coup.
Beneath the friendly courtship is a deep preoccupation, even obsession, about Gephardt at the White House. Gore loyalists view Gephardt as the Vice President's most formidable rival for the nomination because he is popular among liberal constituencies that are important in the primaries, particularly unions. Gephardt has maintained his ties in Iowa since winning the caucuses there in 1988. Most important, no other Democrat has surfaced who seems as committed to taking on Gore. As a result, Gore is increasingly straying from his centrist ideology. "Any time Gephardt sticks his head out," says one Gore aide, "we pound it down."
Fretting about Gephardt, while understandable, seems premature. Every time Gephardt goads the Administration and Gore or his minions react, Gephardt gets more exposure. It could be that Gephardt's presence is good for Gore because it keeps out more appealing, fresh-faced contenders. "Maybe we want Gephardt," acknowledges a close Gore adviser. "You know where he's coming from. He takes up room. It's like the Clinton campaign hoping to get Bob Dole because you know Bob Dole." Perhaps Gore's advisers should heed the lesson from 1984, when former Vice President Walter Mondale devoted his energies to weakening Senator John Glenn of Ohio. Mondale's most threatening rival came out of nowhere: Senator Gary Hart of Colorado.
Yet it seems as though Gore cannot resist. Gore and Gephardt competed brutally in 1988 and the aftertaste lingers. "It's a fundamental competitive thing," says Roy Neel, one of Gore's confidants. Gephardt's advisers, he says, were "furious that Al Gore had come in and destroyed their strategy to be the alternative to Mike Dukakis."
Beyond Gephardt, there is no consensus in the Gore camp over who might pose the biggest threat. They are eyeing former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey because he could run as the clean Government outsider; he is popular with the press and could probably raise enough money to be competitive. Gore advisers are also watching Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska because he has endured Presidential primaries before and may appeal to the same centrist voters that are attracted to Gore. For now, Gore advisers think the possible candidacies of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Jesse Jackson may be helpful because they would eat into Gephardt's liberal base. There is the possibility that if further sex-scandal revelations paralyze the Administration, that could embolden others to take on Gore.
The principal goal of Gore's advisers is to discourage competitors and put down any development that could weaken the sense of Gore inevitability. So intent on killing off competition is he that Gore met late last year with Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and suggested he not to run. The move made the Vice President appear a bit desperate -- and overly preoccupied with the primaries -- given that Dean is Governor of a tiny state (albeit a neighbor to New Hampshire) that lacks the resources to mount a vigorous race. Dean decided not to go forward, citing concerns in his state, while Gore advisers boasted that their effort paid off.
The Vice President's advisers had hoped they could eliminate his primary competition the way the White House did for Clinton in 1996. But many Democrats view Gore as too vulnerable for that to happen. Whatever the field, it will not be enough for Gore to barely cross the finish line; he will need to score big in the early primaries. Gore advisers are particularly concerned about the early Iowa caucuses because the Vice President did not compete there in 1988 and the caucuses, always unpredictable, play to the strengths of campaigns more geared to grass-roots organizing.
As much as Gore wants to win over the liberals who count so much in the primaries, he will have to be careful not to move too far left. To do so runs the standard risk of giving general-election ammunition to Republicans who could portray him as left wing and, worse yet, a panderer.
While his shadow campaign in the White House is of immense value, Gore needs to broaden the scope whom he brings into his orbit. His residence meetings bring together an inbred group of trusted advisers. He lacks a James Carville-style adviser who can develop a compelling message of why Al Gore should be President. Mike Murphy, a Republican image maker, is eager to offer hostile definitions: "Reorganizing Government to fire 2,000 employees, helping the Republicans cut welfare and increasing the Internet bandwidth," Murphy says, "is not a red-hot message to take into the Democratic primaries."
But the biggest danger for Gore is that there will be moments when he has to act swiftly, when he may not have time to consider every possible angle or plot out every strategy -- when he will have no choice but to respond spontaneously, using his instincts and not just his intellect. When he abandoned his usual preparedness and hurried into the White House press room last March, Gore was an utter failure in trying to defend his phone solicitations from the White House. Gore's path to the nomination will not be easy, because his vaunted discipline and preparation cannot always compensate for his weaknesses as a campaigner. "If he makes another big mistake in the near term, people may start saying he's mistake prone," says Tony Podesta, a Democratic strategist who sometimes advises Gore. "Everybody's watching to see how he does with the next bump in the road and how quickly he recovers."
Controversy seems to always send Gore retreating into his shell. Gore's advisers say he was so nervous about being asked about campaign finance that he put off being interviewed for this article for five months, until his fund-raising behavior was essentially cleared by Attorney General Janet Reno. Likewise, he would not consent to even one question about the Lewinsky case.
There is, of course, another scenario entertained by some prominent Democrats, but that is verboten at the White House: that Clinton will be forced to resign, leaving the top job to his loyal No. 2. Hours after the scandal broke, Democrats went as far as to speculate publicly about whom Gore might consider as his Vice President. (The names that kept coming up: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and Gephardt.) But Gore's advisers feel far more comfortable talking about 2000. Barring an economic collapse, Gore seems destined to be his party's nominee. That perception brings new difficulties: Gore will be the target of choice in the Democratic field. Neel, for one, is bracing for political warfare. "Believe me, it won't only be about Dick Gephardt and Al Gore in 2000," he says. "It'll be about Bob Kerrey and John Kerry. It'll be about Bill Bradley and some other so-called reformer. This is not a friendly process. It is miserably adversarial and often petty. Enemies will be created."
Then, if Gore is lucky, will come the general election. If he makes it that far, the historical odds for Gore are not encouraging, at least until recently. Since Martin Van Buren in 1836, only one sitting Vice President has been elected President: George Bush.

Washing Our Dishes

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
"She was a straight shooter -- and she had great dish," the book agent Lucianne Goldberg told Time magazine about her friend Linda Tripp, who accepted Ms Goldberg's advice to tape-record conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky. To The New Yorker's Jane Mayer, the literary agent explained: "I did it because it's . . .fascinating! I love dish! I live for dish!"
A language column's responsibility is to interpret, without taking sides or making moral judgments, the words churned up in the coverage of a story that has gripped the nation by its belt. What, then, does the noun dish signify? 
 Certainly not its standard English meaning, "a slightly concave plate on which to serve food." From that sense came its colloquial verb usage, to dish it out, meaning not just "to serve" but also "to administer punishment." Also from that sense of a plateful of food -- this time delicious -- comes the old slang usage "she's some dish," a lip-smacking compliment, as well as the adjective dishy, chiefly British, meaning "attractive," first spotted in The Sunday Telegraph in 1961: "He encountered the dishy St. Tropezienne on his holiday."
Nor does the current term, as used by the dish-loving Lucy, find its origin in the British slang verb to dish, meaning "destroy," first noted by the great lexicographer Francis Grose in his 1788 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue: "He is completely dished up; he is totally ruined." When the conservative Tories stole the legislative clothes of the liberal Whigs by passing the radical reform bill of 1867, the Prime Minister, Lord Derby, delightedly chortled, "Don't you see we have dished the Whigs?"
Focus on the American slang noun, first cited by J. E. Lighter in the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, from Martin P. Levine's 1979 book, "Gay Men": "Calculated camp, packed so that people will think she's bringing them the real 'dish' from the inside." Lighter attributes this synonym for skinny to homosexual lingo, meaning "gossip; spiteful or malicious comments," rooted in a verb citation in Cory & LeRay's 1963 "The Homosexual and Society": "To gossip. . .often used when such gossip involves the person's sexual activities and amative interests."
My own speculation is that the current slang noun is rooted in the alliterative slang phrase to dish the dirt, as used by P. G. Wodehouse in 1964: "He thinks you fall short in the way of dishing the dirt." That uses dirt as "gossip" the way Ernest Hemingway did in "The Sun Also Rises" in 1926: " 'Do you know any dirt?' I asked. 'No.' 'None of your exalted connections getting divorces?' "
Thus, when Ms Goldberg exults, "I love dish!" she expresses her delight in dishing the dirt, which may have a political effect in dishing an American Whig.
 
DROP THAT DIME
"When you hook a wire to somebody," complained Paul Begala, an aide to President Clinton angry at the investigative techniques of the office of independent counsel, " . . . and then you turn and drop the dime in a phone and call the press, that's not the kind of investigation people need."
Most people under 40 would find that reference to a coin baffling. One does not get a dial tone with anything less than a quarter; in Washington and environs, the price of a local call from a coin-operated phone has just gone up to 35 cents. Is the President's defender unaware of the ravages of inflation over the past generation?
No; he was speaking metaphorically, and metaphors do not take seasonal or even generational adjustment. To drop a dime, in underworld lingo, has meant "to inform the police," with the squealing being done over the telephone, often anonymously by the informer, who is referred to by the squealed-upon as a rat, fink, snitch or tipster.
The recipient of the call refers to the fink as a whistle-blower. Different figures of speech for different folks: a bad guy doing good inserts a coin to make a surreptitious call, making himself a dime-dropper, while a good guy blows a piercing whistle, making himself a much-admired (though sometimes prosecuted) whistle-blower.
Mr. Begala has extended the coin metaphor from an informant calling the police to a police source calling the press. In so doing, he takes the shadiness attached to the dime-dropper ratting on his underworld buddies and imputes it to the police source speaking to the press. In his extension, however, the spinmeister has not spoiled the trope by trying to update it by saying something as awkward as "the manipulative investigator dropped a dime plus a quarter to leak to the media." That would spoil the effect.
That's how we intentionally preserve anachronisms. Feel free to have your dialing machine leave a message on my answering machine about all this; it's your nickel.
 
ON 'DIRTY' WORDS
"(Warning: pun ahead)," writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, and then writes of a Presidential passion for lawyerly phraseology that the writer calls "cunning linguistics." The pun is on cunnilingus, counterpart to fellatio in oral sex.
As the scandal is revealed or rebutted, we are sure to be exposed to words or allusions not previously used in what was once called "mixed company" or in the presence of children. As the dimes are dropped and the dirt gets dished, we should remember that the words themselves are not dirty, but it is the behavior described or accused that can be scandalous or tawdry (from "Saint Audrey," a Norwich church fair at which cheap lace was sold).
Shakespeare's King Henry IV worries that his son, the hot-blooded Prince Hal, is picking up gross terms through his youthful association with the dregs of society, and this carousing might lead to "unguided days/And rotten times." The Earl of Warwick reassures the King, "The Prince but studies his companions/Like a strange tongue." Warwick then extends his word picture, sending a message to those today who feel queasy about salacious terms used to describe actions at the seat of power:
"to gain the language,/'Tis needful that the most immodest word/Be look'd upon and learnt."

Era of Boogie-Woogie as Well as War

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
WHITE-HAIRED ladies in Mobile, Ala., talk about how wild they were in their youth; the times were so uncertain. A retired Episcopal bishop talks about growing up wealthy in New Jersey, with a large household staff, in a style that doesn't exist anymore. Charles Durning talks about landing in Normandy on D-Day, without his rifle.
The 1940's are rarely examined for anything other than the decade's central event, World War II, and the baby boom that followed it. But the period was one of enormous change that went way beyond wartime needs, as "America in the 40's," a three-hour PBS film on Wednesday night at 8, illustrates. 
 It was a decade of inventions. For the first time, you could write a check with a ballpoint pen (in a store now air-conditioned) to buy nylon stockings, a butane cigarette lighter, cake mix, Dial soap or anything wrapped in cellophane. (Other than the check, all became available between 1940 and 1949.)
It was a time of social upheaval. Young men came home to families who could not possibly understand what they had been through. Many veterans flocked to college, on the G.I. Bill of Rights. And working mothers, who had been acclaimed as heroines for keeping the factories going, were suddenly declared a social problem.
Then there were the songs. "The music of the time was either cheerful and upbeat or sentimental," says Tom Spain, the film's producer. When war breaks out while an economic depression is still lingering, he says, "good cheer and sentiment" are "very important qualities."
More than three dozen hits of the era are part of the film, giving it a vintage music-video feel at times. They include "I Got Rhythm" and "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" (both upbeat), "I'll Be Seeing You," "It's Been a Long, Long Time" and "I'll Be Home for Christmas" (all sentimental). Not to mention "Bring Enough Clothes for Three Days" and "Leave the Dishes in the Sink." (They couldn't all be classics.) ANITA GATES

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Where Nijinsky and Pavlova Did Their First Plies

BYLINE: By ROBERT JOHNSON; Robert Johnson is a dance historian and critic.

 BODY:
RUSSIAN BALLET has fascinated audiences in the West for nearly 100 years, and anyone who wants to know why can find out this week, when a group of young dancers from St. Petersburg arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Starting Wednesday, 65 students of the renowned Vaganova Ballet Academy will appear in four performances with recent graduates who are now stars of the Kirov Ballet.
The Vaganova (pronounced va-GAHN-uh-vah) Academy has generally been regarded as the greatest school of dance in the Western world. Balletomanes touring Russia stop in St. Petersburg to gaze reverentially at the musty classrooms that produced luminous dancers like Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov. For political and economic reasons, pupils in the Vaganova Academy have never before appeared in New York, and they arrive now several years after the appearances of two other acclaimed schools: the Bolshoi Ballet Academy of Moscow and the Paris Opera Ballet School. 
 With the Kirov soloists, the Vaganova students, ages 11 to 17, will perform eight dances, including excerpts from favorites by Marius Petipa like "Giselle," "La Bayadere" and "Don Quixote" as well as "The Little Humpbacked Horse," a rarity little known outside Russia. On Saturday afternoon, the Vaganova corps will present a special program, led by the school's artistic director, Igor Belsky, intended to demonstrate their system of training. They will also perform that day with students from New York City Ballet's School of American Ballet, which was founded by George Balanchine, himself a 1921 graduate of the Vaganova Academy when it was called the Petrograd State Choreographic School. It was renamed the Vaganova Academy in 1957.
This academy was founded in St. Petersburg in 1738, but its present name reflects the genius of a woman who died in 1951. By the time the ballerina Agrippina Vaganova began teaching there in 1921, Russia had acquired a trove of saltatory art and experience. Yet this treasure very nearly disappeared, a casualty of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Vaganova's first great accomplishment was to protect the ballet from destruction.
Her achievement went beyond preservation. During 29 years as teacher of the academy's graduating class, Vaganova used her analytical intelligence to standardize the curriculum. She dissected the classical vocabulary, discovering the mechanics of each step and determining the logic behind combinations. Scrutinizing both muscular and emotional processes, she arrived at what is now referred to as the Vaganova Method. This method distilled the essence of the Russian classical tradition and style that had evolved over the years, synthesizing French, Italian and Russian influences, and the Vaganova syllabus further reflected the athletic demands of 20th-century Soviet choreography.
Blending form with emotion was key. "The goal," said Ms. Makarova, "was to help ballet students develop a sense of movement, using technical exercises as a means to reveal their inner emotional potential."
When Vaganova published her pedagogy in 1934, under the title "Fundamentals of Classical Dance," she helped raise ballet to a new plateau. Vaganova can be compared to Louis XIV's ballet master Pierre Beauchamp, who is credited with standardizing the five positions of the feet. Her book, a milestone similar to Carlo Blasis's 1830 "Code of Terpsichore," established her as a master educator of 20th-century dance.
The academy is still run largely as it was in Vaganova's day, and getting into it is not easy. Examiners choose only 50 students -- 30 girls and 20 boys -- from thousands of hopefuls who present themselves each year, underscoring the fact that ballet in Russia remains a source of national pride in the midst of economic disarray. The average number of students in each classroom, 12, remains the same as when the academy was founded.
Students graduate at age 17 with a baccalaureate degree, which approximates two years at an American college. The curriculum includes a complete course of study in the humanities, with specialized classes in the history of theater, music, art and ballet; acting classes in the Stanislavsky method, and lessons in piano and music theory and appreciation.
Various kinds of dance classes -- historical, character and a mixture of modern and jazz -- supplement the ballet instruction. The young people study pas de deux as a separate subject, and they learn the entire corps de ballet repertory of the Kirov. The academy also offers graduate programs for aspiring teachers, choreographers and ballet accompanists. Everyone who teaches in the school has taken a four-year teachers' program devised by Vaganova.
An awareness of tradition contributes mightily to the students' education. "The most significant thing about the Vaganova School," Ms. Makarova recalled of her time there, "was the daily, unobtrusive feeling of contact with the great ballet of the past, its traditions and unwritten laws."
While Mr. Belsky favors acquainting his charges with contemporary Western choreography, he has no plans to tamper with the school's basic method of teaching, he said. As he pointed out, the present system "gives very good results."
Contributing to these results is the sheer physical rigor of the dance classes. Ms. Makarova characterized the school's atmosphere as one of "life in service of the arts." Mr. Belsky, one of Ms. Makarova's former teachers, described the ambiance more bluntly. "Severity, severity, and again, severity," he said.
The students who will appear at BAM are well aware of their responsibilities in sustaining a major cultural tradition. In their Saturday program, as the pupils take their places at onstage barres, spectators will be able to examine the fine points of the Vaganova style. These include an emphasis on precision and a special vitality that derives from body awareness.Other trademarks are a flexible back, harmonious coordination of the limbs and elegant hand movements. The dancers' sensitivity to musical phrasing relates in part to their preparation for performance in a dramatic repertory. Outstanding members of the graduating class, according to Mr. Belsky, include Alesia Boiko, Irina Golub and Anton Korsakov, all 17 years old.
MEANWHILE, THE Kirov soloists will present their specialties, although one of the most talented, Andrei Batalov, will not make the trip. Diana Vishneva, who got rave reviews for her performance in Balanchine's "Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux" at the New York State Theater last November, is reportedly injured and will also stay home. However, while there has been some confusion about just which members of the Kirov will come to BAM, it looks as if the cool and beautiful Uliana Lopatkina will dance the complete "Shades" act from "La Bayadere," partnered by Igor Zelensky.
David Eden, producer of the BAM event, explained why he wanted the "Shades" scene to conclude the program. As a seemingly endless line of ballerinas enters the stage, each one repeating the steps of the one before her, the image symbolizes Russian ballet tradition itself. "It's about continuity," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Insurance Companies;
A New Awakening in Real Estate Investment

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
INSURANCE companies used to be conservative players in the commercial real estate investment game. But many have become more aggressive and are changing their way of doing business.
Prompted by a marketplace flush with public capital, lessons learned from the last recession and changes in how they account for their real estate holdings, insurers in the New York area, as in the nation, are diversifying their portfolios and adding liquidity. And some are cashing out of the game for good, industry experts say. 
 "Those companies still in real estate are there to stay," said Carol D. Nichols, senior managing director at the Manhattan office of the Capital Advisers Group, the investment arm of Insignia/ESG, the national brokerage company. "They understand the competition with Wall Street so they are pro-actively managing their balance sheets, paying closer attention to their assets and liabilities and broadening their array of investment vehicles."
And they, like other investors, "are using real estate to produce higher returns on their investments," added Kim E. Mowers, a senior vice president at the Stamford office of Grubb & Ellis, another national real estate brokerage.
To that end insurers are reducing the amount of properties they would normally hold over a long period by selling them to or swapping them for stock in deep-pocketed companies like real estate investment trusts. In turn, they are investing in more liquid as well as higher yielding forms of real estate.
"The advantage is they can stay in real estate and can get out quickly too, "said Mr. Mowers.
Over the last 18 months insurers have sold 48 properties totaling 7.6 million square feet in the New York region, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage.
The greatest number of properties -- 22, totaling 2.9 million square feet -- were in New Jersey, followed by Fairfield County, with 10, totaling 1.5 million square feet. Nine of the properties totaling 2.25 million square feet were in Manhattan. In the same period, insurers bought three properties totaling 859,365 square feet.
Recent sales include three office towers in downtown Manhattan -- 44 Wall Street, 61 Broadway and 67 Broad Street, sold respectively by New York Life Insurance Company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, both in Manhattan, and Principal Financial Group of Des Moines, which sells and acquires properties for the Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company.
The selling continues. The Newark-based Prudential Insurance Company of America, the nation's largest life insurer, expects to close soon on its sale of Prudential Business Campus, an 875,357-square-foot office park with land for 1.4 million more square feet, straddling Parsippany and East Hanover, N.J. Prudential co-owns the campus with US West Real Estate of Englewood, Colo.
THE sale is part of Prudential's plan to reduce by mid-1999 the $5.5 billion in real estate it directly owns. "We are selling some, converting some to REIT shares and investing some in higher yielding investments," said David Twardock, senior managing director in charge of general account real estate investments at Prudential.
"The market is deep and there is no shortage of capital or buyers," he said.
REITs are among the most aggressive buyers, underscoring the trend toward public ownership of real estate. Indeed, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, among the nation's largest REITs, is said to be the top contender for Prudential Business Campus.
"It's a game of musical chairs with assets going from one holder to another," said Douglas H. Haynes, president of Alexander Summer, a brokerage in Paramus, N.J. "What happened was the arrival of public capital to a closed cowboy industry and insurers are learning to play in the new game."
But what is the impact on the market?
"It's all healthy," said Andrew J. Merin, executive managing director at the Financial Services Group of Cushman & Wakefield. Insurers are diversifying, which is good for their business and good for the market since the liquidity will give temper the often volatile real estate market, said Mr. Merin .
But, he cautioned, "with the lack of quality office product in the region everyone is looking at development."
"While there is enough demand this year I'm not sure there will be in 2000," he said.
For insurers the focus today is on diversification, liquidity and opportunity. In the past they would provide mortgages on or invest money in properties and hold them as long-term investments. Then they would either refinance or sell those properties and start the process over.
One of the risks is if the market misbehaves. "Insurance companies took back a lot of properties in the late 80's and early 90's and needed the market to turn around in order to sell," said Michael Berman, vice president at LaSalle Partners, a real estate service and investment firm in Manhattan. "By the mid-90's the market was coming to them."
Last September New York Life sold 44 Wall Street for $23.5 million. The insurer, which had a $170 million real estate portfolio in the region prior to the sale, had taken back the property through foreclosure. The buyer, a Manhattan partnership of Murray Hill Properties and CS First Boston, will retain the 300,000-square-foot, 45 percent occupied building, as offices.
In December, Principal Financial sold the mostly vacant 640,000-square-foot 67 Broad Street for $45 million to Greystone, a Manhattan-based partnership, which may use it for residential or office use or both. Earlier last year, it also sold a 1.2-million-square-foot industrial building in South Plainfield, N.J. Nationwide, Principal sold 4.8 million square feet of commercial space last year for a total $260 million.
The hope is to do twice that or more this year, said John N. Urban, Principal's director of asset management. "We funnel the money back into growing lines of businesses and less risky forms of real estate," he said, noting that his company has turned an investor's eye to the New York City and northern New Jersey markets.
Some insurers that sell to REITs want to take at least part of their payment in REIT shares.
LAST year Prudential sold $2.4 billion of its hotels and office buildings and developable land, including two Hilton hotels, one in Parsippany and another in Newark. The figure includes a Times Square site at the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street that it has under contract to the Rudin Organization and Reuters American Holdings, who plan to build a headquarters for the British media giant.
In 1996 Prudential sold its site at the southeast corner of Broadway and 43d Street to the Durst Organization, whose building is in construction.
Part of Prudential's payment for last year's sales was nearly $300 million in REIT shares, Mr. Twardock said, noting that if the market sours "we can just sell the stock" rather than trying to sell a building.
The company also retains development rights in some of its properties and invests sale proceeds in what Mr. Twardock describes as higher yielding assets, includingwarehouses in China. "There are opportunities as well as risks, but we do not see our vision changing," he said.
Metropolitan Life in the last two years sold half of its $14 billion portfolio. Along with 61 Broadway the properties included a 600,000-square-foot office complex in Woodbridge, N.J.
"We were heavy on offices so we wanted to reposition our portfolio and gain a better balance of different properties," said Tricia Curtin-Munley, investment manager at the company. "We are moving things out quicker, rather than holding them for the long-term."
The goal is to maximize returns, not build up REIT shares, Ms. Curtin-Munley said, even though in some instances her company has taken REIT shares in partial payments. She said the company is catching its breath before it starts buying again.
Meanwhile, Chubb Insurance Company, in Warren, N.J., has left the field. Last year it sold 8.2 million square feet of space, the bulk of its commercial portfolio. The buyer -- a joint venture among Paine Webber, Morgan Stanley and Gale & Wentworth, a real estate firm in Florham Park, N.J. -- paid $700 million for the properties, most in north Jersey.
"It's a real estate and capital market play," said Mark R. Yeager, president of Gale & Wentworth's commercial group, referring to the insurers' selling spree. The market is healthier, but "this is not nirvana," he said, adding that the market would eventually ebb.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
Building the Island's Most Lavish Restaurant

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
THE story behind Louis XVI, the most lavish restaurant to open on the Island in years, is as distinctive as the restaurant itself.
The restaurant was built, furnished and staffed with money made at two diners and at a family restaurant on Main Street in Patchogue. The modest profit from thousands of simple dishes served over two decades at the Harborside, in Patchogue, and the Expressway and Royal Oak diners in Hauppauge and Bellport, paid for the fancy period interior columns and fine art from Paris, the glistening crystal chandeliers and, most of all, the staff recruited from three- and four-star restaurants of Manhattan. 
 No doubt because the road leading to Louis XVI was such a long and winding one, Jimmy Boboris, its manager and part-owner, moved cautiously and carefully. Mr. Boboris's brother George and cousin Constantine Demas, are the other owners.
The waterfront property, once a hotel, then a modest Italian restaurant, was purchased five years ago. Construction began a year later when the entire site was raised seven feet to lessen the chances of incursions from the Great South Bay. It was the first of many upgrades.
Mr. Boboris, who had worked at a luxury restaurant in Athens before coming to this country, made progress slowly. Remembering all the time it took to accrue the funds necessary to proceed, he waited for a favorable, local economic climate necessary to support a major elegant dining establishment.
Over the four years he, along with his partners, hired architects and interior decorators, supervised construction, visited Paris to acquire authentic Louis XVI art and furnishings and, most of all, used the contacts they had had made during 25 years in the restaurant business to recruit a professional staff and lure them to Patchogue.
To assist in this endeavor, he hired Antoine Bouterin as a consultant. Mr. Bouterin, whom Mr. Boboris calls his "insurance policy," earned his culinary spurs at Le Perigord in Manhattan, before opening Bouterin's on the East Side. His primary task was to find an outstanding executive chef for Louis XVI, and he delivered. He invited Jean-Claude Teulade, the sous chef at Le Cote Basque, to visit Patchogue.
An ebullient Frenchman, with a dark, dramatic Dali-style mustache, he liked what he saw, and, promised a free hand, he signed on. He moved his family from Manhattan and fell in love with Patchogue.
When asked why he gave up the glamour of the city for Long Island, he replied, "Here I am the chef, I can decide, I can do what I want." Mr. Teulade, who has worked at Maxim's, Tour d'Argent and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Paris, also noted that although the kitchen was the same size as the one at Le Cote Basque, it served 100 diners while the one in the city had to provide for 250 people.
When Mr. Teulade was told to buy the best ingredients available, he made his mother in Toulouse his prime source of supply. She regularly sends him packages of spices, herbs and other difficult-to-find foodstuffs.
Mr. Boboris and Mr. Bouterin became a two-man, headhunting company. The few restaurant people one of them did not know, the other did. They then invited Andy Kormendi, a sophisticated Budapest-born captain from Aureole in Manhattan, to take a look. He reacted in a big way, saying, "I couldn't believe this was happening in Patchogue and thought, wouldn't it be great to be on the ocean and see sunsets instead of the buildings across the street?"
He became the maitre d'hotel and used his connections and experience at Aureole, Bouley, Chantilly, the Russian Tea Room and Maxwell's Plum to advantage. Working with Mr. Boboris, he enticed another captain from Aureole, a waiter from Bouley and an up-and-coming pastry chef from Chantilly to come aboard.
He also trained the wait staff from the ground up, stating, "Every other restaurant I went to was set. Here I had a bigger role with a free hand to hire help and set up systems."
Mr. Kormendi, who is also a consultant at Placido Domingo's restaurant in Manhattan, worked for weeks on the basics: how to line up tables, how to put a tablecloth on, when to remove plates, silverware placement and how to handle and clean stemware without breaking it.
Meanwhile, Mr. Boboris was hiring two well-known Island chefs, Blake Verity from Panama Hatties as a sous chef and Joseph Felicetta of Fusion Grille and Octopus Garden as a captain. Although both men are looking for their own restaurants, they lend an important, if temporary, Island perspective to Louis XVI.
From the beginning, the restaurant's owners and chefs agreed that its menu would be a conservative, middle-of-the-road, rather than cutting-edge affair, that it would be main line. not nouveau or nouvelle French.
Mr. Boboris explained: "There are so many different types of French restaurants in the city and so few here. We can't be too specialized, wild or way out. We also don't want to intimidate our customers with a lot of French terms. There is no snobbery here. And so the friendly, familiar French menu lists such traditionals dishes as escargot, rack of lamb, pheasant, lobster and creme boule."
The clientele at Louis XVI requests at least four or five orders of caviar a night, (at a supplement of $35) and specials like farm-raised rabbit are very popular. So future menus (there will be four or five a year) will offer still more adventurous dishes.
The future also holds plans for dining outside in a tent or beside European-style gardens on an outdoor waterside deck. There is also the possibility of a private dock for hungry boatsmen.
Before any of that, the second of the high-ceilinged dining rooms that will cater special events must be opened. The methodical Mr. Boboris is, as usual, in no hurry. Despite the fact that the unopened room represents almost half of his enterprise, "maybe April, maybe May," he said.
"We have a good thing going here now. We don't want to change that. We will be sure we're ready before we move."

HEADLINE: As Crisis Nears, Affordable Units Of Housing Lag

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN Westchester, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, more than 12 percent of the households -- 38,400 -- live in deficient and overcrowded housing. Still, six years after the Board of Legislators called for 5,000 units of affordable housing by the turn of the century, little is being accomplished toward that goal, a study by an independent advisory group has found.
What is more, the shortage of affordable housing is quickly reaching crisis proportions, making Westchester inhospitable to many working-class families, according to the advisory group, the Westchester County Housing Opportunity Commission. 
 "This is hardly a popular subject in Westchester," George Raymond, the commission's chairman, said recently, adding that only 19 of Westchester's 43 municipalities have adopted resolutions endorsing affordable housing.
And even among communities supporting the concept in principle, many have yet to build any affordable units. With only 270 new affordable units being added each year to the current stock of 2,500, it seems unlikely that the county will attain the goal of the Board of Legislators by 2000, he said.
County Executive Andrew J. Spano, however, is of a different mind. Westchester's poor record notwithstanding, he announced on Tuesday that he would meet the 5,000-unit objective within four years -- by the end of his first term. "We have to set our goals high," he said.
Mr. Spano said he favored using available housing stock in areas where land for new development is in short supply. He vowed to review the municipalities that had not adopted resolutions and start a campaign to educate the public in those localities.
The 19 communities that have adopted policies favoring affordable housing are the cities of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and Peekskill, the towns of Eastchester, Greenburgh, Mamaroneck, New Castle and Ossining and the villages of Ardsley, Briarcliff, Croton-on-Hudson, Dobbs Ferry, Elmsford, Hastings-on-Hudson, Irvington, Mamaroneck, Ossining, Rye Brook and Tarrytown.
Examples of successful ventures are the Hommocks Park Apartments in Mamaroneck, which contains market-rate and affordable rentals, and the Arch Condominiums in Sleepy Hollow, which has six affordable ownership units.
The county gives money and technical assistance to sponsors of low- and moderate-income housing, often working in partnership with developers, housing organizations, community and church groups and Federal and state agencies, Lawrence C. Salley, the Deputy Planning Commissioner, said.
Since 1991, the Planning Department has partly paid for more than 429 units of ownership housing and more than 655 units of rental housing in various municipalities. Yet, despite the help available, the resistance to affordable housing continues, Mr. Salley said.
"Without local acceptance, it is extremely difficult," Mr. Salley said. "There are a lot of unfounded myths, like affordable housing will decrease property values, when in fact, the contrary has been documented."
Nowhere has the unwelcomeness of affordable housing been seen more clearly in recent months than in fierce zoning and housing battles in Scarsdale.
With 5,500 homes and 16,000 residents, Scarsdale has done nothing to meet goals set by the commission. The village's poor record has prompted Jeanne Richman, a resident and Chairwoman of the County Planning Board, to call for "at least some small percentage to show that we care."
She continued: "Every community has people who need affordable housing, and Scarsdale has them too. We should not export our problems to other communities."
Meetings about building affordable units for the elderly and allowing so-called accessory apartments in Scarsdale have recently ended in heated arguments. Mrs. Richman explained that even though accessory apartments would not officially be classified as affordable housing, they would probably be "within the reach of those who otherwise might not be able to afford to buy a house here."
But the apartment issue, like that of affordable housing, has engendered intense opposition.
"This type of housing, often the mark of a neighborhood in transition, always proliferates in declining neighborhoods, such as parts of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, the Bronx and Brooklyn, even the north end of White Plains, etc.," Ralph W. Kern, a resident, wrote in a letter to the village's Board of Trustees last fall.
In some communities, the issue of affordable housing has been so controversial that projects have not made it past the drawing board. In Harrison in 1993, a plan to provide affordable housing for 28 families was halted in the face of fears that the units would degrade property values. In Eastchester, a proposal for 60 units was dropped for similar reasons.
Sometimes, racial bias fuels the opposition, with municipalities worrying that blacks, residents of Hispanic descent and other minority groups who qualify for affordable housing will degrade a neighborhood, said Winston A. Ross, regional director for the Westchester chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
In North Salem in the late 1980's, town officials rezoned 63 acres of lakefront property to prevent the building of 184 town houses and some affordable units on the site. The builder sued the town in 1987 for eliminating the multifamily housing, claiming the ordinance was unconstitutional -- a claim that was upheld first by State Supreme Court in White Plains, then by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and finally by the State Court of Appeals in Albany. In 1990 the State Court of Appeals invalidated North Salem's ordinance against multifamily housing and ordered the town to allow the builder to proceed. But since then the builder has sold most of the lakefront property and is not going to build.
An earlier case, Berenson v. Town of New Castle, filed in State Supreme Court in White Plains in 1975, determined that local zoning must balance "the local desire to maintain the status quo within the community and the greater public interest that needs be met." Despite these litigations, the Housing Opportunity Commission reports that Westchester has continued to lag in confronting the problem of "a huge imbalance between household incomes and housing prices and rents." The report cited statistics showing that 150,000 residents, or 17.5 percent of the county's population, are so strained economically that they must feed themselves through food stamps, soup kitchens and food pantries.
Many residents, according to the report, pay an excessive share of their incomes for shelter -- "often at the expense of other basic life necessities."
The report also stated that many municipalities in Westchester "are especially vulnerable" to lawsuits because the county has officially established both the regional need for affordable housing and each municipality's allocation, based on the land area of the community, growth in employment and the number of overcrowded units, among other factors. Scarsdale, for example, should provide 135 units of affordable housing by 2000, White Plains 245 and Cortlandt, 137, according to the Housing Opportunity Commission's allocation plan.
One legal challenge, involving a builder who was suing Cortlandt, was resolved last month in State Supreme Court in White Plains. The court, ruling that the town's zoning was unconstitutional, not only ordered Cortlandt to rezone to allow the developer to build multifamily and affordable units but also approved the Housing Opportunity Commission's allocation of units in the county's various municipalities.
Still, the slowness to develop affordable housing is most likely to continue, in part because builders have recently been lured away by a thriving luxury-housing market, said Rose Noonan, executive director of the Housing Action Council, a nonprofit technical assistance organization, which helps developers, communities and other nonprofit groups build affordable housing.
"Five years ago, the game was affordable housing because the market was down," said Bill Balter, a co-owner of Wilder Balter Partners in Elmsford, a real estate developer. "Clearly there's a profit in the affordable housing business, but not the kind of profit of luxury market-rate housing."
Despite community resistance and economic pressures, there have been some happy endings, most recently in White Plains.
"We're on our way toward finally becoming a success story," said Thor H. Anderson, president of Shore, which stands for Sheltering the Homeless Is Our Responsibility.
After years of objections from neighborhood associations, the volunteer organization will finally put its shovel in the ground this spring for seven town house units for middle-income earners, with each unit containing a rental apartment for the formerly homeless.
Mr. Salley also cited as success stories 22 rental units in Irvington, 120 assisted-living units for the elderly in Peekskill, 62 two-family, owner-rental units in Yonkers and 10 similar units in New Rochelle.
"There are a lot of good things in the works," he said.

Americans Are Heeding The Call of the Loon

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The Canadian "loonie" has been attracting Americans in record numbers. Canadian currency -- which has a loon pictured on the one-dollar coin -- is trading near its all-time low, having dropped nearly 10 percent in value over the last year.
In British Columbia, bookings by American skiers at Whistler, a resort area north of Seattle, are running more than 60 percent ahead of last year, the Whistler Resort Association said. At Casino Windsor, across the river from Detroit, 150 extra employees have been hired to handle the increase in American gamblers. Same-day car trips -- an indicator of cross-border shopping -- reached a 17-year record of 2.1 million in November, the most recent month for which Government statistics are available. 
 At recent rates, $100 would buy about 143 Canadian dollars, before banks add on exchange fees. At the consumer rate available last week at American Express offices in New York City, for example, $100 bought $138 Canadian. A year ago, $100 would have bought $129 Canadian at Amex.
The Asian financial crisis combined with low interest rates in Canada are the main reasons for the loonie's swoon, as Canadian headline writers put it. The Asian turmoil has prompted investors to take money out of those countries, seeking financial security elsewhere. They have preferred the United States dollar to Canada's because of higher interest rates in the United States.
With Canadian unemployment at about 9 percent, about twice that in the United States, and virtually no inflation, the Canadian central bank sees no reason to raise interest rates. So, the favorable exchange rate for Americans headed north seems likely to continue for a while. STEVE LOHR

Strategies For Selling A Co-op

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
WHILE the basic strategy for selling an apartment is the same as that for selling a single-family house -- accentuate the positive and, if possible, eliminate the negative -- community living often makes some additional strategies necessary.
"It doesn't occur to most people that when they're selling their apartment, they're selling their building as well," said David Kuperberg, president of Cooper Square Realty in Manhattan. "And in any sale first impressions are critical." 
 One of the best ways to sell a house, for example, is to enhance its "curb appeal" by trimming the lawn, sweeping the porch and putting a fresh coat of paint on the front door. And while apartment owners can do little about the entrance to their building, Mr. Kuperberg said, they should still consider the impact of curb appeal on potential buyers.
"You have to look at your building with fresh eyes," Mr. Kuperberg said. "Watch how the staff reacts when someone walks in the door. Is the doorman friendly? Does the staff have clean uniforms? Is the lobby clean and neat? All these things make an impression on a potential buyer."
Frequently, Mr. Kuperberg said, people become unaware of things they encounter every day. A color scheme in the lobby that was trendy a decade ago may be tacky today if one were to take the time to look at it. Lobby furniture that is dated, dusty or even dirty may be ignored by residents who see it every day but rarely use it. An elevator that is prone to bouncy stops or starts may be merely quirky to long-time residents, but terrifying to those unprepared for such eccentricities.
"These are the things a buyer will see before he even gets inside your apartment," Mr. Kuperberg said. While it might seem that such matters are beyond the control of individual shareholders, he said, that is not the case.
Mr. Kuperberg explained that board members had the responsibility to make sure that the building is both properly maintained and well managed. If a board lives up to its responsibilities apartments in the building should command high sale prices, he said. And that should be sufficient incentive for boards and managing agents to cooperate with shareholders who make legitimate requests.
"Lobby the board to fix up the common areas," he said. "Be prepared to approach the board members with specific, reasonable suggestions that work to everyone's benefit."
In many cases, real estate experts say, purchasing decisions are based as much upon emotion as they are upon economics -- with the initial "feeling" that a potential buyer gets when entering a home or apartment inevitably coloring subsequent impressions.
Accordingly, they say, the look and feel of an apartment when a potential buyer walks through the door constitutes the seller's first and best opportunity to capture the buyer's attention.
"One of the most important and least expensive things you can do to make an apartment appealing is to wash the windows," said Enid Hamlin, director of advertising and public relations for Lawrence Properties in Manhattan.
Even windows that frame less-than-perfect views will look better if they are clean, Ms. Hamlin said. Often, she said, it is possible to block out uninspiring views or maintain privacy -- while still allowing light into an apartment -- by using curtains or shades on the bottom half of the window and leaving the top unobstructed.
In addition, Ms. Hamlin said, it never hurts for a seller who knows that an apartment will be shown that day to leave the curtains open, the shades up, the lights on and have fresh flowers on the table and music playing softly in the background.
"Seeing an apartment for the first time should be almost like a theatrical experience," she said. "And you want to set the scene as nicely as possible."
In fact, every expert interviewed pointed out that the initial "feel" of an apartment is of extraordinary significance to most buyers -- a point overlooked by many sellers.
"You would be shocked at how many times we go in to show an apartment and the beds aren't even made," said Barbara Fox, president of Fox Residential Group in Manhattan.
Ms. Fox said that when her office takes a sales listing, the seller is provided with a checklist of things to be addressed to present an apartment in the best light possible. One of the most important things a seller can do, she said, particularly in situations where the size of an apartment is limited, is to keep clutter to a minimum.
"Put everything you don't need into storage," she said, adding that elimination of clutter in a cramped apartment is so important that it would even be worthwhile to rent outside storage space if space isn't available in the building. And sellers should avoid the temptation, she said, of eliminating clutter in rooms by transferring it to closets.
"The more cluttered a closet is the smaller it looks," she said, adding that ample closet space is often a major issue for buyers.
Ms. Fox also pointed out that furniture and appliances should be cleaned and polished and floors should be washed and waxed or vacuumed. In apartments that do not have much natural light, she said, lamps should have the brightest bulbs that can safely be used and should be on when a prospective buyer enters an apartment.
Moreover, she said, sellers should be prepared to deal with problems in their apartment they may not even realize exist.
"Smells are always a downer," Ms. Fox said. "Things like cat litter boxes, cigarette smells and cooking odors are hardly ever noticed by the people who live with them." Accordingly, she said, potpourri, scented candles or room deodorizers should be used judiciously to eliminate offensive odors.
"Cookies in the oven work even better," Ms. Fox said. "Even if you don't think you have an odor problem in your apartment, it doesn't hurt to assume that you do."
Marjorie Hilton, president of Marjorie Hilton Interiors, an interior design consultant in Manhattan, said that it is often possible to enhance the look of an apartment at modest expense.
Refinishing a wood floor, for example, is relatively inexpensive, yet a freshly sanded and polyurethaned floor can completely transform the look of an apartment -- even making a small apartment look larger.
"Even in carpeted apartments, the first question a buyer will ask is: 'What's under the carpet?' " Ms. Hilton said.
Other relatively inexpensive improvements that pay significant dividends, she said, are a fresh coat of paint on the walls, regrouting of bathroom tiles, repair of leaking faucets and replacement of any older fluorescent light fixtures -- often found in bathrooms and kitchens -- with incandescent ones.
While it might be argued that things like dirty windows, clutter, cramped closets and exotic cooking odors are not likely to dissuade an interested buyer from making an offer on an appropriately priced apartment in a well-managed building, their impact is never entirely overlooked.
"We sort of like it when people haven't done what they're supposed to do to make everything clean and nice when they're selling their apartment," said Peter Bell, president of Balch Realty, a "buyer's-only" broker based in Westchester. "It gives us something to negotiate to get our buyer a lower price."

HEADLINE: For a Los Angeles 'Suburb,' Steps to Recovery

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: VAN NUYS, Calif.

 BODY:
A $75 MILLION complex that will combine a shopping center with an industrial park is rising here on the former site of a General Motors Corporation automobile plant.
The project, which is called The Plant, is expected to regenerate most of the 3,000 jobs lost when the car maker closed its plant five years ago in this San Fernando Valley community of the City of Los Angeles. 
 City officials also hope that it will provide a spark to ignite new development in a depressed pocket of a region that looks more like a suburb than part of a huge city.
The 370,000-square-foot shopping center, which its developers say is 95 percent preleased, will include a 16-screen movie theater designed with automotive-factory-themed decor. Completion of the 35-acre project, called the Van Nuys Center at The Plant, is expected this summer.
On an adjoining 33-acre site, the same developers -- a partnership of The Voit Companies of Woodland Hills and The Selleck Group of Westlake Village, both in California -- plan to build 600,000 square feet of industrial space.
It will be the largest such development in the San Fernando Valley in 20 years, according to the developers.
Ricon Corporation, a maker of wheelchair lifts for buses and trains that is currently based in neighboring Pacoima, has leased a 150,000-square-foot building now under construction and scheduled for completion in October.
Although the company could have found less expensive space outside of the Valley, Ricon wanted to stay in the region, where nearly all of its 300 employees live, according to William Hinze, a company vice president in charge of sales.
"We believe that the cost of rehiring and retraining new employees more than offsets any advantages we would get by moving out of the Valley," Mr. Hinze said.
The Plant is one of several projects, including an expanded civic center on Van Nuys Boulevard, that represent an attempt to redevelop and redefine a "first ring suburb" of the Los Angeles core that has traversed the cycle of boom, development and decay.
The San Fernando Valley is a 250-square-mile area of Los Angeles that lies north of the Santa Monica Mountains. About 1.3 million people live there in such communities as Tarzana, Sherman Oaks, Encino and Studio City.
In the 40's through the 60's, housing tracts quickly replaced fields of orange trees. Bing Crosby's recording of "San Fernando Valley," with its evocation of care-free living in a mild climate, was a Top 10 hit in 1943.
The Valley was a "prototype of American suburbia," said Robert Voit, president and chief executive of The Voit Companies. "It was a place where one developer could build hundreds of homes that all looked alike."
BUT the Valley has also become a center of industrial and office development and the former bedroom community became an increasingly mature community where people both live and work.
With its many quiet neighborhoods of ranch houses and neat lawns, the Valley retains much of its suburban character. Now the suburban frontier of Los Angeles has expanded far beyond the Valley to the Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys to the north, and Ventura County to the west.
Meanwhile, the Valley itself "has become older and taken on the characteristics of an urban area," Mr. Voit said.
Home buyers in search of traditional suburban amenities, such as comparatively low home prices and lighter traffic, now leapfrog the Valley for more distant places. In turn, the Valley is increasingly a "move up" community for upwardly mobile Latino and Asian immigrant households.
But the Valley is not a move-up area for industry. Many of its industrial buildings, built primarily in the 60's and 70's, are considered out of date, and few new sites are available for construction. As a result, many businesses are leaving the area for newer, larger buildings in Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura County.
The lack of reinvestment in the Valley's industrial areas has resulted in urban decay. In the early 90's, the area surrounding the former General Motors plant had the highest crime rate in the city, recalled Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Van Nuys.
THE redevelopment of Van Nuys has a personal meaning for Dan Selleck, the president of Selleck Development Group, co-developer of The Plant, who was born and raised in the community.
"The lack of reinvestment in that part of the Valley has really been a sad thing to see," he said. "I went on a sixth-grade field trip to the G.M. plant in the 60's. I had numerous friends whose parents worked there."
Later, he said, "I cruised Van Nuys Boulevard as a teen-ager."
After the auto plant closed in 1993, Councilman Alarcon said, his goal was to restore manufacturing jobs to the area. Shortly after closing the plant, Mr. Alarcon said, representatives of General Motors approached him to seek his aid in rezoning the site from industrial to commercial retail, in the belief that a site zoned for retail would command a higher price.
"I simply refused," the Councilman recalled. G.M. representatives, he said, "walked away very angry." About a month later, he added, "they came back and said, 'Can we negotiate?' "
In January 1994, while the Councilman and G.M. representatives were still holding talks, the Van Nuys area was jolted by the Northridge earthquake. (The epicenter of the quake lay a few miles to the northwest.) The San Fernando Valley was particularly hard hit, and the Federal Government soon made funds available for rebuilding.
One source of funds, a $30 million grant from the Federal Economic Development Agency, put an ace in Mr. Alarcon's hand. About $4 million of the grant was earmarked for site improvements at the former G.M. plant. The improvements included widening Van Nuys Boulevard, the main approach to the future shopping center, as well as creation of new road through the center of the property where industrial buildings would be situated.
These improvements would make the site more valuable, Mr. Alarcon recalled telling G.M. representatives. In the end, G.M. agreed to a formula that would rezone about a third of the 100-acre site for retail and another third for industrial development.
G.M. contributed an additional five acres for another pet project of Mr. Alarcon -- a new police and fire station. The auto maker remains on a 27-acre site, where it continues to operate a car-testing facility.
For Mr. Voit of The Voit Companies, rebuilding Van Nuys is a major occupation. Five miles south of The Plant on Van Nuys Boulevard, Voit is at work on a $45 million civic project known as the Marvin Braude Constituent Service Center, a 200,000-square-foot branch of City Hall. The project includes a new master plan for courtyards to connect the center with existing structures in the civic center complex.
Mr. Voit said that the renewal of the civic center, the traditional political center of the Valley, along with the redevelopment of the former G.M. site, are symbols of hope for the newest residents.
Those residents, he said, are coming from abroad, or other parts of Los Angeles, "and they feel very hopeful about the Valley, much as their predecessors felt who are leaving the Valley."
"We are trying to capture some of that hope" in those new projects, he said.

Pfizer Reaches Across the Thames for More Space

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
PFIZER'S CENTRAL RESEARCH operation in Groton will soon straddle the Thames River with a new $150 million project that will give it 400,000 square feet of research and laboratory space on the waterfront in New London.
The 24-acre project will rise on the site of a former linoleum factory that has been vacant for more than a decade. For their part, Connecticut and the city will invest $58.5 million in revitalizing the neighborhood, including the creation of a new state park to include the Revolutionary War-era Fort Trumbull. The fort is now surplus Federal property. 
 Dr. George H. Milne Jr., head of Pfizer Central Research, said construction of the international pharmaceutical corporation's project should begin in the spring, with completion in about two years. Initially it will employ 1,300 people with a payroll of about $129 million, but employment will increase to 2,000 within five years.
Dr. Milne said Pfizer now spends about half its yearly $2 billion research budget in southeastern Connecticut. He added that it had made a commitment to grow through the development of new drugs.
The New London Development Corporation, which worked to bring Pfizer into the city, has won state grants for improvements in the area that will bring even more development, said Dr. Claire Gaudiani, president of both the development group and Connecticut College, in New London.
"My vision is that over a five-year period we'll see a dramatic improvement in our tax base, a dramatic improvement in the number of jobs at all kinds of levels and a dramatic increase in people enjoying downtown New London," Dr. Gaudiani said.
"There will be spinoff from Pfizer," said Mayor Lloyd H. Beachy of New London. "There's going to be a lot of people and companies who are going to say, 'I want to be across the street from Pfizer.' The question is going to be, how are we going to get the right people in there, who will really add to the mix?"
He said he expected homes for the people who will work at the new Pfizer research center, shops, restaurants and service-oriented businesses capitalizing on the increased traffic in the area.
"To me, the really significant thing is how many cities the size of New London have an opportunity to develop an area that takes in 45 or 50 acres just a stone's throw from their downtown," Mr. Beachy said.
The state will provide up to $12.5 million for the development corporation to purchase up to 70 properties in the neighborhood for related development, and the group is working with four real estate brokers in New London. Susan Howard, a broker with US Properties in New London, said there had been strong interest in the project.
"There's going to be a lot of new development, new people coming in," said Ms. Howard. "I'm getting calls from Chicago and New York and Boston already. I was stunned at how quickly the word spread."
THE site that Pfizer will purchase is known locally as the New London Mills property, for the factory that used to occupy it. Over the years a number of projects have been proposed there, most recently the OceanQuest marine science educational center. All have fallen through.
Pfizer brings a strong record to New London. Over the last decade it has never stopped developing its 137-acre Groton site, which today has 75 buildings and is that town's largest taxpayer, providing $7.5 million a year in revenue to the city.
Deborah Pasquale, of Connecticut United for Research Excellence, which promotes the biotechnology and medical industries in the state, said drug research was an increasingly important component of the state's economy.
A study last year showed 12 percent of all domestic pharmaceutical research and development spending in the nation came to Connecticut, up from 10 percent a year earlier. "That didn't even include the Pfizer expansion, or the additional growth going on at the Bayer Corporation in West Haven," she said. "I think in this year you're going to see continued healthy growth on the large company side, and on the small company side."
Ms. Pasquale said there were seven small biotechnology companies in the state now, many of them spinoffs from the Yale University and University of Connecticut research laboratories, and Yale is looking to spin off four more very shortly.
"To go from seven to 11 in one leap would be pretty amazing," he said. "The key ingredient for success at any of these companies, obviously, is good science, but having proximity to a large pharmaceutical company like Pfizer doesn't hurt at all."
Paul B. Begin, group director, facilities management for Pfizer, said the proximity of the New London property to the Groton research center was one of the keys to its selection. "A visual tie of the two campuses is an important feature, so the employees at both can feel connected," Mr. Begin said.
He said Pfizer had decided to take the New London site because of city and state commitments to proceed with other projects to enhance the area, such as a $20 million restoration of Fort Trumbull, a $19 million environmental assessment and cleanup of the factory property and $7 million of improvements to the sewage treatment plant in the area so odors are eliminated. "All of those things, we feel, are positive signs that we're going to have some good neighbors," Mr. Begin said.
AS recently as five years ago, he said, there would have been no incentive for Pfizer to consider building laboratory space anywhere else in the region, because it would have hindered the work at the Groton site. But since then communications technology has evolved to the point where a property across the river will, in many respects, be as close as a building across the campus. Moreover, the Pfizer research organization has grown to the point where it can consider breaking off the clinical research laboratories from the development laboratories, which will stay in Groton.
"They need to be tied back to the Groton laboratories, but a good portion of their work is focused outward, so it doesn't have to be as close to the Groton operation," Mr. Begin said. "We want them to still feel that they're part of the organization, the team."
Brian Kowalchuk, an architect with CUH2A of Princeton, N.J., the firm that has designed the last five expansion projects on the Groton campus, said there were a number of special site considerations for the New London property. One is the fact that it has three "front doors" -- the waterfront, New London's downtown and the southern New London residential areas.
"We want to make sure each of them have a nice view," Mr. Kowalchuk said. "It's important to think about how people will get to the site and what they will see as they approach it."
Pfizer also considers its buildings one of the amenities that help it attract and retain top scientists, Mr. Kowalchuk said, so they have to be more than merely functional. His initial plans call for a series of linked buildings so employees can walk inside from one to another. "It's important not to have barriers between people, that you encourage connections," Mr. Kowalchuk said. "But it's important that you break it down so it doesn't look like one giant megabuilding, so it has the feel of a research campus."
John C. Markowicz, head of the South East Area Regional Economic Development agency, said biotechnology was considered one of the growth areas for the region primarily because of the presence of Pfizer, and the expansion into New London is expected to attract a number of smaller businesses that want to do clinical research for the giant drug firm.
"They run the gamut from small mom-and-pops to companies that employ hundreds of people," Mr. Markowicz said.
He noted that most of the offices in the area around the new Pfizer site were built by military contractors who wanted to take advantage of proximity to the former Navy weapons center. When the center moved to Newport, R.I., many of those companies followed. "It's entirely possible that we have a similar opportunity here," Mr. Markowicz said, to bring in those companies that want to be near Pfizer. But these are companies in the health field which is not as cyclical as defense, and because of the aging population have a healthy future, he added.
"Our plan is to do what we can to bring in companies that will complement Pfizer, not to compete with it," he said. "But there are a lot of opportunities to do that."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
In a Tight Market, Monmouth Beckons Office Users

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FOR the last 25 years the 723,000-square-foot office building set on 40 acres along Tinton Avenue in the Monmouth County community of Tinton Falls was leased by the Army for its communications and electronics command center.
But over the last two years the Army has relocated most of its operation to nearby Fort Monmouth, leaving a huge block of space in its wake.
In that time, 85 percent of the space in the seven-story building has been vacated and the rest will be vacant by midyear. But a developer who bought the building for $9.5 million in December is planning to invest $40 million to $45 million more to renovate it for commercial occupancy. 
 The developer, the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury, is betting that with large areas of quality space in limited supply throughout the county, as in the rest of the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market, the building will draw tenants.
Area brokers agree, adding that the project underscores the fact that the one-time seasonal resort of Monmouth County is emerging from its recessionary doldrums and edging toward a new round of growth.
As the markets in suburban communities to the north continue to tighten, they add, businesses are starting to look southward to Monmouth County because of lower rents, the availability of labor and housing and convenient access -- about 60 miles from Manhattan.
With a total of 6.8 million square feet of space Monmouth County has one of the state's smallest office markets, much of it concentrated in its eastern sector. Historically, the county has attracted, and continues to attract, smaller companies. But it has a group of large, well-established corporate tenants and some like AT&T, also have renewed their commitment to the county.
Since AT&T split into three separate companies in September 1995 it and Lucent Technologies, the equipment manufacturing business it spun off, have been swapping space at the five buildings in Monmouth County they shared.
One result of all that shuffling is that AT&T is renovating an 836,000-square-foot structure and building four adjacent structures with a total of 1 million square feet, at a 262-acre corporate campus off Laurel Avenue near exit 114 of the Garden State Parkway in Middletown. The site, which could accommodate another million square feet, will serve as the main research and development complex for AT&T.
Paul E. Giannonne, a principal of Jacobson, Goldfarb & Tanzman Company LLC, a Woodbridge-based commercial real estate brokerage, said that over the last two years tenants expanding in or relocating to the county had increased their appetite for space. That has enabled the market to absorb much of the supply left over from the mid-80's building boom, reducing the amount of available space on the market to 550,000 square feet, said Mr. Giannone.
Much of what is left of that space is expected to be leased in the next 18 months, Mr. Giannonne said. The market then should be able to handle the addition of the former Army building in Tinton Falls, which he said had pushed the countywide vacancy rate at the start of the year to 17 percent from 8.2 percent prior to its purchase.
Jonathan B. Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization, another commercial real estate brokerage in Woodbridge, said that excluding the Tinton Falls building there were only two blocks of space of 50,000 to 120,000 square feet available in the entire county. That fact, he said, is beginning to spur the construction of new buildings constructedfor specific tenants.
As an example, he pointed to the 138,000-square-foot building under way along Industrial Way West, off Route 35 in Eatontown. It is being built by the Townsend Group of Towson, Md., the property owner, for TSSL Laboratories, the research and development arm of TYCO Submarine Systems Ltd., based in Morristown. Schultz represented Townsend in the transaction.
The need for more space prompted TYCO Submarine Systems, which designs, manufactures and installs undersea cable systems that transmit data, to move its research and development operations out of its current space in Holmdel, said Cheryl McCantz, a TYCO spokeswoman.
TYCO considered several sites within a 10-mile radius of Holmdel, "but none met both our physical and geographic needs," Ms. McCantz said. She added that she expected the research and development division to initially occupy 120,000 square feet in the building by February 1999. The remaining space will be used to meet the division's expansion needs.
MOST brokers agree that, in the short term, such build-to-suit deals will account for much of the construction activity in the county. One reason is that while average rental rates are increasing they are not yet at a point to justify speculative construction, said Jerry Richter, a senior director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage. At the end of 1997, his firm put the average rental rate for Class A space in the county at $23.87 a square foot, up from $18.07 the same time in 1996.
While there is some speculative construction going on in the state, Mr. Richter noted that the number of large blocks of available quality space of 200,000 square feet or more can be counted on one hand. There are at least a half a dozen companies looking for such space at any given time, he added.
For Matrix, this presents an opportunity to accommodate large users in its Tinton Falls building. Its financial partner in the project is AEW Capital Management of Boston. "We don't see this just as a Monmouth County redevelopment project because with its size, location and flexible floor plan we can draw tenants from the tristate region," said Kenneth A. Griffin, a partner at Matrix. The building -- designed as four separate wings and with 100,000-square-foot floors -- is equidistant from exits 105 and 109 of the Garden State Parkway, accessible to rail and ferry service to Manhattan and "in the middle of the excellent labor and housing market that Monmouth County affords," said Mr. Griffin
Plans for the structure, which was built in 1973, call for stripping it to its steel skeleton, redoing the interior and upgrading all mechanical systems. The building also will be given a new yet-to-be determined facade to replace its current nondescript one and the property, now mostly a sea of blacktop, will be extensively landscaped. The work, to begin by midyear, will be done in phases and is expected to be completed in six months.
Mr. Griffin said the building will be targeted to tenants needing 100,000 square feet of space or more. But he said that after at least a third of the building had been leased to large users his company would consider dividing the space into smaller areas.
But what the company thinks will give the project a significant advantage, said Richard F.X. Johnson, another Matrix partner, is that even with extensive renovations the space can be delivered faster and at a lower cost than new construction. Mr. Johnson said that new Class A space in the state rents for $27 to $31 a square foot on a gross basis, which includes taxes and operating costs. He said he expects rented at the Tinton Falls building to be $6 to $8 a square foot lower.
Tinton Falls welcomes the redevelopment because "it means a tremendous ratable for the borough," said Anthony J. Muscillo, its Business Administrator. The former owner, Stanwick/Cecom LLC of Dallas, filed a tax appeal that was settled for $1 million, Mr. Muscillo said. But, he added, "the borough wins in the long-term" because when redeveloped the building will bring in $1 million in taxes a year.
The renovation plan is also welcome, Mr. Muscillo said, because it takes a building that is something of a white elephant and turn it around.

HEADLINE: Summer Rentals: The Prices Are Holding Steady

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
LAST year when Sotheby's rented out a 1900's oceanfront estate in East Hampton, L.I., for $200,000 for the month of August, the company considered it a record for the area. Then, a couple of weeks ago, the estate's owner called Frank Newbold, head of Sotheby's East Hampton office, and said he had negotiated a deal himself for this summer.
"I've just had an offer for $400,000, and I want to thank you," Mr. Newbold said the owner had told him. The offer was for the entire season, but the owner explained that he would not have had the nerve to ask so much had the property not rented for such a high fee last year. 
 "Actually, we're getting a little used to breaking records," said Mr. Newbold, who has been in the realty business in the Hamptons for nearly 20 years. "Every time we think we've reached a new peak, along comes a price that breaks the barrier again."
While stories like that might make renters with thinner wallets cringe, the good news is that such phenomenal increases are limited to very high-end properties, usually expansive homes on or near the ocean. Overall in the Northeast, summer rental fees in beach areas seem to be holding steady this year or going up 5 to 10 percent. "I would say our prices are about the same as last year," said Patricia Garrity, an agent with Allan M. Schneider Associates in Southampton, L.I.
Closer to New York City, Wayne Roth, a broker with Fire Island Real Estate of Ocean Beach, L.I., agreed. A two- to three-bedroom house there has remained about $10,000 for the season (well below prices in the Hamptons, he noted), going up into the mid $30,000's for an property on the ocean or the bay with four or five bedrooms.
Mr. Roth said that his properties were about 90 percent booked by mid-February -- "the earliest we've ever accomplished that."
While demand has been strong in the Hamptons, brokers are quick to stress that there is still plenty of inventory left in vacation-oriented communities in the metropolitan area and beyond.
And the range of prices in which these houses or condominiums can be leased varies greatly.
It is possible to spend $500 a week for a cottage on Cape Cod, or $1,500 for a week in a three-bedroom unit near the boardwalk in Ocean City, N.J., or $100,000 for a month in a waterfront homestead in Martha's Vineyard.
Price is dictated by distance from the water, the time of vacation and the size of the property, with amenities playing an ever-increasing role in determining value.
Every year, brokers say, there seems to be a tendency for people who can plan summer vacations early to shop ever earlier for their vacation housing. Sometimes the reports of this phenomenon discourage shoppers prematurely.
Unlocking the door to a three-story farmhouse a block from downtown Southampton, Ms. Garrity used the house as an example of what happened last year. "This house normally rents in December or January," she said. "Last year, it did not rent until April, and the price had been dropped from $45,000 to $40,000 for the season." This year, the owner listed the seven-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath house, with a pool, at $42,000 for the season.
"She was very concerned about the appropriate price to get a good tenant early and to be done with it," Ms. Garrity said. She succeeded -- the house has been rented.
But, brokers added, there is little room for negotiation in price this year, and most homeowners are getting what they ask.
"Every house I've done this year has been full price," Ms. Garrity said.
While it is hard to make generalities about areas as diverse as Ocean City, N.J., and Southampton, a few trends seem common. Renters are shopping earlier, properties at the high end are filling up quickly and strong sales up and down the East Coast have depleted the stock of prime properties in some areas.
"We still have places left if you're not locked into a time period and if you're not set on the high-end amenities," said Grayce Kelleher, an agent at Chris Clemans & Company in Cape May, N.J., a quaint Victorian town at the tip of the Jersey Shore.
But for the selective, it may be more difficult. By early February, she said, it was already getting tough to find precisely what callers wanted.
"It's getting hard and it's going to get much harder," said Ms. Kelleher, who fielded 24 calls about rentals in a two-hour period on the first Friday of February. "When the caller has specific weeks and requirements I may only have two or three properties to offer them."
While the Presidents' Day weekend used to signal the start of rental shopping in many beach communities, that trend is shifting. On Cape Cod, for example, some brokers are starting in November and asking people to reconfirm.
"This is our second year of that," said Beth Hardy Sparrow, rental department coordinator with John C. Ricotta & Associates in Chatham, Mass.
Ms. Sparrow said the early bookings had depleted portions of the company's inventory, particularly waterfront properties -- some of which increased 50 percent in rental price in the last three years, compared with 5 to 20 percent for less expensive properties in the same time period.
"It's getting a little bit pricey here," Ms. Sparrow said, explaining that rents start at about $700 a week for a cottage and go up to about $10,000 a week for a waterfront home. "A family able to get something really nice for $1,000 a week finds themselves settling for something a little more cottagey."
However, she emphasized that there were still plenty of quality listings available, although they "do tend to be further from the water and more of a walk to town."
But because the Cape has so many diverse communities, there is a wide variety in price.
In Eastham, Mass., Mary Carey, a rental agent with Anchor Real Estate, said homes were booking up quickly, with prices ranging from $500 a week for an efficiency to $3,200 a week for a three-bedroom waterfront house on the bay.
"People have learned that if they want to get the best choice they need to reserve early," she said, adding that by the end of January her office had booked half the total number of last year's rentals, a third of the bookings from repeat tenants who had made their reservations last summer.
In Avalon, N.J., long considered a summer destination for residents from Philadelphia's upscale Main Line, shopping started in October and November, said Randy Leiser of the Avalon Real Estate Agency, which also handles properties in neighboring Stone Harbor, N.J.
"It's coming earlier this year than it ever has," said Mr. Leiser.
He said that in addition to the early rentals, the rental season was getting longer.
"Many people are opting to take a week in June or September," he said. "The other thing that's beginning to happen is that our rental rates have gotten higher, and as a result we're seeing more and more investors return to the market.
While in the early 90's rent increases were modest, at a "few percentage points a year," Mr. Leiser said, "in the last two to three years many of them have gone up 10 and 15 percent."
"The ones that are able to raise the rates that much are the nicest ones," he said, "the largest -- the closer to the beach the better -- three or more bedrooms, central air and nice comforts."
He gave as an example a four-bedroom, four-bath house at 177 61st Street in Avalon, which sits one house back from the beach. Known as an "upside down house" because the living area is on the top and bedrooms on the bottom, it rented for $4,800 a week last year between mid-July and mid-August. This year it is listed at $5,200 a week during that period.
"And it's going to fill up," said Mr. Leiser, estimating that the company's listings were 50 to 60 percent booked.
For the most part the increasing prices at the upper tiers of the market result from the dynamics of supply and demand. But, agents said, increasingly those inventories are being affected by sales.
"The sales market has been so strong that a lot of houses that used to be available for rent are no longer available," Ms. Garrity said. "Houses that supplied the best value in the rental and sales market were sold."
ON a sunny Friday in early February, the streets of Southampton were quiet as Ms. Garrity previewed a range of homes for rent in the area. For $21,000 there was a quaint three-bedroom cottage on Wooley Pond in Southampton Shores, available for the season. A three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath shingle cottage with pool two blocks from the ocean near Southampton's estate section runs $36,000 for the season.
At $70,000 for the season there was a five-bedroom, two-and-half-bath contemporary with pool and clay tennis court in Water Mill. Moving up the scale (and actually into Southampton's estate section) there was a Stanford White classic on 2.3 acres with pool at $120,000 for the season.
But as prices move upward, brokers say, it makes sense to consider buying. "If you pay $70,000 in rent and get a nice house, wouldn't you just put $70,000 on a house and just buy it?" she said.
With a strong economy and Wall Street generating tidy profits, the answer to that question seems to have been a resounding yes. Prime properties -- in most cases that means oceanfront or water views -- are being sold. And in many cases, the buyers aren't renting out.
"There was a period of time back in the summer when we were tracking our sales," said Mr. Leiser in Avalon. "Out of every 10 properties sold, six or seven were not going back on the rental market, so you can see what that does to the inventory."
Still, brokers are quick to stress that new listings are constantly coming on the market and new development is creating new properties. But renters may have to be flexible when it comes to location and amenities.
"For the discerning tenant it's a tight market," Ms. Garrity said. "There aren't as many options."
But amenities is one area where demands have been increasing, brokers said. "I would say that the biggest change in the rental market over the last few years has been that more and more tenants are demanding more and more amenities," said Ms. Sparrow in Chatham.
Just a few years ago, she said, it was easy to rent those quintessential Cape Cod cottages with no washer, dryer or dishwasher.
"Today tenants are demanding that homes be equipped with those amenities plus microwave, newer color televisions and VCR's," she said, adding that there were also increased requests for fax machines and second phone lines.
In Nantucket, Mass., Penny Dey at Congdon & Coleman said she had seen a similar trend. Not that long ago, she said, "a little peeling paint didn't matter."
"Now people who are coming here are more particular about amenities," she said.
While high-end properties generally rent by the month, Ms. Dey said she was also seeing a trend to one-week rentals. She said she had also started to see people from the Hamptons gravitate to Nantucket, where prices -- although high -- are lower.
A three- or four-bedroom house, a quarter mile from the beach, runs about $3,000 a week, she said, with a basic two-bedroom cottage in Siasconset would be about $1,000 a week.
At the high end, she mentioned a five-bedroom home just west of Nantucket with direct waterfront access. Just finished, it is full of amenities and rents for $15,000 a week, but will be held for a full-month rental at $60,000.
"They want to come to Nantucket because the Hamptons are getting too crowded and too expensive," Ms. Dey said. "And of course there's a fear here we're going to turn into the Hamptons."
IN the Berkshires and Vermont, which are not at all like the Hamptons, prices and demand are about the same as last year, brokers said.
"In the Berkshires the rental market is more of an afterthought," said Joseph Carini, president of Wheeler and Taylor Real Estate in Great Barrington, Mass. "People don't usually buy houses with the clear intention of renting them for part of the year, but some folks do."
Mr. Carini said that rents ranged from $3,500 to as much as $20,000 a month.
For $4,000 a month, a renter can get a three-bedroom, two-bath house about 10 miles from the Tanglewood Music Center. At four times that amount, Mr. Carini said, a renter can get a 10-bedroom mansion with four-and-half baths in Stockbridge, just a short distance from Stockbridge Bowl and Tanglewood.
"You can actually hear the music wafting over," he said.
Most properties book by the month, he said, noting that "most people who want to visit for a week or two are better advised to consider bed and breakfasts."
There's still plenty of time and inventory, he said, with the rental market not picking up until March.
In Vermont, where the ski season is still going strong, real estate companies have barely thought of summer.
"We're buried in snow," said Judy Findeisen, a rental specialist with Martin Associates in Killington. She said the summer rental season generally started in March and is "there to be accommodating."
"Summer rentals are usually not difficult to come by, and the price is less than in the winter," she said.
Many Vermont renters are Floridians escaping the summer heat who book condominiums, she said. At one upscale Killington condo, which has a restaurant, sports center and indoor pool, rents start at $1,000 a month for a two-bedroom unit.
Her most expensive home -- a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath home on a peninsula in the Killington area, runs $1,600 a week. House rentals start at about $700 a month.
Despite increasing demand for properties in the Adirondacks, prices have generally stayed even with last year, said Denise Bujold, a rental specialist in the Saranac Lake office of Rob Grant & Associates. However, she too reported a strong demand for larger high-end homes.
She said prices ranged from $750 a week for a one- or two-bedroom cottage on a small lake (not Lake Placid or Saranac Lake) to $4,000 a week for a large (five- to eight-bedroom) home on one of the larger lakes with amenities such as modern kitchens, fireplaces, Jacuzzis and perhaps even a boat.
While Ms. Bujold estimated that about 40 percent of her properties were booked, she said she "wouldn't discourage someone even as late as June."
But for those planning a beach vacation, it may be a good idea to pick up the phone. "This year it's like everybody in the whole world wants to come here," said Carlotta Whirty, rental manager at Lila Delman Real Estate in Narragansett, R.I.
"I have people who would spend $20,000 a month if they could get something on the water," she said, adding that she has increasingly heard the phrase "money is not an object."
If that sounds as if it would make life easy for a rental agent, don't believe it, Ms. Whirty said. "I have to turn them down," she said. "That's hard."

HEADLINE: Ask How Many, Don't Ask Why

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Phil Arkow has 2,000 dog license tags. He has one dog. There is no entirely satisfactory explanation for this wide discrepancy, which keeps getting worse. Before he is done, it is Mr. Arkow's stated purpose to gather thousands more tags but remain with the single dog.
Mr. Arkow understands that this may seem abnormal. He can live with that. "Collectors are crazy," he shrugged as he sifted through his beloved assemblage of tags. "I don't think there is any logical reason for any of this." 
 The dog tags represent his own idiosyncratic take on collecting stamps or baseball cards or Elvis memorabilia. It has its appeal. By and large, the tags are free. It has its drawbacks. The dog tags are, well, dog tags.
"When you get into it, they're as fascinating as stamps or coins," he said. "There are oddities. There are errors. People specialize. Some want tags with their birth year. Some want tags with a certain lucky number. My goal is to get one tag from each community that issues them. There are 30,000."
Mr. Arkow, a bespectacled man with a quizzical look, describes himself as "50 going on 15." He keeps his dog tags stashed in the attic of his home in Stratford. His wife, Melody, doesn't get it. Spouse apathy (if not outright derision) is not uncommon in collector households.
After all, the inner logic of amassing dog tags undoubtedly escapes much of the population, who at best see it as esoteric and at worst as majestically idiotic. Does an Alma, Mich., dog tag have any real value to anyone but an Alma, Mich., dog, or the pet's owner?
Yet Phil Arkow finds a kind of peace in dog license tags, just as Melvin Goldberg does in items that were manufactured during the American occupation of Japan and just as Willard Carey does in sugar packets. They are among thousands of people who care deeply about things like toothpick holders, infant feeders, cocktail napkins, beer cans, citrus labels, church bulletins, foreign plastic bags, cuff links, wine corks or 45-RPM record players.
Few can relate in any comprehensible form why they do what they do. When pressed, many collectors give up on studied explanations and simply recite the theory that they were born with some sort of instinct to accumulate objects. They speak of how when they come across two of something they get this nagging itch to look for a third.
Most obsessed collectors belong to a national club devoted to appreciators of their chosen obsession. There is a club for almost every collectible, from spark plugs to swizzle sticks. They receive newsletters. They learn the arcane histories of their beloved treasures. They discover colleagues with whom they can communicate, visit, swap objects. A dog tag collector cannot commune with a soap wrapper man; they need their own kind.
 
DOG TAGS
2,000 Items So Far For a Grand Total of $2
Phil Arkow was all smiles at the door of his suburban home. He had just returned from his job as a communications director for a foundation in Philadelphia.
At his dining table, he proudly showed some of his tags (besides dog tags, he has a few dozen of the far rarer cat tags). "This is probably the oddest one in my collection," he said. It was from 1973, issued by the town of Minden, and it was in the shape of Texas. Minden, however, is in Nebraska.
"There are a lot of different tags shaped as fire hydrants," he said. "They've been accused of being sexist."
"Look at this," he went on. He held up a tag from Manitou Springs, Colo. It was a dog tag in the shape of a cat. "Maybe they got two for the price of one if they took the cat design," he said.
As he combed through his tags, he was polite in remarking, "You don't have to act like you're interested in this."
Mr. Arkow entered this world from the related universe of license plates. As a youngster he collected license plates he found on the side of the road. When he got older and bought his own house, he decorated the study not with artwork but with license plates. Then he heard about dog tag collections.
This was in the mid-1970's, when he was working for a humane society in Colorado Springs. The bulk of the dogs brought in, by owners giving up their pets, bore tags that they no longer needed. "So I got them, so to speak, first paw," he said. If he was going to collect something, and he felt he ought to, dog license tags were a more suitable fit. He sold most of the 200 license plates he had accumulated and got to work on dog tags.
When he travels, Mr. Arkow makes a point to drop in on local animal shelters. Many of them have had visits from tag collectors before, so they graciously leave a bowl of expendable tags on the counter at the entrance. Some people arm themselves with metal detectors and scour yards for tags, especially construction sites when a foundation is being laid and the lot has been dug up. Or they buy them at flea markets.
"I refuse to buy them," Mr. Arkow said. "I'm cheap. I think I bought one tag in a moment of weakness, a 1913 tag from Cripple Creek, Colo. I sprang for $2. I liked it because it was in the shape of an elongated dog biscuit."
From time to time, he speaks at meetings of dog catchers and, while in their company, often manages to arrange to get some tags from the catchers.
There is one rather obvious way to acquire dog tags, although it carries morally repugnant overtones, which is to simply remove them from submissive dogs while their owners are not looking.
Did he know anyone who swiped a tag off a dog?
"I did," he said right back. "It was about 10 years ago on the beach in Mexico. A dog came up to me and I figured I needed a Mexican dog tag more than he did."
A few times, Mr. Arkow has attended the annual convention of dog tag collectors. Once he met a guy who had 30,000 tags. He traveled around with them in a safe.
Many tag collectors hunt for other objects as well, most commonly license plates, police badges, railway tokens and key chains. "They seem to be interested in small things made out of metal," said Mr. Arkow, who says he does not share this broader metallic interest, his past dalliance with license plates notwithstanding.
Others range farther afield. "I met one dog tag collector," he said, "who said he was one of only 12 people in the world to go to all 3,130 county courthouses. He collected going to county courthouses."
Mr. Arkow spoke without condescension. He also collects sand. Each time he and his wife are at a new beach, they stow some sand in a small bottle, label it and add it to their stockpile. They know of no other sand collectors, but that doesn't inhibit them. They have about 200 sand samples.
"Now and then we say we'll pour it all together and have a clam bake," Mr. Arkow said. "Or maybe grow our own island."
 
NOT THAT O.J.
Anything Goes If It Has the Mark
Melvin Goldberg is a physician in Clifton who has never been to Japan and has no interest in visiting the country. Yet he has 5,000 items that were made in Japan. Not just made in Japan, he will hastily point out. Made in occupied Japan.
He darts in and out of flea markets and garage sales and flips objects upside down in hope of seeing the "Mark." The Mark is everything, either the M.I.O.J. Mark ("Made in Occupied Japan") or the O.J. Mark ("Occupied Japan"). The Mark confirms that the object was made for export to the United States during the years that the American forces occupied Japan after World War II. That covers seven years, from 1945 to 1952.
Something like 50,000 different objects were made by the Japanese during the years that they began to rebuild their capsized economy. Many of them carried one of two other marks -- "Japan" and "Made in Japan" -- but those are of no interest to Dr. Goldberg, because he has no way of proving that they were actually made during the all-important occupation years. He and fellow collectors talk of "going O.J. hunting" and of being "O.J. collectors," sometimes feeling the need to clarify by adding that they are not referring to a Mr. Simpson.
About 400 people belong to an Occupied Japan Club, including Dr. Goldberg and two Japanese people living in Japan. The club holds a biennial convention and publishes a bimonthly newsletter called, "The Upside Down World of an O.J. Collector." The title alludes to the practice of upending objects to look for the Mark.
O.J. items range from the emphatically utilitarian to the decorative: hammers, fishing rods, cigarette lighters, tablecloths, clocks, lamps, porcelain figurines, toys, cameras, umbrellas, snow cone makers.
"I don't know exactly how many objects I have, but I always say I have 5,000 items," Dr. Goldberg said of his prodigious collection. "I have a lot of duplicates. You know those little packages of sewing needles? I have 990 packages of them. I bought them from some guy at a flea market. I got them all for $10. He didn't even ask why I wanted them. He just wanted to sell the needles."
He has innumerable porcelain figurines and small toys. He has a mess of cigarette lighters, complete sets of china, settings for 8 and for 12. He has lamps and plaques and miniature cameras. He has jewelry, celluloid dolls, harmonicas, a disappearing coin trick, rubber erasers, Christmas ornaments, a pin with the Lone Ranger on it and another one with Hopalong Cassidy. He has drill bits and buttons.
It was an offhand remark that got Dr. Goldberg going. "I was with my wife-to-be and future in-laws in Virginia at a flea market in 1971," he said. "My father-in-law-to-be saw these figurines from occupied Japan. He had been an antiques dealer, and he said, 'This is a good thing to collect.' I bought three ceramic figurines for $5, and that got me started."
His original intent was to gather the objects as an investment. Discerning the possibility of the pieces eventually escalating in value and in part funding his retirement, he bought them with his contributions to his pension plan. In the mid-1980's, the law changed and one could no longer invest pension money in collectibles. Dr. Goldberg kept on buying the occupied Japan objects. He likes collecting them.
Dr. Goldberg got many of his items for little money. There are so many more collectors now, as well as a raft of books showing objects and estimating values, and prices have shot up. Some objects are estimated to be worth in the hundreds of dollars and a few at more than $1,000.
He has also started collecting objects made in occupied Germany. They are harder to find. Fewer years were involved. Occupation troops prowled Germany only between 1945 and 1949.
The objects bear stamps like "Made in Germany U.S. Zone" or "Made in Germany British Zone." Dr. Goldberg has about 200 items so far. He has a hammer and tool set, a decanter, some toy cars, a bracelet. He has a book that was published in Frankfurt in 1948. It is printed in Polish. Dr. Goldberg had a Polish patient translate the title, then lost interest. The book is about metallurgical engineering.
 
SUGAR
Ants and Moisture Are the Big Threats
For Willard Carey, the beginning was a Jersey restaurant, a kid's birthday party. He never saw it coming.
In 1948, when he was seven years old, he was invited with some gambolling classmates to a friend's birthday celebration at Pal's Cabin, a restaurant in West Orange.
"Being jerks, everyone filled their pockets with sugar packets," he explained. "I took them home and put them in a shoe box. Then I had two shoe boxes. Then I had three shoe boxes."
He got older but the urge persisted. He is up to five shoe boxes, something like 3,000 packets and another 300 sugar cubes. He has them from airlines, country clubs, hotels, restaurants cheap and expensive. He has them from Tahiti, France, Switzerland. He has some from Africa.
Music advanced his collection. When he was in first grade, he took up the drums, and when he got out of college, he played with a 16-piece band until the age of 42. That got him into a lot of hotels and restaurants, repositories of sugar.
"All the time I travel and whenever I'm in a restaurant, the first thing I do is look at the sugar bowl," he said. "I always take just two -- one for a backup or to trade. I've never been a hog, not since that first time."
Collecting sugar packets is low budget. Then again, no one envisions a collection being auctioned off at Christie's. Only about 300 people are thought to be avowed packet collectors.
Some sugar maniacs look to complete sets -- all the islands of Hawaii or all Marriott hotels or all the airlines. In years past, there was a series of packets with the Presidents on them, another with famous athletes, another with frontier characters. Some collectors concentrate on cubes. Others limit their holdings to packets from places where they have eaten. Mr. Carey is less specific. "I just go for volume," he said.
In recent years, Mr. Carey has noticed a pronounced decline in this country in distinction in packets. In the interest of saving pennies, many restaurants seem content to offer generic packets with no colorful illustrations and no name on them beyond Domino. "It makes it hard on us," he sighed.
He lives in South Plainfield and works as operations support manager for gas for Public Service Electric & Gas in Newark. He has a network of about 10 co-workers who know of his packet devotion. They make it a point to retrieve sugar for him on their own excursions.
Mr. Carey's wife, Phyllis, does not think much of his compulsion. She did not marry her husband for his sugar. To her, sugar is sugar, a staple commodity.
To her relief, he does not engage dinner guests much in sugar conversation. "There's not that much to talk about," he said.
Generally, the protocol is for packet collectors to drain the sugar packets to ward off invasion by ants and moisture. Mr. Carey had been derelict. He kept them fully packed on a shelf above his workbench. "It wasn't until last year that I brought all the boxes out of the basement," he said. "I was lucky. Not one was attacked."
Using a surgical scalpel, he spent several weekends at his kitchen table carefully slitting each packet along its crease and emptying the sugar.
He has no good explanation for why he collects something that most people are content to add to their coffee. "You tell me," he said. "I can't tell you why I do it."
He thought a moment, and then said, "My grandmother in Scotia, N.Y., collected salt and pepper shakers. She had like 500 of them. I couldn't tell why she did that. She couldn't either."
He has no incurable sweet tooth. He takes his coffee with two sugars. "That's probably too much," he allowed.
Did he ever try to meditate on why he did it?
He replied evenly, "I've had more important things to think about, like cutting the grass."
Sugar remains his solitary extracurricular pursuit. "I once thought of collecting keys," he said. "But then I realized, what would I have -- a bunch of keys."
As much as the sugar packets mean to Mr. Carey, he is at a loss to know what future value his collection might have. Who would inherit it? Where would it ultimately wind up? "After I go," he said, "my collection will probably end up in the garbage."

Agins/The New York Times)(pg. 1); THE ATTRACTION of Melvin Goldberg's chosen pursuit, objects made in occupied Japan, is that they run the gamut from utilitarian to decorative. Or maybe it's that some of his pieces, top, are actually worth something. Willard Carey, above, has no such problem with his sugar packets. For them and for Phil Arkow's dog tags (even the Portuguese ones above right), there will be no Christie's auctions in the future. (Photographs by Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times)(pg. 8)

Not Quite Gone, Far From Forgotten: Newark, Capital of Jazz

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
In the early part of the century, Newark was known as a "ticklers town." The great black jazz piano players had to come and play in the clubs in the section called the Coast on their way to greatness. None other than Duke Ellington said in his memoirs that in the 1920's, one of the best places to hear black music was Newark.
In clubs with names like Conertons, Bill Buss's Saloon and Randolphs, jazz that was every bit as vibrant and lavishly original as anything heard across the river in New York City was being played here in the narrow strip running from Lincoln Park north to Branford Place Park and west of Broad Street to Washington Street. 
 On Saturday night, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center offers a glimpse of that time and its music in "The Lost Jazz Shrines of Newark." Conceived and developed by the Newark poet and essayist Amiri Baraka, the multi-media program will use memorabilia and photographs from Mr. Baraka's collection and others to illustrate musical and vocal performances by the 15-piece New Arkestra, made up largely of local jazz performers. The program is based on Mr. Baraka's research and rendering in dramatic readings of the life of Willie (the Lion) Smith, an early composer and jazz great whose proficiency in stride piano was considered by many to transcend that of the better-known James P. Johnson and Fats Waller.
The program in Newark, sponsored by Absolut Vodka and the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, is one of nine around the country intended to highlight the cities, areas, clubs and informal spaces that nurtured jazz and its creators from its beginning. Maurine Knighton, executive director of the Brooklyn arts center 651, who helped develop the idea, said some common strains had emerged from city to city as the organizers looked at the evolution of jazz shrines.
"There were formal sites like clubs and ballrooms, but there were informal sites as well, like community centers, Masonic halls and churches," she said, noting that the venues were as wildly improvised as the music itself. "People had a proprietary sense about the music, and they held it close and very dear."
The other cities planning programs commemorating their jazz shrines are New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., and San Antonio, Tex. In New York, three programs will highlight locations in Brooklyn, Greenwich Village and Harlem.
Mr. Baraka said Willie (the Lion) Smith was a regular on the New York jazz scene from the 1920's until his death in 1974. But his career started in Newark, where he grew up and, as a teen-ager, began playing in the saloons, brothels and "buffet flats" -- homes where music was played and food was sold -- of the city's tenderloin district just before and after World War I. It was a time when there was entertainment around the clock, and the first thing a new club or saloon would do when it opened was to have a ceremony built around throwing away the key to the place.
For the Newark program, Robert Banks, 68, a local pianist and organist who learned his craft from musicians influenced by "the Lion," will play many of the pieces Smith wrote and performed in the old days.
He describes the style of playing Smith popularized as an up-tempo style that relied on a heavy stride -- left-handed playing that spanned all six and half octaves -- and a lot of countermelody and syncopation. Mr. Banks said one of Smith's signature pieces was "Fingerbuster," a fast-moving piece in which the pianist must demonstrates skill in moving rapidly up and down the entire keyboard.
Unlike most musicians, Smith's nickname had nothing to do with his playing; it came from his service in World War I as an artilleryman. For 49 days straight, he manned a howitzer alone on the front lines in France, prompting his colonel to call him "a lion with that gun."
Mr. Baraka said neighborhoods like the Coast thrived in good economic times but suffered during the Depression, when many clubs and close. But the jazz venues never entirely disappeared, and new places cropped up in the 1930's and 40's as the clubs spread west into the Central Ward and stride gave way to swing. There, clubs with names like Jumping Jive, Lloyds Manor and the Orpheum featured headliners including Newark's own Savoy Sultans, who spiced their performance by dancing while they played and passing their instruments around without missing a beat.
As recordings replaced live performances as the major vehicle for the spread of jazz or any other music, the clubs disappeared. But even today, Newark maintains three or four jazz venues that still attract top performers.
In an effort to spread the word about Newark's jazz history, Mr. Baraka and the Performing Arts Center are planning on expanding the program to look at different eras in the city's jazz evolution and staging performances by the New Arkestra of the music of those periods at local clubs.
"We wanted to take it out into the communities so that people can see what a rich musical history the city has," said Stephanie S. Hughley, the center's vice president for programming. "We hope we can translate some of the enthusiasm of those times."
"The Lost Jazz Shrines of Newark," Saturday at 7:30 P.M. in the Victoria Theater, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark. Tickets: $15 and $20. Information: (888) 466-5722.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Prescribing a Fiscal Pill For a Long-Term Cure

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey is awash in cash.
Because of the economic boom, state budget officials estimate there will be $1.3 billion in additional tax revenues over the next 18 months. That is on top of the state's $550 million budget surplus, sitting in a "rainy day" fund that has gone untouched this year. 
 So why didn't Governor Whitman recommend giving more of this money back to taxpayers when she outlined her new budget earlier this month?
After all, voters made it abundantly clear last fall that they were not happy about paying the highest property taxes in the nation. And cutting taxes is not a new concept for Mrs. Whitman. Keeping her 1993 campaign promise to cut income tax rates thrust her onto the national political stage and spurred states across the country to follow her lead.
Yet, in her new $17.95 billion budget, Mrs. Whitman proposed a spending increase of almost $1 billion for the fiscal year starting July 1. That's a 5.4 percent increase over this year's budget, the single largest spending increase since she took office four years ago.
Mrs. Whitman did propose one new tax cut. She wants to eliminate the sales tax on long-distance calls made within the state, which would save consumers and businesses about $24 million a year. However, a $24 million tax cut represents only 1.3 percent of the state's $1.8 billion projected budget surplus.
Defending her approach, Mrs. Whitman notes that she and lawmakers have already cut taxes 17 times since 1994. The state's tax-cutting record, she says, has helped create the economic boom that is pouring more money into the state's coffers. She argues that her budget "honors our commitment to use taxpayers' dollars wisely."
Governor Whitman is not alone in recommending higher spending over tax cuts this year. State spending is rising at about the same pace across the country, and two-thirds of the nation's governors are Republican. In New York, Governor George E. Pataki, a Republican who is running for re-election this year, has proposed an 8.5 percent spending increase over this year's budget.
Also, Mrs. Whitman is not exactly going on a spending spree. She is not recommending any sweeping new programs. More than half of the billion-dollar increase is earmarked for public schools, and school districts are complaining that it is not enough. Another $61 million increase is proposed for the state's community colleges and state universities to help hold the line on tuition.
Other spending increases include $29 million for New Jersey Transit to avoid bus and transit fare increases this year; $15 million to build bike paths throughout the state; $25 million to help cities reclaim abandoned buildings, and $50 million for a down payment on the Governor's pledge to help preserve open space and farmland. Mrs. Whitman also called for putting aside $650 million into next year's "rainy day" fund, giving the state a large cushion.
The Governor insists that her budget offered plenty of relief for property-tax payers by raising school spending and slightly increasing municipal aid.
But municipal aid did not rise significantly. Most of the increase for public schools covers pension costs for teachers, not classroom supplies.
The absence of any "direct" property relief is giving Democrats plenty of fodder to present themselves as fiscal conservatives. By portraying themselves as tax cutters, they are trying to erase voters' memories that they supported former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase.
State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Democrat from Camden, has called on the Governor to use about $400 million of the surplus to expand the homestead rebate program. Until 1992, the program provided rebates, up to $500 annually, for families earning less than $100,000. Now, the program covers only families earning less than $40,000, as well as senior citizens and disabled individuals. The rebate checks now are no more than $90.
"Governor Whitman went on television three months ago to tell New Jerseyans that she heard their cries for property tax relief 'loud and clear,' " Mr. Bryant said, referring to a Whitman advertising spot during the waning days of last fall's campaign. "The Governor can effectively respond to the public's demand for solutions by putting tax rebate checks into the hands of working families."
There is no doubt that a rebate check would be welcomed in every New Jersey household. But voters want more than a $90 check in the mail. They want sweeping changes in the property tax system that will significantly lower their tax burden. That means relying more on state dollars and less on local property taxes to cover the cost of public schools.
Before even considering such changes, New Jersey would first need to get its own fiscal house in order. Under the direction of a new state treasurer, James A. DiEleuterio Jr., this is the first budget in four years that is not riddled with risky fiscal maneuvers. In this budget, the Governor is proposing to spend no more than what the state takes in. At the same time, the budget sets $650 million into the rainy day fund.
Putting the state on firm fiscal footing does not give much comfort to tax-weary homeowners. But, in the end, it is the only way that New Jerseyans can one day get the level of property tax relief that they are demanding.

A Firm Friend Starts to Waver

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL

 BODY:
FROM the time Turkey sent soldiers to fight alongside Americans in the Korean War, leaving more than 700 of them buried in the cold Korean earth, this country has been one of the United States' closest allies.
When the United States needed territory on which to build spy stations for monitoring the Soviet Union, Turkey provided it. When it sought an air base in the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey made one available. When it was looking for allies in the Persian Gulf War and support for the embargo against Iraq, Turkey proved reliable even as it lost billions of dollars in trade. 
 In return, the United States has stood firmly behind Turkey. Huge amounts of American weaponry have flowed to the Turkish army, and criticism of Turkish human rights abuses is always more muted in Washington than it is in European capitals.
In recent days, however, this long friendship has shown signs of stress. American plans to bomb Iraq have brought to the surface doubts that have been spreading here since the end of the cold war.
According to a public opinion survey conducted last week for a leading Istanbul newspaper, 63 percent of Turks oppose the plans to bomb Iraq. Even public figures who have supported the United States in the past are expressing fears that such a campaign could trigger new instability in a region that has become increasingly volatile lately.
"There is a greater feeling of concern about what America is doing than I have seen here since we joined NATO 50 years ago," said Cuneyt Akalin, a professor of political science at Galatasaray University in Istanbul. "Politicians who are expressing reservations about the American plan for bombing are winning a lot of public sympathy. Saddam is certainly a bad guy, but there is a lot of concern about why the Americans are going after him so hard at this moment. If he strikes against Israel and Israel reacts, there will be real chaos."
 
Tensions Nearby
Professor Akalin cited other tensions in the region -- instability in the nations of the Caucasus and between Israel and the Palestinians. "People in Turkey who used to take refuge in NATO and the United States now think that maybe we should become more friendly with Russia," he said. "A lot of big questions are in the air."
Turkish fears are based in part on a sense that a bombing campaign against Iraq could create trouble in unpredictable ways for the entire region. More specifically, Turks remember that the 1991 gulf war left them with big problems -- the loss of revenues from a pipeline that once took Iraqi oil across Turkey to the Mediterranean, the sudden arrival of one million Kurdish refugees from Iraq and economic collapse in southeastern provinces that had relied on over-the-border trade with Iraq.
The gulf war also led to creation of a Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq that has become a sanctuary for anti-Turkish guerrillas. Many Turkish politicians fear that if there is another round of conflict, the enclave could become a full-fledged Kurdish state.
Seeking to calm these fears, the United States Ambassador to Turkey, Mark Parris, summoned Turkish journalists to a briefing at which he asserted that maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity is "the bedrock of U.S. policy toward Iraq." He added, "We would not support establishment of any separatist entities with respect to Iraq or anywhere else."
Nonetheless, even Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, a pro-American figure who is a close ally of the Turkish military, is worried about what might happen in the wake of an attack. "Turkey has reason to be alarmed," Mr. Yilmaz told reporters who accompanied him on a state visit to Ukraine. "We are still very concerned about the possibility of a Kurdish state emerging in the region. It wouldn't necessarily come from an American plan. After an attack, things may develop spontaneously."
 
Clamping Down
Fears that bombing Iraq could lead to new assertiveness by Kurds have already pushed the Government into action at home. Police officers have raided offices of the only legal Kurdish political party, arresting important leaders on charges of plotting separatism. It was perhaps the first political fallout from the American attack, unfolding even before the first bomb has fallen.
Even Turks who do not believe that a Kurdish state will emerge after the expected bombing of Iraq wonder if the United States has measured all the possible consequences.
"We know the military objective, which is to destroy weapons of mass destruction," said Sukru Elekdag, a former Turkish ambassador to the United States. "But what will be the broader political effect? We don't know. Either the Americans are not telling the Turks what they envision, or they haven't thought about it. Either way it's very bad.
"There is no sympathy in this country for Saddam, and Turks feel generally that his weapons of mass destruction should be eliminated," Mr. Elekdag said. "But we have to look beyond the war. The subsequent situation should not be worse than present conditions. There could be chaos or confusion, which would encourage Iran to take advantage of the situation by attacking Iraq, or any number of other possibilities.
"If the United States withdraws now without getting some important results, it would be seen as a paper tiger, which would be bad for Turkey and the whole area. But there is no urgency at this moment. Saddam is not about to use his weapons, so the United States can afford to be a little more patient."
Another close observer of Turkish foreign policy, Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Bilgi University in Istanbul, recalled that many Turks supported the United States only grudgingly during the gulf war. He said support is even weaker now.
"As the days pass, more and more people are thinking that the Americans are not right this time," Mr. Ozel said. "There are so many negative possibilities, and we don't have the sense that the Americans have thought them through."

HEADLINE: Kiss, Kiss, Dar-leeng, Where Do You Want to Go?

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN 

 BODY:
ON a Friday afternoon, as other travel agents were shutting down early for the long Presidents' Day weekend, the call came. Could the Frenchway Travel agency get the models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell from Cape Town to Havana by that Monday? They absolutely had to be there for a photo shoot for Harper's Bazaar.
In a flash, Esther Tavor, an owner of the agency, was on the case. "Don't tell me no -- I tell you that is not acceptable," she said tersely over the telephone to an airline representative, her heavy French accent blending parfaitement with the cigarette smoke and smell of espresso wafting through the office. The wheels of Frenchway were turning. 
 The world, encircled by thousands of leagues of topographical lines, may be a big place. But it is not nearly so unfathomable to the women of Frenchway, an agency on the eighth floor of a modest office building at 11 West 25th Street in Chelsea. With the tactical prowess and sang-froid of generals at war, Ms. Tavor and Yael Choukroun -- sisters, French natives and the agency's founders and owners -- are experts at dealing with one of the more formidable threats to world peace: the fashion emergency.
The agency's style-in-overdrive ethos was palpable even to a Federal Express man, who was there to pick up some last-minute parcels. "Wait, darling," another Frenchway operative said, her voice somewhere between a coo and a bark. "One minute."
For the record, "darling," one of the commoner words around Frenchway, is pronounced dar-LEENG. The agency, started 13 years ago, has a staff of 11, all of them women. "One man in here, and forget it," Ms. Tavor said with a dismissive gesture and a roll of her eyes, as though the presence of a member of the opposite sex would undermine the agency's motto: "We do it . . . with passion. . . ."
That passion has built quite a following in the fashion industry: the designers Thierry Mugler and Azzedine Alaia; agencies like Wilhelmina Models, Next Management and Women Model Management; photographers like Mario Testino and Peggy Sirota, and the magazines German Elle and French Vogue. In fact, 70 percent of Frenchway's clients are from the fashion industry.
"If I've got a girl going from New York to London to Paris to Miami and back to New York, and a day to pull it together, they can get it -- for a great price," said May Au, an agent and booker with Women Model Management, which represents Ms. Moss. "I don't know how, but they do."
Ms. Tavor chalks it up to pit bull-like persistence, honed by years of dealing with modeling agencies and countless crises, not to mention constant cancellations. "When someone cancels, we don't get upset," she said. "It's models -- you can't do anything about it."
But she and Ms. Choukroun have learned that when it comes to models, there are some things they can do. One is to make sure that the models are not booked on the last flight of the day. If they miss an early flight, "there is always another one," Ms. Tavor said. "Very important." She said she has found that booking models onto seemingly more fashionable European carriers, like Air France or British Airways, is a good carrot to get the models on the plane.
Another precaution is to make sure that the agency knows which models fly in economy (those just starting out), business (those on their way up) and first class (those recognizable by first name alone).
"There are girls who won't do a shooting if they have to fly economy," Ms. Tavor said, declining to match names with classes.
The socialite and designer Diane Von Furstenberg has even had a dress flown by Frenchway. Last year, she called Frenchway from Paris, desperate to get a dress to her overnight from New York, recalled Ms. Tavor, who was able to find a model in transit to entrust with the precious cargo.
For some, the agency's allure is not just Teutonic efficiency but its Gallic laissez-faire. "They call you darling, you can hear them smoking on the phone," said Kristen Vallow, an art director for the photographer David LaChapelle. "It's like you're already in France."
Ms. Vallow said she recently called the agency to get a last-minute ticket to Rio de Janeiro for New Year to meet her prospective in-laws. "They just said, 'Darling, I love it!' " she said. "It actually changed the way I thought about my trip. It seemed fabulous and madcap to be going to Rio, instead of going to Brazil to meet my fiance's parents for the first time."
Like any travel agency, Frenchway can book a flight for anyone who calls. But it may not be totally at your service: if one wants to book a flight to some humdrum locale far in advance, for example, the agency would just as soon see the business go elsewhere.
"For me, personally, if it's not an emergency, I'm not interested," Ms. Tavor said. "I need the challenge. If you call me for a ticket in two months, it will only irritate me."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Cold Water For the Hot-Fund Strategy

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
HOT funds, it seems, can burn investors.
Two prominent editors of mutual fund newsletters have stumbled into problems recently by trying to use a strategy that relies on picking so-called "hot hands," or fund managers who have done extremely well the previous year. 
 The idea behind the strategy is that a top-performing fund in one year will continue to outperform rivals because it is already aligned with the market's current favorite stocks. As of late, however, that has just not happened.
"I've come a cropper recently -- it doesn't work all the time," said one of the editors, Sheldon Jacobs of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter, published in Irvington, N.Y.
And Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, based in Potomac, Md., avoided a bad pick last year only by sidestepping the fund his system chose.
Both men said their systems had produced above-average long-term returns. The No-Load Fund Investor made its first pick using the strategy in 1992, though Mr. Jacobs said he tested how the approach would have worked back to 1975. Over the last 22 years, he said, his picks, theoretical and actual, have advanced an average of 23.0 percent annually, compared with 15.2 percent for the average fund.
Mr. Wiener has made his picks since he began the newsletter seven years ago. He said that in that time they had delivered annualized returns of 18.2 percent, compared with 14.0 percent for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mirrors the Standard & Poor's 500 index of large-capitalization stocks.
The strategy hinges on the premise that market trends that benefit a particular fund don't necessarily stop come year-end. "If you think about it, there's no reason that because the year changes from December to January that a particular investment style or strategy suddenly goes out of favor," Mr. Wiener said.
But many investment professionals reject the notion that investors can produce above-average results simply by choosing last year's best performers. Burton Malkiel, professor of economics at Princeton University, said: "While there have been certain periods when you could isolate that kind of persistence, the persistence is not persistent. It completely falls apart during other periods, and the bottom line is that there is no way an investor can gain above-average performance simply by buying funds that have had recent good performance."
A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., had a briefer interpretation. "There are no hot hands -- just different lengths of market phases," Mr. Lipper said.
Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Wiener don't advocate betting the rent money on the strategy; both advise investors to put only a small part of their stock market allocation into hot-hands funds.
Their systems are similar: They limit their selections to diversified domestic equity funds, rejecting sector and international funds as too volatile. Then they choose the previous year's top performer from among their respective data bases. Mr. Jacobs follows 373 no-load funds fitting this description; Mr. Wiener limits himself to funds managed by the Vanguard Group. The funds are sold the following January and replaced with new winners.
The notion that market trends persist beyond the end of a year enjoys some academic support. In a recent article in The Journal of Finance, Mark Carhart, a University of Southern California economist, reported on research into common stocks that found a pattern of price increases persisting into a second year.
"I call it the one-year momentum effect, and it's robust in the United States and in most markets of the world," said Mr. Carhart, currently on leave to work at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. "What's happening is that there's some information about the company that has come out and it hasn't been fully discounted in the price of the stock, so it continues to drift upward abnormally for another year."
While the tactic seems simple, it has proved troublesome to implement. In 1996, Mr. Jacobs recommended Wasatch Mid Cap, which had spurted 58.8 percent, or almost twice the average increase for stock funds in his universe the previous year. The fund was heavily concentrated in technology stocks, however, and collapsed during a correction in the sector. It returned only 3.6 percent, versus 18.6 percent for the average equity no-load fund in his universe.
Worried that his purely mechanistic approach had failed, in 1997 Mr. Jacobs rejected his computer's choice, Warburg Pincus Small Cap Value fund, and instead chose the Robertson Stephens Partners fund, which had returned 43.3 percent the previous year. Partners was bearish, and so was Mr. Jacobs. The fund lagged behind the average by 4.5 percentage points last year. (The Warburg fund, as it happened, posted almost identical results.)
This year, Mr. Jacobs has recommended Safeco Growth No Load, which surged 50.0 percent last year. Two funds with better records, American Heritage and Oakmark Select, were rejected because they were "nondiversified," he said.
Mr. Wiener also tinkered with his system last year, though for a different reason. He said the best eligible Vanguard fund of 1996 had been the Windsor fund, which gained 26.4 percent. Windsor, however, is closed to new investors. So he urged his subscribers to hold onto Vanguard Windsor II, which they already owned because it had been the previous year's pick.
Fortunately for his readers, Windsor II trounced its sibling, returning 32.4 percent, versus 22.0 percent for Windsor. His recommendation this year is Vanguard Primecap, which spurted 36.8 percent last year.
Jumping into hot funds can cause investors to incur additional costs. For investors outside of tax-deferred accounts, successful positions will create capital gains that have not been held long enough to qualify for the lowest tax rate, now applicable only after 18 months.
Nevertheless, investors are drawn to hot funds. Consider this year's picks: Safeco said assets of its Growth No Load fund had swelled 40.2 percent, to $895.2 million, in the first six weeks of this year. Primecap's assets jumped 7.9 percent in January, to $8.84 billion.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Dodge Ram Quad Cab;
A Grand Slam in the Door Wars

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
TRUCKS are the big thing, and the biggest-selling trucks are large indeed. Americans bought nearly three million pickups last year, about two-thirds of them "full sized" -- an understatement given how hefty these haulers have become.
The extent of the pickup phenomenon cannot be fully appreciated in urban areas of the East Coast, where the trucks lined up at stoplights are likely to be graffiti-tagged delivery vans or squeaky-clean sport utilities. Away from the coasts, across the vast expanse where Paul Harvey is on the radio and chicken-fried steak is on the breakfast menu, the pickup seems well on its way to supplanting the family car. 
 On a couple of a long-haul trips across the Plains, I conducted an informal survey: On a stretch of Interstate 80 west of Des Moines, 7 of every 10 vehicles I met were pickups, most of them full-size. On Highway 75 north of Topeka, Kan., it was 6 out of 10.
Across the heartland, there are new faces behind truck windshields: small-business owners, lawyers, insurance agents, women who look suspiciously like soccer moms. Footloose guys in their 20's, who might once have aspired to Formula Firebirds, are buying sporty trucks as their first new cars.
These people feel at home in the dude-ranch cabins, where soft cowhides, power windows and CD players have replaced bare metal and barely padded seats. But the frosting on the pickup was the extended cab, a 1974 breakthrough from Ford that was copied throughout the industry. With extra space behind the front seat, there is room for two or three children -- adults, even, if they're good sports -- and a secure place for shopping bags, tool boxes or sales sample kits. And you can still pick up a sofa or a ton of concrete blocks on the way home. Extended cabs now account for 61 percent of full-size pickup sales, up from 17 percent in 1989.
But the early extra-cab pickups had a problem: using the extra space meant tilting forward a heavy truck seat, a particularly daunting exercise for children. For 1996, General Motors offered a solution, a small third door, and Ford followed suit when it redesigned its F-150 for 1997.
Chrysler skipped the three-door party to plan the next premiere, and for 1998 its beefy Dodge Ram -- the pickup that looks like a Peterbilt -- is available with four doors. This could be the start of something bigger. Just as four-door models took sport utility vehicles out of the woods and into the car pools, multiple doors are bound to broaden the appeal of pickups even further.
Dodge has this market to itself, but not for long. Having missed the shift to four-door mini-vans, Ford is determined not to make the same mistake in trucks, where it leads the market. By year-end, it will offer four doors for each of its light-truck lines -- on its big Super Duty models next month, on the compact Ranger in May, and on the full-size F-150 and F-250 pickups in the fall.
G.M. is behind, but it will eventually offer four doors on its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, due this summer.
Of course, pickups with four conventional doors, called crew cabs, have been around a while. These are heavy-duty work trucks with two full bench seats and, generally, few other amenities. The Ram Quad Cab is not like that: It can be had with all the frills, and its extra doors are junior-sized, hinged at the rear and latching into the full-size front doors. The front door must be open before the back door can be unlatched.
As in the two-door Club Cab, there is a full-width seat in the rear, with three seat belts, two shoulder belts and a bottom cushion that flips up for more storage space. The front seats have integrated safety belts that stay out of the way.
My test vehicle was a Ram 1500 Series with a six-and-a-half-foot bed, four-wheel drive, a 5.2-liter V8 and a five-speed manual transmission. The window sticker totaled $28,885, bolstered by $6,000 in options.
The rear doors proved useful, making it possible to load items on one side and retrieve them from the other -- although the pickup's width makes this harder than one might expect. And there was an annoying hitch: If the front seat is all the way back on its track, or slightly reclined, the backrest blocks the latch for the back door. The seat then has to be moved to reach the latch -- an awkward, two-hand operation -- which seems to defeat the purpose of adding a door to avoid having to move a seat.
Even with family-friendly access, the appearance of the big Dodge is intimidating, and therein lies much of its appeal. While no one paid attention to the previous Ram, the macho redesign of 1994 has not just tripled sales, it made this truck a conversation piece wherever guys with calloused hands lean against fenders and chew on toothpicks. Drive one past a construction site and it turns heads like a supermodel. That was especially the case with the bold, black test truck, which seemed about as big as the Death Star and at least that menacing.
Big pickups also appeal because of the seemingly infinite ways they can be personalized; you need the math skills of Will Hunting to total the configurations. For starters, there are 32 combinations of cabs (standard, Club Cab, Quad Cab), cargo beds (6.5 or 8 feet) and engines (3.9-liter V6, 5.2-liter V8, 5.9 liter V8, 5.9-liter turbo-diesel in-line 6, 8-liter V10). You can have the basic ST, the fancy Laramie SLT or the drab-as-Monday-morning Work Special.
There are four wheelbases (118.7, 134.7, 138.7 or 154.7 inches), four transmissions, two transfer cases, 23 tire and wheel combinations, three gas tanks, half a dozen axle ratios and a universe of possible trailer-towing capacities. You can order the Snow Plow Prep Group, the Sport Appearance Group or the Super Sport Truck Group. There's a Camper Special, a Trailer Tow Preparation Group and a Travel Convenience Group.
Like many vehicles, the extended Ram is bigger than most people need it to be. The appeal is undeniable in the wide-open spaces of, say, Montana, but is less logical in the precincts of, say, Mamaroneck. Although the test truck was relatively small -- the 2500 Series is really big, especially with the long bed -- it was a handful in New York.
A good thing: It is among the few vehicles that Manhattan cab drivers actually fear. A bad thing: Its width (80 inches) makes it difficult or impossible to navigate streets lined with double-parked delivery trucks. A funny thing: Its length (nearly 19 feet) makes parallel parking a spectator sport.
With no load, the suspension dances over potholes and hops over rough patches. On a trip to Connecticut, the Ram handled, well, like a big truck. The steering is light and feels in touch with the road, but high-speed cornering is obviously not the point.
The 5.2-liter V8 has more horsepower this year (230, up from 220). The engine's 300 foot-pounds of torque were evident at the low end but somewhat lacking at midrange. Even this relatively small engine will spin the rear tires easily if four-wheel drive is not engaged. The long-throw shifter felt much like those of farm trucks I drove in the 70's, and I missed third gear several times before I got a feel for it.
The Federal mileage rating for the test truck was 13 in town, 17 on the highway. An indicator light tells you when to upshift for the best economy.
Even with a four-wheel anti-lock system, a $500 option, the brakes had a pickup's usual tentative feel. G.M. promises much better brakes on its new models; if it delivers, and its rivals are forced to catch up, it will have performed a valuable service.
The cabin is cavernous, and a new instrument panel includes dual air bags, plus a key-operated switch to deactivate the passenger bag if a child seat is in use. The controls are oversized and convenient. Chrysler's cruise control buttons are still among the best around, situated on the steering wheel with an indicator light on the dash.
The front seats -- split in a 40-20-40 pattern with an armrest/bin in the middle -- were too hard and upright. The backrests recline, but the mechanism is clunky. And the headrests appear to be of little benefit to anyone much taller than 6 feet. There are two power outlets and two generous cup holders. One is ingenious, with a slide that adjusts the diameter to fit any cup.
The jumbo storage compartment under the center armrest is also inspired, with spaces for a laptop computer, a mobile phone, cassettes and small items. The lid is firm enough to serve as a desk, and at a width of 15 inches, is almost as big as one.
 
INSIDE TRACK: An open-and-shut case for the practical pickup.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Dodge's burly Ram gains new flexibility with four doors. Plush appointments are available from a long option list.
 
Graph: "The Bigger the Trucks, the Better the Sales"
While sales of small trucks have slipped in recent years, full-size pickups have soared in popularity. Since it was redesigned as a 1994 model, the Dodge Ram had become a contender among full-size trucks. Graph tracks sales of full-size and of compact pickups, from 1990 through 1997. It also tracks sales of the Ford F-Series, the Chevrolet C/K, the Dodge Ram, the GMC Sierra, and the Toyota T-100, over the same period.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Until Ed McMahon Calls, They Need to Slice Debt

SERIES: FRESH START: A periodic look at the crossroads of personal finance.

BYLINE: By PAUL SWEENEY

 BODY:
TWICE a month, Elizabeth Genel sits down at the dining table in her seaside condominium to face a small mountain of bills. Fortified with a Pop Tart and a Diet Coke, she makes short work of the stack, reducing it to nothing in 60 minutes flat. At the same time, unfortunately, she also levels the family checking account.
When the checks come in, "there's $4,000 or so in the bank," she said. But after the bill-paying sessions, "there's only $100." 
 The big bills are not only from the holidays or some special expenses. For Ms. Genel and her husband, Mark Nyman, a lawyer, much of the monthly outflow goes to large long-term debt. Indeed, the couple, who are both 31 and live in Milford, Conn., are more than $450,000 in the hole. If they had a theme song, it might come from the bumper sticker, "I owe, I owe, it's off to work I go."
"I wish that Ed McMahon would knock on the door with a check," Mr. Nyman said.
They clearly have high earnings potential. Both earned law degrees at the University of San Diego in 1994, and Mr. Nyman practices family law in Stamford, Conn., earning a salary in the high five figures.
Ms. Genel shunned the law and took a job in retail cosmetics, a field she knew. Simultaneously, she researched the possibility of operating her own cosmetics shop and makeup salon. Her husband, who is also a certified public accountant with experience at Price Waterhouse, wrote a business plan that won them a bank's backing.
In October, Ms. Genel's dream became a reality when the couple opened up JD's Cosmetic Essentials on the Post Road in Westport, Conn. The shop -- named for her unused law degree -- sells fragrances, soaps and toiletries that are unavailable elsewhere in Connecticut, she said, and hard to find even in New York and Boston. Although Ms. Genel is not yet drawing a salary, the store is paying its bills, she added, including the salaries of two part-time employees.
But the couple's big debts seem to overshadow their professional progress. Their largest liability, with an 8 percent average annual rate of interest, is $172,000 in combined education loans. Ms. Genel jokes that the only benefit she can show from law school is her marriage to Mr. Nyman. "It was an expensive dating service," she said.
Then come the store debts: a $100,000 bank loan, at 10 percent interest and secured in part by the couple's home, and $30,000 borrowed interest-free from their families. Since Ms. Genel left her former job and started the boutique, the couple have also run up their Visa and Mastercard balances, which had already ballooned during their school years. The balances now stand at more than $25,000, at an average interest rate of 14.5 percent. Finally, the condominium carries a $135,000 mortgage, with a variable rate that is now 8 percent.
The grand total: $462,000 in personal and business debt.
Nor does the couple have much in savings. Mr. Nyman's 401(k) account at work has $13,000, 75 percent of it invested in the Fidelity Stock Selector fund, which is a quantitative fund, and 25 percent in Fidelity Emerging Growth.
The couple worry that they may never escape from debt -- or be able to retire. Ms. Genel wonders if they will even be able to afford the two children they both want. And there are plenty of small reasons, too, to wrestle down the debt.
"I want to buy a package of Milano cookies without feeling guilty," Ms. Genel said.
Indeed, the couple have little leeway for luxuries. Each month, they pay $237 on their car -- nothing fancy, a Nissan Altima -- and about $380 on their health, life, car and home insurance. Add in food, phone, utilities and gasoline, and there is little left for fun: Entertainment usually means watching TV at home. To splurge, they eat out a couple of times a month, but one-time expenses, like the $600 for Ms. Genel's root canal last year, can endanger even that luxury.
One of their few extras is Ms. Genel's health club membership, at $400 a year.
How to rein in their debt? The New York Times asked Karen Altfest, vice president at L. J. Altfest Company, a financial planning firm in Manhattan, to make some recommendations.
On paper, Ms. Altfest said, the couple's situation looked very troubling, among the most extreme cases of indebtedness that she could recall.
She was initially dubious about Ms. Genel's business venture, too. By opening a cosmetics shop, Ms. Altfest said, the couple had not only undertaken an uncertain enterprise and saddled themselves with added debt, but they had also lost Ms. Genel's regular paycheck.
Upon meeting Ms. Genel, however, Ms. Altfest was impressed with her confidence and ambition. "Whatever you've got, I'm buying," Ms. Altfest said. But while Ms. Genel's qualities may enhance her chances, Ms. Altfest advised strict limits on the venture: If the store is not paying Ms. Genel $50,000 to $60,000 in salary within three years, it should be shuttered and she should find a regular job.
The planner also gave her imprimatur to the couple's notion of selling the condominium. Although they would no longer be building home equity, the move to an apartment would save $400 a month on the $1,400 they now pay for mortgage and condo fees.
Losing the tax deduction for mortgage interest will not be too costly for now, Ms. Altfest said, because the start-up costs for the shop will minimize their income taxes.
After selling the condo for about $200,000 and paying off the mortgage, the couple should use the remaining $65,000 to pay off their credit-card debt, which carries the highest interest rate. Then, Ms. Altfest recommended, they should either tear up the plastic or put it in the back of a drawer.
The couple might use the rest of the condo profits to reduce their business loan, an idea to which Ms. Altfest did not object.
But Ms. Altfest said that, as the couple's income grew, they must maintain a tight rein on spending. "Pretend that you're earning the same income," Ms. Altfest said. "You should do that until you've made a big impact on the debt."
As for children and retirement, Ms. Altfest thought that both were possible -- but only if the couple saved regularly while retiring debt. "It's hard to save for the future when you don't have the past cleaned up yet," the planner noted, but parenthood and retirement are costly.
Financial advisers offer many tips for helping the savings habit take root. For example, they say, make your savings a monthly "bill," just like the rent. Put the savings where it would be costly to raid, like a retirement account or certificate of deposit that has an early-withdrawal penalty. Or designate particular income -- say, Ms. Genel's salary, or Mr. Nyman's every fourth paycheck -- for savings.
Mr. Nyman strongly agrees with the need to save. "It blows my mind to see clients who make a lot of money but don't have any assets," he said.
Even with a rigorous financial regimen, however, the couple will need 10 to 15 years just to pay off their student loans and, more generally, may have to work into their 70's to realize the other goals, Ms. Altfest said.
But Ms. Genel was upbeat. "I never thought we could do it," she said. "These numbers are so huge. It's nice to hear from a professional that there is hope."
Ms. Altfest had other advice for the couple, including the need to write wills. Ms. Genel took this counsel seriously, but she could not resist teasing her husband.
"Here, honey, you can have all my debt," she said.

The Re-education of Philip Reed

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
ONE day last month, determined to buy locally in his new neighborhood, Philip Reed, a fresh member of the City Council, walked across East 116th Street from his office and ordered a sandwich at the back of a narrow little deli. The man behind the counter said he could make no sandwiches because there had been no bread delivery that day.
Never shy with advice, Mr. Reed explained how easy and profitable it would be to cross the street to the local supermarket and buy a few loaves. Writ small, it was exactly the kind of economic connections he wants to help make in the Eighth District, which includes chunks of East Harlem, the Upper West Side and the South Bronx. 
 A few days later, when Mr. Reed returned, the man again told him there had been no bread delivery, thus no sandwiches. Mr. Reed, not uncharacteristically, began shouting, "You are either on drugs or selling drugs because you are an idiot."
He stormed out. If the man was on drugs, Mr. Reed thought, he would have to find social service agencies to get him clean. If he was selling drugs, he would have to get the police to drive him out of business.
"Is that the first thing you need to do here?" I asked.
"First thing, I need a carpet on
this floor," he said, "so when I make calls I don't sound like I'm shouting in an echo chamber."
We were sitting at a table in his large, bright, spare office, eating fried fish from up the block. The carpet -- like the sandwich story -- is both a reality and a metaphor. Mr. Reed, who turned 49 yesterday, has spent most of his political life as advocate and agitator on discrimination, housing, H.I.V. issues. Suddenly, his words have more "weight and consequence." He is learning procedure, organization and diplomacy all at once. He can change people's lives.
"I can't pop off as much, I have to think through the issues," he said. "I'm having a ball. People actually ask me what I think. I've gotten a new lease on life, a renewal. It's a cliche, but the Lord works in mysterious ways. She has a plan for me."
On January 20, 1997, the day of President Clinton's second inauguration, Mr. Reed ended 18 months of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer so ferocious it was just as easy to allow people to believe he had AIDS. (He was diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive in 1981.) He decided to replay his dream of elective office -- he had been defeated in races for the State Senate and the City Council -- and he called his campaign "Dead Man Running."
Despite nasty racial politics -- he was smeared as an anti-Latino candidate -- he won overwhelmingly.
"Trounced was the word your paper used," he said. "TROUNCED." His face twisted, his voice dropped. "And now you can hear the people saying, 'He may be queer but he opened his only office in East Harlem. Not on the West Side, but here with us!' "
Mr. Reed, quick-silver smart, funny, cocky, emotional, profane, is very West Side. Born of an interracial romance and marriage that fell apart around their birth, he and his twin sister were raised by their mother and stepfather, both white, in an upper-middle-class Manhattan world of civil rights activism, prep schools, the Vineyard. Mr. Reed dropped out of Ohio Wesleyan and received conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He spent 10 years in San Francisco, as a salesman for Otis Elevator and a radical gay political activist. He returned to New York 20 years ago, coming into politics here through a neighborhood block association. He left Otis to run a service program in Brooklyn for people with H.I.V.
Last year, he was receiving $1,300 a month in disability payments, slowly coming back to life after the chemo treatments. He had nothing to lose. He was ready to run again.
"Most of my friends are dead," he said. Tears came as quickly as had the laughter. "There are big holes in me. My life has knocked a certain amount of the arrogance out of me. I've been unemployed and disabled, and I did nothing wrong. I've had to shop for the cheaper can of food. Okay, how do we move beyond that? As an individual, as a community?
"How do we get gentrification to come north of 96th Street, and monitor who gets something out of it? How do we make that Hispanic cultural strip on East 106th Street into a tourist destination? How do we make sure that people on welfare who get jobs don't lose health insurance? How do we stop politicians from driving a wedge between Hispanics and African-Americans?"
He stopped, and twisted into his comic's posture. "You come back in six months. I might have answers. I will surely have a carpet on the floor."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Drug Abuse Problems Are on the Rise as the Labor Pool Shrinks

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX

 BODY:
ILLEGAL drugs are a big problem for Garry M. Ritzky: too many of his job applicants use them. Mr. Ritzky, risk and human resources director for Turner Brothers Trucking Inc., a transportation and oil services company in Oklahoma City, is having a hard time finding candidates who are clean of cocaine, marijuana and heroin.
"We have an oil pipe operation that uses unskilled laborers, and we're seeing more positive drug tests," he said. "We had three last week." The number of positive drug tests among applicants for low-skilled jobs at Turner Brothers has doubled in the last year, Mr. Ritzky added. 
 Such evidence, while mostly anecdotal, runs counter to the decline in positive drug tests that most businesses have seen the last decade. Yet with the unemployment rate at a 25-year low and the economy continuing to grow, more human resource managers say they are starting to see a small but disturbing increase in the number of job applicants who fail screening for drug and alcohol abuse.
One reason for that increase, they say, is that as the supply of potential employees continues to shrink, those with drug and alcohol problems probably represent a larger portion of the labor pool. Some also say a number of products now available to beat drug tests are encouraging some job applicants to take chances. And marijuana, they say, is again in vogue.
According to a study released late last year by the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 16 percent of unemployed people used illicit drugs in 1994. When the data were collected, unemployment was at 6.1 percent. Today, with unemployment at 4.7 percent, qualified job seekers are harder to find.
"Employers are finding it harder to find people who are not using drugs," said James G. Lipari, public health adviser for the Federal Government's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. "Since there are more employers using testing and other prevention means, there are more people who are unemployed for that reason, which makes the pool of unemployed who are using drugs great."
But these apparent trends are not yet reflected in the data. When drug testing first became widespread, in the late 1980's, about 18 percent of the tests showed signs of drug use, according to SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories, one of the nation's largest drug-testing labs. That number, which represents mostly screening of applicants and a small amount of tests for workers already on the job, fell steadily, to 8.8 percent in 1991, and then began to decline more slowly. In 1996, about 5.8 percent of the tests showed signs of drugs.
"Over the past 10 years, we've seen a dramatic decrease in positive tests," said Thomas Johnson, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham. The lab is expected to release the results for 1997 in the next few weeks.
"Early indications are that they will continue to decline," Mr. Johnson said.
One drug that is coming back, however, is marijuana. Of the people who failed the SmithKline drug test in 1996, almost 60 percent had traces of marijuana in their urine. That is up from 52 percent from 1995.
Marijuana use was in the spotlight two weeks ago when the Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati had his Olympic gold medal withdrawn after he failed a drug test. Mr. Rebagliati said he had not smoked marijuana since April 1997 and that any residue in his urine was from second-hand smoke. With somewhat less-than-clear Olympic rules on the penalty for marijuana use, he was later allowed to keep the medal.
The accuracy of drug tests has been questioned by groups including the Society for Human Resource Management, based in Alexandria, Va. It says data provided by companies like SmithKline Beecham, while accurately reflecting a downward trend, must be taken with a grain of salt. "Some people have since learned to beat the system," said Barry K. Lawrence, a spokesman for the society.
Several companies advertise on the Internet, for example, selling products to cover up traces of drugs in urine or hair. One company, Test Clean Drug Testing Solutions in Oklahoma City, boasts that its product, Klear, which can be bought for as little as $30, "is the smallest most potent, undetectable urine purifier sold today."
Mr. Johnson of SmithKline acknowledged, "It's like a cat-and-mouse game." But, he said, laboratories are catching on and are starting to test for those adulterants as well.
Most experts agree that drug testing has cut drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace, but its greatest impact is on casual users.
"It eliminated use among individuals who could stop, who had more at stake and didn't want to lose that," said Ellen Weber, director of national policy for the Legal Action Center, a nonprofit group based in New York that is involved in drug, alcohol and H.I.V. employment issues. "Drug testing, in my mind, was never an effective tool for people who are dependent on drugs."

Some findings from a recent survey of 250 employers about drug abuse in the workplace. Following are the percentage that said:
 
Drug and alcohol addiction are significant or very significant problems in their industries. 52%
 
Drug and alcohol addiction are significant problems for their companies. 33%
 
They would immediately dismiss employees who displayed alcohol- or drug-related behavior on the job. 30%
 
Treatment for alcohol and drug abuse is an effective method for returning employees to productivity. 79%
 
The greatest impact of drug and alcohol abuse on their organizations is lost days and/or diminished productivity. 50%
 
Their heath plans cover chemical dependency treatment. 82%
 
They offer employee assistance programs to help deal with addiction in the workplace. 80%

HEADLINE: The World: Present Tense;
Oh, To Be Young, Charismatic and Centrist in Germany

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
IF there is one message that has been drummed home to Germans, as much by foreigners as by their own postwar leaders, it is that the past must never be suppressed. But are Germans -- or, at least, their politicians -- suppressing the present?
Even at the most obvious level, this land of 82 million people confronts enough deep-rooted problems to support the view that it stands, slightly bewildered, at a crossroads. Choosing which road to take is not so clear-cut. 
 Unemployment is nudging towards the five million total associated with the joblessness that helped loft Hitler to power in 1933. (Even the wording on some jobless protesters' banners is uncannily reminiscent of similar placards in the early 1930's.) Indeed, joblessness -- particularly among young people in the depressed former East Germany -- is a driving force behind an alarming wave of neo-Nazism.
The euro, Europe's soon-to-come single currency, is set to replace the German mark, the emblem of postwar prosperity, stability and economic power. And, perhaps most fundamentally, Germany is caught between the opposing strains of the American-style marketplace and the older reflexes of the welfare state.
So what have Germany's leaders pulled out of their hats to confront these deep-seated problems?
The answer is: precious little. And when Germans scan the horizon for a Teutonic Bill Clinton, say, or a German Tony Blair to invigorate a moribund political establishment, they find little inspiration.
 
Paralysis
An effort last year to spur entrepreneurial initiative by overhauling the tax system foundered in a political deadlock in Bonn. When 155 economics professors, echoing widespread misgivings among Germans, called this month for the postponement of the euro's introduction beyond the scheduled starting date 11 months from now, Chancellor Helmut Kohl stifled all further public debate by saying the new currency would proceed, on schedule, as per contractual obligations with the rest of Europe. End of discussion: not once have Germans -- or most other Europeans -- been told by their leaders what the euro will mean for salaries and benefits, pensions or mortgages or purchasing power.
Successive attempts to remodel Germany's expensive state pension and health care systems, moreover, have been diluted in political compromise, as is typical in a land that prizes consensus and fears confrontation that might awaken the ghosts of the past. Indeed, the political system devised for West Germany by the Western allies after World War II provides for so many checks and balances that political paralysis is nearly inevitable.
The result for employers is that the cost of hiring has become too high: just to insure that an employee has net pay of $2,000 per month, employers must pay more than twice that amount in gross salary to cover mandatory withholdings for state pensions, taxes, health care and social security. Some economists estimate that four out of five of Germany's 4.8 million unemployed are without jobs because of these costs.
Big business in Germany has already drawn its own conclusions, exporting manufacturing jobs to countries with cheaper labor, creating the paradox of solid economic growth that does not shorten unemployment lines.
For decades, of course, Germany has been regarded as an economic model, the land that gave its people the longest vacations, highest pay, shortest work week, earliest retirement, highest pensions and deepest social security net. So it is not surprising that the Darwinian ethic underlying economic growth in the United States -- not to mention the legacy of Thatcherite Britain -- should collide with German insistence that more than just the fittest should survive: the weak need their pensions and health care and unemployment benefits, too.
The government paralysis stems from various factors. National elections next September have already transfixed politicians as they jostle for position rather than tackle issues or contemplate risks. Chancellor Kohl and his coalition have been in office since 1982, so the twin genies of fatigue and arrogance that beset Britain's Tories in the late 80's and early 90's and marked the tired final days of the Bush Administration have become increasingly visible in recent years.
With the fanfare of reunification reduced to a long, expensive, bumpy diminuendo, the nation's political life seems to be on hold, awaiting the planned move of the government to Berlin next year, the coming of the euro, the advent of the millennium, the elections.
The only problem is that the rest of the world is moving on. Where the United States and Britain have performed the same conjuring act -- ousting longtime conservative governments with a combination of youthful, charismatic leadership and the embrace of centrist policies that replace ideology with pragmatism -- Mr. Kohl, Europe's longest-serving leader and most powerful conservative figure, is unchanging and unchanged.
"His whole political thinking has been rooted in history," said Patricia Clough, the British author of a newly published study in German of Mr. Kohl. "His two missions have been the reunification of Germany and to unite Europe so that there can never be war again. And he's never really grasped that the world is changing on other fronts, like globalization."
 
Fear of Change
Yet Mr. Kohl, whose principle currency is his own immutability, may still be in power after the September vote: not only is there no German Clinton or Blair on the horizon, but it is far from certain that German voters would risk embracing one at precisely the moment they sense so many other uncertainties.
"The loss of the German mark will be so traumatic for many Germans that they will not want to risk anything else," Ms. Clough said. So while Mr. Kohl may be postponing hard choices for a successor well down the road, she said, part of his strategy now is "to reassure Germans that they will be safe, that nothing will change."
Neither is it clear who will challenge that strategy. The single most popular politician in the country, according to opinion surveys, is Gerhard Schroder, the state premier of Lower Saxony. But he has yet to win the endorsement of the opposition Social Democrats as a candidate for Chancellor, and only last month he established strictly non-Darwinian economic credentials by nationalizing a steel mill to preserve jobs before key state elections on March 1.
For some, though, there is a different, less tangible malaise. The Thatcherite Britain of the 80's brought real pain to entire sectors of the population as much as it revolutionized the economy. America's middle-class in the early 90's endured the trauma of downsizing as the price for low employment and world-beating growth.
As if anesthetized by decades of well-being, by contrast, many Germans sense change is inevitable, but by and large they have not felt that kind of radical pain. Indeed, many would ask: Why should we? In a land whose voters have grown accustomed to comfort and security, that is a question the politicians would prefer to postpone for another day.

HEADLINE: Going in Style: The Loved One Gets a New Age Send-off

BYLINE: By JEFF STRYKER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
A Taurus rocket launched earlier this month from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, Calif., carried a standard payload of three communications satellites. But also along for the ride were the cremated remains of 30 individuals who had paid $4,800 each to become one with the universe.
They were packed by Celestis, a Houston-based commercial venture, in a canister with lipstick-sized vials containing about seven grams each of human remains. The launch drew attention to the increasingly creative possibilities for disposing of cremated remains -- or "cremains" as they are known in industry -- and to the growing popularity of cremation itself. 
 Today, about one in five Americans is cremated; the number is expected to grow to one in three by 2010, according to Jack Springer, executive director of the Cremation Society of North America. In California, the departed are cremated at nearly twice the national rate. And cremation is even more popular in Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada and Washington, where more than half of those who died in 1995 were cremated. The preference for cremation is clearly regional: the rate in Alabama and Mississippi was only 4 percent.
A survey conducted for the Funeral and Memorial Information Council in 1995 showed that the most common reasons for choosing cremation are convenience, simplicity and economy.
Thomas Lynch, a Michigan funeral director and poet, offered another explanation in his book, "The Undertaking: Life Studies From the Dismal Trade" (W. W. Norton & Company, 1997). Cremation, he wrote, "renders our dead somehow more portable, less 'stuck in their ways,' more like us -- you know, scattered."
The human body yields about 5 to 12 pounds of ashes, coarsechunks of brownish-gray bone fragments, which are sometimes used for a kind of reincarnation. Mark Gruenwald, the Marvel comic book editor who died of a heart attack in 1996 left orders that some of his ashes be mixed into ink used to print "Squadron Supreme" (Marvel Books, 1997), a book-length compilation of 12 original issues of the utopian comic series he had created a decade earlier.
Among those who do not want to sit out eternity in a fancy urn is Pat Schroeder, the former Democratic Representative from Colorado. "I always wanted to be cremated and made into a doorstop because, basically, what I want to do is hold doors open for people," she said last month in an interview on National Public Radio.
 
Wide-eyed Students
Gerald Larue, who teaches a course on death and dying at the University of Southern California, likes to confront his students with the reality of death with an assist from Herman Harvey, a departed U.S.C. psychology professor whose cremains he inherited. Professor Larue circulates a portion of his late friend's cremains ("about a quarter cup in a little jar") to his wide-eyed students. "He is still teaching," Professor Larue says.
With the funeral industry slow to acknowledge cremation's burgeoning popularity, independent entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity, offering a wide range of cremation accessories. On the World Wide Web, the "Online Urn Mall" has a company selling cremation jewelry -- gold and silver pendants with space to store a small amount of ashes. Another company offers "personality urns," 400 varieties of theme urns for loved ones with a particular interest, like golf, hunting, or religion.
But the most grandiose use of ashes belongs to Celestis. This month's shipment was its second.
The first, last April, included the remains of counterculture icon Timothy Leary, "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry, and 22 other men. The second launch had the ashes of 24 men and 6 women, including a married couple, Anthony F. Santore and Catherine Telesco-Santore of Brooklyn, commingled in a vial inscribed "Together Forever."
Perhaps the most heartbreaking traveler is Danny van der Hoek, a 15-year-old Dutch "Star Trek" fan who committed suicide last Sept. His family solicited money through an Internet site to fulfill his wishes to end "in a final blaze of glory just like Gene Roddenberry did."
Celestis plans more launches, having recently signed up with a partner in Japan, where cremation rates approach 99 percent and "Star Trek"-mania is rampant.
Meanwhile, for a display of pyrotechnics closer to earth, Pacific Memorial of Los Angeles will incorporate cremains into a fireworks display.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
War in The Gulf? Peace in The Pits

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
War is . . . swell. That was the stock market's rather unseemly message when the United States bombed Iraq seven years ago. The Dow Jones industrial average shot up more than 100 points the day the bombardment began, and in the following month it soared 17 percent. Indeed, the current leg of the bull market began when Desert Storm did, in January 1991.
And a war dividend seems unlikely this time around. Back in 1990, investors were worried about the coming hostilities, and stocks slid sharply in autumn, ending the year down 12.5 percent from their July highs. Oil prices soared, as did fears of inflation. And many citizens, haunted by memories of Vietnam, ached at the thought of Americans coming home in body bags. 
 When Desert Storm finally swept Iraq, patriotic fervor swept the states, and the stock market quickly recovered all it had given up before the bombing began.
Such anxiety is absent this time. Investors continue pouring money into mutual funds and borrowing money to buy stocks. And stocks have continued to soar: the Dow, which closed at another record high on Wednesday, ended the week up almost 44 points.
This may be yet another sign of the irrational exuberance that has professional worrywarts wringing their hands. And there is a danger, if the market has truly discounted the effects of war, that any disappointing development will send stocks into a swoon. In the short term, securities markets move based on expectations about the future. If those expectations are met, investors shrug; if not, they can panic.
Investors may be behaving quite rationally indeed.
The price of oil is not a worry. Traders, faced with a glut of the stuff and falling demand from Asia, wouldn't mind if some barrels went up in sooty smoke. Oil futures are at their lowest since the spring of 1994.
The bombing may, of course, be averted. President Clinton, though looking increasingly boxed in, may be more willing to find a face-saving compromise after last week's failed pep rally in Ohio. The White House, after all, is not famous for taking unpopular stands, and it may be swayed by public criticism of its policies and cynicism about its motives.
If not, well, Saddam and his toxic bugs are plenty scary, but compared with his military might in 1990, "he's a nothingburger," says Charles A. Gabriel Jr., a political analyst for Prudential Securities.
As for the other "major" problems on the country's horizon, they, too, seem less serious than people feared just a few weeks ago. The stock market is probably far too optimistic about the fallout from troubled Asian economies, but the clouds come with a silver lining -- the Federal Reserve has stopped threatening to raise interest rates. And l'affaire Lewinsky is low-rent Watergate -- more spicy but less filling than the Nixonian original.
The economy, meanwhile, is just right -- and somehow keeps getting better. Jobs are plentiful, interest rates low, inflation only a memory. And more people than ever are sharing in the stock market's bounty.
Of course, eventually, something will go wrong. Corporate profits will plunge, the trade deficit will soar, Tokyo will topple or, most likely, something utterly unforeseen will stop the parade.
But no one knows when. So even in the shadow of war, American investors cannot be faulted for counting their mutual fund balances -- and their blessings.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Retirement Foresight From the Younger Set

BYLINE: By INGRID EISENSTADTER

 BODY:
JUSTIN BIER is about to make the third annual contribution to his I.R.A. He has kept the money in Treasuries so far, but now that he has a tidy sum accumulated, he is scouting out equity investments.
But unlike most owners of individual retirement accounts, Justin is not a grown-up. He is 16 years old -- today is his birthday -- and his I.R.A. contributions come from the money he earns doing filing and computer work for about two hours a day at the office of his father, Robert Bier, a podiatrist in Edison, N.J. 
 Dr. Bier's accountant suggested the I.R.A. when Justin started working for his father -- you need earned income to have an I.R.A. -- and the boy is now enthusiastic about it.
"I know I have a secure future," said Justin, who earned $5,900 last year from his office job and the tennis lessons he gives on weekends.
He should feel secure. Starting an I.R.A. as a child can mean a huge kitty at retirement. These early-bird accounts may become even more attractive given recent tax-law changes, like the creation of the Roth I.R.A. and the loosening of rules for using I.R.A.'s to pay for education.
The accumulations in these accounts can greatly exceed even those of the most assiduous of grown-up investors. Consider an enterprising 25-year-old who faithfully salts away $2,000 a year and earns an 8 percent annual return until he retires. At age 65, that person will have amassed $608,000. But if he started at age 10, he would have $1.98 million -- more than three times as much.
Indeed, a 10-year-old who makes just one $2,000 deposit at 8 percent will see the account grow to $138,000 by age 65. The compounding benefits of a 55-year investment horizon are so great, in fact, that putting small sums, even $50 or $100, into such an I.R.A. is worth it. (The law sets no rules on minimum deposits, although mutual funds or brokerages may.)
Because there is no age requirement for I.R.A.'s, many children who have earnings can play the game: a 4-year-old who earns money from a television commercial, a 12-year-old with baby-sitting or paper-route income, a teen-ager who flips burgers or a boy like Justin who works in a parent's business.
"Tax court has allowed parents to pay wages to children as young as 7," said Henry Fellman, author of "Keep Your Hard-Earned Money" (Simon & Schuster, 1998). The only requirements are that parents "pay a reasonable salary for work actually performed" and "treat employed children as any other employee, such as by using time cards," he said.
If an I.R.A. is set up for a child, a parent or other adult must serve as custodian, making investment decisions and otherwise controlling the account until the child comes of age.
No one knows the exact number of these minors' I.R.A.'s because the Internal Revenue Service does not track the age of owners. Nonetheless, such youngsters are clearly a rarity.
"Out of our 1.9 million I.R.A.'s, only about 10,000 are custodial I.R.A.'s," said Wendell Collins, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch. And those custodial accounts include not only those of minors but also those of elderly investors who need assistance in managing their affairs.
Setting up a child's I.R.A. is often not easy. Many institutions accept the accounts only if they are established under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act.
"I called 8 or 10 mutual fund companies, but couldn't find one that would accept my son's I.R.A.," Dr. Bier said. Justin's account is now at a local bank.
There are institutions, like Vanguard, Charles Schwab and Quick & Reilly, that do accept minors' I.R.A.'s. "Inquiries about children's I.R.A.'s come with increasing frequency," Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman, said.
But sometimes there are restrictions. "We open these accounts only for existing customers," said Charles Salmans, a spokesman for Quick & Reilly, adding that the firm also requires proof of the child's income and of the custodian's identity.
The Taxpayer Relief Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, may make minors' accounts more popular.
The Roth I.R.A. is one big reason. Money is deposited in these accounts on an after-tax basis, but the earnings are never taxed. In a traditional I.R.A., by contrast, contributions and earnings are both taxed upon withdrawal. Deciding which type a person should have depends on many factors, but the Roth version has a clear draw for children's I.R.A.'s: its forever-tax-free earnings can make the accounts' very long time horizons extremely lucrative.
Under certain conditions, the new tax law also permits penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s to pay for higher education. In this respect, as in some others, children's I.R.A.'s are treated no differently than their parents'. And given that the growth in education costs continues to outstrip inflation, such tax-advantaged accounts may become a major source of school financing.
Investors should be aware that the new rules on education withdrawals hide one potential disadvantage: They could lead to diminished financial aid.
True, the Federal Government does not include I.R.A. savings in calculating aid under its education programs, like Pell grants. Nor do most private schools factor in I.R.A. assets, according to Kathleen Payea, manager of need analysis requirements for the College Board, which provides schools with financial aid guidelines.
And some administrators say the new tax law is unlikely to prompt them to change this policy.
"It would be myopic for us to look at this as an opportunity, because in the long term we'd lose," said Don Saleh, dean of admissions and financial aid at Cornell University. If I.R.A.'s were factored into financial-aid rules, Mr. Saleh said, the school would suffer the loss of many middle-class students.
Nevertheless, some schools do at least ask the families of applicants for I.R.A. information, Ms. Payea said. And the College Board has already begun polling schools about how to handle the new education-withdrawal rules.
If schools do factor I.R.A.'s into their aid formulas, children's I.R.A.'s may be particularly hard-hit. Currently, schools expect students to contribute 35 percent of their assets to their yearly educational costs, while for parents the annual expected contribution is 5 percent of assets.
But even if school policies change, said David Charlow, an official at Columbia University, they would probably exempt I.R.A. accumulations below a certain sum.
And beyond the advantage conferred by their long time horizons, early-bird accounts can be a good teaching opportunity. That can be important when the child grows up and assumes control of the account.
Dr. Bier recently bought Justin two books on investing, and has arranged for the boy to spend a day looking around on Wall Street. Using the Internet, Justin has already started following stocks that interest him.
"I want my child to understand about working hard and saving," Dr. Bier said. "In my practice, I see lots of senior citizens, and many are having a hard time getting by."

Financial planners push clients to start an I.R.A. early -- say, in their mid-20's -- in order to have a large sum at retirement. But it they start even earlier, the pot will be far bigger.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Robert E. Torray;
Torray Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
THOUGH hardly given to spontaneous outbursts of merriment, Robert E. Torray, the portfolio manager of the Torray fund, could not help but crib a quote from Groucho Marx to close his latest shareholder letter: "Are you going to believe what I tell you, or are you going to believe your own eyes?"
Not a bad line, given that investors may have trouble believing some of the fund's sizzling returns. Over the 12 months ended Feb. 13, Torray returned 34.7 percent, compared with 28.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and 24.8 percent for the average fund in the large blend category -- a label for funds that hold big capitalization stocks but are not particularly growth- or value-oriented in their investing style, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund-tracking firm in Chicago. For the three-year period, the Torray fund returned 38.9 percent a year, on average, compared with 31.3 percent for the S.& P. and 26.8 percent for its peer group. 
 Investors who ask Mr. Torray how he generates such returns are likely to get treated to a long monologue from the manager, a tendency he readily acknowledges. "I get people on an airplane, and they are begging for a parachute," he said.
Part of the trick, Mr. Torray said, is the fund's concentrated portfolio: 20 stocks represent more than 70 percent of the fund's assets.
Mr. Torray, 60, who runs the fund out of Bethesda, Md., also thinks long term. After he finds a good company, he is willing to hold on to it -- virtually indefinitely. The fund's 1997 turnover was a skimpy 11.7 percent, compared with 84 percent for the average domestic diversified stock fund, according to Morningstar.
Two key considerations for Mr. Torray in evaluating a company are its management and its market position in its industry. These days, the fund holds mostly large-capitalization stocks because that is where Mr. Torray is finding the best values.
Most important, he says, is his philosophy that value derives from a company's underlying business, not from a stock's valuation characteristics. So he focuses on fundamentals..
For example, while many money managers use a company's price-to-earnings ratio as a benchmark for trading, Mr. Torray pays it scant attention.
"Some cable companies have no earnings, so their P/E is infinity," he said. "Other companies have recurring charges that reduce earnings and increase the P/E."
One of Mr. Torray's tactics is to buy shares others are dumping. "Usually, we buy into a falling stock price," he said. When he pounces, a company's stock price typically has fallen 25 percent to 50 percent over the preceding six months to one year.
Yet Mr. Torray is not put off by stocks that others call expensive. "We'll pay more for a first-rate business," he said, adding that top-notch companies "seldom sell for bargains."
Mr. Torray's "sell" discipline can be offbeat, too. While rivals will dump a stock at the first whiff of an earnings disappointment, Mr. Torray often sells only after a company fails to meet expectations over two to three years -- an eternity to many fund managers.
Furthermore, when a stock reaches his price target, Mr. Torray does not necessarily unload it. Because cash has flooded the fund -- it has swelled from $116 million in assets at the start of 1997 to almost $900 million now -- he merely stops buying shares and the company soon accounts for a smaller percentage of assets. He is not shy about comparing himself to the best, and, indeed, his investment style bears some resemblance to that of the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.
"I do exactly the same thing as Buffett does," Mr. Torray said, buying and holding a limited number of key stocks.
 
Saying Yes to Student Loans
Mr. Torray began buying the SLM Holding Corporation, formerly the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, in February 1993, after share prices fell by more than a third from their peak in 1992.
"Shareholders got hysterical after President Clinton made student lending a cornerstone issue of his campaign and said the Government should lend directly to students and save the interest paid to Sallie Mae," Mr. Torray said. But, he says, Sallie Mae has managed to maintain its franchise.
Today, he is still adding to his position. "It's a solid company, well positioned going forward as the number of students increases and the cost of education increases, forcing more people to borrow," he said.
And shares are still reasonably priced, he said.
"The market hasn't fully embraced the company," Mr. Torray said. "Maybe student lending isn't exciting to people."
Its shares closed at $46.625 on Friday.
SLM has never had a big Wall Street following, he said, because it is not easy to categorize. As Mr. Torray sees it, SLM is a "simple business, easy to understand, and has a triple-A balance sheet."
He expects earnings growth of 13 percent to 15 percent a year over the next five years and said shares could trade as high as $60.
 
Loading Up on Morgan
Although Mr. Torray began buying J. P. Morgan only on Jan. 21, the company already accounts for more than 4 percent of the fund's holdings "and probably will get bigger," he said.
"It's probably one of the most unique franchises in the world financial business," he added.
Mr. Torray said Morgan was well capitalized and had made a "remarkable transformation from a blue-chip bank to a worldwide financial adviser, underwriter, trader and money manager that is perfectly positioned to deal with the world economy." He figures that the stock could run up 40 percent to 50 percent from current levels in the next five years. Recent rumors that Morgan might be acquired played no role in his decision to buy the stock, he said.
The company's expansion, however, has led to underperformance, which is why shares are priced conservatively, Mr. Torray said. The stock closed at $111.375 on Friday. He said the stock could hit $200 in five years.
Morgan's management has said its target is 15 percent to 20 percent return on equity compared with 14.2 percent now. "That's not unreasonable," said Mr. Torray, who figures shares could rise apace. "I could be comfortable holding shares indefinitely."
 
Sensing a Bargain in E.D.S.
Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company that was spun off by General Motors, has had some earnings disappointments. After the spinoff, shares traded at more than $64 a share, then fell into the $40's and have sunk several times into the mid-$30's. The stock closed at $44.313 on Friday.
Mr. Torray began buying shares in October 1996, five months after the spinoff.
So far, the company has "impressive top-line sales growth," and has signed new contracts, but that has not yet translated into higher earnings, Mr. Torray said.
He thinks E.D.S. can generate double-digit earnings growth. "At this price, we consider it attractive," Mr. Torray said.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Team Work;
All for One, One for All and Every Man for Himself

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
THESE days, it seems everyone is a team player, willingly or not.
Chairmen and their managers form executive teams. Factory-floor workers are lumped into quality teams. Students in grade school push desks together for "cooperative learning." Many colleges encourage, even require, students to work together. 
 And why not? Studies say that students learn better working in small groups, and they also build teamwork skills that will help them in their careers. Teams have made corporate America more nimble and innovative by tapping into ideas from all employees. Teamwork has helped Americans settle frontiers and win wars. Even Benjamin Franklin preached team ball: "We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately," he declaimed.
 
Mixed Feelings
Time out, though. Not everyone is on the teamwork team. Often the concept is hardly more than a slogan. In other cases, the approach is misapplied. And many people simply have trouble overcoming the sense that individualism trumps teamwork for getting ahead.
Consider cooperative learning, a movement that gained popularity in the 1980's and has become a fixture in most schools. Educators are convinced of the advantages of putting classmates into small groups and assigning them a project -- students learn the material better, they say, and also learn to listen to, and respect, others' opinions. Done right, cooperative learning can turbocharge education and approach John Dewey's ideal of the school as "a genuine form of active community life, instead of a place apart in which to learn lessons."
But many parents worry that their child might be stuck carrying the load for the group, even though each student in the group is supposed to be held accountable for his or her contribution. Other parents object to the very idea of cooperative learning, in part because they see little evidence that it holds much useful value in a society that places such a premium on being the best.
Sure, it's important to be able to get along with people, their argument goes. But schools typically don't measure or evaluate teamwork. Colleges sort applicants largely by grades and test scores. When it's time to join the work force, people are hired and promoted as individuals. So many parents fear that if young Johnny helps his fellow students too much now, he might grow up to be the nice guy who finishes last.
"Cooperative learning is bunk," Marianne Moody Jennings, a professor of legal and ethical studies at Arizona State University and a columnist for The Arizona Republic, wrote a few years ago. "Learning takes work, and cooperative learning takes the work right out of learning."
In an interview, Ms. Jennings said she often heard complaints from university students about being required to study in groups. "They came for the sage on the stage, and not the guide on the side," she said. "It really does bring everybody down to a lower level."
 
Reflex Action
The business world has its own teamwork problems. Of course, there are many examples of effective teams: American car companies realized late in the game the wisdom of bringing together experts from design, engineering, production and marketing before they start to build cars.
But corporate America has a habit of taking a good idea too far. Many companies, for example, have draped themselves in the banner of teamwork without much thought. While researching a book about the skills students need to prosper in a changing economy, Richard J. Murnane, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, found one company that had a team of customer service representatives who worked by themselves on phones in cubicles.
"A great many more firms talk about teamwork than do it in any meaningful way," Professor Murnane said. "It's become in vogue."
In a recent article in The Harvard Business Review titled "The Myth of the Top Management Team," Jon R. Katzenbach, a consultant with McKinsey & Company, argued that groups of top managers that called themselves teams seldom actually worked together in pursuit of a particular goal.
 
Good Vibes
Instead, Mr. Katzenbach said in an interview, many companies simply put people together in a room and call them a team, leaving teamwork entirely to chance -- "real teams at random," he called them. Too often, he said, teamwork becomes a feel-good mechanism that can get in the way of actually accomplishing something. Sometimes decisions need to be made quickly, and deferring to the team in a kind of "I'm O.K., you're O.K." spirit may promote good will but little else.
"The notion of the team-based organization is dangerous because you will try to do everything as a team," he said. "It's a crazy idea."
Some executives, of course, know how to be both team players and bosses. In "Executive Teams" (Jossey-Bass; 1998), David A. Nadler, chairman of the Delta Consulting Group in New York, wrote of how the former chairman of Corning Inc. talked figuratively about wearing his "cowboy hat" when he wanted the give-and-take of a team meeting, and his "bowler" when it was time to be boss.
One can forgive many employees if they don't buy the teamwork pitch. Paul Osterman, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, surveyed 500 companies in 1992 and 1997, and found that those that used work groups like teams to lift quality and productivity did not share whatever gains they realized with workers, unless those workers were unionized. He also found that those same companies tended to have more layoffs than traditional companies. It can be hard to square the fact that at the same time managers are ruthlessly pursuing bottom-line profits and their bonuses, they are also urging workers to consider themselves part of the company team.
And for all the talk of the need for team players, the star system remains alive and well in business. Many companies would like to suggest otherwise, noting that they have restructured compensation packages so that bonuses are tied as much to team goals as individual performance. But this is the age of the celebrity C.E.O. -- the lone ranger who can ride into any troubled company and turn things around, reaping outsized rewards compared with the "team" that helps him.
Business people love to use sports metaphors to talk about teamwork. But the analogy is breaking down there, too. The level of teamwork is faltering quickly in the National Basketball Association, for example, as the stars take over games and team payrolls.
The fact that workers feel less loyalty to their employers is well documented, and putting employees on teams is unlikely to change that. Fast Company magazine ran a cover article last month about the "Free Agent Nation" of some 25 million independent contractors, self-employed and temps in the United States. And Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert cartoon strip, has predicted in a rare moment of seriousness a future in which most professionals work for several companies and feel more secure because their livelihood is no longer in the hands of one dreaded boss.
 
'Rugged Individualism'
So should Americans be team players or free agents? Should they hang together, as Ben Franklin urged, or follow the "American system of rugged individualism" that Herbert Hoover hailed in a 1928 campaign speech?
In this country, the answer is, inevitably, both. "There is a central tension, of hardy individualism and the sense that we're all in it together," said James T. Kloppenberg, a professor of American history at Brandeis University. "And it can't be resolved."

TRADE DEFICIT
Give Us Your Tired,
Your Poor, Your Exports
The nation's 1997 trade deficit reached its highest level in nine years, and a jump in December suggested that the deficit would surge again in 1998 because Asia's financial crisis makes Asian products cheaper in the United States. Imports of goods and services exceeded exports by $10.8 billion in December, a deficit increase of $2.1 billion from November. Economists had expected the December deficit to be about $9 billion. The monthly figures showed the first tentative signs of Asia's effect on trade patterns. The trade deficit with economically ravaged South Korea, for example, expanded by $300 million in December, to $343 million. 

CONSUMER DEBT
Just Say No, Occasionally
American consumers, often portrayed as fecklessly mired in high-cost debt, appear to be saying enough is enough. Their automobile, credit card and other installment debt, which excludes mortgages, rose just 4.7 percent last year, compared with 6.9 percent in 1996 and 14.2 percent in 1995. Because consumer spending has helped to fuel the economic boom, and much of that spending has been through borrowing, a drastic slowdown could be worrisome. The flip side of spending is savings, and the national savings rate fell to 3.8 percent last year, the lowest in 58 years.
 
THE ECONOMY
Pick Your Numbers
Reinforcing evidence of a robust economy and nearly nonexistent inflation, the Government reported that prices paid by manufacturers posted the biggest decline in nearly four years last month. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures the cost of raw materials and semifinished goods before they reach the consumer, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent. . . . A second report, by the Commerce Department, showed construction of homes and apartments fell slightly in January from December, but the annual rate of construction was still healthy at 1.53 million units. . . . Industrial production stalled unexpectedly in January as the output of utilities fell 4 percent, the Federal Reserve said. Manufacturing production rose, but at a slower pace than in previous months. The Fed said output at factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in January -- the first month without an increase since October 1996.
 
RIGHTS
Inequity on Maternity?
A United Nations survey of 152 countries has found that the United States is one of only six that does not have a national policy requiring paid maternity leave. Such disparate countries as the Sudan, Cameroon and Nepal, for example, mandate that a woman receive her salary while she is caring for her newborn. The majority of the countries surveyed provide benefits through social welfare systems, although some require the employer to pay and others combine both financing sources. Only the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Lesotho, Swaziland and Papua New Guinea do not require paid leave, according to the review of International Labor Organization member countries.
 
THEY'RE BA-A-A-ACK
German Re-engineering
Of all the failures under Communist rule in East Germany, none received as much ridicule as the smoke-belching little box of a car known as the Trabant. Even today, seven years after the last "Trabi" rolled off the assembly line, the jokes are still legion. Why didn't the Trabi move when the light turned green? Because its tire got stuck on a piece of gum. Why do deluxe Trabis have heated rear windows? To keep your hands warm as you push. How do you double a Trabi's value? Fill up the gas tank. But now the jokes have a new twist. The company that made the Trabant, now called Sachsenring Automobiltechnik A.G., has been reborn and is booming. Instead of cars, it makes car parts -- and not for old Trabis. Far from being an East German laughingstock, it has become a model for entrepreneurial pluck, a rare trait in the smug business world of of western Germany.
 
DOWNSIZING
Layoffs and More Layoffs
Promise Keepers, the Christian movement for men that is based in Denver, has given six weeks' notice to its entire staff of 345. . . . Springs Industries, a textile maker in Rock Hill, S.C., said it would dismiss 480 workers and close the plant, which once employed 5,000, by midyear. . . . Medtronic Inc., a maker of medical devices, said it would close eight plants -- in Austin, Tex.; Eden Prairie, Minn., and San Jose, Calif., as well as in the Netherlands, Japan and Sweden -- and cut about 600 jobs. . . . Renault plans to cut 1,500 jobs in France this year after giving pink slips to 2,800 last year.
 
VIETNAM
Dominoes, Anyone?
Vietnam became the latest Southeast Asian country to devalue its currency, as Asia's financial turmoil showed signs of pummeling even the most protected regional markets. The Vietnamese central bank allowed the country's currency, the dong, to slip to a new controlled rate of 11,800 to the dollar, a 5 percent devaluation. The move underscores the danger facing Vietnam, whose 74 million people make it the second-most populous Southeast Asian country, after Indonesia. Relatively late to open to the outside world, Communist-run Vietnam never fully benefited from the region's economic boom. But that has hardly isolated it from Asia's crash.
 
RETAILING
A More Limited Limited
The Limited Inc. said last week that it would shut down unprofitable stores in its women's apparel businesses, close all but one of its Henri Bendel specialty shops and spin off another subsidiary, Abercrombie & Fitch, to Limited shareholders. The plan is the biggest revamping since the Limited went public in 1969. Further, the company plans to close roughly 200 of its underperforming stores that carry the names Limited, Express, Lerner New York or Lane Bryant. This is in addition to the 200 stores the company began closing in December. The company will continue to open new Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works stores through a majority-owned subsidiary, Intimate Brands. All told, the store closings represent about 10 percent of the company's clothing businesses.
COMPUTERS
A Less Limited Dell
The Dell Computer Corporation reported quarterly earnings that exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates, as the company's strategy of selling computers directly to consumers continued to fuel torrid growth. Revenue rose for a 16th consecutive quarter. By selling its machines direct to customers, with no middlemen, Dell can minimize inventory and maximize return on capital. The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split and said it saw strong revenue gains in the United States, Latin America and Europe. Despite the economic crisis in Asia, Dell said it achieved profitable fourth-quarter results in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes Japan. Revenues in that region exceeded $240 million, a 79 percent increase from a year earlier, the company said.

Brooklyn Tenants, Too, Suffer in Court

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your article "Music Teacher Loses an Ansonia Battle" (Jan. 25), concerning Fausto Bozza's loss of a suit in Housing Court when the contract is on his side is more evidence, if not absolute proof, of how corrupt the housing court judiciary in New York City is. 
 In Brooklyn Housing Court, landlords and their lawyers routinely ignore even the required three-day notice. Most of the judges seem to be extremely biased, usually toward landlords. Landlords usually are represented by lawyers, while tenants routinely cannot afford representation.
What makes any city great is variety. If government and the courts keep pushing rent to the stratosphere, eventually there will be luxury housing and subsidized housing for the very poor. This will leave a city without a serious economic middle class and no one to do the low- and medium-income jobs, including shopkeepers and clerks. A rather desolate prospect.

HEADLINE: How Best to Oust Hussein?

BYLINE: By John Deutch; John Deutch, a professor of chemistry at M.I.T., was Director of Central Intelligence and Deputy Secretary of Defense in the first Clinton Administration.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Many people are calling for the United States to overthrow Saddam Hussein. But how would we actually do it?
The most obvious way would be to attack Iraq with a combination of air and ground forces. But almost no one wants to risk young American lives in Iraq, and everyone agrees that air strikes alone cannot do the job. 
 Instead, some suggest, the United States should mastermind a quiet assassination of the Iraqi leader.
For the moment, disregard that it is illegal under current law to sponsor assassination for political reasons. Also disregard past history -- for example, abortive American efforts to kill Fidel Castro in the 1960's.
But ask yourself two questions. Is it likely that we could carry out such an assassination successfully? (Perhaps, though it stretches credulity.) And could we do so quietly? (Impossible.)
There certainly are circumstances where assassination might be justified -- for example, an attempt on Hitler's life. But the conditions for reversing our policy against assassination should be pretty stringent: unanimous support from allies; a preponderance of world opinion, especially in the region, about the desirability of getting rid of the despot, and some confidence that the successor would be less evil than the target.
There would also need to be a judgment that American influence and interests in the Middle East would not be impaired for long if we were revealed to have been even partly responsible for the assassination. No, assassination is not a viable way to handle Mr. Hussein.
What about the idea of overthrowing the Iraqi Government through "covert action"? Covert action has long been an important instrument of the United States Government. It lies between open warfare and diplomacy -- the United States tries to influence political events in another country, but anonymously.
In my judgment, covert action has growing importance today, primarily in the war against drugs, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But could the much reviled Central Intelligence Agency organize an overthrow of Saddam Hussein with the hand of the United States concealed?
Of course, this is not the first time that some political leaders and the public have longed for a simple way to get rid of a troublesome foreign leader. Dwight Eisenhower took the covert-action approach with Sukarno in Indonesia in the late 1950's, and John Kennedy tried it with the Bay of Pigs. In 1954, Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown in Guatemala, and Col. Edward G. Lansdale, in a legendary C.I.A. operation, showed that covert action could successfully defend a legitimate regime from Communist insurgency in the Philippines.
But the record of covert action is, at best, mixed, as our experience in Iraq shows. Since 1991, the C.I.A. has supported several dissident groups -- the Kurds in the north, dissidents in London, and most recently an opposition in the Iraqi military. But, of course, Saddam Hussein is still there.
The problem is that policy makers frequently adopt covert action to avoid harder choices -- either direct military action or the difficult aboveboard diplomatic work necessary to replace a foreign leader.
Since the end of the Persian Gulf war, there has been a reluctance to undertake the policy of working publicly to replace Mr. Hussein. There is no obvious leader to back, Mr. Hussein is popular with the Arab public, and there is a risk of provoking terrorist acts against the United States.
In the presence of ambiguity like this -- remember Nicaragua? -- covert action becomes almost impossible. Consider the difficulty a C.I.A. case officer would face in talking to a prospective leader of a coup attempt against Mr. Hussein. This coup leader would be unlikely to resemble Thomas Jefferson. He or she would ask: Will the United States provide military assistance in the first few hours of an attempted takeover? Whom will the United States support after the fall of Mr. Hussein? Is there any evidence of regional support (neighbors are important) for a regime after Mr. Hussein? How much money will the United States commit if the coup is successful, and how much is available in advance (in small bills)? How will the Sunni, Shia and Kurds share power in post-Hussein Iraq?
Even if the case officer could answer those questions, that would be only the first hurdle. Once such a movement is begun, the C.I.A. would like to be able to control the insurgency, and the agency knows that is not possible. Because of their fervor, dissident groups are notoriously optimistic about what they can accomplish. They often want to blow up the radio station in town rather than the radio tower, or the railroad station rather than the railroad tracks. These actions can be bloody and are hard to control.
Covert action can be helpful if it is not considered a "hail Mary" pass at the end of a football game, but is instead part of the blocking and tackling of a concerted team effort.
If we are prepared to make a public commitment to overthrow Mr. Hussein, then we should announce our intention to form and financially support a new Iraqi dissident group. We should work with other governments in the region to describe the political and economic benefits that would come to Iraq and the Iraqi people with a new regime, one that does not seek weapons of mass destruction or threaten the security of the region. And we should authorize covert action that would be appropriate to support those public efforts.
Such an approach is more likely to catalyze change than an assassin's bullet. Covert action is not an alternative to air strikes -- those strikes, despite their limits in directly bringing about Mr. Hussein's fall, are necessary to tell the world that the United States continues to oppose Mr. Hussein's reckless conduct. But independent of any military action, we should also be working strenuously, both publicly and covertly, to nudge Iraq toward a stable life after Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Education Aid To Localities Gets 2d Look From Trenton

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Feb. 21

 BODY:
Widespread grumbling about New Jersey's allocation of school aid for the 1998-99 academic year has prompted the state to start an immediate and broad search for mistakes in its grants to local districts.
A team of accountants and computer analysts from the State Treasury Department is spending the weekend poring over nearly 3.8 million state income tax returns for 1995 to insure that all districts receive the state money they are entitled to under an aid formula enacted in 1996. 
 The Whitman administration ordered the broad analysis after a study of about 1 million other tax returns earlier this week discovered errors in calculations for a handful of the state's 600 school districts, said Mary Lou Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department.
"There's anomalies in about a dozen of the communities and we thought they had justified complaints," Ms. Murphy said. "Other towns will probably ask us to check our numbers, so we decided to do it all at once instead of piecemeal."
The complaints coincide with the state's using, for the first time, state income tax returns in calculating the amount of education aid for each school district. Under the 1996 aid formula, each district's state grant for educational programs depends on the taxable value of its property and the income levels of its residents. Previously, the state relied on income data from the 1990 United States Census to determine a district's personal-income figures.
Ms. Murphy said officials had no way of knowing how many districts received incorrect state aid figures for their new budgets until the analysis was complete. She said officials hoped to finish it by early next week.
Local school officials across the state have been complaining about the figures since the state's Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, released his $6 billion education budget on Feb. 11. The New Jersey School Boards Association says that 228 of the districts received cuts in their aid and an additional 177 received increases less than New Jersey's average rate of inflation of 1.7 percent. The local officials argue that the cutbacks or the minimal increases will force a sharp increase in school taxes or a cut in educational programs for students.
The few errors found thus far, and the weekend analysis, deal with a $2.5 billion package of aid for the Whitman administration's core-curriculum standards, a set of statewide instructional guidelines. Another $2.5 billion in state aid for transportation, special-education programs, bilingual education and computer programs is not affected, because each district's share of that money is determined by student enrollment in the programs, not a district's property values and income levels.
The few mistakes the Treasury Department uncovered in its earlier review of the one million tax returns involved discrepancies between a taxpayer's mailing address and residence. In some communities, particularly those that were once rural but have undergone major housing development in recent years, people receive their mail in post offices in adjacent, older towns. The problem in education aid calculations arises because some residents list on their state tax return the town where they receive their mail instead of the town where they live.
Consequently, the state's aid calculations have incorrectly inflated the income levels in some towns with many low- and moderate-income residents and, correspondingly, reduced their education aid grants, officials said. The focus of the weekend review is ferreting out such mistakes across the state and correcting them, said Ms. Murphy of the Treasury Department.
Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the state's school boards association, said Randolph, an older town in Morris County, lost $2 million in education aid. Its officials, he said, believe the state has overstated its income levels.

HEADLINE: THE XVIII WINTER GAMES: ICE HOCKEY;
Enterprising Russian Team Hasn't Forgotten World-Beater Roots

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: NAGANO, Japan, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Look at that middle-aged man with the dark hair and the famous face, walking in and out of the Russian dressing room at the Olympic Games. Is that Vladislav Tretiak, one of the greatest goalies in world hockey history? Yes, it is. Now he is coaching the goalies for the Russian national team.
See the older man, sitting in a prime seat in the stands, looking dignified in a business suit? He is Viktor Tikhonov, the Vince Lombardi of hockey in the former Soviet Union. He was supposed to be out of favor after the U.S.S.R. ceased to exist. What in the name of Aleksandr Yakushev is Tikhonov doing here? 
 "He is an honored guest of the hockey federation," said Aleksei Kasatonov, the general manager of the Russian team.
And there is Kasatonov, everywhere, a big, burly man with a stern visage and dark hair slicked back on his head. He was a world-class defenseman for Central Army in the 1980's and he played in the National Hockey League in the early 1990's. He speaks English slowly and deliberately, with a thick accent, in a deep voice. If he were an actor, Hollywood would cast Kasatonov with a chest full of ribbons and medals, standing on a balcony, reviewing the troops and the tanks in Red Square on May Day. Now he has his team playing the Czech Republic for the gold medal in the Olympics.
With Russia making an uneven transition from a planned economy to free enterprise in the 1990's, the stories about its hockey culture have been discouraging. The great teams are disintegrating, according to visiting North American scouts and journalists. So torn by politics is the Russian hockey culture that many star players refused to play in these Olympics. Vladimir Malakhov stayed away, and so did Sergei Zubov and Nikolai Khabibulin. Slava Kozlov stayed home and so did Slava Fetisov, who used to be Kasatonov's defense partner but is not among his friends. Igor Larionov, Russia's version of Wayne Gretzky, refused to come, but later expressed regret and tried unsuccessfully to join the team.
And what did he and the others miss? An impressive charge to the championship game. The Russian team won all five of its games on the way to the final. The players who agreed to represent their country cannot stop talking about the team spirit inside the dressing room and around their living quarters.
They praise Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket, who is the captain. He scored five goals in the semifinal game, a 7-4 victory Finland, and had a tournament-leading nine goals in all. They also speak highly of Sergei Fedorov, who joined the team at the last minute, even though he had no contract in the National Hockey League. Fedorov had 6 points on one goal and five assists in the five games leading up to the final. Aleksei Yashin also had 6 points, on three goals and three assists. On defense, Boris Mironov clobbered opposing forwards with hard, clean body checks and a few of the other kind, too. In goal, Mikhail Shtalenkov had a goals-against average of 1.82.
And what about those who stayed away and must watch their countrymen on television?
"Maybe they think, 'Maybe I should have gone to the Olympic Games,' " said Aleksei Zhamnov, one of the stars of the team. "Maybe some guys are upset."
The startling rise of Russia in this tournament has been one of the revelations of the Olympics. Coming in, Russia seemed to have the fourth- or fifth-best team in a Winter Games that allowed full participation of N.H.L. players. Canada and the United States would be challenged by Sweden for the gold and silver medals, everyone seemed to think.
After a fourth-place finish in the 1994 Olympics and a poor showing in the 1996 World Cup, Russian hockey dominance seemed to be swept into the dustbin of history. The nation had won 8 hockey gold medals in 10 Olympic Games from 1956 through 1992, but it would now go through a long, difficult rebuilding stage.
The experts ignored one element.
"We have excellent, world-level players," said Vladimir Yurzinov, coach of the Russian team.
The best of all has been Bure, whose career seemed to have plateaued with the Vancouver Canucks. Given a leadership role with his national squad, Bure accelerated his game to a new level.
"It's such a big honor to be named the captain of the team," said Bure, who added his recollections of those before him who wore the captain's "K" above the "C.C.C.P." on their red sweaters. "I've been watching hockey since I was 6 years old. I've seen those guys like Boris Mikhailov and Slava Fetisov. I've tried to learn something from them."
Zhamnov said Bure controls the atmosphere in the dressing room. "He talks to guys all the time," Zhamnov said. "He is a good captain for me and for everybody. In the final game, I hope he scores six goals."
Darius Kasparaitis, a Lithuanian defenseman who was trained in Russia and plays for the Russian team, said Bure was missed by Russia in the World Cup when he was injured. Kasparaitis said criticism of Russian hockey since then has been used by the players for motivation.
"We are here to prove we are still among the best hockey nations in the world," Kasparaitis said. "In the United States, we read all that stuff about how the Russian team is bad, not even in the first four. That made us mad."
One of the intriguing subplots has been the appearance of Fedorov, a restricted free agent who has played seven seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. When Aleksei Kovalev of the Rangers withdrew from the team because of knee surgery, Fedorov was quick to replace him. During this tournament, Fedorov has received an offer from the Carolina Hurricanes of $38 million for six years. Detroit has a week to match. The Red Wings' other options are to accept five first-round draft choices as compensation or to arrange a trade with Carolina.
Many of his teammates were curious about what frame of mind Fedorov would bring to the tournament. Some of his Russian teammates in Detroit had said in public that Fedorov had become self-centered even as he led Detroit in playoff scoring as the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup last June. The members of the national team say they have been pleasantly surprised.
Andrei Trefilov, the backup goalie, said: "He's fine. He's a leader on the team, him and Pavel." Kasatonov said Fedorov "has a high motivation because of the situation with his contract. He works unbelievable."
Fedorov expressed hope for a gold medal with a touch of patriotism.
"It helps a lot back home," he said of Russian hockey success in the Olympics. "Lots of people are looking forward to seeing us win."

HEADLINE: Greenwich Fights Beach Lawsuit With Army of Experts

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 21

 BODY:
For this wealthy community on Long Island Sound, few issues are as important as keeping nonresidents off its beaches. For years, town officials have rejected Federal and state money for park improvements, fearing it might obligate them to admit outsiders.
So it was no surprise that when a law student filed suit to open the beaches, Greenwich prepared for war. It hired some of the best legal talent in Connecticut, brought back the former town attorney who had defended the policy since the 1970's and engaged a battery of expert witnesses. 
 As testimony in the trial came to a close on Friday in State Superior Court in Stamford, the fight seemed quite lopsided.
On one side sat the five lawyers for the town and a neighborhood association. They were packed into two tables, the floor around them cluttered with cardboard boxes and file folders, their briefcases almost piled on top of each other. Against a wall were stacks of aerial photos and maps of the area.
On the other side of the room, Brenden P. Leydon, 29, sat alone, his briefcase on the floor, a few papers and books spread before him. Mr. Leydon had filed the suit when he was still a law student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Now a lawyer at a firm in Stamford, he said this was one of the first cases he had ever argued in court.
Still, Mr. Leydon said, the wall of defense lawyers did not intimidate him.
"O.J. didn't hire the dream team because he had a great case," Mr. Leydon said in an interview. "I knew my case, I knew what the law is. They needed all those lawyers."
Mr. Leydon, a Stamford resident, decided to challenge Greenwich's policy after he was turned away when he tried to go jogging at Greenwich Point Park, often called Tod's Point, a 147-acre site with a beach, walking trails and a view of Manhattan. The park is open only to Greenwich residents, who must buy an annual beach pass to get in, and their guests.
Greenwich residents and officials contend that if the park is opened to everyone, it will be overrun, neighboring streets will be clogged and the ecology of the area will be destroyed.
Critics say Greenwich, a town with some of the most expensive property in the nation and some of its wealthiest people, has no right to restrict access to a natural resource. The critics are also opposed to other towns' restrictions. Of Connecticut's 78 miles of beach, only 30 miles are public. In New Jersey, by contrast, all 127 miles of beach are open to the public.
Mr. Leydon maintains that "reasonable access" to the beach is guaranteed by the state's public trust doctrine, which says, among other things, that municipal parks should be open to all residents of the state. He also said that by denying access, Greenwich violates the First Amendment because it prevents people from gathering in a public place to exercise their right of free speech.
One of the town's lawyers, Ralph G. Elliot, dismissed that contention. "It doesn't have anything to do with free speech," he said in an interview. "They can say anything they want if they can get in."
Despite their formidable legal team, Greenwich residents have been worried about the suit since it was filed in 1995. Many have been steadfast in their determination to keep access to the park limited, and they firmly reject some critics' allegations that the policy is racist.
"No one here sits around thinking about the color of someone's skin," said Mary Staples-Webber, who lives just outside the entrance to the park. "The point is that Tod's was not meant to handle that many cars."
That was the core of the town's case last week. The defense called town officials, consultants and an economist as witnesses to show how the park and surrounding roads would be damaged by increased use. Jonathan S. Falk, a vice president with National Economic Research Associates, an economic consulting firm in White Plains, testified on Friday that an open park could attract about 1.4 million cars a year, up from 276,000 in 1996.
"The quality of the park would be so diminished that people would stop coming," he said.
Mr. Leydon's witnesses included a former town official, a vice president of the neighborhood association, a graduate student from the University of Rhode Island, a longtime Connecticut social advocate and a White Plains woman also active in social causes. Mr. Leydon asked her to come to court on Wednesday only after she had called him on Tuesday night to express support.
And then Mark Tedesco of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, whom Mr. Leydon had been counting on for months to provide key testimony, arrived in court on Thursday to inform the judge that agency policy forbade him to act as an expert witness in a civil case.
"I was absolutely shocked," said Mr. Leydon, who was told of the change the night before. "I had spoken to the guy for a year and a half. I wish I had been informed of the policy a little earlier in the case."
Ned Coll, the activist who testified for Mr. Leydon, said Mr. Leydon did the right thing when he filed the suit but acknowledged that he was up against strong opposition.
"That Leydon is a good guy, it seems to me," Mr. Coll said. "It was David taking on Goliath. Those other guys looked like undertakers."
While some lawyers involved in the case said privately that Mr. Leydon's inexperience often showed, they said he knew the law on the issues and they did not underestimate his arguments. As a law student, Mr. Leydon had worked on the winning side of a similar case over park access in New Jersey.
Still, Mr. Elliot said, he felt confident about the judge's ruling, which could be months away. "All the evidence that we wanted to get in is getting heard by the court," he said.
Mr. Leydon was not as successful.
On Thursday, he tried to submit a videotape of an episode of the television show, "TV Nation," that showed several nonresidents getting onto the Greenwich beach by swimming to shore. Mr. Leydon had rented a 27-inch television set and video cassette recorder to show the tape. When the judge noticed the late hour, he suggested that they watch the tape the next day. Mr. Leydon, who was taking time off from his job to fight the case, protested.
"Judge, I paid $170 to have this today and it's a daily rental," he said. "I'd rather not pay it again tomorrow."
The judge agreed to watch the tape that day. But then he rejected it as evidence.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees New Villain in Asia Crisis: Tokyo's Leadership

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
As finance ministers from the world's leading industrialized countries gathered here today, the United States and its European allies identified a new villain in the Asian financial crisis: not currency market speculators, not the crony capitalists of Indonesia and Korea, but the paralyzed Japanese Government.
With language not seen since the trade battles that marked the early years of the Clinton Administration, the President's top economic advisers have in recent days stopped just short of accusing Japan of gross economic negligence. By failing to stimulate its own economy and by hesitating to clean up its reeling banks, Japan, with the world's second-biggest economy, is undermining the international effort to restore stability to the rest of Asia, these advisers argue. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, has told Congress that Japan was engaging in "virtual policy" -- a derisive reference to its repeated promises to take strong measures to spur its economy and failure to take sufficient action. Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative, declared recently that Japan's efforts to end the Asian crisis were "woefully inadequate." President Clinton has repeated the message several times in letters and phone calls to Japan's Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who in the words of a senior Administration official, "agrees wholeheartedly and then sits on his hands."
At the opening session of the finance ministers' meeting today, the dispute with Japan broke into the open. A confidential study of the Japanese economy presented to the ministers by the International Monetary Fund concluded that Tokyo's financial initiatives have come far too late and amount to far too little. It urged immediate tax cuts and other strong action this year, and Gordon Brown, Britain's Finance Minister, said that "there was a good deal of support for that statement."
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who is normally cautious about public confrontations with Tokyo, said today that Japan needed to "very quickly get on track." He warned that as America's trade deficit increases this year because of a flood of newly inexpensive Asian imports, Japan faced the danger of "fomenting protectionist pressure" in Congress.
The criticisms met a strong rebuttal today from Japan's new Finance Minister, Hikaru Matsunaga. "I feel the economic measures Japan has taken so far have not been appropriately evaluated," he said, telling Japanese reporters that in a meeting with Mr. Rubin this morning he had not committed himself to any further actions.
There is nothing new in Japan's and the United States' meddling in the inner workings of each other's economic decision-making. A decade ago, Japan insisted that Congress eliminate the Federal budget deficit and even had a vague commitment written into an agreement between the countries, with little expectation that it would actually happen.
But the increasingly public nature of the attacks on Japan's economic management, as opposed to its trade policy, have stunned the Japanese. Some officials say they are unfairly being turned into a scapegoat for a regional crisis they did not start and are in no shape to end.
Nevertheless, in private, even senior Japanese officials concede that the basic charge leveled by the United States -- that political paralysis and indecision have prolonged Japan's troubles and thus Asia's -- carries seeds of truth.
"We made a series of bad economic mistakes, and now it is politically difficult to reverse them," an adviser to Prime Minister Hashimoto said recently, referring to Japan's decision in April to go ahead with a large sales tax increase that stalled the economy's nascent recovery. "Now the strategy is to muddle along, and hope that a giant collapse isn't in the offing that would wipe out everyone."
That is exactly the fear of the finance ministers who are here this weekend to devise a strategy to contain Asia's troubles. At the closed session today, the European nations were the first to criticize Japan and a critical review of Japan's actions dominated much of the session.
For the Japanese, the criticisms sting. After years at the fiscal pinnacle, Tokyo's bureaucrats are unaccustomed to being portrayed around the world as economic incompetents. In a half-hearted effort to defuse the mounting criticism, the governing Liberal Democratic Party on Friday announced new measures to spur the economy and to extend $2 billion in new loans to Indonesia and other hard-hit countries.
But in doing so, it gave its critics ammunition. The measures included none of the steps that President Clinton and his aides have called for -- tax cuts to encourage Japanese consumers to buy more, and a detailed, tough plan to close failing banks and restore confidence in Japan's financial system.
So far, Japan has promised to pump money into the failing banking system, which is buried under at least $600 billion of what the Japanese delicately call "problem" loans. Mr. Rubin has told his Japanese counterparts that simply pumping cash into dying banks, without closing weak institutions and tightening oversight of the banking system, would only prolong the problems.
To drive the point home, some of the former American regulators who shut banks throughout Texas and California during the savings and loan crisis in the 1980's have visited Tokyo in recent months, in case anyone wanted their advice. They were given a polite reception, one of them reported later, fed some good meals, and offered limousines to whisk them back to the airport.
"I got the impression they didn't want to hear about it," a former regulator said.
Washington's main goal these days is to get Japan to agree to buy a large share of exports from South Korea and Southeast Asia, products which are vastly cheaper now that Asian currencies have dropped in value by 50 percent to 80 percent. So far that is not happening; in fact, it is scarcely being discussed in Japan, where the domestic economy's troubles overshadow those of the rest of Asia.
"The American-led rescue of Mexico worked because the United States was growing fast enough to buy up whatever Mexico made," Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said this week. "In Asia, that should be Japan's role as the region's leader, and its richest economy. But the Japanese seem oblivious to it. And if Asia comes unglued again, that will likely be the reason why."
But American officials say they have little expectation that their complaints will yield many real results. Finance Minister Matsunaga was appointed to clean up the scandal-ridden ministry; he has little experience in global economic issues. Prime Minister Hashimoto is fending off scandals that have rocked his party and the country's banks, which makes public financing to bail them out politically unpopular. Moreover, Mr. Hashimoto has promised to end deficit spending, and his aides make it clear that Japan has little intention of spending the kind of money that would be required to spur the economy.
"The stagnation of the past two years was the fault of the Government," said Edward J. Lincoln, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also was the special economic adviser to Walter F. Mondale when he was American Ambassador to Japan. "For a long time, the Japanese were in denial, saying things weren't as bad as everyone thought. Now it is clear that they are that bad, and they are making Asia's problems worse."

HEADLINE: Laughing With the Bourgeoisie;
A New Television Show for a New China, Shot in Manhattan, Skips the Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City: A grimy city of danger and despair. America: A confusing land of ruthless capitalists and thwarted dreams.
For years, this was the America that people in China experienced on state-run television. In the early 1990's, for instance, a popular series called "A Native of Beijing in New York" recounted the travails of a married couple who came to New York with buoyant hopes but ended up divorced and disillusioned. In the final scene of the series, the protagonist, a beleaguered businessman named Wang Qiming, makes an obscene gesture at a group of New Yorkers -- and, metaphorically, at the entire city and country. 
 How quickly scripts can become dated.
In "New York Adventures," a romantic comedy series being taped in the city for Chinese television, the main characters, a young couple named Dashan and Jenny, do not toil at a sweatshop or a restaurant. They are managers at a Manhattan consulting firm. They do not live in a filthy hovel; they roam around a swank high-rise apartment with a kitchen that Martha Stewart would envy. And their boss is not a boorish Chinese patriarch; she is a sweet, intelligent Caucasian woman who speaks fluent Mandarin and develops a crush on Dashan -- without knowing that he is Jenny's husband.
On its surface, "New York Adventures" is high camp and melodrama, milking the most out of cultural misunderstandings and a would-be romantic triangle in which everyone but the American is in on the joke.
On another level, the show is about Chinese immigrants yearning for, and lassoing, the American dream of money, success and family -- a dream that only a few years ago would have been dismissed as foolhardy, even un-Chinese. But now, because the Chinese are making more money and traveling more widely thanks to recent economic reforms, the aspirations trumpeted in "New York Adventures" are considered within reach.
"People like to see something close to their lives, so they will probably be able to relate to the young couple in the story," said Junhao Hong, author of the forthcoming book "The Internationalization of Television in China" and an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
There are political undercurrents, as well. As it incorporates market-style economics into its own brand of socialism, the Communist Government has become more amenable to giving the masses what they want: more entertainment, less politics.
"It's no longer 'Beat up the liberal bourgeoisie' on television these days," said William Brent, president of China Entertainment Network, an entertainment consulting and production company in Shanghai. "It's: 'Have fun watching how the other half lives.' "
New York is one place, presumably, where the other half lives. But unlike the cruel maw of a city depicted in "A Native of Beijing in New York," New York is almost glorified in the new series, with backdrops that could double as a tourist's home video: Times Square, Wall Street, Central Park, Lincoln Center, the Plaza Hotel.
As with most series in Asia, "New York Adventures" is expected to run every weekday evening, at the same hour, for four straight weeks for a total of 20 episodes. The series, which should conclude its three-month shooting by month's end, is scheduled to be broadcast in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and other cities in the spring, then find its way to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and Chinese-language stations in the United States, said Richard Ting, the show's producer.
That the Chinese people would be receptive to a series taped in New York that praises the good life and co-stars a Mandarin-speaking Westerner is a far cry from 1958, when China introduced its first television station. Through the 1960's and 1970's, Chinese audiences saw programs that, as per the Government's directives, only ladled out political propaganda. There were programs on model workers. On the gospel of Mao Zedong. On the exiled Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.
"When I was growing up, we always thought that the biggest movie star in China was Sihanouk," said Mr. Ting, who immigrated in the 1980's and is now president of the Eagle and Dragon Trading Company, a Manhattan garment company.
After 1979, television began to change as China lurched toward a market economy that leaders described euphemistically as "socialism with Chinese characteristics." The number of television stations exploded, from 52 in 1983 to 837 in 1996. People started buying their own TV sets, instead of crowding a neighbor's living room. In 1983, there were 36 million sets and by 1996 that number had grown to 286 million.
Moreover, the Government allowed commercials on television for the first time in 1979, Mr. Hong said. Now, television programs are typically financed in one of two ways: either by a flat fee from a television station and allowing the station to collect fees from commercials, or by giving a program to a station free and earning the proceeds from a 30-second or 1-minute commercial. "New York Adventures" will take the latter route, Mr. Ting said.
"Television is a mirror of social change, and people in China want to see more realistic programming now," Mr. Hong said.
Of course, certain stereotypes about Americans still endure. In "New York Adventures," every character drives an expensive car -- a Lexus here, a Celica there -- to get around town. The show's producers also wanted Rachel Meyer, the non-Chinese star, to dye her brown hair blond (which she did) and to mask her hazel eyes with blue contact lenses (which she did not).
Usually, though, the humor is very Chinese. In one episode, Jenny's father -- who speaks no English and whiles his time pining for a grandchild -- dispenses Chinese herbs to some friends. This is common in China. But in New York, he is arrested for practicing without a medical license.
Linguistic follies abound. "Tomorrow," for instance, is misconstrued as "chi mao rou," which means "to eat cat meat."
There is no shortage of the exaggerated physical comedy that tickles Asian audiences. In one scene Ms. Meyer's character, Nancy McCoy, visits Jenny and Dashan's apartment unannounced. So Jenny hides in the kitchen. Dashan -- by now a sweating and bumbling wreck -- concocts an excuse to prevent Nancy from entering the kitchen: there is a vicious dog inside. Jenny, of course, pretends to be that dog. She barks. She even bites Dashan's finger.
Mr. Ting based much of the story on his own experiences. To finance the project, he solicited $1 million from Zhejiang Furun, a textile conglomerate in his home province of Zhejiang. He traveled to China to secure the approval of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television. He hired the cast, consisting mainly of recent Chinese immigrants.
But how he discovered Ms. Meyer -- who had never acted before -- is a tale of Hollywood-like serendipity.
On a crisp autumn day, Ms. Meyer was on a street corner in Flushing, distributing leaflets for a language school. She was speaking Mandarin -- a language that she had studied at Smith College and in Taiwan, where she had lived for three years. A crowd of Chinese onlookers stared. Finally, one of them said: "Hey, I know a producer, and he wants you to star in his show."
"At first, I was a little bit skeptical," said Ms. Meyer, 30. "Like, 'Yeah, right, you know a producer.' " But after she met Mr. Ting, read the Chinese-language script and realized that this was no joke, she took the plunge.
She described the show as a cross between "The Dick Van Dyke Show" (goofy, genial comedy) and "Melrose Place" (sudsy corporate intrigue). "I want to ride this wave, because it's a great opportunity."
For the indoor scenes, Mr. Ting rented a mansion in tony Alpine, N.J. Then he invited the crew of 20 people or so to live there in a communal arrangement to cut costs and nurture camaraderie.
On a recent day, the crew planted itself in front of the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. As usual, the characters were dressed nattily: Nancy in an indigo power suit, Dashan (played by Guo Fu Wang) in a charcoal double-breasted suit, Jenny (Xiao Hong Zhang) in a verdant faux-fur overcoat. Spectators circled the director, Zong Si Min, as he prepared to tape a crucial scene: Nancy's discovery that Jenny and Dashan are married.
Tense stuff. But in the scene, there was no vengeance exacted, no sour grapes. Instead, Nancy, gracious and understanding, offered Dashan an even better job in Asia. Smiling in disbelief, he whispered to his wife: "Ah, America!"
It was a wrap. But one group of spectators remained, mesmerized by the sight. They were tourists from China.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
League's Top Rookies Count to Three, and Then Leave for Greener Pastures

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
It was an idea that seemed well-founded. Instead of paying enormous salaries to unproven players like Shawn Bradley and Glenn Robinson, install a rookie salary scale that would not reward the league's young players until they had three years under their belt.
But less than three years after the owners and the players agreed to the plan, it has gone bust in a number of ways. It has not helped teams keep franchise players or necessarily helped the league's out-of-whack economics. 
 Of the 13 lottery picks in 1995, only 3 have remained with the team that drafted them. And two of those three players -- Kevin Garnett in Minnesota and Bryant Reeves in Vancouver -- signed such extraordinary deals that their franchises must find creative ways to keep competitive rosters intact.
Last week, the No. 1 pick from that draft, Joe Smith, and the No. 7 pick, Damon Stoudamire, were dealt for the sole reason that the teams that drafted them felt they were not prepared to pay $100 million to keep them, or that no matter what amount of money they offered in the off season, the players would bolt.
"It's really a sad state of affairs," Golden State General Manager Garry St. Jean said recently. "You have a guy for three years and you barely have a chance to evaluate him and he's gone."
In the Warriors case, they simply did not feel Smith was worth the financial commitment.
The former players association executive directors Charles Grantham and Simon Guordine helped put together the current deal.
But the owners actually created the problem by giving up the right of first refusal during labor negotiations in the summer of 1995.
Instead of a team having the right to match another team's offer to their free agents, a player can now simply bolt.
"The flip side to the deal is that players can feel like they are sort of serving just an apprenticeship and the dynamics about how players feel about their teams change," said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. "I felt at the time that the owners gave up a lot by giving up a right of first refusal."
While some players have benefited greatly -- Garnett's $126 million deal is the sterling example -- the structure has created a league of disparate salaries, a National Basketball Association of haves and have-nots.
There is a good chance the collective bargaining agreement will be reopened in April by the owners, who have the unilateral right to do so.
There is an even better chance that the current rookie scale will be up for intense debate and, possibly, change.
"The way things are now, something has got to give," Kevin McHale, Minnesota's vice president of basketball operations, said recently.
"There's no stability and it's near impossible to keep a playoff team together in a small market. And often times, three years after you're done putting all the effort into teaching and nurturing, your player is gone to someone else."
 
The Balk Move
Eric Montross, Sam Cassell and Jim Jackson might have substantial arguments to make about not reporting to the next team they are traded to. Playing for four different teams apiece over the past year, they have been at the system's mercy.
If Montross (Boston, Dallas, Nets, Philadelphia), Cassell (Houston, Phoenix, Dallas and the Nets) and Jackson (Dallas, Nets, Philadelphia, Golden State) held out for a clothing stipend to accommodate each climate change, people would understand.
But what happened prior to Thursday's deadline -- Kenny Anderson refusing to report to Toronto and Rony Seikaly failing to show in Utah -- has the league worried and perhaps thinking about amendments to its current trade-and-report rules.
"If it becomes more and more prevalent, that's a definite concern," said Russ Granik, the N.B.A's deputy commissioner. "When our players don't report on trades, it's a little disturbing."
Section 10 of the uniform player contract states that if players fail to report in the 48-hour window after a trade, they can be suspended without pay. Orlando was apparently prepared to exercise that clause with Seikaly before the Jazz voided the deal.
Anderson's situation was even more troubling. Soon after he was traded for Damon Stoudamire, he steadfastly refused to play for Toronto. Rather than deal with the ramifications of a disgruntled player, the Raptors settled for the Celtics rookie Chauncey Billups instead.
Though the Raptors gained an improving forward in Gary Trent and another promising rookie in Alvin Williams from the Portland deal, Toronto General Manager Glen Grunwald essentially found himself taking Boston's unwanted baggage off his hands and giving up much more than the franchise could have had for Stoudamire, one of the most coveted players of the last two months.
Several well-documented tales of agents and players going into conniptions after they were informed of a potential trade led to the demise of several deals, including one in which Stoudamire was supposed to go to Orlando in a three-way deal that would have brought Anfernee Hardaway to the Nets.
"There were a lot of rumors out there, so we don't know what all was true," Granik said. "We'll take some time to digest what's happened before we make any recommendations."
 
Trade Talk
 Several of the key trades over the last 10 days invite additional comment:
*Rony Seikaly and Brian Evans to the Nets, and David Benoit, Kevin Edwards and Yinka Dare to the Magic. Comment: Nets add a bona-fide, if quirky, center to bolster playoff hopes, and rid themselves of two players who may not be in the league next year along with a small-time role player (Benoit).
*Jim Jackson and Clarence Weatherspoon to the Warriors, and Joe Smith and Brian Shaw to the 76ers. Comment: The Warriors freed more salary cap room by dealing for the free-agents-to-be Jackson and Weatherspoon, and they also got rid of two Latrell Sprewell loyalists. The 76ers didn't do too badly, either. They can find out if Smith is worth the commitment while dumping two players they were not going to invest in over the summer.
*Brent Barry to the Heat, and Isaac Austin, Charles Smith and a No. 1 draft pick to the Clippers. Comment: This is what the league's salary structure has come to: Pat Riley traded away Austin, a hard-as-nails player whom he helped mold into one of the league's top big men, for a pillowy-soft West Coast guy who can pass and shoot but does not do defense. The Clippers get a rebounding presence for at least three months, but not much more. With neither club wanting to lose solid role players for nothing, this was akin to two used-car salesmen trying to get rid of vehicles they knew were going to be repossessed by the bank. Welcome to the N.B.A., 1998.

HEADLINE: HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;
A Lot of Room to Grow

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: WORCESTER, Mass.

 BODY:
He drifts to sleep in a specially designed eight-foot bed, where his size 15 feet barely fit. To accommodate his 42-inch inseam, the material for his dress pants had to be purchased in France. Neal Fingleton is 7 feet 5 inches, weighs 270 pounds and is still growing. He is taller than all but two players in the National Basketball Association. He is only 17 years old.
The basketball players at Holy Name High School breezed through the six-and-a-half-foot doorway on the right side of the court here, dribbling and jabbering and doing what high school kids do before practice. The scene was routine, until Fingleton, the gigantic import from Durham, England, emerged. 
 A head of closely cropped light brown hair first appeared. Then the head lifted and the rest of Fingleton's 89-inch body followed; a sophomore in red shorts who is already being courted by colleges like Kentucky and North Carolina and being watched by the N.B.A. Initially, it is impossible not to gawk.
"It doesn't bother me to be this tall," Fingleton said. "I like to be different. "Like if everybody wears some kind of sportswear, I wouldn't wear it. Like this Tommy Hilfiger? Everyone wears it, so I never would. I like being different."
Besides, the XXXL Hilfiger long-sleeved shirt Fingleton tried on recently did not even stretch beyond his forearms.
Fingleton is a basketball Gulliver, as most opponents do not have a player within a foot of his size. Not surprisingly, there is already speculation about whether this still-developing giant will eventually bolt directly from high school to the N.B.A. He would get bounced around by a good Division I center right now, but he has two and a half years to get meaner, savvier and maybe even taller.
"I think Neal will play major college basketball," said J. P. Ricciardi, his coach.
"I think it's too early to say about the N.B.A. because he has so much room to get better. In the same sense, it wouldn't surprise me if a team said, 'We have the 28th pick in the draft, here's a 7-5 guy who's still getting better. Instead of taking Joe Blow from Wichita State, let's take a big kid we can work with.' "
The speculation confuses Fingleton, an innocent sort who averages 16 points, 12 rebounds and 8 blocked shots. Holy Name, which has an enrollment of only 200 boys, plays in the top division in Massachusetts and is rated as the third-best team in the central part of the state with a 15-5 record.
Fingleton knows he would have to make phenomenal progress to even dream of opposing David Robinson, one of his favorite players, by 2000.
"It would depend on how good I was," Fingleton said about turning pro. "I don't want to embarrass myself. I might want to go to college and get more experience. It would be an easier transition."
The transition to the United States has been smooth for Fingleton, who left behind his parents, an older brother, an older sister and a country that has sent only two players to the N.B.A., Steve Bucknall of the Lakers and John Amechi of the Cavaliers.
Fingleton became intrigued by the United States after Tony Hanson, a coach in England who was the second-highest career scorer at the University of Connecticut, helped send him to a summer camp at UConn. Steve Harrison, the father of one of Fingleton's teammates from England, persuaded his son, Neal, and Fingleton to leave home. Since both boys had attended the camp at UConn, they looked at schools in New England, and Holy Name stood out because it showed the most interest. But Neal Harrison changed his mind a week before the voyage was to begin. Neal Fingleton did not.
"Neal said that he wanted to go to America," Mike Fingleton, his father, said by telephone from England. "I've never gone against what my kids want to do. He loves basketball."
Fingleton talked about his move to a new country as casually as he ordered a meal of spare ribs and beef chow mein. This is a rare chance for him to improve his family's blue-collar life. His father, who is 6 feet, fixes conveyor belts for an electric company, and his mother, Christine, who is also 6 feet, is a nurse and a cook.
"I thought this would be better because in England the unemployment rate is very high," Fingleton said. "With my size, going for a job wouldn't work out."
Although Fingleton has played basketball for only three years, he is not clumsy. Fingleton, who is left-handed, was a talented soccer player until he grew from 6-3 to 7-1 between his 13th and 14th birthdays, so sprinting back and forth is not foreign to him. He runs. He does not lumber.
As would be expected, what Fingleton does best is dunk. If he gets the ball in the paint, he should score every time. But he makes Ricciardi cringe because he sometimes forgoes a shot from six feet to pass to a teammate.
Defensively, Fingleton rarely keeps his hands up throughout an entire possession. And he needs to be more adroit at positioning because his mere presence could force opponents to alter their shots.
"All the things he needs work on are correctable," Ricciardi noted. "He just hasn't played enough basketball."
Fingleton lives with a sports-crazed couple, who asked to remain anonymous, in an Italian section on the east side of Worcester. They attend his games, prepare his meals and participate in parent-teacher conferences.
When he first arrived in August, Fingleton got so many stares, he felt like a circus act. "You get some idiots," he said. "You get them everywhere."
Now the neighbors know Fingleton and offer him plates of lasagna. Soon, anyone with a fleeting knowledge of basketball will know about him. He plans to play every day until he graduates at 19, letting the college and pro teams drool over him. His basketball journey is just beginning.
"If he gets through the education, then maybe he can get accepted to the N.B.A., or whatever it is," said Mike Fingleton, Neal's father.
"There are thousands of kids in the States who want that, too. It's the best place for basketball. That's why he's over there."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: IN BAGHDAD;
CHIEF OF U.N. SEES GLIMMER OF HOPE IN BAGHDAD TALKS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Emerging from his first round of talks with Iraqi leaders in his last-ditch effort to find a solution to the standoff over United Nations weapons inspections, Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that he hoped to be able to return to New York next week with a written agreement.
"It's not easy," Mr. Annan said in an interview before a second round of talks between Iraqi and United Nations delegations this evening. "We still have a lot of work to do. But we had a good meeting." 
 He said that an appointment with President Saddam Hussein had not yet been arranged, but that he expected to see the Iraqi on Sunday.
Mr. Annan, interviewed at an opulent Government guest house on the banks of the Tigris River that President Hussein put at his disposal, seemed confident that he would get a substantive agreement that could avoid an attack on Iraq by the United States and its allies.
He said that any agreement would be taken back to the Security Council, but that the Council would not be able to rewrite it. He has said repeatedly in recent days that he has the Council's backing for this trip, and that this gives him enough flexibility to conclude an accord.
But United Nations officials said Mr. Annan was fully aware that he could run into strong criticism from the United States and Britain if he presents an agreement that seems to circumvent the authority of the United Nations or the Special Commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
 In Washington, President Clinton met for the second day in a row with his foreign policy aides to discuss diplomatic and military options, once Mr. Annan completes his trip. And the United States advised American citizens to leave Iraq as soon as possible. Page 10.
Mr. Annan said the Iraqis had been cooperative, especially with the team he sent here last week to map eight "presidential sites" as a basis for talks on how they could be inspected. Iraq has banned weapons inspectors from those sites. "We started well," he said. "That's why I say I'm rather optimistic."
Mr. Annan expects to remain in Baghdad until Monday for a day of talks on the program under which Iraq is allowed to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other essential items. On Friday the Security Council doubled the amount of oil Iraq can sell.
In his meetings today and in the official press, Mr. Annan was greeted with a barrage of complaints against the weapons commission.
An editorial in a Government-owned newspaper -- there is no free press in Iraq -- said Baghdad did not have a problem with inspections but only with the attitude of the Special Commission teams, which it said did not have an adequate regard for Iraqi sovereignty and dignity.
A number of United Nations officials based here who are not part of the inspection process say the inspectors, who are neither diplomats nor United Nations employees, have been abrasive in their dealings with Iraqis -- and sometimes in their relations with relief agency officials. The Iraqis are more broadly critical of the inspectors, accusing them of trying to intrude into Government areas where they have no right to be and of spying for the United States.
Officials of the weapons commission say the complaints have become more strident as the inspectors close in on suspect sites under the control of the President, his Special Republican Guard or other services.
Apart from his talks today with an Iraqi team led by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the Secretary General also met with the Russian Ambassador to Iraq, Nikolai Kartouzov; a special envoy from Russia, Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, and diplomats based in Iraq from more than a dozen countries.
He also met with Ambassador Yves Aubin of France. France and Russia have been most active in trying to help Iraq settle its problems with the Security Council. Both countries have substantial current or potential economic interests in Iraq.
Mr. Annan said he sensed that Iraq, which has opened the country to foreign news organizations in large numbers for the first time since the war in 1991, seemed to be eager to escape from its years of pariah status, which began with its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
"In a way, they have used this crisis to open up to the other Arab leaders," he said, adding that there were also contacts now between Iraq and even Iran. "Both Iraq and Iran are trying to break out of isolation," he said.
Iraq also needs the oil money that it has been denied since 1990. President Hussein has many large and expensive projects under construction in Iraq -- many of them opulent palaces -- and diplomats here are puzzled about how he can pay for them.

HEADLINE: Julian Bond Elected to Lead A Reorganizing N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Julian Bond, a long-time fighter for civil rights, was narrowly elected chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People yesterday evening. In the second round of balloting, Mr. Bond defeated Joe Madison, a Maryland radio host, by a vote of 29 to 24, with one abstention.
"I thought I could serve and offered myself," Mr. Bond told the organization's annual meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. "It's kind of crazy to say I earned it, but in this business you have to earn your credibility every day." 
 Mr. Bond, who served for 21 years in the Georgia legislature and now teaches history at American University in Washington and the University of Virginia, vowed to continue the campaign of his predecessor, Myrlie Evers-Williams, to rebuild an organization that three years ago was torn by scandal and financial chaos.
"We're on our way to financial health and integrity," he said. "The challenge is continuing that. It is a daunting challenge."
Mr. Bond said that there is "a very rigid division" between his role of chairman, a voluntary position, and that of the president and chief executive officer, Kweisi Mfume. He said that the chairman, who must be re-elected each year, "establishes policy in a fairly general way," while the president carries it out on a sustained basis.
The nation's oldest civil rights group is aware that it must keep up with an ever-changing American society and wants to be much more inclusive in discussions involving civil rights. "Colored people come in all colors and we want very much to reach out to all of these emerging minorities in America," Mr. Bond said.
At the organization's nadir three years ago, the two men in the organization's top posts were discredited. Benjamin L. Chavis Jr. was dismissed as executive director in 1994 for using the organization's money to pay an out-of-court settlement to forestall a sexual harassment suit. William L. Gibson Jr. was ousted as board chairman in the wake of charges of financial improprieties in 1995.
Ms. Evers-Williams, widow of Medgar Evers, the assassinated civil rights leader, led the climb back. "When I greeted you as chairman in 1995, the future of the then 85-year-old N.A.A.C.P. was almost nonexistent," she said in a speech. "The once pristine reputation was tarnished by scandal, burdened and weakened by disengaged leadership."
Since then, the organization has gone from a $5 million deficit to a surplus of more than $2 million. Mr. Mfume, a former Baltimore congressman, was named president and chief executive officer in 1996, a new and expanded title, and given greater responsibilities. The organization strived to become a more active voice in issues ranging from defending affirmative action to battling police brutality to expanding economic opportunities for minorities.
Mr. Mfume cited the efforts that have been made to increase management employment and contracting opportunities for minorities in the hotel industry last year. This year, he said, the same approach will be used on the telecommunications industry. "This is the next frontier of a larger civil rights movement," he said.
Ms. Evers-Williams said she decided not to seek re-election to set up the Medgar Evers Institute to fight for civil rights and write a book, among other things.
Mr. Bond's succeeds Ms. Evers-Williams after a lifetime of fighting for civil rights. As a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, he was a founder of a student organization that helped win integration of theaters, lunch counters and parks. He was arrested for sitting in at the then-segregated cafeteria in Atlanta's City Hall.
In 1960, he helped found the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, and became the group's communications director.
In 1986, he lost a bitterly fought Georgia Congressional primary to John Lewis, himself a legendary civil rights leader.
Although the organization's leaders spoke of goals in fairly broad terms, some delegates voiced a desire to get back to more active programs and to restore positions cut during the climb back to financial health. The staff that makes and carries out policy was cut from 120 at the end of 1994 to 47, and has now climbed back to 65, said Leon W. Russell, one of the four losers to Mr. Bond. "We need to get programming back in line," he said.

HEADLINE: Lost Hopes of the Arabs

BYLINE: By Ira M. Lapidus; Ira M. Lapidus's most recent book is "A History of Islamic Societies."

 BODY:

THE DREAM PALACE OF THE ARABS
 A Generation's Odyssey.
 By Fouad Ajami.
 344 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $26. 
 In this bold, imaginative and sure-to-be-controversial book, Fouad Ajami tells how Arab writers and intellectuals have neither accommodated to reality nor created the world they need. Ajami himself comes from a Shiite village in southern Lebanon, which he left for Beirut and a new life combining Arab nationalism and American pop culture. In 1963 he arrived in the United States, where he has become a noted scholar and a voice for secular, liberal and cosmopolitan values.
From this vantage point, he gives a vivid and often moving account of Arab thought today against the background of the lost era of progressive pan-Arab nationalism and high hopes. Since the defeat of the Arab states by Israel in 1967, that dream has collapsed into dictatorships, wars, communal hatreds, sectarian religious violence and a fixation upon the futile conflict with Israel. Hope has turned into disillusionment and despair. In "The Dream Palace of the Arabs" Ajami speaks openly of painful truths that many Arab intellectuals would rather keep within the family.
The first chapter of the book is a long elegy on the fate of Lebanon, memorialized through the lives of important, but defeated, intellectuals. Ajami does not go into the events of the civil war, but devotes much of the chapter to the suicide of Khalil Hawi, a renowned Lebanese poet, at the moment of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Hawi was born into a poor Eastern Orthodox village family. He moved to Beirut as a boy to do construction work, saved enough money to enter the American University of Beirut and eventually became a professor there, as well as a greatly esteemed Arab poet. Like many other upwardly mobile Lebanese youngsters, he was a follower of Anton Saadah's fascistic Greater Syria movement, and then of the pan-Arab movement led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Hawi and other Arab intellectuals were fascinated with the great men -- Saadah, Nasser and, later, Saddam Hussein -- who promised the fulfillment of the Arab political dream though violence. They put collective political redemption before civic and liberal values.
Parochial young men like Hawi, Ajami says, needed larger identities to transcend their local origins. But there would be no Greater Syria, no Arabdom, not even a Lebanon to receive Hawi. Never married, never comfortable as a village man in his upper-class American University environment, he became embittered by a sense of guilt and inadequacy after the defeat of the movements he had supported. The Israeli invasion was the last measure of his personal and public shame. He had left home, it had turned out, for nowhere.
Shifting to the Arab states of the Fertile Crescent, Ajami reviews the events of the recent decades, combining political commentary with discussion of Arab thought. He emphasizes a much neglected motif of the 1970's and 80's -- the rise of Shiism in opposition to the Arab nationalist ideologies. For many Shiites, pan-Arabism was identified with inequality, the propertied classes and Sunni dominance. The revolution in Iran encouraged the Shiite underclasses throughout the Arab world to rise against their overlords. Ajami sees the Iran-Iraq war essentially as a struggle to counter the rise of Shiite influence in Iraq, Lebanon, the Persian Gulf and the Arabian peninsula. But Shiite messianism also failed to change regional politics. Family regimes in Arabia and military dictatorships in the Fertile Crescent remain in power. Opposition is fragmented, and the aspirations of ordinary people have been defeated by the oligarchs. The intellectuals have strong words but no vision of a better future.
Ajami looks at this lost opportunity through the eyes of the famous poet Adonis. Born Ali Ahmad Said to a Syrian Shiite family, he came to Beirut in 1956 and adopted the name Adonis to suggest the pagan cult of fertility and resurrection. Sympathetic to the lower-class Shiite movements and prepared to make gestures of reconciliation to Israel, Adonis earned the suspicions of pan-Arab and Palestinian intellectuals. In 1986 he left Beirut for Paris and died in exile.
Ajami's deepest disappointment is with Egypt, and his chapter on that country, replete with recent interviews with Egyptian intellectuals, is among the most interesting in the book. Egypt had the most sophisticated literary and cultural resources in the region, and was for decades the pathbreaker for Arabs everywhere. Now it seems to be embarked on what Ajami calls a "Sisyphean quest for modernity and national power." Constitutionalism, liberalism and dictatorship; capitalism, socialism and capitalism again; pan-Arabism and Islamist movements -- everything has been tried. Nothing has worked.
Egypt is now riven between a Western and an Islamic orientation. The Government is at war with the militant Islamists, the Gamaat Islamiyya, and in its defense of order it has centralized power, warding off both the demands of the middle classes for political participation and the emergence of a broadly based, popular regime. The violent Islamist groups, despite their assaults on the Government, on foreigners and on the Copts, have not been able to mobilize the Egyptian masses. However dangerous, they remain sectarian and marginalized.
At the same time, to retain its legitimacy the Government permits and promotes an Islamic cultural revival through the media and in the schools: Egyptian culture is being Islamized from within. Ajami celebrates the few voices who defend secularism, the rights of the Coptic population against Muslim extremists and the pluralistic, many-layered cultural identity of Egypt. Among them is Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid, a theologian dedicated to the rational and philosophic interpretation of religion. But he too has been forced into exile.
The struggle between the state and the Islamists in Egypt is vividly described, but in this case Ajami does not let the opposing point of view speak for itself. This is unfortunate. Even though some Islamist groups represent little more than brutal terrorism, there are also thoughtful and humane people trying to reconstruct their societies on a religious and traditional basis rather than a modern one. Their claims to represent a moral and communal alternative to the barren, materialistic individualism of the West are winning a substantial following, especially among students and the middle classes. Any serious reconstruction of Arab identity and of Middle Eastern states now has to take Islam into account, even if the failure of many religious leaders to condemn terrorism remains a barrier to serious dialogue.
The Palestinian case, which is the subject of the final chapter, carries much of the book's burden. While Yasir Arafat, Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan, the politicians, have backed peace with Israel, the intellectuals, with some noteworthy exceptions, have opposed it. For example, in Egypt the confident, cosmopolitan intellects of the older generation -- Tawfic al-Hakim and Naguib Mahfouz among others -- saw that reconciliation with Israel was essential to free the Arabs for their own development. But the younger generation, powerless and resentful, fears a peace in which Israel may become a dominant economic and cultural power.
Among the Palestinians themselves, invented memory is the enemy of the real world. The story of dispossession from the land is, after all, the basis of Palestinian identity, and around that story a vast edifice of memory -- the charm of the houses, the villages and the olive groves of yesteryear, all now lost, all now unbearably inhabited by the enemy -- is being cultivated. Nothing in the real world can match this nostalgia for the return to home and the bitterness against enemies that it engenders. With sad detachment Ajami notes that Arab writers, with few exceptions, do not explore the possibilities of peace.
We should be wary, though, of looking upon all this as simply an Arab problem. In Israel too there is a rising tide of nationalist fervor, religious messianism and political intransigence. In many other nations and regions, racism, ethnic self-centeredness and religious sectarianism are leading to violence and preventing the formation of more inclusive societies. Everywhere in our interconnected world we are suffering from unreal hopes and parochial loyalties. Dream palaces are not just a danger for the Arabs. More and more, they seem to be a danger for all of us.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
A TV Generation Is Seeing Beyond Color

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

 BODY:
IT'S NOT HARD to figure out why, come Mondays at 9 P.M., Anna-Lucille Calabrese can be found parked in front of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." Like Buffy, the heroine of the hip hourlong drama on WB about a girl who reluctantly takes on the task of ridding her high school of an infestation of the undead, Anna-Lucille, 13, is bright, popular and tinged with teen-age irony.
Also like Buffy, whose milieu is the lush environs of Southern California, Anna-Lucille lives in a wealthy suburb -- in her case, Montclair, N.J. Her father, a publishing executive, drives a fast black Porsche sports coupe. 
 "She's smart and in control," says Anna-Lucille of Buffy, whose blond hair and Ivory Girl looks are part of the joke.
But Anna-Lucille is hardly the neat little demographic package that television executives wish for. In fact, during the hour before "Buffy," she does something that not only skews the precarious economics of the multibillion-dollar entertainment industry but also adds a wrinkle to the national debate on race: she flips the channel to watch "Martin" reruns and "In the House," shows with entirely black casts, on UPN.
Like a growing number of young white television viewers across the country, Anna-Lucille crosses the color line daily and barely notices. She and her peers seem not to care much about race, at least when it comes to the small screen. "They're funny, too," she says of the shows she watches. "They're crazy, but they're funny."
The crossover trend among young television viewers is remarkable because it directly contradicts the habits of older Americans. In fact, over all, there is astonishingly little overlap between the most-watched shows among blacks and those among whites.
"E.R." is No. 1 among whites but 18th with blacks. "Seinfeld," a close No. 2 with whites, is an astonishing 54th among black viewers. "Between Brothers" is the most popular show among blacks, but it ranks 107th among whites. In fact, not a single show is in both the top 10 for blacks and the top 10 for whites. Only 4 shows appear on both racial groups' top 20 lists; the one with the highest ratings is "Monday Night Football." Not one is a comedy.
"Blacks generally watch black shows, and whites generally watch white shows," says Dean Valentine, a former Disney executive who became president of UPN last November. "It's a reflection of how fragmented our society has become."
Children, however, increasingly seem to be bucking the trend. "Kids are much more color-blind than adults in their television viewing," says Douglas Alligood, who has for the last decade tracked such trends for BBDO, the advertising agency. "And they're becoming more so. They make decisions based on the context of the show, not simply the racial content."
Laura Herrold, a white 11-year-old from Ridgewood, N.J., who watches "Sister, Sister" and "The Smart Guy," as well as "Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch," agrees. "My friends and I don't even talk about whether the people on the shows are black or white," she says. "We watch those shows because they're about people our age."
It's easy to see this news as the harbinger of a new age of racial harmony, led by the youth of America. On one level, the trends mean that young people are more accepting of diversity than their parents. But while some questions that the crossover brings to mind are sanguine, others may not be.
When today's teen-agers grow into adults, will they continue this tolerance of diversity and pass it along to their children? Or will they, as their parents did, switch to "segregated" television. Are the series watched by white teen-agers the best possible reflections of black culture they can find? And will the young networks that present most of the black series continue to do so, once they've established themselves?
The racial chasm in television viewing is relatively new. That's because until the last several years there weren't enough shows with black casts to fragment the audience. "Growing up, television was a white medium entirely," says Samm-Art Williams, a black playwright who has written for series like "Martin" and "Good News." "We came of age watching 'Father Knows Best' and 'The Donna Reed Show.' Everyone did." But Fox, WB and UPN have changed that. With NBC, CBS and ABC programming shows with largely all-white casts aimed at a wide swath of middle America, the three upstart networks, each of which has its biggest affiliates in major urban areas, have in the last few years developed more than a dozen sitcoms with all-black core casts.
The result is a slew of new black media images, ranging from warm and fuzzy dads like Robert Townsend on "The Parent Hood" to the feisty 20-something roommates on "Living Single" (which was recently canceled after four and a half seasons).
But such shows have also polarized America's viewing habits, underscoring the depth of the nation's ambivalence about race and identity. Television dramas like "E.R.," "N.Y.P.D. Blue" and "Chicago Hope" have gracefully integrated their casts (if not, by and large, their audiences). But the races rarely mix on sitcoms. While a few black shows have white minor characters and some of the white shows trot out an occasional black person, prime-time comedy is one of the last bastions of public segregation.
The major networks insist that that's how people, especially older white people, like it. As white viewers get older, the number of them watching sitcoms about black people dwindles to a virtual handful, according to the ratings. Oddly enough, older black people start watching shows that are predominantly white.
"The figures are very stark," says Karen Kratz of A. C. Nielsen, the rating service.
The sole exception to this racial parting has been Bill Cosby, whose audience throughout the years has attracted both blacks and whites. "The Cosby Show," which ran from 1984 till 1992, on NBC was No. 1 in both black and white households. "He is an aberration," says Mr. Alligood. "Cosby," Mr. Cosby's current show on CBS, is 15th in black households and 27th in white households.
Even the immensely appealing Will Smith, who starred for five seasons on NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," was not truly a crossover success. His show, at its height in 1993, was No. 1 among black viewers but never rose above No. 36 with whites.
But if the viewing habits of the current crop of young people are any indication, America is slowly becoming less race-conscious. This season, the white teen-age viewership of several youth-oriented black-skewed shows rose significantly. "Sister, Sister" had a 42 percent increase in white viewers last year. "The Wayans Brothers" showed a 27 percent rise in its white audience. "Moesha" (starring the pop star Brandy as the girl next door), "Hanging With Mr. Cooper" and "The Smart Guy" saw smaller percentage gains in white viewership.
Although the numbers are still relatively small, industry insiders who have experienced firsthand Hollywood's uncomfortable and often clumsy relationship with race are encouraged.
"This is an extraordinary phenomenon," says Stan Latham, a black director who has worked on virtually every black sitcom from "Cosby" to "The Steve Harvey Show." "I know it sounds excessive, but I really think this could be the salvation of American culture."
Sociologists say there are several reasons that more white teen-agers are watching black sitcoms. To begin with, the shows are there; nearly half of the youth-oriented sitcoms are now made up of largely black casts. In addition, they say, young people of both races are less conscious of color overall and more accepting of diversity. (Indeed, some white teen-age shows -- "Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Clueless" -- have attracted big followings among black teen-agers.)
Finally, elements of black street culture have become popular among young whites. For nearly a decade, hip-hop music has outsold rock among white teen-agers, and the clothing esthetic that accompanied it -- baggy pants, oversize polos with huge logos, expensive sneakers -- long ago infiltrated even small-town America.
Notably, it was white viewers who made "Yo! MTV Raps," now the channel's most popular show, a hit in the early 1990's. Before then, MTV had largely ignored rap videos.
"The inner cities weren't even wired for cable when the show took off," says J. Fred McDonald, a University of Northeastern Illinois sociologist and author of "One Nation Under Television: The Rise and Decline of Network TV." "It was white kids who showed the music executives that they would buy that sound."
These days, rappers are far from the only black entertainers on television. "There is an amazing number of diverse black images available on television these days, from Janet Jackson to Samuel Jackson to Coolio to the dramatizations of the Tuskegee experiment," says Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California's school of cinema studies and author of "Am I Black Enough for You? Pop Culture From the Hood and Beyond." "That's the sort of environment that kids -- black and white -- grow up with now. It's no wonder white kids have no problem enjoying black sitcoms."
But the negative side to such a crossover is that it further institutionalizes mediocre programming.
"The problem is that most of these sitcoms with all-black casts are less than spectacular," says Mr. Boyd, echoing a comment often heard in program development circles in Hollywood. Even the network executives who present them agree that virtually none of these shows are in the league of sophisticated, and all-white, sitcoms like "Seinfeld," "Frasier" or "Friends." Most episodes of "The Wayans Brothers," on the WB, for example, are little more than 22-minute showdowns to prove which of the lead characters is the bigger muttonhead. "We know the overall quality of these shows is pretty bad, and we aren't happy with many of them," says Mr. Valentine of UPN.
There is widespread ambivalence about such shows among leaders of black organizations. In February 1997, the Hollywood and Beverly Hills chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. issued a statement condemning shows like "Martin" for promoting derogatory stereotypes. And yet just months before, the organization's national board had awarded the show's star, Martin Lawrence, its coveted Image Award. "Martin," canceled last spring after five seasons, was among the most popular series with young white viewers.
Mr. Boyd and others worry that white teen-agers who live in all-white neighborhoods may use the shows as their only reference point in their perceptions of blacks. "These shows could actually impair their understanding of the depth and breadth of black culture," he says.
BUT SOME writers, including Mr. Williams, take issue with those who believe it is a comedy writer's responsibility to "uplift the race."
"I think black folks need to stop taking themselves so seriously," says Mr. Williams. "It's my job as a sitcom writer to tell jokes, to have fun. If you're going to cure ills, go to the theater."
Ed. Weinberger, who wrote for "Cheers" and "Taxi" and more recently created "Sparks," a sitcom about a black law firm, for UPN, says his two sons, ages 10 and 13, love some of the black comedies because the humor is broader and faster moving. But not all pass muster.
"My kids like 'Jamie Foxx' and 'Martin,' " Mr. Weinberger says. "They don't like the quiet comedy of 'The Parent Hood' or 'The Gregory Hines Show.' The thing that sells them isn't race; it's the nature of the comedy. They like it fast and stupid."
Quiet, fast or in-between, the era of black sitcoms is ebbing. Despite the influx of new young white viewers, the tenuous economics of running a network are leading some executives to rethink the strategy of catering to urban audiences. "Our advertisers are totally conscious that we be very crossover," says Mr. Ancier. "The message is, if you don't make shows that appeal to white audiences, you fail."
That message was borne out last year. Fox, once a bastion of bawdy black comedy, has nearly completed its transformation to a whiter shade of pale. Added to its successes with "The Simpsons" and "The X-Files," its current home run is "Ally McBeal," a quirky hourlong drama about a white female lawyer in her 20's. The WB's ratings gains this year outstripped any of the six networks, but it wasn't the channel's black sitcoms that made the difference; the gains were made largely on the strength of "Buffy" and "Seventh Heaven," a pious drama about a white minister and his large family. And late in the season Mr. Ancier persuaded the creators of "Moesha" to transfer the main character to a nearly all-white private school. The move was intended to increase the number of white viewers who tune in.
One popular strategy is to concentrate on multi-ethnic shows, integrating the casts in order to hold onto the core black audience while attracting new white viewers. Winifred Hervey, a black sitcom writer who is a veteran of "The Golden Girls" and the creator of "The Steve Harvey Show," says she is frustrated by the new emphasis on the multiracial. "A good show doesn't come from someone saying, 'O.K., we want you to write a crossover drama.' The really worthwhile shows spring from a story you want to tell, not from demographics."
But Mr. Valentine says he is determined to satisfy both his advertisers and his audience by "breaking down the ghetto."
"People get really upset about segregation in society, so what I'm unclear about is why they think it's all right on TV," he explains. "We have to bring in a lot of people of all ages and races."
To Edwin Kaplan, a precocious 11-year-old from Montclair, that sounds just fine. "I like shows because they make me laugh," he says. "I don't care if they're about black people like 'Family Matters,' white people like 'Full House' or a family with black and white kids together. After all, the problems always get resolved in 30 minutes. What's the difference?"

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Has Vanguard Windsor's Shine Begun to Fade?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
TWO years after he took the helm of the mighty Vanguard Windsor fund, Charles Freeman has hit some choppy waters.
The fund, whose $21 billion in assets makes it the second-largest of Vanguard's non-index funds, lost 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter -- the first quarterly loss since Mr. Freeman took over as manager at the end of 1995. In 1998, the fund has gained about 4 percent, through Thursday, a better performance but still behind the average for its peer group. 
 Like so many other funds that lost money in the fourth quarter of last year, Windsor had trouble navigating the shoals of Asia, whose economic turbulence swamped the share prices of many American companies that do business there.
Hit particularly hard were the stocks of large, cyclical companies that the Windsor fund has long favored, including makers of basic materials like aluminum, paper and chemicals.
For now, investors in the fund, which has been closed to new investors since 1989, have little cause to fret. But they would be wise to watch carefully to see which direction Mr. Freeman aims to take the fund from here.
The investment style favored by Windsor was honed by John Neff, the famed manager who piloted Windsor for 34 years. Both Mr. Neff and Mr. Freeman work for the Wellington Management Company, a Boston-based asset manager hired by Vanguard to oversee some of its funds.
Wellington's managers like to buy big stakes in companies whose share prices have been beaten down but whose fundamental outlooks remain good, and then hold onto them for a very long time.
Mr. Freeman has largely stuck to that style, but in the most recent quarter he has slashed some of the fund's larger and more longstanding positions in stocks of cyclical companies. In fact, those positions were largely responsible for the downturn in performance last quarter, said Jeff Molitor, director of portfolio oversight at Vanguard. (Mr. Freeman declined to be interviewed last week.) Mr. Molitor said that about one-quarter of the fund's assets were invested in cyclical companies in October, when the Asian weakness hit.
"The portfolio really got hit the hardest near the end of October, and the cyclical stocks did not bounce back to the same extent that the market did," Mr. Molitor said. "The cyclical stocks were down 10 percent to 12 percent on average. In a market that is up 3 percent, that's a big gap in performance."
But not all of the fund's weakness came from Asia, said Daniel P. Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter based in Potomac, Md. Shares of Seagate Technology, the maker of data storage systems, fell 44 percent in the fourth quarter after the company warned of slowing sales.
As the owner of 16.7 million shares of Seagate, the Windsor fund was one of the company's largest shareholders. The fund still owns most of those shares, but it sold its holdings of several other companies, many of them cyclicals, in the fourth quarter of last year.
For example, Mr. Freeman sold all of the fund's 12.6 million shares of USX-Marathon Group, the oil and natural gas company, and all of its 1.3 million class B shares of Continental Airlines.
He has not abandoned the cyclical stocks altogether. In place of the recently sold holdings, Mr. Freeman established large positions in Lafarge, a maker of cement and building materials, and EEX, an oil and gas producer.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 1998, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the recent performance of the Vanguard Windsor fund referred incorrectly to the fund's holdings of cyclical stocks, reflecting filings by the Vanguard Group with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund still owns 12.7 million shares of USX-Marathon Group, about even with its holdings at the end of October, and 261,000 shares of Continental Airlines class B, down from 1.3 million shares at the end of October; it did not sell all of its shares of either stock in the fourth quarter. Charles Freeman, the fund's manager, said last week that the fund has maintained its weightings in cyclical stocks since the end of October at about 45 percent of its assets.

HEADLINE: Calling Infertility a Disease, Couples Battle With Insurers

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
Roberta Kraft is $38,700 in debt. She owes money on her Visa card. She owes money on her American Express card. She owes money to her parents and to her best friend from college. She and her husband have not bought new clothes in two years and live in a cramped one-bedroom apartment because they have spent all their discretionary income -- and a good chunk of their future earnings -- in a single pursuit: trying to have a baby.
In her still unsuccessful quest, Ms. Kraft has economized in ways she never imagined. She bought fertility drugs from a pharmacy in Mexico because they were cheaper than those sold in her Upper East Side neighborhood. She withdrew money from a retirement account, paying steep penalties. She sold a pair of diamond earrings she had inherited from her grandmother, tearfully rationalizing that her grandmother would have given her blessing. 
 Ms. Kraft has gone to such lengths because her insurance company will finance few of the procedures she needs to become pregnant. And so, in addition to the emotional ordeal that they face, she and her husband are also struggling with a severe financial crisis.
This crisis is striking a growing number of couples as scientists develop new treatments to combat physical problems that prevent pregnancy -- treatments that few insurers are willing to cover and that few couples can easily afford.
To patients like Ms. Kraft -- who would speak only if her maiden name was used and her husband was not identified -- and the doctors who treat them, such refusals by insurance companies amount to discrimination. Infertility, they say, is a disease, like diabetes or emphysema, whose treatment should be covered by any basic insurance policy. When it is not, they argue, patients go without crucial medical care that could lead to pregnancy, or they pay enormous expenses on their own or get inappropriate care simply because it is treatment their insurance companies will pay for.
But others question whether the inability to become a biological parent is a medical condition or a social problem. And they ask whether society can, or should, pay for costly treatments that benefit a narrow group of people when growing numbers of others lack insurance for even basic health care.
"The debate comes down to this," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health-care economist at Princeton University, "Is having your own offspring with your own genes a matter of human right? And if you can't accomplish that on your own, do you have the right to have your efforts to achieve it financed?"
The issue came to the fore last month, when Aetna, one of the nation's biggest health insurers, announced that its U.S. Healthcare health plans would no longer offer coverage for advanced infertility treatments. Company officials said that because few other health plans offered such benefits in their basic packages, women with fertility problems had been disproportionately joining U.S. Healthcare plans, saddling the company with an unfair share of costs for infertility treatments.
 
Some States Require A Degree of Coverage
Thirteen states, including New York and Connecticut, require health plans to offer some coverage of infertility treatments. Two states, Massachusetts and Illinois, mandate that in vitro fertilizations be included.
But these regulations do not cover many workers because many businesses -- those that insure themselves under provisions of a 1978 Federal law -- are exempt from state jurisdiction. This applies to many more people than one might imagine, since many large companies self-insure and use a commercial carrier to administer the plan.
Several recent studies have found that it would cost less than $3 per member per year if coverage was mandated for advanced reproductive technology -- procedures that manipulate the union of sperm and egg.
In vitro fertilization, in which eggs are combined with sperm in a laboratory dish and the fertilized embryo is implanted in the woman's uterus, is the most common of these procedures. The procedure costs about $8,000 for each attempt, and most couples try several times before they succeed.
About 6.1 million women in the United States, or 10 percent of the women of reproductive age, are infertile, according to the most recent figures from the Federal Government's National Center for Health Statistics. Of these, about 600,000 have tried assisted reproductive technology in their attempt to bear children.
"I hate talking about money in relation to my kids," said Pamela Madsen, whose two sons were conceived through in vitro fertilization, "but by mother always jokes that she holds the mortgage on them."
 Ms. Madsen's experiences in what she calls the "ovarian Olympics" led her to become president of the New York chapter of Resolve, a support group for people with infertility problems.
 Lacking comprehensive insurance to finance many of these procedures, couples with fertility problems describe a web of efforts to pay for the medications and therapies they need to try to have a child.
The first step usually involves exhausting their savings. The next step is signing up for a host of credit cards and charging up to their credit limit. If they can, they usually then borrow from relatives or friends.
"We don't go to the movies, haven't taken a vacation in so long, and I can't remember the last time I bought new clothes," said Elizabeth Prike, a high school teacher from Woodside, Queens. Her 4-month-old son, Thomas, was born after she took fertility drugs and was artificially inseminated with sperm from her husband, Stephen, a production manager at a box-making plant.
Mrs. Prike's insurance company paid for her drugs, but did not cover any office visits, blood tests, sperm treatments or the insemination itself, leaving the couple more than $10,000 in debt to Brooklyn I.V.F., an infertility clinic. To help pay the collection agency handling their account, Mrs. Prike said, she went back to work sooner than she had hoped.
"I just felt cheated by my insurance company," said Mrs. Prike, who tried to get pregnant for seven years. "I paid into the plan and then my disease isn't covered. That's just not fair."
George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston University's School of Public Health, disagrees. "Not having these treatments covered is unfortunate, but it is not unfair," said Mr. Annas, arguing that assisted reproductive technology is an elective procedure, not a necessity.
"In fact, people don't have the right to any health care in this country except emergency care," he noted, adding that if the country had national health insurance, "then we should think about adding this as a benefit."
"Not that people shouldn't have access to these procedures," he added. "If you want them, though, you have to figure out how to pay for them. If an insurance company offers it, also fine. But to mandate it, given the growing numbers of uninsured people, makes no legal, economic or health care sense."
 
Medical Decisions Based on the Program
Doctors across the country say the way the system tends to work now, many women end up pursuing inappropriate, often expensive, treatments that are unlikely to solve their fertility problems because certain procedures are covered by insurance on the theory that they are designed to correct a physical problem rather than to address infertility -- a point that several insurance officials conceded privately was economically irrational.
The most common example cited is surgery to clear blockages in the fallopian tubes. Such surgery, which is highly invasive and requires anesthesia, usually costs about $12,000. Sometimes, it is enough to allow once-infertile women to conceive on their own. Often, women undergo the procedure several times, to no avail, each vain attempt covered by insurance.
Many reproductive specialists argue that given the option, they would often forgo the surgery and perform in vitro fertilization, which they believe in many circumstances has a greater chance of producing a pregnancy. But since most insurance plans don't cover such assisted technology, many patients who cannot afford to pay out of pocket undergo repeated tubal surgeries, hoping they will beat the odds.
"People make terrible medical decisions because of their insurance coverage," said Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, professor emeritus of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School and chairman of the ethics committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. "The system as it exists makes no sense."
 After two surgeries to clear blocked tubes failed to help Anette D'Orlando become pregnant, her doctor urged her to try in vitro fertilization. Mrs. D'Orlando and her husband, pat, were relieved when the nurse told them that their insurance company had verified that the procedure would be covered.
 Mrs. D'Orlando began a painful drug regimen to stimulate her ovaries to produce extra eggs. But a day before the doctor was set to harvest the eggs, the insurance company rejected the claim for payment. Franctic, the D'Orlandos paid for the procedure partly in cash and charged $5,000 on their Visa card.
 Mrs. D'Orlando is now pregnant and the couple is fighting with the insurer.
 "They paid for these operations that didn't work and not for the one that did," said Mr. D'Orlando, "and now I'm starting a family with a big debt handing over me."

Crossing the Border For Bargain Drugs
To save money, some people resort to measures that can be dangerous. Many women buy drugs from overseas pharmacies. Others, alerted through word of mouth or postings on the Internet, buy or get drugs from other women who have leftovers from their own prescriptions -- a prevalent practice that is illegal and, doctors warn, potentially dangerous since there is no guarantee that the medications are not expired or that they actually are what they purport to be.
Theresa Grant drove 50 miles from her home in Tucson, Ariz., to the Mexican town of Nogales, where she bought the drugs she needed for her treatments for one quarter to one sixth the price at her local pharmacy.
"I saved thousands of dollars," said Ms. Grant, who runs a family restaurant and is a co-founder of the International Council on Infertility Information Dissemination, an information and advocacy group for people with fertility problems.
But Ms. Grant said that she would not have taken the risk had her doctor not recommended the specific pharmacy that she went to.
From her home in Monsey, N.Y., Chedva, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, runs a kind of drug cooperative for needy, infertile women from the local Orthodox Jewish community.
"People call in saying, 'I have extra Pergonal that maybe someone else can use,' and other people call saying, 'Maybe you have some Pergonal because I can't afford my prescription,' " said Chedva, who spoke as she worked on an art project with her 5-year-old son, conceived after 13 years of infertility treatments. "We bring them together."
She acknowledged the illegality and dangers, but said women in this situation really have no choice, and she said she is very cautious about the donated drugs she accepts.
For her own drugs, she said, she sent her prescription to relatives in Israel, who filled it for a third of the cost locally. To defray other treatment costs not covered by insurance, she took an interest-free loan from a local charitable organization, one of many set up by Jewish communities around the country to help childless Jewish couples pay for infertility procedures.
"We are drowning in more and more debt, every month more," said Chedva, who estimated that she and her husband, a Talmudic scholar, owe about $40,000 to friends, relatives and the community fund. She said they are trying to put together enough money to try to conceive another child.
Dr. Richard Grazzi, a fertility specialist who runs Brooklyn I.V.F., said it was painful to him, as a practitioner, to see how often money issues intrude between him and what he thinks is the best treatment for his patients.
At first, he was lax in making sure that uninsured patients had the means to pay the clinic for treatment. But mounting debt forced them to be stricter with payments.
To help patients who cannot afford care, his office has worked with a local branch of Citibank to arrange for "infertility loans." The program was started by a bank officer who was a patient in the clinic.
"Nobody who hasn't experienced infertility can understand what these couples go through," Dr. Grazzi said. "It's a medical crisis, a personal crisis, a sexual crisis, religious, existential and marital crisis," he said. "When you throw financial stress on top of that, it's just a setup for disaster."

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Silicon Valley, 'Digital Coast' Emerges

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
No true booster of Silicon Valley or its New York wannabe, Silicon Alley, would dispute the benefits of a catchy moniker for raising a region's high-technology profile and attracting coveted talent and venture capital.
But Los Angeles Mayor Richard J. Riordan's announcement last week that this city would henceforth be known as "Digital Coast" elicited little more than snickers and derision from its geographic rivals. 
 "Already people are talking about 'Digital Toast,' " sniffed Mark Stahlman, a co-founder of the New York New Media Association and the man who coined the derivative Silicon Alley label to describe the cluster of Internet companies in lower Manhattan.
A spokesman for Joint Venture Silicon Valley, an economic development group in San Jose, Calif., was more magnanimous, noting, "At least they stayed away from 'silicon,' since there is only one Silicon Valley, and everyone has already tried to do a takeoff."
It was precisely such dismissals of Los Angeles as a cyberlightweight that compelled a group of entrepreneurs to throw themselves a naming ceremony last week. The considerable talent pools of aerospace and entertainment industry workers here have spawned many new-media companies in recent years, but free association probably still conjures O. J. Simpson and star maps in the minds of most people more quickly than it evokes, say, cutting-edge Web site design.
So, with the Mayor's support, members of the high-technology industry here formed a committee to put itself on the map, as it were. The Digital Coast designation was selected from a list of hundreds of suggestions over the last several months. A first choice, "Tech Coast," was abandoned because of a trademark dispute.
"I'm glad we didn't go with 'Silicon Sandbox,' " confided Nick Rothenberg, chief executive of US Web/ W3-designs, "because I'm not sure business people could have carried it around and used it in quite the same way."
Kevin Wall, chief executive of a software company, Box Top Interactive, and chairman of the naming committee, said: "We're living in the shadow of Hollywood. We want to be recognized, and for that we need a collective identity."
Or as another executive attending the festivities put it, "We're not going to let ourselves be defined by the outside anymore."
Indeed, this being a town proficient in image making, Digital Coast is not meant to be merely a name but a "brand," complete with a marketing plan for "signage and banners," according to the Mayor's news release.
If this self-baptism seems a bit forced, it is far from the first time a locale has draped itself in techno-chic associations. One Web site (http://www.tbtf.com/siliconia.html) lists 45 instances of "siliconia" associated with 55 locations, including North Carolina's Silicon Triangle, the Silicon Fen in Cambridge, England, and even the Silicon Swamp of Perry, Fla., on the Gulf of Mexico.
But the big rivals remain New York, Southern California and Silicon Valley. And while much of the rivalry appears to be tongue in cheek, thousands of jobs are at stake in any economic engine created by companies converging and multiplying to create a new industry.
So far, the original Valley has far outstripped its rivals. But Los Angeles reasons that as bandwidth expands and on-line entertainment becomes more feasible, it will come into its own -- though only time will tell whether its bid to become "the new-media capital of the world" is simply California dreaming.
"Multimedia is our ticket for success into the next century," Mayor Riordan said at the ceremony last Wednesday as slides of the Southern California coast at sunset, night and midday flashed on a screen behind him. "The future is in our hands, and we're going to win."

HEADLINE: Who's Lining Up At Box Office? Lots and Lots Of Girls;
Studios Aim at Teen-Agers, A Vast, Growing Audience

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Girl Power has seized the entertainment business.
The teen-age girl audience is emerging as the most powerful demographic factor driving the success of movies like "Titanic," the James Cameron epic heading toward a worldwide box office record, as well as television shows like "Party of Five," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Ally McBeal" and "Dawson's Creek" and recording stars like LeAnn Rimes, the Spice Girls, Fiona Apple, Jewel and the Backstreet Boys. 
 This vast audience of girls is not only growing but also getting younger. "In the music business, teen-age girls have always been one of the central heartbeats, from the bobby-soxers who loved Sinatra to the girls who screamed for Elvis and the Beatles to the current phenomenon of Spice Girls and Hanson," said Danny Goldberg, chief executive officer of Mercury Records, which has earned millions of dollars from Hanson and others.
"But now the teen-age years seem to start at 8 or 9, in terms of entertainment tastes," he said. "The emotions are kicking in earlier. It's a huge audience."
Jamie Kellner, chief executive officer at the WB television network and former president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, said WB had largely been created to appeal to teen-agers and young adults.
"From Day One, our network has been rather female-skewing," Mr. Kellner said. WB's highly rated new drama series, "Dawson's Creek," which leans heavily on teen-age relationships and sexual issues, is written by Kevin Williamson, who wrote the movies "Scream," "Scream 2" and the film adaptation of "I Know What You Did Last Summer," all wildly popular with teen-agers, especially girls.
"What the female teens want is empowered female teen characters, which is something that has been missed for a long time on television," said Mr. Kellner, who is now casting a series pilot, called "Felicity," about a college student.
What is evident about the startling box office for "Titanic," which has already grossed more than $402 million in the United States, is that a hefty portion of the repeat business is coming from teen-age girls and younger women, who are seeing the film four or five times. Unlike teen-age boys, who attend movies with a friend or two, girls prefer going to theaters in packs.
Even before the release of "Titanic," Paramount, the film's distributor in the United States, had tested audience reactions and was fully aware that teen-age girls were the commanding demographic factor for the movie. (The film is distributed abroad by 20th Century Fox.)
"In our original concept testing -- when we read the concept of the movie over the phone and who was in it -- we mentioned Leonardo DiCaprio, and there was a lot of interest in him among girls," said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. "When we tested the first trailers, the young girls were the highest quadrant in their interest in seeing the film. And when we screened, the girls were one of the highest-testing groups who enjoyed the movie."
Accordingly, the studio marketed the film as a story of young lovers, with a heavy emphasis on Leonardo DiCaprio, whose 1996 film, "William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet,' " also drew throngs of girls. (Mr. DiCaprio, like Brad Pitt, is, according to Variety, also a megastar in Japan, the world's second biggest overseas market for Hollywood films, after Britain, largely because of Japan's huge audience of moviegoing teen-age girls.)
 
Saying Attention Must Be Paid
Robert Levin, president of worldwide marketing at Sony Pictures Entertainment. "A while ago everyone was really focusing on the young male audience: young male action movies, young male comedies. Now we're saying, 'Wow, there's really a young female audience out there that we must be attentive to.' "
Buffy Shutt, president of marketing at Universal Pictures, said: "By sheer bulk, the young girls are driving cultural tastes now. They're amazing consumers. And it's happening now because of demographics and more women being involved in the programming and movie-making process."
Laura Ziskin, president of Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox, who is making "Never Been Kissed," a teen-age comedy with Drew Barrymore, said, "I still don't know how to make a movie for a 17-year-old boy, and I'm not doing that. But at least I have a chance of making a good movie for a teen-age girl."
(Ms. Barrymore, who is especially popular among girls, stars with Adam Sandler in "The Wedding Singer," a comedy that opened over the Presidents' Day weekend and has grossed nearly $39 million. It is in the No. 2 spot after "Titanic.")
Ms. Ziskin said, "Young women have rarely been able to see their experiences dramatized on the screen, and we're finally starting to see it now, which is a new thing historically."
Population data project that the nation's teen-age population will soar to more than 42 million by 2010 from 38.2 million last year. That is not quite as large as the postwar baby boom at its peak, but it is still a powerful cultural and economic force with vast spending power amounting to as much as $80 billion, perhaps more. It was the baby boomers, after all, who made huge hits of films like "Saturday Night Fever"(1977), "Flashdance" (1983) and "Top Gun" (1986). A study by the Motion Picture Association of America, the industry's lobbyists, showed that 48 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds say they go to a movie at least once a month, compared with 26 percent of people 18 and over.
A recent random sampling of some teen-age girls in Manhattan, waiting in line to see "Titanic" at the Olympia Twin theater, at Broadway and 107th Street, showed that the lure of the film was fairly predictable: it was a tragic love story, against the backdrop of an epochal event, that starred the baby-faced Mr. DiCaprio, whose sensitive good looks made the girls swoon.
"He's beautiful, but I love the whole movie too; it's so sad," said Eliana Cabrera, 13, who had already seen the movie three times and had shown up with about a dozen girls from Intermediate School 218 in the Inwood section of Manhattan to see it again.
Across the country, at Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, Kelly Jones, a college student who was waiting in line a second time to see "Titanic," said of the film: "It has a good story, and the women in it aren't bimbos like in a lot of films where there's too much violence, too many car chases and too many stupid jokes."
"Titanic" is hardly the only film to awaken Hollywood to the teen-age girl audience. The box office for another current hit, "Good Will Hunting," is being driven heavily by girls because of the presence of two young actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
 
Taking a Clue From 'Clueless'
Of course, there has always been television and movie fare with special appeal to girls, but what may have set off the current trend was Amy Heckerling's "Clueless" (1995), a sharp comedy about some spoiled Beverly Hills girls that was based loosely on Jane Austen's "Emma." An unexpected hit, the film took in $57 million at the box office and was later turned into a television series. One year later, teen-age girls surged into theaters to see Baz Luhrmann's MTV-inspired "William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet,' " with two teen-age icons, Mr. DiCaprio and Claire Danes.
More recently, "Scream," a sly horror film last year that was scary yet spoofed the genre, emerged as a huge hit, grossing $103 million. A major reason for the film's success: among its stars were television regulars like Neve Campbell of "Party of Five," Courteney Cox of "Friends" and Sarah Michelle Gellar of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," all of them teen-age favorites.
"For the first time in the horror genre, young women drove the business on 'Scream' and then 'Scream 2,"' said Mark Gill, head of the Los Angeles office of Miramax, which released the two films. "Most of the lead characters are young, hip attractive women, and the audience identifies with them."
What seems to drive the horror genre, though, is sex. "These movies tap into those raging hormones that you don't know what to do with," said Mr. Williamson, the screenwriter. "You sit in the theater and have a therapeutic experience. These characters are smart as can be; they're savvy; they're self-aware. You haven't seen that before in too many horror films."
And virtually every studio is now making, or planning, a handful of films aimed at teen-age girls. "It's a re-emerging audience, and everyone is taking a closer look at it," said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, which has put at least two such movies into production.
This crowd, he said, is lucrative. "They're easier to market to, compared to the older audience, because their tastes are very specific," Mr. Roth said. "They come to a movie over and over again if they like it. They don't work; they don't have families to raise. They're available consumers with money."
Several studio executives said the potential power of this audience has quietly resulted in a generational shift among stars: that is, Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson and a handful of other top stars are slowly being superseded by young actors like Mr. DiCaprio, Ms. Danes, Will Smith, Matt Damon and Kate Winslet.
 
Audience Waiting To Be Discovered
Meanwhile, the movie industry's rediscovery of the young female audience is greeted with cynicism in some quarters. The consensus is that this audience was always there, but never fully acknowledged until lately.
"The success of a film like 'Lethal Weapon' was not just because young males showed; half of the people sitting in that room were women who wanted to see Mel Gibson," said Robin Swicord, a screenwriter of films like "Little Women," who has written and plans to direct a film for Paramount about young models, aimed at the female audience.
" 'Last of the Mohicans' was a surprise hit to a lot of people," she said, "but the reason it was a hit was because women and younger girls went again and again to see this romantic story and Daniel Day-Lewis running through the forest with his shirt off."
Laughing, she said, "Actually, we called 'Last of the Mohicans' by another name: 'Lust of the Mohicans.' "

HEADLINE: The Misguided Max Tax

BYLINE: By William G. Gale and Robert D. Reischauer; William G. Gale is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Robert D. Reischauer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, was director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The latest fad in the seemingly endless stream of budget proposals involves limiting total tax payments. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wants to cap Federal revenue at 19 percent of gross domestic product. Some have gone even further, pushing for a constitutional amendment that would limit Federal taxes to 25 percent of income. The "Max Tax," a variation on this theme, would let each taxpayer choose between filing under the current system and simply paying 25 percent of gross income.
These proposals may seem simple and fair. But they would constrain public policy in unwise and dangerous ways, give away needed Federal money and provide a huge tax break for the wealthiest households. 
 It's true, as advocates for tax limits like to point out, that the Federal Government has more revenue today relative to the size of the economy than at any time since the end of World War II. But there are good reasons that this is the case.
First, lawmakers increased tax rates in 1990 and 1993 to reduce the deficit. And guess what? For the first time since 1969, we will have a budget surplus. A tax limit like the Max Tax, which would reduce revenue by more than $100 billion, would throw this accomplishment away.
Second, since the 1960's payroll taxes have risen to match the rising costs of Social Security and Medicare. This largely explains the higher overall tax burdens facing individuals. Yet even these higher taxes will not meet the challenge that these two programs face when the baby boomers begin to retire in a decade.
Third, both the economy and stock market are booming. When incomes, corporate profits and capital gains soar, Government revenue rises more than proportionately, because the tax system is progressive.
But tax limits would be a windfall for the wealthy. If the Max Tax had been the law in 1994, those individuals with adjusted gross income below $50,000 a year -- that's 90 percent of all taxpayers -- would have received cuts averaging only $150. Those with incomes exceeding $200,000 -- the top 1 percent of taxpayers -- would have received cuts averaging $40,000. Should we reduce progressivity in the tax system when the richest among us are receiving a disproportionate share of the wealth?
It would be unwise and risky to limit taxes through a constitutional amendment or some arbitrary statutory cap. If the nation needed to expand the defense budget significantly, we would want to consider raising taxes; otherwise, we may find ourselves recklessly financing any buildup through soaring deficits, as we did in the 1980's.
Moreover, a cap on taxes would be difficult to design and implement. Clear and accepted definitions of "taxes" and "income" would be needed, but none exist. For example, would it make sense when calculating a tax limit to equate income and payroll tax payments even though some portion of the latter will be returned to the taxpayer in the future as Social Security benefits?
Tax lawyers and financial planners would have a field day designing ways to game the new system. Under a tax limit, they would create mechanisms to shift corporate income, which would still be taxed at a 35 percent rate, to upper income households that would face a 25 percent rate on unlimited amounts of gross income.
The next step in tax reform should be to simplify the tax code. This does not require a constitutional amendment, a depletion of Federal revenue or a huge tax cut for the wealthy.

HEADLINE: Merrymaking Is Clashing With Tradition in Mardi Gras Tableaux

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The parades, the lifeblood of the pre-Lent Carnival season for many people here, still course through St. Charles Avenue to cries of "Throw me something, mister!"
The famous beads, plastic junk endowed with some almost mystical importance for a moment in time, still fly from the floats. Shriners, fezzes in the wind, still rumble along on their matching Harleys between high-stepping marching bands and woodenly waving beauty queens. 
 At the tableau balls of the super-secret societies known as krewes, the rustle of this season's silk still mixes with the reek of old bourbon and older money, while in the French Quarter, tourists who still think Mardi Gras is license to get blind and staggering drunk, still do.
It is the season of merriment in New Orleans leading up to Lent, which started with the Feast of the Epiphany on Jan. 6 and ends at midnight on Fat Tuesday, Feb. 24.
To most outsiders, the "Greatest Free Show on Earth," is just as loud, grand and weird as ever. But to people who know its past, Carnival -- most people call it Mardi Gras -- is shrinking, both in history and scope, becoming more tawdry and tourist-oriented at the expense of tradition, even as studies on its economic impact show that that, too, is dwindling.
Traditionalists say it is not just the old battle over the exclusivity of some historic krewes, which for years admitted only whites, but also a creeping shoddiness in how it is all played out.
"What we've known and loved has been turned into a theme park to amuse visitors," said Henri Schindler, a Carnival historian and float designer whose creations built from papier-mache -- on themes of literature, mythology and history -- have been called rolling pieces of art.
"Now," Mr. Schindler said, "we have double-decker buses carrying Wayne Newton and Steven Seagal."
But it is more than a matter of taste, of style. It is a feeling that Carnival, long considered a party for locals that the outside world could see and hear and taste but never really become part of, is fighting for its very identity.
It is now possible simply to purchase one of those coveted places on a parade float, even if those floats are less imaginative, less grand.
As cameras for MTV, true-life crime shows and tabloid news programs roll in the French Quarter, the drunken partying has grown so extreme -- flashes of nudity have given way to the actual performance of oral sex acts on Bourbon Street -- that it is the drunkenness and obscenity itself that threatens to become Carnival's theme.
"We've lost quite a bit," Mr. Schindler said. "What is happening is the modernization, Americanization and homogenization of Carnival."
The latest addition to Carnival is the Krewe of America, and members need have no connection to New Orleans or its history. Instead, members from around the country can purchase a $2,500 package for two that includes hotel room, plane tickets, a brunch, a ball, and a place on one of the krewe's parade floats.
The krewes, the New Orleans variation of crews, are nonprofit clubs financed by dues and fund-raising projects, and most of them are involved in charities. Memberships have been traditionally limited to people who live in or around the city.
To traditionalists, the Krewe of America turns history on its head. It is supposed to be local residents tossing beads to tourists, not the other way around, said Arthur Hardy, a Carnival historian and publisher of the "Mardi Gras Guide."
"It's still a party we throw ourselves," Mr. Hardy said. What the Krewe of America is doing, he said, "is like having the audience join in a Broadway play."
But the Krewe of America's captain, Jack Blossman, said the whole idea of the krewe was to let people see behind the mask.
"Most people only see Mardi Gras from the curb," said Mr. Blossman, a banker who lives outside New Orleans. "We give them a chance to get on the inside."
It is open to people of both sexes and of all colors. That is in stark contrast to organizations like Comus, the oldest parading krewe, which stopped parading after a 1991 city ordinance banned membership discrimination. Other krewes followed the lead of Comus, but those organizations -- made up of white men -- still celebrate Carnival with fancy-dress balls. Other organizations with long traditions, like Rex, opened their membership and still parade.
In a move that rankles many traditionalists, the City Council granted the prime parade slot once held by Comus -- at 5 P.M. on Fat Tuesday -- to the Krewe of America.
"I hate to see it become a corporate perk, a junket," Mr. Schindler said.
Mr. Blossman said that "every parade has people from out of town" who ride along, but the krewes do not advertise that fact. In time, he said, his krewe hopes to have 20 people from each state. While he says that his krewe is trying to get along with the Carnival establishment and carving out its own place in the culture, Mr. Blossman contends that snobbery is behind much of the hostility.
There is a middle ground between the new krewe and traditionalists. Krewes like Bacchus, founded in 1968, and Orpheus, founded in 1994 by the singer Harry Connick Jr., include celebrities, popular floats and generous "throws," the beads, aluminum doubloons and plastic cups that the crowds clamor for.
Beyond the cultural impact of Carnival is its immense economic one, from tourism dollars, but after years of increases, that is also changing. According to a study by the University of New Orleans, the economic impact fell to about $801 million in 1997 and to $810 million in 1996 from a high of $929 million in 1995.
The number of parades are also falling, to 45 last year from a high of 55 in 1986. And as the parade culture dwindles, the culture of rampant drunkenness grows.
Last year, people had sex on Bourbon Street. Videos of the street scenes from Fat Tuesday are on sale in X-rated video stores.
"I'm not a prude," Mr. Hardy said, but in the past few years he said he had seen the ribaldry go from the traditional naughtiness -- it is common for a young man to ask a young woman to show him her breasts in exchange for beads -- to acts that are far lewder.
That increasingly dangerous reputation of anything goes is scaring away more middle-class adult visitors, the kind of people who actually spend money, and attracting young people who only want to frolic in a drunken haze, traditionalists say.
What many people see on television, particularly from Bourbon Street, "is a drunken orgy," Mr. Hardy said, adding, "They feel they have a license to behave this way."
But historians also say that Carnival in New Orleans is always in flux, in agitation, in transformation, and that in other ways it never seems to change at all.
Just saying, for instance, that an old-line krewe has opened its membership does not mean that the membership is actually any more integrated -- and memberships are still largely secret. The majority white krewes are still, say historians, almost exclusively white, and the black krewes, like the famous Zulu Social Aid and Please Club, are almost exclusively black.
The parades, much more than elitist balls, are the twine that holds the whole thing together, residents say. Anyone can come to a parade.
Earlier this week, as the Krewe of Pegasus paraded down St. Charles, there were no grand floats. But marching bands from inner-city high schools had people dancing on the trolley tracks that run between the four-lane street. There was no real sense of mystery, of intrigue. But a horse did go a little crazy and almost trample a group of drunk college boys in bad Hawaiian shirts.

HEADLINE: Report Finds Bias in Lending Hinders Home Buying in Cities

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
While the number of Americans who own their homes has reached a record level, a new report by the United States Conference of Mayors contends that discriminatory lending practices in urban areas have kept many city dwellers from participating in the boom.
Last year, the overall national rate of home ownership reached a record high of 65.7 percent. But the report, "America's Home Ownership Gap," found a sharp difference in likelihood of owning a home in different places. 
 Citing evidence compiled by the Federal Reserve Board and the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, the report said 71.5 percent of people who live in the suburbs own their homes, compared with 49 percent who live in cities.
The disparity, the report said, stemmed largely from redlining by banks, a practice that makes mortgage loans unavailable to low-income buyers. It found that those same people are also affected by real estate agents who steer them away from certain neighborhoods and by the current limits on Federal Housing Administration loans.
Typically, the people who have been hurt are members of minorities, who disproportionately live in cities. The report said 71.3 percent of whites are homeowners, compared with 43.6 percent of blacks and 41.7 percent of Hispanic Americans. The Federal Reserve concluded that minority households applying for mortgage credit were "much more likely" to be rejected than white households with similar incomes.
"Redlining and all other forms of housing discrimination are ugly stains from America's past that have no place in America today," said Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, in response to the report's findings. "This report proves that home ownership in America is still too often separate and unequal."
Home ownership is viewed by many sociologists and politicians as vital to neighborhood stability, a key to promoting safer streets, better schools and economic development.
That pattern has worked successfully in suburban areas for decades as thousands of bedroom communities have sprung up around urban centers. But in many cases, the outward flow has led to the decline of inner-city neighborhoods, with renters and, often, wrecking balls claiming homes once owned and occupied.
Some cities, like Philadelphia, Cleveland and Detroit, are fighting back with ambitious redevelopment plans, making use of local and Federal programs that emphasize home ownership as the best way to rehabilitate eroding neighborhoods.
But as the report found, discriminatory practices continue to impede the development, even as incomes are rising and many banks have lowered their mortgage rates.
The report quotes Willie Brown, the Mayor of San Francisco and chairman of the mayors' conference on community development and housing, as saying: "We've got more people in more jobs making more money and buying more homes. But these home buyers aren't minorities, and that raises the question: Shouldn't all boats be rising on this strong economic tide?"
The report offers few concrete solutions, other than to urge the private mortgage industry to make more loans available to lower-income buyers. Mr. Cuomo said that the Administration is proposing to raise Federal housing loan limits, which have been in effect for 21 years.
Passage by Congress, he said, would enable three million more families to buy their homes.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: IN BAGHDAD;
Despite Threat of Missiles, the Iraqi Capital's People Take a Crisis in Stride

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 22

 BODY:
In a city where crucial negotiations about the fate of Iraq's 22 million people might be headed toward an optimistic resolution, the people of Baghdad seemed cool and placid today -- almost nonchalant.
In stores and coffee shops, people glanced at television screens showing other Arabs supporting them and international diplomacy working full blast -- taking it all in stride. 
 Even during the last four weeks, when it has appeared that a formidable American armada was getting read to send a shower of missiles over Iraq, hardly anyone here rushed to hoard food. And the value of the dollar, which usually soars in times of danger, has actually fallen.
True, Maher Yaacoub knew today that things were looking up. He could see it by glancing at the reports taken from CNN flashing on the Yasir Almeheidi electric shop's television just behind the rickety table where Mr. Yaacoub peddles single cigarettes from open packs.
The CNN reports, complete with Arabic translation, gave hourly details of talks in Baghdad with the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, asserting that they were going well. And everyone in Iraq knows that when the tightly controlled Iraqi media starts showing uncensored reports from a major "imperialistic American" network, it is a clear sign things are swinging Iraq's way.
Still, Mr. Yaacoub said philosophically: "What will happen will happen. We have been there before."
But overall some 60 people interviewed over the weekend appeared fatalistic, skeptical and even defiant despite assurances from their Government that there was some light at the end of the tunnel after seven years of severe economic sanctions.
"My dear friend," said Kazem Hani, 24, a pharmacist, "we are at the mercy of America, whose President is surrounded by people who hate Muslims and Arabs, who has a sexual scandal on his hands that he wants to resolve at our expense, and who is pressured by generals to try their new toy missiles on somebody. With odds like that our only refuge is God, not, excuse me, Kofi Annan."
The pharmacist was sipping tea this afternoon with a colleague in Soraya's Pharmacy, off the main shopping artery, Saadoun Avenue. The largely empty shelves contained only two kinds of medications: a pain killer and an antidepressant that can only be dispensed with a doctor's prescription.
As 13 clients came in over a two-hour period, the two pharmacists were able to respond only to three requests for pain killers. To the rest the answer was the same: "Sorry, brother. I don't have it." The customers shuffled out in the same resigned way they shuffled in.
Does anybody around here ask for gas masks?
Mr. Hani laughed bitterly. "You are talking to someone who has not eaten a banana in seven years," he said. "I last had meat a month ago. When I come to work every morning here, I say good morning to six engineers who are peddling cigarettes on this street to supplement their incomes. Do you believe anyone here is worried about gas?"
"They say your school years are your happiest years. They have been my most miserable years. I went into pharmacology school under the embargo and graduated under the embargo. Dreams, hopes of marrying, traveling, opening a business, are all evaporated.
"We have no army. Anyone can see we cannot defend ourselves. But they are going to attack us because, after searching our country for seven years, they suddenly discover we have biological weapons?"
Mr. Hani leaned forward and added, "I think this may be the first time a lot of people may die because your President has turned the White House into a brothel."
This gloom did not lighten yesterday when it was announced that the Security Council authorized a doubling of the amount of oil Iraq can sell for food. If anything, the move was seen as a cynical ploy because the embargo has not allowed Iraq to maintain its oil infrastructure so it is doubtful whether it can pump the additional oil. At the moment, Iraq is pumping 1.5 million barrels of oil a day compared with a capacity of 4 million before the embargo was imposed in 1990.
Asked about prospect of getting more food and medicine, Issa Khalid, owner of a leather shop, side-stepped the question, asking, "Tell me first, is it true American citizens were advised to leave Iraq and the whole Middle East as soon as possible?"
It was, the answer came back. "Well, is there need to say more?"
These assertive comments seem to longtime travelers here to indicate a change in the way Iraqis view the rest of the world. Many expressed defiance toward other countries.
Perhaps as a result of the shift in mood, Baghdad appears more open to foreigners than at any time since the crisis began. Foreign reporters have flooded the country in the last four weeks and have found few obstacles to their movement or their ability to talk to people.
What is even more remarkable is that Iraqis are talking. In a clear break with almost predictable behavior in the past, hardly anyone interviewed in the last few days asked that their names be withheld.
In the once peaceful, almost idyllic, setting of the School of Fine Arts -- dotted with sculptures of goddesses and nymphs -- scores of the 600 male and female students were receiving their daily military training today under the gaze of 43-year-old Youssef Rashid, chairman of the Theatrical Arts Department.
Mr. Rashid, a pensive intellectual, seemed almost perturbed at the sight of his young artists being forced into such rough activity. But when asked if this is not perhaps the fault of Iraq's leaders, he bristled.
"Why?" he said. "Is it Saddam who has imposed the embargo? Besides, what is America to tell any country what leadership it should have. This is a country with thousands of years of culture that is now watching its babies dying of malnutrition."
Beyond the defiance, there is a far more widespread sentiment that anything Iraqis do, or refuse to do, does not matter anymore.
"We are used to this -- it has been eight years, you know," said Ohoud Ibrahim, a 36-year-old actress with a riveting stare who teaches here. She is star of a popular play in Baghdad called "A Screwed Up World."
Watching students learning how to use machine guns, she said: "You know, sometimes I go out of the theater at night wondering if what is happening between us and America is weirder than the play. I think most people in Iraq are at the point where they just don't care."
The main beneficiary of this mood is President Saddam Hussein. "If you think anybody is going to rise to overthrow him, forget it," said a woman named Nadia, who was virtually the only person interviewed who insisted on a measure of anonymity. "He is our devil and the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know, especially Clinton."

HEADLINE: Higher Quota Urged for Immigrant Technology Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congress and the computer industry, the White House is seriously considering proposals to increase the immigration quota for computer scientists and other information technology workers, so that foreigners can fill thousands of job openings in this country.
The issue is extremely divisive. President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore want to placate friends in Silicon Valley, who say there is a critical shortage of technology workers, but they risk offending organized labor. 
 Under current law, employers can bring in up to 65,000 skilled foreign workers each year. The workers receive visas, known as H-1B visas, that last up to six years.
In 1997, for the first time, the Government issued the maximum number of such visas, and it expects to reach the limit again in May or June, several months before the end of the current fiscal year.
High-tech companies, which depend on foreign workers for essential services, have been lobbying the Administration to support an increase in the annual limits. They say there is an urgent need for Congress to act this year, and some lawmakers are eager to do so.
The initial, public response from the Administration was negative. In January, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said, "This Administration does not support an increase in the caps on visas."
But confidential White House documents show that the Administration is seriously considering proposals that would increase the quota by 50 percent or more. The Administration contends that any increase should be linked to education and training and new protections for American workers.
One industry group, the Information Technology Association of America, sees "a severe shortage of competent and skilled information technology workers." It says there are 346,000 vacancies, representing 10 percent of all the jobs for computer programmers and engineers and systems analysts.
Harris N. Miller, president of the association, said, "The shortage threatens not only the information technology industry, but the growth of the entire U.S. economy, our global competitiveness and the wage stability that is the bedrock of this country's low inflation."
Senator Spencer Abraham, the Michigan Republican who heads the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, shares this concern.
"If American companies cannot find home-grown talent and if they cannot bring talent to this country," Mr. Abraham said, "some of them will move their operations overseas, taking American jobs with them. That is why I am going to use my position to propose that we increase the number of more highly skilled temporary workers we allow into the United States."
Speaker Newt Gingrich said he too supported an increase in the quota for "people of high talent."
The Commerce Department predicts that the United States will need more than 1.3 million new information technology workers -- an average of 138,000 a year -- in the coming decade.
The openings come in the context of a tight labor market. Over all, the national unemployment rate last year, averaging 4.9 percent, was the lowest since 1973.
The options for increasing the immigration quota are described in a memorandum requested by Elena Kagan, deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House. The memorandum, prepared and approved by senior officials at the Departments of Commerce, Labor and State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, begins by saying, "This is a very controversial issue."
Seth Harris, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy, said Ms. Kagan had "asked the Labor and Commerce Departments to draft a memorandum setting forth options with respect to the proposal to increase the cap on H-1B visas."
White House documents show that the Commerce Department, the State Department and the immigration service favor an option that would set the quota for skilled foreign workers at 80,000 to 100,000 a year. Information technology and other industries with shortages of skilled workers would have priority in getting the extra visas, above the current 65,000.
At present, employers seeking H-1B visas do not have to show a shortage of American workers, nor do they have to show that they tried to recruit Americans for the jobs.
The Labor Department would prefer to keep the cap at its current level, but might give priority within the quota to industries that have shortages of skilled workers, the documents say. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the immigration subcommittee, favors this approach.
Technology companies say that, while they support more education and training for Americans, they need skilled labor immediately and therefore want to bring in additional foreign workers.
Administration officials said they would prod Congress to adopt new protections for American workers as lawmakers consider raising the quota for foreign workers. The President's proposals would require employers to recruit Americans before importing foreign labor, would ban the use of foreign workers to replace laid-off Americans and would reduce the maximum stay for H-1B workers to three years, from six.
The memorandum to Ms. Kagan notes that "critics of raising the H-1B cap, such as the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers and the American Engineering Association, say industry drastically overstates any problem."
Hal Ponder, a lawyer with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s department for professional employees, said organized labor opposed increasing the quota until there was more careful study of the problem.
"We question whether there is a shortage of information technology workers," Mr. Ponder said in an interview. "If there is a shortage, there are skilled workers in the United States who could meet that need."
Norman S. Matloff, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Davis, said that many technology companies were seeking cheap labor. As a result, he said, they prefer to hire recent graduates and foreign workers and often discriminate against American computer programmers over the age of 40, who are perceived as requiring higher salaries.
"Foreign nationals are willing to take lower salaries in exchange for the prospect of becoming permanent residents of the United States," Mr. Matloff said. "Even though they often earn less than U.S. citizens with comparable jobs, they still receive more than they would be paid back home in India or Russia."
The memorandum to the White House from the Departments of Labor, Commerce and State says: "The H-1B program seldom operates as a temporary worker program with workers coming to this country for a short duration and then returning to their homes. Instead, it operates often as a probationary employment program. Employers bring workers to the United States and, if they perform well, sponsor them for permanent admission to this country. This linkage permits employers to hire foreign workers without first recruiting U.S. workers."
Under this arrangement, the memorandum says, "U.S. workers are never provided a genuine opportunity to compete for these jobs."
Stephen H. Leven, director of human resources at Texas Instruments, said that most of the people hired by his company on H-1B visas were foreign citizens who graduated from American universities with degrees in electrical engineering.
"Employers expect to hit the H-1B ceiling as early as May this year," Mr. Leven said. "Once the cap is reached, companies will be unable to hire additional foreign workers until the new fiscal year begins in October. That will be devastating to U.S. companies seeking to bring new products to market."
In their memorandum to the White House, Administration officials said the industry's conclusion about a dire shortage of skilled technology workers was "not entirely accurate." While there seem to be shortages of technology workers in selected occupations and some local areas, the memorandum says, "wage data do not suggest acute skill shortages nationwide."
By contrast, the Information Technology Association of America says, "Our industry is facing a national labor shortage of historic proportions."

United Nations Chief Reaches Deal With Iraq
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq met with Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, and agreed to lift his ban on arms inspections at so-called presidential properties, a spokesman for Mr. Annan said. The agreement could avert another American attack on Iraq and recharge the arms inspection process that was put in place after the Persian Gulf War. A1
 
Senior Clinton Administration officials warned that deeds, not words, were required to resolve the crisis with Iraq. They said they would withhold judgment on the import of Mr. Annan's visit to Baghdad until he returned on Tuesday with details. A1 

Iraq was said to have agreed to inspections of eight "presidential sites" that it had declared off-limits to United Nations weapons inspectors and dropped its demands for a time limit on inspections. The agreement apparently does not address the issue of all the sites that the commission in charge of Iraq's disarmament has identified as suspect. A8
 
The people of Baghdad seemed almost nonchalant at the news about the negotiations. Some said the penury imposed by seven years of sanctions made theirs a life not worth living and shrugged off the threat of an American strike. One Iraqi quoted a saying, "A wet man does not fear rain." A9
 
A New Kind of Leader in Korea
Kim Dae Jung, who on Wednesday will become the President of South Korea, insists that the solution to Asia's economic crisis is more democracy, greater openness and freer markets. Mr. Kim, a renowned dissident who opposed South Korea's military dictatorship, has said he is willing to speak out against human rights abuses in the region. A1
 
Shake-Up in Key Indian State
As another 200 million voters cast ballots in the second of three key days in India's general elections, the state government of Uttar Pradesh was ousted after defectors from a coalition led by a Hindu nationalist party switched sides and pledged their support to a new coalition. A3
 
Fires Flare Again in Indonesia
Small farmers and large plantation owners in eastern Borneo have apparently resumed their slash-and-burn land clearing, unleashing fires that threaten to blanket Southeast Asia with smoke and haze the way they did last fall. The Government of Indonesia has banned burning, but the farmers are desperate to survive as food shortages and bankruptcies spread throughout the country. A3
 
Belfast Talks to Go On
The British and Irish Governments have decided that terrorist attacks by splinter groups who object to the Northern Ireland peace talks should not be allowed to derail the talks, officials close to the negotiations said. Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said that his party would not be deterred by "Republican militants." A4

A Shrinking Mardi Gras?
It is the season of merriment in New Orleans, and to most outsiders, the "Greatest Free Show on Earth" is just as loud and weird as ever. But to people who know its past, Mardi Gras is shrinking, both in history and scope. They say it is becoming more tawdry and tourist-oriented at the expense of tradition, even as studies on its economic impact show that that is dwindling as well. A10
 
'No' on Caterpillar Contract
The United Auto Workers voted to reject a new contract with Caterpillar Inc., continuing its six-year dispute with the nation's larger maker of earth-moving equipment. The nationwide vote on the proposal was 58 percent against and 42 percent in favor. Although the contract proposal, supported by union leadership, would have ended the uncertainty for about 13,000 workers in four states, it also required them to give way on some issues that twice led to long, bitter strikes.

Homeownership Up, for Some
The number of Americans who own their own home has reached a record level, but a new report by the United States Conference of Mayors says that discriminatory lending practices in urban areas have kept more city dwellers from participating in the boom. The report says the people who have been hurt by those practices are minorities, who disproportionately live in cities. A13
 
On the Campaign (Finance) Trail
Among voters these days, campaign finance is second fiddle at best to topics like Iraq, Senator Russell D. Feingold learned last week as he made his rounds in Wisconsin to talk to constituents.

Prostitution Gets A Little More Discreet
The number of prostitutes on New York City streets has thinned, in large part because of the surge of Disney-style family entertainment in Times Square and the city's assault on "quality of life" crimes. But prostitution, though less visible, is no less prevalent. More discreet forms have been able to flourish, thanks to the Internet, cellular phones and escort services. A1
 
Ferraro on the Attack
Geraldine A. Ferraro denounced Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for repeatedly blocking measures to restrict campaign contributions, and urged him to support a bill to overhaul campaign finance coming to the Senate floor this week. Ms. Ferraro took a break from her own schedule of fund-raising to seize on an issue that she and the two other Democrats seeking the nomination to run against Mr. D'Amato said was one of his biggest political vulnerabilities: his aggressive fund-raising practices. Mr. D'Amato reiterated his opposition to the measure through a spokesman. B3

With New York City expecting a huge budget surplus for the second straight year, the suggestion naturally arises that the city spend some of its extra $1.2 billion to fix its crumbling infrastructure.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Continuing to Give, Despite Obstacles Great and Small

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
A stolen car. Kidney stones. Unemployment. These misfortunes, which plowed into Joseph Leary's life just before Christmas, helped turn December and January into his "winter of major discontent," as he put it.
But while the hardships made Mr. Leary anxious, depressed and financially pressed, he still sent his annual $25 to The New York Times Neediest Case Fund -- with a prodigious explanation. 
 "So the dog didn't eat my check," wrote Mr. Leary, a graphic artist from the Upper West Side. "But I have an even better batch of excuses."
As the fund-raising appeal enters its final week, many donors have been asking forgiveness for acting so late. "Sorry I didn't get to this sooner," wrote Marcia Blecker of Roslyn, N.Y., "but unfortunately we've had an onslaught of family deaths and I've been down with the flu."
Others, however, had less sympathetic reasons. Daniel and Hannah Finnie, ages 6 and 4, dispatched their $10 just before Christmas. But their father, Matthew, thought he might save a few pennies by mailing their donation in a recycled business-reply envelope, which the Postal Service returned six weeks later.
"Sorry for the delay," Mr. Finnie, of Basking Ridge, N.J., wrote in a note that finally arrived last week. "I got cheap and tried to reuse an envelope so it ended up costing me an extra stamp instead."
Whatever the excuse, contributions postmarked before Feb. 28 will be added to this season's tally of $5.4 million, the largest amount ever collected by the fund. Gifts postmarked after that date will be counted toward the next appeal. The previous record, $5.08 million, had been set in 1991-92. When the campaign ends on Saturday, the money will be distributed among seven of the city's most prominent charities. And because The Times pays all administrative costs, every dollar will go to help those who have fallen on hard times.
While the success of this year's campaign may have tempered the philanthropy of some, it seems to have fueled the generosity of others. C. Stephen Heard of the Upper East Side sent $300, his second gift of the year, hoping it might inspire others and "help push the needle toward the $6 million mark," he wrote. "I will try to send one more before the end of February," he added.
Many of the 12,000 people who have contributed to the fund so far this year say they did so because they wanted to alleviate the suffering of New York's most desperate residents. Others, like Jennifer Anne Hull of the Upper East Side, were also moved by a twinge of guilt.
"It's Saturday night and my aching feet have finally recovered from a day spent shopping the designer sale racks at Saks," she wrote in a note that accompanied her $175 gift. "While mentally congratulating myself on scoring a $450 Claude Montana blouse for $160, my eyes glanced over an article in The Times headlined 'Out From Under a Threat of Eviction: No Longer a Need to Choose Between Rent and Food.' There's another check that I need to write today, and it's enclosed."
Some contributors have made a habit out of giving. Albert and Mimi Jaffe recently moved to North Carolina from Westchester County, but they continued their custom, sending in $2 for every year they have been together, a figure that represents the cost of a marriage license when they were wed 58 years ago. "We hope to continue this tradition as long as we're alive and kicking," Mr. Jaffe, a semi-retired insurance writer, said in an interview. "And I've included a much more sizable bequest in my will when we're not."

HEADLINE: Prostitutes on Wane In New York Streets But Take to Internet

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
The old prostitution haunts now crawl with nearly as many police officers as streetwalkers, part of New York City's continuing assault on "quality of life" crimes. Once-seedy areas where the sex business flourished, like Times Square, have given way to Disney-style family entertainment. And the combined forces of AIDS and drug addiction have further thinned the ranks of prostitutes on neighborhood streets.
But while prostitution may be less visible in the city, it is no less prevalent. The Internet, pagers, cellular phones and subterfuges like escort services have enabled more discreet forms of prostitution to thrive beyond the reach of the street-level crackdown, the authorities and prostitutes themselves say. 
 "You have some people who have no alternative but the street," said Capt. John Costello, commander of the Manhattan South police vice squad. "But there are a whole lot of people that we never deal with, working out of offices, apartments and the Internet. And if they are acting behind closed doors and are discreet, we will never hear about them."
As the police have forced prostitutes to change tactics, the city's resurgence as a destination for conventioneers and tourists has expanded the demand for prostitution, said Ronald Moglia, a professor of human sexuality at New York University.
And the business is adjusting. Prostitutes cruise the Internet nightly looking to arrange liaisons in New York, the computer and modem having replaced the sidewalk and street lamp as the means by which many prostitutes and customers meet, size one another up and negotiate transactions. Ads for sexual services flourish on Web sites and in mainstream publications. And the current Manhattan Yellow Pages now has 52 pages devoted to escort services -- legal businesses that the police say frequently front as prostitution rings. That is 17 more pages than two years ago.
Long-established escort services are feeling the competitive squeeze.
"This business is growing like crazy," said Nerissa Braimbridge, whose International Escort service in Manhattan has brought together young women and wealthy men for more than two decades -- for companionship only, she said, adding that her service receives many queries over the Internet. "It's grown from something small to something degenerate. Everyone is getting into the business and operating as an escort."
Prostitutes have certainly not been driven off the streets, and many still shiver nightly on the sidewalks in desolate stretches of the city. But they are an increasingly beleaguered, often desperate group.
"It's not like it used to be," said Candace, a 41-year-old prostitute who has worked in Hell's Kitchen and other Manhattan neighborhoods for more than a decade. Referring to Ninth Avenue, she said: "There used to be 15 girls working here; now it's only me. You've got to move around a lot more and work more secluded places to get by, and you can't take as much time sizing up your customer. Things are tough on the street."
But another prostitute, a 26-year-old man who gave only his professional name, Steve, has managed to do brisk business while keeping far away from the hazards of the street corner. On a recent evening he worked at his computer making dates for Valentine's Day. He said he had found steady work since he began selling sex on the Internet, through an on-line account that cost him $10 to set up.
A posted profile describes Steve as a "head-turning escort for evenings or travel" whose hobbies include "making wealthy men very happy."
On-line prostitutes say the Internet is a natural medium for selling sex: it is anonymous and connects them to a vast array of potential clients. It is safer than the streets, where vice officers and predatory strangers are constant threats.
And it is cheap. An escort company can buy an ad on a Web site for $50 a month, compared with thousands of dollars for half a page in the Yellow Pages. Prostitutes also say the Internet enables them to avoid sharing their profits with a pimp or an escort agency.
One beneficiary of the evolution of New York prostitution has been Redlightnet.com, a clearinghouse for the on-line sex trade that has been run for a year and a half out of a small apartment in Chelsea. Redlightnet's page on the World Wide Web is supported by more than 10 regular advertisers in the escort business and more than 400 personal ads.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to do this job, it just takes looks," said Alan M., a 26-year-old former Navy sailor who said he started selling sex out of his home in Chicago several months ago and averages $1,500 a week for about 10 hours' work. His costs are mainly for clothes and keeping his computer in good repair. Clients pick up most other expenses, including taxi and plane fares when he travels to New York and other cities.
In these and other ways, off-street sex workers are sharply different from those who walk the streets, experts say. They usually do not refer to themselves as prostitutes, sociologists say, noting that it is easier for them to escape the industry's stigma because they are unlikely to develop a criminal record and are more often in business for themselves.
"You have a more open attitude toward sexuality on the part of young people," said Ira Reiss, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Minnesota. "Now we have a variety of new communication devices, there is a much easier moral code and a willingness to experiment and try new things by both men and women. And it's much easier to say, 'I'm just making extra money.' "
There are no authoritative figures on the prostitute population in New York City. But evidence from a variety of sources suggests that the industry is growing, even as fewer prostitutes work the street. And electronic technology appears to be central to the industry's success, both in attracting business and avoiding the authorities.
 
Discreet Operations Are Rarely Targets
The police say prostitutes who work on line or for escort services are unlikely ever to be arrested, since law enforcement agencies rarely go after discreet indoor operations. In fact, the only way such businesses get into trouble, escorts and police officials say, is by employing under-age prostitutes, annoying neighbors with too much foot traffic, or failing to pay taxes.
One New York State law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity said his office had made several attempts to reel in on-line sex workers over the last year but had failed each time because the prostitutes became suspicious before a deal was brokered.
According to the city police, only 30 establishments were closed during the first eight months of last year, and only 44 were closed the year before. While the Police Department could not give complete statistics for prostitution arrests in 1997, vice squad officers arrested fewer than 2,000 prostitutes and clients in 1996, fewer than a third of whom were prostitutes working inside buildings.
From January to October 1997, the department's vice enforcement division arrested only 1,380 prostitutes and their customers, fewer than half from inside establishments.
The police say there is no evidence that a significant number of street prostitutes have gone into the booming escort business. But many have adopted more modest technological means to stay ahead of the police. They try to build client lists so that they can arrange work by phone rather than on the street. Others work out of bars or dance clubs, giving out pager numbers to clients. Pimps sometimes set women up in roving vans and limousines, beeping them whenever the police are spotted.
 
Using Technology To Evade Prosecution
Escort services, which are often fronts for prostitution, are notoriously ingenious at evading prosecution. Police officials said attempts to find and infiltrate such services required a great deal of luck. The telephone numbers they use are often in locations where no prostitutes have ever set foot, instead housing only a receptionist with a bank of phones.
Donna, a 26-year-old escort who has worked for several services in the city, including one on line, said she had never met the madam of a service that calls her regularly. Its phone number, which turned out to be a beeper, was given to her by another escort she knew. When she first called looking for a job, she left her number and was quickly called back by a woman who asked her who she was and what she wanted, then told her to go to a bar in SoHo and wait.
Donna was met there by a man who asked her questions about her background and took her phone number. He gave her a key to a hotel room in mid-Manhattan and explained the rules. She was to report when available, for periods ranging from all day to one hour. The key was for a hotel room that contained a locked closet, where the money that she and other escorts made would be left.
Now, she is paged occasionally and told to go to a certain client's hotel room. Or she is told to go to the service's hotel room and wait five minutes for a man to come calling. One always does, she said.
Undercover officers say that when they do make contact with a real bordello, its operators usually tell them to call back from a pay phone before giving out their address. Someone from the operation then looks out the window to see if the client is a recognized officer.
If he is, the receptionist just hangs up. Should an officer get in the front door, he will be questioned by a worker and asked for several forms of identification before he is allowed to pass.
"They have closed-circuit cameras, lookouts and sometimes vastly superior technology," said Captain Costello, the Manhattan South vice squad officer, adding that officers often show up at an establishment to find that their cover has already been blown.
"They say they're sorry, we're closed," he said. "Then, you're just standing there looking like a jerk."
 
After Crackdowns, A Changing Market
Although prostitutes have thrived behind closed doors, their counterparts on the street have had far less luck in evading the law. The city's police crackdown on streetwalking began in 1994, when more than 9,500 prostitutes and clients were arrested. Clients found their names being published and vehicles taken away, while judges proved less likely to allow prostitutes back on the street without jail sentences.
Experts say the crackdown has cut the number of streetwalkers in half in some parts of the city, and repeat offenders are fewer.
The number of convictions per prostitute has also declined, with 50 percent of the prostitutes now seen by the court having no more than one prior conviction, said Michele Svirdoff, research director at the Midtown Community Court's Center for Court Innovation.
"When the court first opened, it was not unusual to see defendants who had 100 prior arrests on their sheet," she said. "Now, a majority of those we are seeing are novices. What that tells is that the market is changing."
 
Upturn in Consumerism Is Increasing Prostitution
Like any service industry, prostitution is affected by the economy, and both sociologists and prostitutes can cite numerous economic reasons that it flourishes in New York City. For one, in a city where well-paying, low-skill jobs are scarce and the unemployment rate, nearly 9 percent, is well above the national average, the lure of prostitution can be high. At the same time, experts say, demand for prostitutes has been increasing sharply now that clients have more disposable income and tourism and convention business is booming.
"Prostitution is a market-related economy, so if there is a lot of consumerism, then it grows," said Professor Moglia of New York University. "And an increase in tourism obviously increases prostitution because it is an increase in consumerism."
The operator of Redlightnet, the on-line prostitution clearinghouse, who spoke on condition that his name not be given, said more ads were coming in and more prostitutes were going on line every week.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign for safer streets, he said, had unwittingly helped his businesses. "He has generally made the streets safer for all New Yorkers and tourists, and more tourists means more hookers here to take care of them."

8 Nations Adopt Strategy on Jobs

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Russia and the world's seven top industrialized nations, the so-called G-7, adopted a jobs strategy today that seeks to combine free-market incentives with providing jobs for low-skilled workers.
Much of the group's communique, issued by labor and finance ministers after two days of meetings, sounded similar to strategies for dealing with the effect of globalization and technology debated at three previous jobs conferences. 
 However, the eight countries -- the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Italy -- promised to submit proposals detailing how they will carry out the strategy at a meeting in Birmingham, England in May.
The seven-point plan includes fostering entrepreneurship, offering incentives to welfare recipients to work, encouraging lifelong learning and loosening up on state regulations that hamper small and medium-sized businesses.

HEADLINE: Officials Say Surplus Is for Patching Budgets, Not New York

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
For the second straight year, New York City is expecting a huge budget surplus. But at the same time, its public works often seem to be on the verge of collapse, with bricks raining down from schools, streets caving in, and students learning in bathrooms in crowded schools with coal furnaces.
The question, then, naturally arises: Why not spend the city's $1.2 billion surplus to fix the city's deteriorating infrastructure, the same way a homeowner might use a bonus from work to put on a new roof? 
 But city officials are holding on tight to their extra money, saying they need it for those difficult years that are sure to come. Many lawmakers agree, despite the seemingly unending need to mend an aging city.
"Being a parent whose children went to a school that was a coal-burner, I understand their worries," said Herbert E. Berman, the chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, whose children attended Public School 203 in Brooklyn. "But as legislators, we can't spend wildly. Someone has to make the hard choices."
Nothing legally bars Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Council from dipping into the surplus to build a new elementary school in Jackson Heights, Queens, or to replace century-old water mains in lower Manhattan. In fact, the $1.2 billion surplus is so large that it could pay for 30 new schools, as well as for 200 others to have their coal furnaces converted to ones running on gas.
But officials who will decide the final shape of the city's $34.3 billion budget for the next fiscal year say that an intractable problem prevents them from such spending: the inevitability of budget deficits. Simply put, the city in most years spends more than it collects in revenues -- and those deficits are expected to return and grow. But this year and last have been exceptionally good for the city's coffers, leaving City Hall awash in money, most of it from soaring profits on Wall Street.
Officials note, however, that that stream of revenue could soon stop flowing, and they argue that the current surplus should be used to patch up deficits that are anticipated in future years. With that in mind, Mr. Giuliani last month proposed using 73 percent of this year's surplus to help close the expected budget gap of $2.1 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins in July.
The city is already planning to spend $4 billion to $5 billion annually over the next five years on its sewers, roads and buildings. That money is included in a separate capital budget. But many advocates and independent fiscal monitors say that the city's public works have fallen into such disrepair that drastic action is needed, like dipping into the surplus in its regular budget, and using that money for specific, urgent repairs.
"Given the fact that there is a surplus, spending more on critically needed infrastructure makes a lot of sense," said Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, a city-financed watchdog agency that the Mayor wants abolished. "Infrastructure improvements are an important economic development tool. When a business is looking to locate here, they're going to look around at infrastructure very broadly. Can their employees send their kids to good schools? Are the parks up to snuff?"
Even politicians who want to save the surplus for the future quickly acknowledged that the nation's oldest city has unlimited physical needs. Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat and a member of the Council's Finance Committee, pointed to the public schools -- with their decrepit buildings, crowded classrooms, and closets, bathrooms and trailers used for instruction -- as having the greatest need.
Officials cited other major needs across the city, like backed-up sewers that periodically flood southeastern Queens, an ancient water main leaking under Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, and the Third Water Tunnel, whose construction began in 1970 but was halted during the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
The city finances capital projects by issuing long-term bonds, which are repaid over 20 to 30 years, in keeping with the view that several generations of taxpayers should share the cost of rebuilding a road or bridge. And it keeps that capital budget completely separate from its $34.3 billion operating budget.
Even if it wanted to dip into that operating budget, there would be limitations: about 90 percent of it cannot be touched, because the money is used to pay for salaries, benefits and programs mandated by Albany and Washington.
So the annual debate over the budget essentially revolves around the remaining 10 percent. And the emergence of the budget surplus has intensified the debate about tapping into the operating budget for capital needs.
But experts caution that an economic slowdown or a decline in the stock market could quickly eliminate the surplus, again forcing the city to close budget deficits through unpopular measures, like cutting services or raising taxes -- something the Republican Mayor has shunned.
"Once we fix our gaps, then I'll get engaged in a debate" over how to use the surplus, Joseph J. Lhota, the Mayor's budget director, said. "But I think it's irresponsible to use that money at this point. All they're basically saying is, 'Take that money, use it for this other project and cut some other services,' without ever telling us what to cut."
The city is anticipating a budget deficit of about $2 billion to re-emerge in the next fiscal year. The gap is expected to widen at the turn of the century, with the city expected to spend more on a new contract with its municipal workers.
The city is legally bound to balance its operating budget every year. That is why Mr. Giuliani wants to use 73 percent of this year's surplus to help close next year's projected deficit, with the rest being used to finance programs and make up for revenues lost to tax cuts.
At the same time, the city is trying to patch up its aging public structures. Like many of the city's current problems, officials say those problems are rooted in the city's fiscal crisis of a generation ago, when it fell behind in maintaining its roads, bridges and other public works.
By the mid 1980's, the Williamsburg Bridge and other spans were in serious danger because they had not been painted for years, the most visible signs of the city's deteriorating infrastructure. And so the city borrowed heavily to rebuild itself, especially in the late 1980's.
Today, the city is saddled with $30 billion in outstanding debt. This year, the city is spending about $3 billion to pay interest and principal on the debt. Those debt service costs are a big cause of the anticipated budget deficits in coming years.
In fact, some fiscal monitors suggest that this year's surplus provides an opportunity to move away from its old practice of issuing debt to finance improvements of public works. Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, said the city could use the money to retire long-term debts -- or to pay cash for capital projects.
"We would support using the surplus that way if it was a really serious infrastructure need that everybody would benefit from," he said.
Mr. Criscitello, the director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said he favored earmarking some of the surplus for physical improvements to the city, instead of cutting about $774 million in taxes over the next four years, as the Mayor has proposed.
While Mr. Giuliani has argued that cutting taxes would create jobs, Mr. Criscitello said that poorly maintained parks and crumbling school buildings could send middle-class families packing -- and the city would ultimately lose their tax receipts.
It is an argument that advocacy groups for the city's public schools take even further. Pointing to a $2.4 billion state school construction bond act that was narrowly defeated in November but garnered the support of more than 70 percent of city residents, they say New Yorkers want their elected officials to spend more on schools.
Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, suggested that a third of the surplus should be spent on renovating schools and child-care centers.
As a chief financial officer, "the Mayor's plan deals responsibly, in part, with the reality of limited resources and budget deficits in the future," she said. "But for the Mayor of a city, it really does make sense to redevelop your infrastructure."

HEADLINE: Race Discrimination Furthers Income Inequality

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 17 editorial on black-white income inequality repeats the claim that "such inequality is more a problem of poor education, weak skills and the rise in single-parent families than of race." In fact, continuing racial discrimination plays an important role in perpetuating this inequality. 
 The evidence for continuing housing discrimination is strong. A 1989 national study found that blacks were shown about 25 percent fewer housing units than were equally qualified whites, and over the last four years similar studies have found no sign of a downward trend.
Discrimination in housing restricts the access of blacks to good school districts and therefore contributes to the black-white skill differential. Housing discrimination also limits the access of blacks to neighborhoods near jobs and helps confine many black households to high-poverty neighborhoods.
Studies of hiring practices have documented continuing hiring discrimination against young black men. Racial discrimination still has a lot to do with the black-white income gap, and anti-discrimination policy has a key role to play in bringing incomes closer together.

HEADLINE: NASA Must Reignite Research, Panel Says

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO fulfill dreams of exploring the solar system, finding planets around distant stars or possibly traveling to other worlds, the United States needs to invest more in key space-related technologies that no one else is developing, experts say.
One secret of NASA's recent success in using small, relatively inexpensive spacecraft to explore outer space has been in adapting existing technologies and off-the-shelf components for these budget-conscious missions, such as last year's Mars Pathfinder triumph. 
 But a panel of scientists and engineers looking into what will be needed for further exploration in coming decades says there are limits to this approach of adapting general technical know-how for space applications. If the National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants to continue meaningful research beyond the Earth in a time of constrained budgets, it says, the agency needs to explore new technology unique to its goals.
"Although NASA has recently proved adept at incorporating modern technologies into its spacecraft, the agency currently supports relatively little work in long-term space technology development," said a report published this month by a committee of the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences.
The committee of engineers, scientists and aerospace experts said NASA should devote modest, but consistent, amounts of money to several areas of research with the potential of producing unique technology for space applications. The panel identified six areas that should get priority for additional research and development, and suggested that significant advancement could be made in each field with modest investments of $3 million to $5 million a year for up to five years.
"There have been previous reports on future space technology, but they all assumed that there would be new funding for the work," said the panel's chairman, Dr. Daniel E. Hastings, chief scientist for the Air Force. "NASA asked us to tell it what to invest in, but to assume that the budget was not increasing. The agency wanted to know where it could get the most return for the modest investment it was able to make."
NASA has a history of inconsistent support of new technology, Dr. Hastings said, too often backing research with near-term, not long-range, payoffs, and following fads and changing directions every few years. "You can't make progress with this oscillation of funding, with some research getting a lot of money for a while, then little or nothing," he said. "We recommended setting a few priorities and giving them steady support until they prove themselves or not."
These are the six technological areas in which the panel said additional research and development could produce significant advances for space exploration between the years 2000 and 2020:
*High data-rate, wideband communications covering planetary distances. Instead of conventional radio communications, new systems could use microwave or optical transmissions based on laser technologies. This would require research into pinpoint tracking and pointing methods as well as high-efficiency, low-power lasers. Such systems could transmit so much more data over greater distances than traditional approaches that robots on other planets could send live, high-resolution images to Earth as they explored.
*Microelectromechanical systems for space. Microscopic sensors, gears, switches and other devices being developed for industries such as electronics and computers could be used to create small, low-cost, low-energy sensors and devices for spacecraft. Ultimately, this technology might create a new generation of miniature spacecraft that could hitchhike into space aboard larger craft or be fired into orbit by cannons or other gun launchers.
*Radiation-resistant computer memories and electronics. Radiation in space can damage computer chips and sensitive electronics, a problem made more acute as such devices decrease in size. More research could lead to new types of low-mass shielding, radiation-resistant circuitry materials and better ways to recover data disrupted or damaged by atomic particles.
*Nuclear power systems for space. To power deep space missions too far from the Sun to run on solar energy, or to produce high peak power for bases on the Moon or Mars, requires compact, durable and reliable nuclear reactors or thermoelectric generators. Research is needed on advanced nuclear systems that use less atomic fuel, are more efficient and have greater safety margins than current ones. Environmentalists and others opposed to sending nuclear material into space mounted protests in October when NASA sent the Cassini spacecraft on a roundabout journey to Saturn.
*Precision-controlled large space structures. Large, lightweight structures, including expanding antennas, inflatable supports, extendable girders, and multiple, moving telescope mirrors, are difficult to control in weightless environments. Research is needed to make them less susceptible to temperature changes, vibration and other disrupting factors. In addition, work is needed on precisely controlling the orientation and movement of these structures so that they are stable platforms for scientific instruments that must be pointed with extreme accuracy.
*Methods for extracting and using natural resources found in space. The cost of planetary exploration and establishing bases on the Moon or other worlds might be greatly reduced by developing methods of mining and refining raw materials on the site for oxygen, rocket fuel and building materials for structures. Research is needed on robotic systems to move and prepare materials, as well as on methods to process them and store the resulting products. Proponents of mounting a manned Mars mission shortly after the turn of the century espouse using this approach as a way of making it economically feasible.
The NASA official who received the new report, Samuel Venneri, the agency's chief technologist, said the conclusions were consistent with NASA's thinking and direction. "NASA is moving toward being a more aggressive research and development agency," Mr. Venneri said. "We've already taken some of the recommendations and expanded them. This report is an independent assessment of the direction we are taking of doing more research and getting out of operational areas, such as running the space shuttle system."
Mr. Venneri said the agency is spending less than the study recommended on research into nuclear power and mining resources on the moon, asteroids and other planets. "We are supporting some efforts in these areas, but have to invest less in them for now because of the priorities of other projects, such as the space station."
In other areas, such as research into building and controlling large objects in space, support well exceeds the study's recommendations, he noted.
At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and other centers, work is under way toward building large orbiting astronomical observatories, including a next-generation optical instrument to replace the Hubble Space Telescope and a Space Interferometry Mission to study the motion of stars, black holes and distant galaxies.
Dr. Stephen C. Unwin, deputy project scientist for the interferometry mission, said that with sufficient money, researchers hope to launch the observatory into orbit around the Earth's poles in 2005. Designed to be flown on a small, inexpensive Delta 2 rocket, the 3,750-pound observatory would unfurl a 35-foot-long boom holding seven telescopes with 12-inch diameter mirrors.
The spacecraft, with its telescopes operated in pairs with one in reserve, would lock onto distant guide stars and stabilize its position while measuring light falling on pairs of mirrors at slightly different times and angles. Combining light from a star or galaxy that hits separate mirrors at time differences measured in billionths of a second requires precise control, scientists say.
"We've chosen an almost circular, polar orbit to keep the spacecraft in sunlight most of the time," Dr. Unwin said. "We don't want the structure creaking or moving while adjusting to temperature changes caused by moving between shadow and sun. We need a very stable spacecraft."
Dr. Keith E. Wilson, a senior engineer in the optical communications group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said he would welcome the added research money in laser communications recommended by the study. "The work we have done so far is very promising, but we have not ironed out all of the issues," Dr. Wilson said. "With a small, added investment, we could answer many of the remaining questions."
There was a successful demonstration of some of this capability in December 1992 when the Galileo spacecraft sped past Earth on its way to Jupiter. During the Galileo Optical Experiment, narrow laser beams were sent from the Earth for the first time to a deep-space craft. Over eight days, Galileo detected light pulses from Earth at distances between 300,000 miles and 3.5 million miles away, record distances for such transmissions, Dr. Wilson said.
And in a seven-month experiment ending in May 1996, Dr. Wilson and colleagues demonstrated the first ground-to-space, two-way optical communications when laser pulses were transmitted between a Japanese satellite and ground stations a dozen times. "You can easily see the potential for optical communications," Dr. Wilson said, "and it looks very promising."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
The Fed's relatively high interest rate hasn't cut growth.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
WHILE market interest rates have fallen sharply over the last 10 months, one rate has not budged.
The Federal funds rate, which is the Federal Reserve's target for short-term interest rates, has been at 5.5 percent since last March. After adjusting for the decline in inflation, the real rate is actually more than half a percentage point higher than it was a year ago. 
 "One might have thought that would have slowed the economy," said N. Gregory Mankiew, a professor of economics at Harvard. "It is a little surprising that it hasn't."
The Fed funds target rate -- practically, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- is the Fed's main tool for guiding the economy. Higher rates make it more costly to borrow and mean less fuel for the economy.
But the best measure of how hard the Fed is pulling on the economic reins is this rate after inflation, or the real rate. If the Fed funds rate is 6 percent but inflation is 6 percent, the real rate is zero, and the Fed is letting the economy run.
The economy's strength now in the face of a relatively high real rate highlights the potential problems for Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who begins his report on monetary policy to Congress today.
Both the stock and bond markets have rallied this year on the view that economic turmoil in Asia will keep the United States economy from overheating by cutting demand for American exports. The sharp currency devaluations in Asia are also expected to curb inflation since imports from the region will be much cheaper. The consensus is that the Fed will leave its interest rate target unchanged, even though there are no significant signs of a slowdown in the 3.9 percent pace of growth last year.
But the weak tug from the high real Fed funds rate indicates that Asian influences may not slow the economy as much as many forecasters expect. Then the Fed would feel increasing pressure to keep inflation from returning by raising its short-term interest rate target, which would upset both the stock and bond markets.
The other risk is that the economy is slowed more by Asia then expected. Then real rates, which seem benign in this strong economy, could suddenly begin to bite. With high real rates acting as a drag on the economy, the Fed would have an incentive to cut its target. "If growth slowed down to 2 percent this would be the hot debate at the Fed," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "Are these real rates too high?"
The real Federal fund rate is not dragging down the economy now because consumers are spending freely, encouraged by the "wealth effect" from the stock market run-up of the last three years. The new highs being recorded by major market indexes just reinforce the trend.
Henry Kaufman, an economist and money manager, says that high real rates can have much more impact when the economy is slowing down or in a recession. Given the robust growth now, he said, "this level of real rates is not a restrictive influence."
Another factor is that many companies want to invest in new technology, causing them to ignore the higher real rates. So business investment, another important engine of growth, has kept chugging along. "This level of real rates does not slow down the robust capital spending we have had," said Wayne D. Angell, a former Fed governor and now chief economist at Bear Stearns.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, takes another tack. First, he dismisses the contention that Asia is going to lead to a major slowdown in the United States.
While the real Federal funds rates has gone up, other real rates have declined, he points out. The 10-year rate, adjusted for inflation, has fallen to 3.69 percent in January from 4.05 percent last May, while the real Fed funds rate has risen to 3.89 percent from 3.27 percent. The 10-year rate is a common benchmark for setting fixed-rate mortgages.
Mr. Greenspan noted the trend when answering questions from the Senate Budget Committee last month. The rising real Federal funds rate was effectively "tightening" monetary policy last year, he said, but the impact was not "spilling over into long-term rates."
Part of the reason other real rates have fallen, Mr. Barbera said, is that Asians have stopped borrowing. "We are not competing as much for funds," he said.
This stimulus from lower real rates can be seen in the robust housing market, he says. Retail sales are also stronger then they seem, he said, because prices, not unit sales, have fallen.
In his testimony to the Senate Budget Committee late last month, Mr. Greenspan indicated that he was depending on Asia to curb growth here. And in the December policy meeting the Fed went to a neutral stance from one that assumed that the next rate move would be up. So of the two economic risks, a stronger-than-expected economy would surprise the Fed the most.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq at New Closing High as Technology Shares Soar

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Technology stocks soared yesterday as investors brushed aside concerns about the impact of Asia's economic woes on American corporate profits, catapulting the Nasdaq composite index to a new closing high.
The technology-laden index rose 23.63 points, to 1,751.76, eclipsing its old high of 1,745.85 reached on Oct. 9 by 5.9 points. Other indexes were mixed, however, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 3.74 points, to 8,410.20, but the broader Standard & Poor's 500 up 3.93 points, to 1,038.14. 
 Many analysts viewed the Nasdaq gains as a positive sign for the overall market, paving the way for the 1998 rally to continue.
"It tells you that maybe not right away, but in time, the United States economy is going to recover from this Asian-induced soft landing," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany.
Eugene Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott, said the Nasdaq's ability to hit a new high on the heels of a string of records by both the Dow and the S.& P. "might introduce further buying and renewed investor confidence.
"Its stronger performance helps to fortify the advance that's already taken place," he said.
Several of the stocks that led the Nasdaq higher yesterday -- like Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer -- have recouped all of the losses sustained during the fourth quarter, when technology shares fell amid concerns that the economic turmoil in Asia would hurt their profits.
After falling 2.31 percent in the fourth quarter, Microsoft is up 24.9 percent so far this year; Intel is up 34.3 percent, after slipping 23.9 percent, and Dell has risen 54.9 percent, after a 13.3 percent fall.
However, Oracle, which fell 38.7 percent in the fourth quarter, has regained less than half of that loss, rising 18.2 percent this year. Also, Applied Materials, another of the index's worst performers at the end of 1997, falling 36.8 percent in the fourth quarter, has recouped only a portion of its loss, rising 24.1 percent this year.
Over all, the Nasdaq, which fell 7.35 percent in the fourth quarter, is up 11.6 percent this year.
Microsoft gained ground yesterday on investor enthusiasm for the company's 2-for-1 stock split. In moving higher, the company edged closer to becoming only the second company to have a market capitalization of more than $200 billion. Now, General Electric holds that distinction, with a value of $254 billion.
Even as the Nasdaq caught up with the other major indexes by reaching a record high, those market gauges were mixed. The Dow was dragged down by oil company shares such as Chevron and Exxon. Investors retreated from oil stocks on expectations that an agreement between the United Nations and Iraq over weapons inspections would ease concerns of oil supply shortages stemming from conflict in the Persian Gulf.
Countering the slide in oil shares was a 6-point gain by Merck, which rose 4.6 percent, to 130 5/8, on news that the Food and Drug Administration had approved the sale of a new product, the first once-a-day pill for the prevention and treatment of asthma.
Despite the strong gains in the Nasdaq, trading was muted, as investors limited their activity prior to Congressional testimony of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, which begins today.
Analysts were divided on whether the Nasdaq's run could continue.
The recent gains have been concentrated in the larger companies that make up the index, they point out, with smaller companies' stocks continuing to be sluggish.
If smaller-company shares were to begin performing better than large capitalization issues, Mr. Peroni said, "I would be a little bit more concerned" that investors were willing to take on more risk, raising the possibility of a selloff.
But Thomas Galvin, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said he believed that the recent gains already left technology shares poised for a slide.
"We've had this Asia relief rally because technology got the most banged up in the fourth quarter, but I would tend to believe that technology has got to take a break," Mr. Galvin said. "I think the consensus view is that Asia is behind us."
But as the economies and businesses in those countries struggle to regain their financial footing, American companies may yet feel some reverberations later in the year, he said.

Pitfalls in Cutting Korea's Lifetime Work Force

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
When this country's most militant labor union shelved a potentially crippling strike early this month, fears started to fade that the chances for South Korean economic recovery would be set back by debilitating labor unrest.
But the pace and scope of change in the nation's labor practices, regarded as an indispensable part of getting the Korean economy back on its feet, are of increasing concern to foreign investors and economists. 
 If they were expecting restructuring along the lines of Eastman Kodak, AT&T, I.B.M. or scores of other American and European companies, where thousands of jobs were eliminated, they are likely to be disappointed.
The greatest barrier to sweeping job cuts in South Korea is the country's business culture, with its tradition of lifetime employment. "What you'll see will be grudging, gradualist adjustments," said Richard Samuelson, head of research at SBC Warburg Dillon Read here, "along the lines of 2 percent here, 5 percent there -- which may be followed six months later by another 2 or 5 percent."
So jobs will disappear, but not overnight.
One of the strings attached to the International Monetary Fund's $58 billion bailout of the South Korean economy was a demand for greater labor flexibility -- a euphemism for scrapping laws rigidly protecting workers from layoffs. Analysts and economists figure that the I.M.F. plan means at least a million people will lose their jobs this year, which they view as the bare minimum needed to weed out the excesses of South Korea's bloated corporations.
But reaching that number quickly, and thus hastening a recovery, will not be easy, given the tactics that South Korean companies are likely to use: "honorary retirement," similar to early retirement in the United States, and the attrition and hiring freezes that companies have been using to prune their work forces since the middle of last year.
The National Assembly has provided some help, recently approving legislation that will make layoffs easier. Under the new law, mergers and acquisitions will be the easiest way to eliminate large numbers of workers, and the law scrapped requirements that forced a company to go to court for approval -- a long and difficult process.
It is a sort of enticement for South Korea's conglomerates to consolidate, but its other main purpose is to lure investments and takeovers by foreigners.
In fact, many in the labor movement and in business think the Government is hoping that the messy, unpopular task of laying off masses of workers will fall to foreigners. "That's why this law was introduced in the first place," said Yoon Young Mo, international secretary of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which canceled the threatened strike -- although not before delivering a setback to the recovering stock market and spurring a drop in the value of South Korea's currency, the won.
"We believe the mergers and acquisitions by foreigners the law is encouraging will lead to mass dismissals," Mr. Yoon said.
Although he refused to rule out future strikes by confederation members, Mr. Yoon predicted that as unemployment soared, it would set off a panic among an increasingly desperate public with nowhere to turn for relief in a society where lifetime employment and ironclad familial loyalty had until now made a social safety net unnecessary.
But in the same way that the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions does not want to be blamed by the public for derailing a recovery, foreign investors are wary of being blamed for the economic pain the country and its citizens will undergo in the next year or two.
Perhaps that is why Citibank and Chase Manhattan, long rumored as respective suitors for the failed First Korea Bank and Seoul Bank, have put any discussions on hold for now. The prospect of cutting a significant number of jobs and then trying to sell retail banking services to those former employees' families and neighbors is daunting.
"Foreigners are going to be cautious about investing in businesses which need to be radically restructured, particularly when it comes to layoffs," said Michael S. Brown, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.
While public unrest could show up in strikes, business and labor leaders say that President-elect Kim Dae Jung, a former political prisoner who has long been aligned with the labor movement, is well positioned to mediate.
To understand how deep Mr. Kim's ties to labor lie, consider the sentiments of Ahn Pong Sul, director of the international department of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the largest labor organization, with 1.5 million members. "If we had not elected him," Mr. Ahn said in an interview, "I would have left this country because there would have been no hope for me and my family."
Mr. Kim was possibly the only South Korean politician capable of coaxing labor to sit down at a table with management and Government officials and hammer out the blueprint for revamping the economy that led to the new legislation -- which also includes significant and painful changes for corporations and steep budget cuts for the Government.
Once all parties signed off on the blueprint, reneging became extremely difficult. Almost immediately after it was signed, all sides expressed dissatisfaction with it, so the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions' threat to strike because it objected to certain provisions seemed churlish.
The agreement, the first of its kind in the country's history, is expected to act as a restraint on the labor movement. "I don't expect labor to attempt to disrupt the economy because that would be the opposite of what everyone is working to accomplish," said Lee Yong Hwan, executive director of the Federation of Korean Industries, a business organization. "Times have changed; the militant labor union is not as militant as it was two or three years ago."
Mr. Ahn of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions put it a different way. "Please remember that Asia, including Korea, is rooted in Confucian values that emphasize harmony and respectful relations among different classes and peoples," he said. "In difficult situations, those values get stronger."
How to rapidly change the economy without engaging in mass layoffs remains a quandary, however. The Government, which insisted on the layoff legislation, sent a conflicting message a few days ago, when Labor Minister Lee Ki Ho warned of "harsh retaliation" against employers who abused the new law.
Given the law's stringent requirements, including a 60-day notification to union representatives, full severance pay for laid-off workers and a promise to hire them back once business improved, making use of it in the way that the I.M.F. intended may be difficult.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Weighs Merger And Cuts Jobs

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company, frustrated in its efforts to become a major investment banking concern, said yesterday that it would consider a merger, a once unthinkable option for a company that has historically prided itself on determining its own fate. The company also said that it would dismiss about 5 percent of its employees, or some 700 people.
In an internal memo circulated yesterday at the New York headquarters of Morgan, the company's chairman and chief executive, Douglas A. Warner, said that a merger with another institution was "an option" that the bank was considering in an effort to vault to the top of the investment banking world. Bank advisers said that Morgan has been seriously considering a big merger in recent weeks but that no transaction was imminent. 
 The memo also said that layoffs were necessary "so that expected revenue growth exceeds expense growth" in 1998. But even with the job cuts, Morgan does not expect to reduce its overall expenses sharply, a sticking point with analysts who have long complained that the bank's operating budget is bloated.
The layoffs are expected to occur over the next two weeks and will affect employees worldwide and in every line of business. Morgan laid off about 5 percent of its employees, or about 850 people, in early 1995. At that time the bank employed about 17,000 people. Today it employs about 14,000 people.
Bank advisers see Goldman, Sachs & Company as one of the most ideal partners for Morgan, but Goldman's more aggressive company culture and the fact that Goldman executives would want to run the combined concern are considered to be likely deal breakers. Other potential merger partners include the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Credit Suisse Group. Although there was speculation recently that Deutsche Bank A.G. was considering a merger with Morgan, bank advisers said no such talks were taking place.
For his part, Mr. Warner has not found a partner that suits him. His memo said that "no strategic merger yet envisioned matches the promise of our own growth strategy if we execute it successfully."
The problem for Morgan, however, is that it has yet to execute its strategy of transforming itself from a traditional commercial bank into an investment bank as successfully as it needs to do. Investment banking's leaders -- Merrill Lynch & Company, Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and Goldman -- still dominate such businesses as stock and bond underwriting and mergers and acquisitions, so it will not be easy for any company to steal market share from them.
That is not to say that Morgan has not made substantial strides reinventing itself from a legendary, blue-chip bank that once held uncontested access to the cream of America's corporate giants.
In 1980, when Morgan began pursuing investment banking opportunities, about half of its revenue came from such traditional businesses as corporate lending and advising clients on the outlook for interest rates. In recent years, about 75 percent of its revenue has come from new lines of business like trading and underwriting.
Indeed, Morgan is so proud of its accomplishments that Mr. Warner keeps a laminated newspaper article in his office commemorating the date eight years ago when regulators first gave the bank permission to underwrite stocks.
But while the bank now has a more diverse and sophisticated financial arsenal at its disposal, the company has not risen to the top of the investment banking business and its profitability has been sacrificed in the process.
Morgan recently reported fourth-quarter profits of $271 million, a 35.3 percent drop from the $419 million the bank earned in the fourth quarter of 1996. For all of 1997, Morgan earned $1.465 billion, down 6.7 percent from the $1.57 billion it earned in 1996.
Mr. Warner noted in his memo that Morgan's stock price "is lagging competitors' and some observers have questioned the viability of our strategy." He pointed to the bank's problems in Southeast Asia -- Morgan recently recognized $587 million in Asian currency swaps as nonperforming and is embroiled in a rancorous legal dispute with South Korean companies involving such swaps -- and bloated expenses as the culprits dragging down the stock. The Bankers Trust New York Corporation, another bank with heavy Asian exposure, is also considering layoffs in its Asian operations and Chase Manhattan expects some substantial layoffs this year.
"Stronger financial results must be a priority," Mr. Warner said in the memo. The bank plans to focus on derivatives trading, risk management, asset management, emerging markets, mergers and acquisitions, and stock and bond underwriting. It is not clear what will happen to such businesses as public finance.
While there has been talk within Morgan of another major reorganization of senior executives following a reshuffling that took place in December, there is no sign that a shake-up is planned. But Morgan employees say that the bank's presidency, a position currently held by Mr. Warner, is likely to be awarded to another person at the bank because Mr. Warner is believed to have too many demands on his time. Leading candidates for that job are Peter Hancock, who oversees the bank's fixed-income and credit businesses, and Ramon de Oliveira, head of Morgan's asset management business.

TV's Olympic Ads: Straight From Dullsville

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Now it can be told. As if all the reasons viewers shunned CBS's coverage of the 18th Olympic Winter Games weren't enough to chill network executives, there was yet one more: dreadfully dull commercials.
Oh sure, the network's presentation was lackluster and few if any athletes stood out amid the parka-clad crowds. Yes, events were postponed repeatedly by bad weather and delayed because of the 14-hour time difference with Japan. And it may be true that Americans are no longer willing to devote three hours or more an evening to watching teen-agers on ice skates. 
 But the myriad shortcomings of the Games -- evident apparently even to CBS, which played "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" during the closing credits on Sunday night -- were more than matched by the poor performance of Madison Avenue. One advertiser after another flopped, failed or fizzled, turning in showings that made Todd Eldredge and Alberto Tomba seem like champions by comparison. To put it another way, marketers treated consumers the way members of the United States men's hockey team treated their rooms.
The pedestrian and uninspired results of the Olympic competition among advertisers, coming so soon after the paucity of breakthrough spots during Super Bowl XXXII, proved again that the evil of banality may be more inimical to pitching products than all the complaints about clutter, overcommercialization or ratings shortfalls that required the running of additional "make-good" ads.
Now it's time to award imaginary medals in this column's post-Olympics advertising review. Some of the horrifying commercials received the feared lead medal for base, and debased, performance. Some of the many spots that rang falsely were presented tin medals. Not surprisingly, only a handful qualified for gold.
Here are a baker's dozen examples of how advertisers and their agencies fared:
AMERICAN AIRLINES -- A young woman working for the American Airlines unit of the AMR Corporation fawned over a corporate fat cat traveling in first class whose daughter has given birth. Her gushing over her wealthy customer was obsequious enough to turn die-hard Republicans into committed Communists. Lead. Agency: Temerlin McClain, part of True North Communications.
CBS -- Some promotional spots for the CBS network unit of the CBS Corporation were cute, particularly one that spoofed the Apple Computer "Think different" campaign by urging viewers to "Think funny." But commercials with Olympic themes fell flat, especially those replete with lame stereotypes about the French (they like cheese and Jerry Lewis, dislike bathing) and Italians (they act like cast members of "The Godfather"). Lead. Agency: in-house.
DIET COKE -- The Coca-Cola Company's second-most-popular product was reduced to an irrelevant prop in two sets of somnolent serial spots about a father's awkward dialogue with his daughter and a son being cross-examined by a pair of puzzled (and puzzling) parents. Lead. Agency: Wieden & Kennedy.
EASTMAN KODAK -- Commercials for Max film from the Eastman Kodak Company showed how conventional "problem-solution" advertising could be effectively freshened. The pitfalls of using the wrong film were dramatized on a picture-taking trip through Hollywood as Burt Reynolds came out as "Blurred Reynolds" and a photograph of Doris Day's signature at the Chinese Theater turned into "Wrong time of day." Gold. Agency: Ogilvy & Mather, a unit of WPP Group.
FORD -- An image campaign for the Ford-brand vehicles sold by the Ford Motor Company, featuring the preternaturally avuncular actor John Corbett as pitchman, offered a pastiche of "Our Town," "Northern Exposure" and "A Prairie Home Companion," seemingly set at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. The campaign carries the theme "Built to last"; let's hope it isn't. Tin. Agency: J. Walter Thompson Detroit, part of WPP.
FRITO-LAY -- A spot for the Frito-Lay unit of Pepsico Inc. presented a curious cross-cultural clash, pitting a Jewish waiter in a delicatessen against an all-American customer who dared eat Deli Style Lay's potato chips in his restaurant. Oy vay! Lead. Agency: DDB Needham New York, part of Omnicom Group.
JOHN HANCOCK -- A moving spot for the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, shown only during the opening and closing ceremonies, eschewed selling policies for an emotional appeal to raise funds for the Sarajevo Olympic Children's Fund, which seeks to rebuild the city that played host to the 1984 Winter Games. Gold. Agency: Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
KFC -- A commercial that delightfully debunked traditional paeans to the Olympic spirit by showing how people crowded into a living room to watch "Susie's big night" of skating on television could be quickly and easily distracted by a sale on fried chicken. Gold. Agency: Young & Rubicam Advertising.
McDONALD'S -- One commercial, spoofing teary Olympic tributes, elicited laughter when a skater's parents turned out to be too busy eating you-know-where to catch her performance. (Was she named Susie?) But other spots about hockey and skiing were as much fun as a visit to a drive-through window with a malfunctioning microphone. Tin. Agency: DDB Needham Chicago, part of Omnicom.
MICHELOB LIGHT -- A commercial centered on a mystery involving the Michelob Light brand of beer sold by the Anheuser-Busch Companies was as fascinating and absorbing as Jim Nantz, the CBS Olympics host. (And speaking of mysteries, who hired him?) Tin. Agency: Leap Partnership, a unit of the Leap Group.
TYLENOL -- This commercial from Johnson & Johnson, centered on vignettes of people overcoming pain, seems to have been translated from English to German to Japanese to English. An announcer proclaims "We are Tylenol," then intones such puzzling phrases as "How we care is who we are" before concluding that Tylenol is "the most trusted strength in pain relief." Tin. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi, part of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C.
U.P.S. -- Several commercials for United Parcel Service that were centered on Olympic themes delivered little of interest. One spot celebrated the "snowlets," those annoying symbols of the Winter Games, by showing how popular snowlet merchandise had become in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. What, is the Asian economic crisis over already? Another spot cheered on an athlete who was a U.P.S. driver by day and a "speed-hungry, bobsledding missile" by night. Commuters along his route must pray he never confuses day for night. Lead. Agency: Ammirati Puris Lintas, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
WENDY'S -- Here were spots for consumers who like their commercials more stuffed than a Wendy's baked potato. One commercial was overcrowded with R. David Thomas, the founder of Wendy's International Inc., plus various hockey players, the former hockey star Cam Neely and a plug for an in-store game called "Go for the Goals." Lead. Agency: Bates USA, part of Cordiant Communications Group P.L.C.
Will the woes of the 1998 Winter Games affect coming competitions? While advertisers and agencies are likely to try using the problems CBS confronted in Nagano as leverage to pay less for commercial time, giant global marketers -- including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, the AT&T Corporation and Visa International -- are already planning their ad ploys for future Olympics. The Summer Games in 2000 are appealing because they will be played in photogenic Sydney, Australia. And the next Winter Games, in 2002, will be played in Salt Lake City -- and American venues typically mean higher American ratings.

The quality of the commercials that appeared constantly during the CBS coverage of the Winter Olympics varied widely. If the spots could have won medals like athletes, here is how some might have fared.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Rally on Defused Iraqi Crisis Is Short-Lived as Dollar Falls

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
An early bond market rally on the defused Iraqi crisis faded yesterday and left prices lower for the fourth day, hurt by weakness in the dollar and apprehension about the Congressional testimony today by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Unfounded rumors that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin had resigned also contributed to the selling. 
 The 30-year bond fell 14/32, to a price of 103 5/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to a nearly two-week high of 5.90 percent, from 5.87 percent Friday.
The bond market derived some early strength from the accord that eased the threat of a United States-led attack on Iraq. Oil prices plunged to nearly four-year lows on that news, viewed by bond traders as a sign of reduced inflationary pressure.
But bond prices reversed course as the Iraqi news caused a sharp fall in the dollar's value. As the threat of an imminent conflict eased, the bond market turned attention to Mr. Greenspan's twice-yearly report to Congress on the economy.
Some traders said his remarks could pose a risk to bonds if he did not reiterate his fears about the economic crisis in Asia.
Mr. Greenspan has said that Asia's financial problems could result in a United States economic slowdown and deflation, but so far the impact from Asia has been slight.
Another uncertainty that emerged was the impact of the Labor Department's report on January consumer prices, to be reported today.
Although many traders expect the Consumer Price Index to offer further evidence of benign inflation, as the Producer Price Index report did last week, they were not confident enough to buy bonds on that assumption. Others, however, suggested bonds represented a buying opportunity.
"Even if we get a negative surprise in the C.P.I. report, many investors are sure to take comfort in the apparently favorable developments in Iraq over the weekend," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Accord With Iraq Pushes Oil Prices Down to 1994 Levels

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil fell sharply yesterday after Iraq and the United Nations Secretary General signed an agreement allowing the inspection of weapons sites, staving off for the present the prospect of United States air attacks and the risk of an interruption of oil supplies.
Yesterday's price decrease -- crude oil futures fell 87 cents, or more than 5 percent, to $15.37 a barrel -- wiped away the last of the rise in prices late in January as expectations of an attack grew. That brief surge now looks more like a blip as yesterday's drop continues a pattern of much of the last year, in which prices have fallen by more than one-third, pushing them down to levels not seen since early in 1994. 
 That has benefited drivers, with prices for 87-octane unleaded gasoline falling below $1 a gallon in some cities. But share prices of oil and oilfield-service companies fell yesterday as analysts and investors calculated that lower retail prices could squeeze earnings.
To be sure, some analysts predicted that prices could not stay at current levels, particularly as demand increases with the approach of spring and summer, when Americans drive more.
But in the short term, they said, prices could drop a bit further before rebounding, amid heavy worldwide supplies. This has been caused in part by a decision in November of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production to 27.5 million barrels a day from 25 million. Though some members of OPEC were already producing more oil than their quotas called for, the increase in the ceiling has only added to supplies.
An unusually mild winter in the United States, which has reduced the need for heating oil, declining demand in Asia amid the economic crisis and growing production from oil regions like the North Sea have all contributed to plentiful supplies.
There is also the prospect of more oil being pumped. The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution last week that would allow Iraq, under an oil-for-food program, to export $5.2 billion worth of crude oil over a six-month period, compared with the previous limit of $2 billion.
That would enable the Iraqis to pump far more than their current level of roughly one million barrels a day. Some industry experts, however, question whether the country could increase output significantly, at least initially, because its oil equipment has badly deteriorated in the seven years of economic sanctions since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Though there are oil-industry economists who expect prices to drop as low as $14 a barrel, there are reasons why prices at that level may be short lived.
Demand for gasoline and other oil products has remained strong, particularly in the United States, and could eat into global supplies. Also, there are signs Saudi Arabia, which is now producing about 8.6 million barrels a day, might be willing to cut back to help shore up the price.
Ali Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, suggested last week that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should start reducing their production. He said that if other OPEC countries signaled a willingness to reduce output, his nation's officials would be willing to sit down with the others to see what further cuts might be required.
"The Saudis are willing to do something, but they don't want to be first," said Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for BT Alex. Brown. But for big producers like Venezuela and Nigeria, as well as Saudi Arabia, where so much public and private revenue is dependent on oil prices, he said, "The pain will ultimately become unbearable, and they will cut a deal to cut production."
James T. Colburn, vice president for energy options at ED&F Man International, a major oil-trading firm, said it would take relatively little -- perhaps a cut of about a million barrels in the OPEC output of 28 million barrels a day, including quota cheating -- to make an impact. "They would not have to cut too much to have this thing pick up again," Mr. Colburn said.
Still, the short-term outlook for low prices depressed oil stocks yesterday. Exxon fell $1.8125, to $62.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Mobil was down $2 to $70. Amoco lost $1.25, to $83.3125, and Chevron dropped $2.1875, to $77. A service company, Schlumberger, was down $2.4375, to $72.0625.
Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron, said he was still betting that later this year the price of crude oil will have risen to the $18-to-$20-a-barrel range.
Thus, his company and other major producers are not planning to cut back on their exploration budgets at this point. "I think this a short-term drop in prices," Mr. Derr added.
Whether drivers will continue to enjoy low gasoline prices is also uncertain.
Michael Canes, chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, the major industry trade group, said that while further drops in crude oil could bring prices at the pump down, drivers were also burning gasoline at a fast pace.
The demand for gasoline was up about 3 percent in January, compared with that a year earlier, he estimated. If such strong demand continued, it could eat up the current high inventories of refined petroleum and retail prices could rise sharply when the seasonal increase in driving begins in March.

Want to Play In New York? Ask Politely

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
WITH the Grammy Awards being held tomorrow night at Radio City Music Hall, it's none too soon to wonder if the recording industry's big show will move to another city next year and become, as a headline writer put it, the Scrammys.
As you may know, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been singing "Hit the Road, Jack" a lot lately. He feels that Michael Greene, the in-your-face chief of the awards presentation, has done insufficient penance for supposedly screaming obscenities and threats at a mayoral assistant. 
 It does sound as if Mr. Greene's behavior was off the charts. But he tried to make nice by sending the aide roses. She threw them back. He then said, "I'm sorry if I offended anyone." Not good enough, the Mayor said yesterday, calling it a "phony apology." He wants an act of full contrition, something closer to the journey to Canossa that Emperor Henry IV made in 1077, when he appeared in penitent's garb before Pope Gregory VII. That, Mr. Greene suggested yesterday, is not about to happen.
What elevates this above a mere spat is that Mr. Giuliani has said the Grammys can go back to Los Angeles, and the heck with their estimated $40 million contribution to the local economy. Shades of last year when the Mayor said he didn't give a hoot if the United Nations left town, taking with it the $3 billion-plus a year that diplomats spend here. (Despite his fondness for "The Godfather," he has a way of standing a line from that movie on its head. Sometimes at City Hall, it isn't business; it's strictly personal.)
Should the Grammys indeed leave New York, "we'll replace that with three other things in a day," the Mayor said. Oh? Like what? So far, he hasn't elaborated.
It would be lovely if the city could wrest the National Spelling Bee from Washington, especially since the reigning champ is a Brooklyn girl, Rebecca A. Sealfon. The much-reviled gathering of the Tailhook Association might make a nice catch. It would show patriotism and faith in the power of redemption. The Modern Language Association's conference, last held in Toronto, is always welcome.
But let's be realistic. It may not be easy to replace an extravaganza like the Grammys, which not only brings in millions of dollars but also allows the city to show itself off before a global television audience of 1.5 billion.
Then again, who knows? Maybe the Mayor has a $40 million surprise up his sleeve. Maybe the Grammys will stay put. Anything can happen in a city as hot as New York, where even a report about flourishing prostitution can be seen as good news. Moralists may take offense. But if prostitutes do well, it means conventioneers and tourists are pouring into town.
ON a different track, the city's fortunes are also reflected in the huge number of out-of-towners applying to the leading private colleges here, Columbia and New York University. The latest figures were announced this month, and they are truly startling.
Columbia College has 12,111 students seeking a mere 955 places in the class of 2002. Applications are up by 39 percent just since 1995. N.Y.U. reports having received about 24,500 applications for 3,000 freshman spots, a 16.5 percent increase from 1997 and a remarkable rise of 115 percent in six years.
Certainly, the two institutions are attractions in themselves. But give Mr. Giuliani credit. Both schools say that the safer, cleaner and livelier New York on his watch is where young people want to be, with their parents' blessing. For L. Jay Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president and a history professor, it evokes visions of pre-Renaissance Paris and Florence.
"Universities in cities have returned to their medieval roots," he said. "They're places of choice for people from all over."
Some might say his school has done almost too good a job. It has drawn so many students from other places that New York City supplies only 20 percent of its undergraduates. To help keep the N.Y. in N.Y.U., the school recently created 20 scholarships for locals, with money from the real-estate developer Lew Rudin, class of '49. It's a start, Dr. Oliva said, to make sure that New York does not lose more ground.
Of course, should the city fall on hard times, the universities might be sitting less pretty, too. "But you also know," Dr. Oliva said, "that this city bounces and rebounds," which, to return to the original subject, is probably worth remembering should this personalized tiff with the Mayor cause the Grammys to hit the road.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Solution for Byproduct of Uranium

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: PADUCAH, Ky., Feb. 20

 BODY:
The Federal Government has been storing a uranium byproduct for so long that some of the 28,000 cylinders stacked in an open yard here are labeled "M.D.," for Manhattan District, leftovers from the project that built the first atom bomb.
After years of studying what to do with its 1.2 billion pounds of the byproduct, depleted uranium in a toxic compound known as uranium hexafluoride, the Energy Department has chosen a solution and this week opened hearings on the plan. 
 The plan is to empty the more than 46,000 cylinders stored at processing plants here in Paducah in the far west of Kentucky near the Illinois border, at Oak Ridge, Tenn., and at Piketon, Ohio, and chemically convert the uranium into safer, more stable forms -- "when economically feasible." That means when the department finds a buyer for the material. And that, say experts, probably means never.
"Is there somebody we can sucker into this?" John A. Volpe, manager of the radiation health and toxic agents branch of the Kentucky Health Department, said at the first hearing, on Thursday. "Maybe somebody inside the Beltway -- there isn't anybody out here."
Presenting options, Charles E. Bradley Jr., the Energy Department program manager for the uranium, listed a variety of possible uses for the uranium cited over the years. But, Mr. Bradley acknowledged, "none of these have yet panned out."
While the department looks for a market to defray the cost of processing the material, estimated at $2 billion to $4 billion, the cylinders, which weigh up to 14 tons each, are sinking into the dirt, where they rust even faster. When a cylinder rusts through, a toxic smoke leaks out.
Today a crew of workers, with a hoisting machine adapted from the logging industry, gingerly lifted one 30-year-old cylinder off its rotting wooden supports, gave it a quick inspection and stacked it nearby on a new concrete stand. The cylinder was one of about 35 they would move today, with thousands already moved and thousands ahead, the leftovers from more than half a century of making uranium fuel.
Removing toxic hydrogen fluoride from the compound and converting the uranium to an oxide or metal form would cost up to an estimated $80,000 a cylinder. Scraping and repainting the cylinders -- most of which are 4 feet in diameter and 12 feet long -- would cost about $1,600 each. So instead they build concrete supports and re-stack them.
Recently the Government signed a contract to paint about 10,000 cylinders in the next 5 years. But at that rate it would take more than 40 years to paint them all, and the new paint lasts only 10 to 12 years.
The material is what is left after a gaseous diffusion plant removes as much as possible of the uranium that is easy to split in a reactor, U-235. That leftover is U-238. For a while nuclear engineers hoped to build breeder reactors, which could turn U-238 into a useful fuel, plutonium. But no one is building breeders.
Another possible reason for saving the material was to scavenge the remaining U-235 in it by using a new processing method. But virgin uranium is so cheap, and the demand so much lower than once projected, that such use is doubtful, too.
Some engineers still hope that the depleted uranium, which is 30 percent denser than lead, could be used in industry, perhaps as shielding for spent nuclear fuel. The material itself is slightly radioactive.
But people outside the Energy Department doubt that a market will develop. With no attractive alternatives -- and with the Government explaining that no serious accidents have occurred and none are likely but that hydrogen fluoride can damage lungs or cause death -- reaction at the hearing was not friendly.
"We are faced with a critical health, environmental and economic crisis that could have been avoided," said Kristi Hanson, a resident of Brookport, Ill., across the Ohio River from Paducah.
Eugene E. Hoffman, a metallurgist who retired from the Energy Department Oak Ridge operations office in 1996, has studied the cylinders. "Their uses are fictitious," Mr. Hoffman said at the hearing.
He urged converting the material before the area is struck by an earthquake. Even without an earthquake, Mr. Hoffman said, the cylinders are now so rusty that the walls of some are no longer thick enough to ship them legally over highways.
Other hearings are set for Tuesday in Oak Ridge, Thursday in Piketon, Ohio, and March 10 in Washington.
Even though some of the material is half a century old, it is considered a resource material rather than a waste, and so Federal law does not require a plan for disposing it.
Engineers here say that while the rust may be ugly, only seven cylinders have leaked. The cylinders stand in undulating rows where they have caused depressions in the ground. On warm days the cylinders snap and pop as the contents go from a solid to a gas to a solid.
The Federal Government is spending $41 million this fiscal year on cleaning up chemical and radiological problems around the site, and wants $71 million for the effort by 2001. But that plan does not address the cylinders.
Carl R. Frode, Jr., the Environmental Protection Agency expert assigned to the environmental restoration efforts at Paducah, assessed the situation this way: "You can't leave the uranium cylinders sitting out there and say, 'Bye, we're done.' "

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE ALLIES;
Europeans Offer Praise For Accord With Iraq

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
European allies warmly hailed the accord brought back from Baghdad tonight by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Even before President Clinton had given his view on the agreement, President Jacques Chirac of France approved of it. In a 35-minute telephone call, the two leaders agreed that it was all right, said Mr. Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna. 
 "According to the information now in their possession, the accord which was signed appears to comply entirely with the United Nations resolutions and abides by the recommendations made by the five permanent members of the Security Council," she said.
More skeptically, the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, expressed the hope that noncompliance by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, would not again produce weeks of diplomatic impasse and hesitation to use force.
"It is absolutely essential that we are not back in this position in a few weeks' or a few months' time," Mr. Blair emphasized tonight, saying that Britain would push for a Security Council resolution authorizing a military response if Mr. Hussein failed to live up to the terms of the accord reached this weekend.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook added, "If there had been no pressure on Saddam, we would not have got a deal out of Saddam."
Foreign ministers of the 15 European Union countries, meeting in Brussels today, gave their blessing to the accord.
"It seems that the decisive appeal from the international community has been met, the appeal for unlimited access to all inspection sites," said the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel.
The German Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, speaking more cautiously, said, "The text has to be examined, and above all, we need to see in practice that Saddam Hussein holds to the promises he has made."
Gunter Verheugen, a foreign policy spokesman for the German Social Democratic opposition in Parliament, said: "World opinion will mean that this deal must be accepted. The Americans would find themselves in dangerous isolation if, pointing to some trifling detail or another, they insisted on a military strike."
Russia, which had opposed the use of force in the crisis, welcomed Mr. Annan's success. "We worked constantly," President Boris N. Yeltsin said. "From the very beginning we were for a diplomatic solution to the crisis."
An official Russian Foreign Ministry statement that said the agreement allowed international inspectors "full, unfettered access across the entire territory of Iraq."
But allied pressure on the United States and Britain to go easy on Iraq is expected to increase if Mr. Hussein does abide by the agreement to let arms inspectors into the "sensitive" sites from which he had previously barred them.
The French Defense Minister, Alain Richard, said that if Iraq abided by the terms of the agreement, and United Nations weapons inspections showed Iraq no longer had any nuclear, biological or chemical weapons capability, economic sactions against it should be lifted.
This, French officials say, is the only long-term incentive for Mr. Hussein to comply with the arms agreements.
Having pushed hard for both President Clinton and Mr. Hussein to agree to give Mr. Annan one last chance at diplomacy, Mr. Chirac has an enormous stake in getting the United States to accept the deal, American diplomats said. He met with Mr. Annan at dinner in Elysee Palace tonight.
France participated in the 1991 war to get Iraq out of Kuwait, but with 55 percent of the French public opposed to siding with the United States in the latest crisis, according to a poll published by the daily Le Figaro this morning, there would have been little understanding here if the United States rejects the agreement.
French newspaper and radio and television reports over the weekend portrayed Mr. Annan's trip as an effort to defuse a crisis between Baghdad and Washington.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Buying a Deal as Hussein Buys Time

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton had no real choice today.
Unwilling from the start of the latest confrontation between Washington and Baghdad to contemplate a military or a military and political campaign to drive Saddam Hussein from power, the President cast the Iraq crisis as a test of wills not between the United States and Mr. Hussein but between the United Nations and Mr. Hussein. 
 The overriding issue, Mr. Clinton declared only last week, was whether the Iraqi President would "allow the U.N. inspectors to complete their mission with full and free access to any site they suspect may be hiding materials or information related to Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction programs."
Now, presented with an agreement bearing the imprimatur of Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Clinton could hardly turn his back on it and send the bombers in.
So he bought the deal, even as he spoke of "details" that still have to be worked out and emphasized what he called "a big if": the question of whether Mr. Hussein would keep his word. The President said he would keep United States forces at a high level of preparedness, and use them if necessary.
In the short term, Mr. Clinton has avoided a risky military involvement that could have proved costly in the coin of diplomacy as well as domestic politics. In the longer term, it is not clear that he has permanently averted military action.
Nor is it clear that Iraq will soon be even reasonably free of weapons of mass destruction.
The details, officials said, could prove highly troublesome, particularly a provision that diplomats would accompany the inspectors to some sites.
"Who's going to choose the diplomats?" a senior State Department official asked. "Precisely what will their function be? Will they be able to influence how the inspectors go about their job, and where? This is a concession to Saddam, and he may find a way to make mischief with it."
Once again, the Iraqi leader has retreated, but he has bought time to move war materiel and perhaps to hide it more effectively. Few in Washington believe tonight that the last chapter of the story has been written.
Although Mr. Hussein has promised for the first time since the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to permit full access to all suspected sites, there is no assurance than he will ultimately permit it.
Unless he has undergone a conversion almost as dramatic as Saul's on the road to Damascus, he will try to preserve his arsenal. He may revert to his long-established pattern of stalling, obstructing and redefining terms. But on the other hand, he may adopt new tactics in pursuit of an old strategy.
"He clearly hasn't undergone a conversion," said Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution, who dealt with the Middle East at the National Security Council in the Bush Administration. "He will almost certainly continue to try to cheat and keep his weapons. But this time he may not try to obstruct the weapons inspectors. He may not be able to, and he may not have to.
"My guess is that during this four-month stalemate he will have dug deeper holes and found other ways to hide the stuff from inspection."
If the inspectors are obstructed, Mr. Clinton will find himself right back where he has been this month. He suggested today that since Mr. Hussein has been given this last chance to live up to his word, any violations would swing world opinion much more solidly behind United States military intervention.
Perhaps. But to accomplish that, the President would have to do a much better job of convincing the skeptics -- the French and the Russians, many in the Arab world and an indeterminate but clearly substantial slice of the American public -- that Mr. Hussein is indeed a menace to world stability in a class with Hitler, as members of his Administration have said.
At home, Mr. Clinton is likely in the coming weeks to face a continuing barrage of criticism from conservatives, many of whom believe that the Iraqi problem will be solved only when Saddam Hussein is removed from office.
This week's editorial in The Weekly Standard, one of the main conservative journals of opinion, is headlined "Attack Iraq." It argues that "a comprehensive military and political offensive aimed at removing Saddam" would have represented "a better and more easily defined course of action than the course President Clinton chose, and such a strategy remains a better course of action for the future."
Prominent Republican lawmakers agree, like Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who said this morning, "One way or another we're going to have to topple Saddam Hussein" to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction. But neither he nor other hawkish Republicans would explicitly call for the use of American troops to get the job done.
By hitching the nation's policy to the United Nations, Mr. Clinton has also left himself vulnerable to attack from those who distrust it. Although he made guardedly positive comments about the agreement, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said the President had put himself in a box.
"This is another example of how the Administration's foreign policy is subcontracted to others," he told a group of reporters at the Capitol.
But on the international front, Mr. Clinton may find himself faced with a challenge of a different sort. If Mr. Hussein has succeeded in hiding the materials needed to make weapons of mass destruction -- and experts warn that they are easily concealed -- the inspectors may find little or nothing. And if that happens, French and Russian diplomats are likely to press at the United Nations and elsewhere for the lifting of economic sanctions against Iraq.

HEADLINE: FLORIDA TWISTERS: THE DAMAGE;
Lives and Homes Destroyed In a Night of Deafening Fury

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: SANFORD, Fla., Feb. 23

 BODY:
Joel Heaton's luck finally abandoned him shortly after midnight today.
It was then that the black funnel of a tornado roared down on Freddie's Fish Camp, about five miles east of this Central Florida city, and carried away a house trailer with Mr. Heaton in it. 
 Next door, a trailer housing another single man, Fred Padgett, also sailed away with its occupant. But Mr. Padgett splashed down in the marshy waters of the St. Johns River, a few hundred yards from land. Rescuers found him before dawn, suffering cuts and broken ribs but alive, clinging to an overturned houseboat.
By evening, however, there still was no trace of Mr. Heaton, whose nickname Lucky was testimony to his history of escaping close calls. Police divers searched the murky waters near the fish camp, where anglers, mostly rawboned men who grew up in these parts, keep boats and fish for large-mouth bass in the headwaters of the river.
Tornadoes always leave caprice amid destruction, and that was the case here in Seminole County, where the police said 11 people died and scores were injured when a line of twisters danced across Central Florida around midnight.
In a neighborhood south of the Sanford jetport, a wide swath of houses and mobile homes were destroyed, while structures across a street lost barely a shingle.
The hardest-hit neighborhoods were those along a southern path to the jetport, where clusters of housing owned by people of modest means stood. Dozens of residences were smashed into rubble, with muscle cars and stout sports vehicles tossed aside like a child's playthings.
Carmen Rivera, 38, and her 12-year-old daughter, Diane, had moved into a mobile home three days ago after moving here from Bridgeport, Conn. They were aware of tornado warnings last night but were unprepared for the two minutes of terror that dipped out of the sky. The first sign of danger, Mrs. Rivera said, was the shrieking wind and windows that rattled so hard that the family knew it was experiencing more than a heavy thunderstorm.
"We were clinging to each other when the windows blew out and one wall ripped away," she recalled today as she sat in the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Sanford, where an emergency shelter was set up to provide for the newly homeless.
Across town, Brad Fauver, surveyed the ruined heap of what the day before had been an unoccupied two-story house he had remodeled. Only splintered wood and a partial foundation were left.
"I guess I did my remodeling a little too soon," Mr. Fauver said.
Sanford is considered the first population center in Central Florida, about 30 miles northeast of Orlando, where palm trees and scrub palmetto dissolve into the tall oak trees draped with Spanish moss more typical of the northern tier of the state.
Most tourists who pass through Sanford, population 36,000, are passengers on the Auto Train -- Sanford is the southern terminus of the rail system that transports cars and their drivers between here and Virginia. A devastating freeze 13 years ago laid waste to the orange groves that covered the landscape from horizon to horizon, and they and the citrus economy never recovered.
But the sprawl of the Orlando area is spilling into southern Seminole County, and the new jetport here has become the fascination of package charter flights from Britain that deliver one million tourists a year bound for Walt Disney World and other Florida destinations, local officials said.
Hurricanes occasionally sweep through this part of the state, but few residents were ready for tornadoes in late February, a season when dusty, chilly winds are expected but not the tropical storms now delivered by El Nino far away in the Pacific Ocean.
Freddie's Fish Camp is off State Road 46, where the St. John's River meets Lake Jessup. The camp lies unprotected on a spit of land flanked on three sides by water, about two acres in all, with 12 year-round residents in trailers and a small fleet of older vessels and weather-scarred houseboats.
The proprietor, Rod Goddard, 58, said he was dozing off shortly after midnight when he heard "a whistling sound coming harder and harder and harder."
"You could hear this roar and the power lines going down," Mr. Goddard said. "My wife ran out the door, and I was trying to get into my pants and follow her when it hit. The windows blew out, and the force slammed me against the wall. I couldn't get out the door."
Trees twisted and snapped, and mundane objects like lawn mowers and mailboxes became deadly missiles, he said. His black Chevy 1500 pickup truck parked in the yard took several direct hits that shredded metal fenders, crushed windows and left the vehicle pockmarked with battlefield-like wounds.
Nearer the river, a resident who identified himself only as Ernie had sought shelter in a tin-roofed pavilion on concrete pilings. He said he scrambled under a concrete picnic table as the tornado bore down, lifting the structure.
"The roof was sucked right into the sky, and debris was flying all around me" he said.
When he could crawl from beneath the branches of a tree that had landed on the picnic table, the fish camp had been transformed into a jumble of beached or overturned boats frozen in his sight by flashes of lightning.
When the survivors could gather to assess the damage no one could account for Mr. Heaton or Mr. Padgett. As the hours passed, hope that Mr. Heaton, like Mr. Padgett, would be found alive began to dim.
"We called him Lucky because he had driven a pickup truck off the road into ditches a couple of times and walked away," Ernie said as he stood barefoot and watched the police divers search. A strong western wind had picked up and dragged a new cover of clouds overhead.
"It doesn't look like he was so lucky this time" Ernie added, his eyes scanning the wind-whipped river a final time before he walked away.

HEADLINE: The Reagan Riddle

 BODY:
As President, Ronald Reagan projected optimism, conviction and nostalgia for a simpler time in America. Now retired and afflicted, he is poignantly beckoning Americans once again to recall a moment when Presidential leadership itself seemed more simple and open than it is today. The President who stood for irreducible verities like opposing Communism and unleashing "the magic of the marketplace," as he un-self-consciously put it, has been vividly captured by the two-part documentary broadcast on PBS last night and tonight. No less impressive is the program's acknowledgment that the man in the middle remains an enigma.
The program is only the latest of several recent displays of affection for Mr. Reagan. As his 87th birthday approached, normally fractious Republicans in Congress united to name an airport after him in the capital city he reviled. Cover stories in Forbes and The Weekly Standard asserted that the current economic boom should be ascribed to a Presidency that ended nine years ago. Almost everyone seems to believe that he will be known as the leader who vanquished the "Evil Empire," a phrase that shocked the mainstream when he uttered it. 
 It does Mr. Reagan's memory a disservice to suggest that his leadership was flawless or his legacy uncomplicated. He advocated balanced budgets but never submitted one. His program favored the rich over the poor, and his approach to social policy was brutish. His sweeping tax cuts of 1981 were followed by tax increases in his own term and then under Presidents Bush and Clinton, with little ill effect. The President who savagely opposed the missile treaty negotiated by his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, managed to live under its terms. His resolution in foreign policy was compromised by trading arms for hostages in Iran.
Mr. Reagan's great gifts are nonetheless worth celebrating. From the time of Teddy Roosevelt, only a handful of the nation's chief executives have pushed through their programs by sheer force of personality. At a time when many had concluded that the job was too much for one man to handle, he charted where he wanted to go, and thereby expanded the possibilities of the office itself.
Several moments in the PBS program are startling. There is the discovery by Edmund Morris, whose long-awaited biography of Mr. Reagan is due later this year, that the President's capabilities slipped steadily from the time he was shot in March 1981, for instance. But most striking is the essential loneliness and intellectual slightness of a man who had few if any intimate friendships beyond that with his wife and was blissfully unquestioning about himself and his beliefs.
"You're not going to figure him out," declares Ron Reagan Jr., in a virtual challenge to the film makers. "That's the first thing you need to know. I don't think he's figured himself out." That may be beside the point. Mr. Reagan figured out a few big, simple truths about the country, which is why Americans remember him fondly today.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: KNICKS NOTEBOOK;
Williams Is in Line To Sign a Third Time

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 23

 BODY:
You can bench him, you can put him on the injury list and you can even trade him. But you cannot get rid of Herb Williams. He is the Power Forward Who Will Not Go Away.
Showing more resilience than the Jason character from the Friday the 13th films, the 40-year-old clubhouse sage and Madison Square Garden cult hero may be within a day of rejoining the Knicks. Again. 
 "As soon as he clears waivers, we would like to come back to New York if they're interested," George Andrews, Williams's Chicago-based agent, said today. "We're talking to other people, but it wasn't exactly our plan to leave. So we wouldn't mind coming back."
On Thursday, the Knicks traded Williams for the second time in three seasons. Philadelphia, which acquired Williams in the deal for Terry Cummings, did not want him to count against its salary cap and promptly waived him. The same scenario applied in a trade with Toronto two seasons ago, and Williams returned to the Knicks a few days after playing one game for the Raptors.
With a roster spot open and team officials intimating they would like to have him return, Williams could sign with the Knicks after he clears waivers Wednesday morning.
He will not be in uniform Tuesday when New York is host to the Golden State Warriors, but he could be in time for Thursday's game against Milwaukee at the Garden.
Proving how wacky economics are in the National Basketball Association, being cut should actually improve Williams's finances. His $700,000 for this season was guaranteed, and a clause in his contract increased that by 15 percent when he was traded. If he rejoins the Knicks, he will sign a new contract, probably for $272,500 -- the pro-rated share of the minimum salary for the rest of the season -- and will end up making slightly less than $1 million.
After sitting for most of the season, Williams had a break-out game against Charlotte on Feb. 10. He played 15 minutes and had three blocked shots. The oldest player in the league, Williams has only played in 14 games and scored 15 points. But Coach Jeff Van Gundy relied upon Williams for advice and he was enough of a locker-room presence that several players voiced displeasure to the coach when he was traded.
"I think he just wants to show that there's still some life in the body," Andrews said. "He's probably got the fresh legs on the team right now, considering he really didn't play the first part of the season. Herb believes in this team. He was just starting to get some minutes.
"He's like that old car sitting in your garage. You got to kick it to get the carbon out once in a while, but it still works."
 
Buck Williams Starts Rehab
 Buck Williams, who underwent minor surgery on his left knee last week, was back at Purchase College and already beginning to rehabilitate the injury today.
The team has speculated that Williams will return between three and six weeks after the surgery -- which involved shaving away loose cartilage in the knee -- but Williams is not saying when he will be back.
"I've become a swimmer," he said, referring to his rehabilitation treatment.
Meanwhile, Larry Johnson (contusion in his right thigh) and Chris Childs (sprained left ankle) did not practice today, and both are listed as day to day. Childs limped noticeably as he left the gym at SUNY-Purchase, favoring the ankle he twisted in the second quarter of Sunday's game against Houston. Johnson was still sore after injuring his thigh in the third quarter.
 
Warriors Change Chemistry
 The Warriors, who have won three of their last five games, are still only 11-42. But Jeff Van Gundy claims the changes they made before the trading deadline -- acquiring Jim Jackson, Clarence Weatherspoon and Jason Caffey -- have helped change the team's chemistry.
"They've changed so much, they have a different enthusiasm level now," Van Gundy said. "They've made great trades, really good trades. I loved Caffey. Great rebounder. They've gotten rid of guys that didn't want to be there, which I think cleans up their locker room."
The Warriors and Coach P. J. Carlesimo are awaiting a decision in the Latrell Sprewell case.
"The thing I respect is how well he has been able to handle it, to keep coaching," Van Gundy said of Carlesimo. "And you watch their team and they have stabilized because of that."

HEADLINE: Despite Intern, President Stays In Good Graces

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
Most Americans are inclined to think that President Clinton, despite his denials, had an affair with a former White House intern. But, in the statistical equivalent of a collective shrug, most call it understandable for the President to lie about his sexual conduct, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Half the public wishes that the investigation into Mr. Clinton's relationship with the intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, would simply be dropped. By three-fourths majorities on each question, Americans said that the press had spent too much time on the issue and that they just did not want to hear about it. 
 Those surveyed sharply distinguished between private and professional conduct in the Oval Office. Many Americans expressed disappointment in Mr. Clinton's personal behavior as President, calling it worse than they expected. But an overwhelming majority, 84 percent, agreed with the proposition that "someone can still be a good President even if they do things in their personal life that you disapprove of."
Having been confronted with some details about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky over four weeks of accusations and piecemeal disclosures, the public is in no mood to let glimpses of the President's private life lower its opinion of his job performance.
With half of even Republicans and conservatives saying they are pleased with the job he is doing, Mr. Clinton has achieved the highest public approval ratings of his Presidency in the joint New York Times/CBS News Poll. His ratings have improved among all demographic groups.
Pulled aloft by record levels of public satisfaction with the economy and the direction the country is taking, the President's overall job approval rating is now 68 percent, up from 56 percent just before he delivered his State of the Union Message last month.
In another record high, 57 percent of the public view Mr. Clinton favorably, while 29 percent view him unfavorably. The telephone poll, conducted among 1,153 adults from Thursday through Saturday, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Despite their qualms about his truthfulness and personal conduct, people do not hold the President responsible for the crisis engulfing the White House. Fifty-seven percent of respondents blame Mr. Clinton's political enemies for "creating the current situation." Only 33 percent blame Mr. Clinton.
"I wasn't the biggest Clinton fan," said Patrick Lynch, a 30-year-old bartender in Glenside, Pa., who was interviewed after taking part in the poll. "But when I see all the things that he's been able to do, it just seems that someone is going to great lengths to ruin his day. Presidents in the past have done much worse."
Even among those who think Mr. Clinton is lying about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, nearly 4 in 10 think that the investigation into the relationship should be dropped.
Fifty-eight percent predicted that the Lewinsky matter would not interfere with Mr. Clinton's ability to function effectively as President.
Judging from the poll, the White House has plenty of political breathing room as it pursues its chosen strategy for dealing with Mr. Clinton's crisis, withholding information and attacking the independent prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr.
There is little public impatience about the President's resolute silence regarding Ms. Lewinsky. Just over three-quarters of the people surveyed, 77 percent, said Mr. Clinton should wait until the investigation was completed before addressing the accusations that he had an affair with her and then sought to cover it up.
Sixty-four percent called the accusations against Mr. Clinton a private matter having to do with his personal life rather than a public matter involving his job as President. Previous polls have suggested that Americans have hard experience of their own in working through the problem of adultery, with majorities saying they have known someone who was unfaithful.
"It kind of brings me down on him as a person," said Bob Vasina, a 40-year-old financial analyst in Binghamton, N.Y., addressing the accusation of sexual misconduct. "But as far as doing his job, I think it's a separate issue and doesn't affect my opinion at all. I think there are many people doing very good jobs doing what he is alleged to have done on the side."
Mr. Starr's own favorability rating remains dismal, with three times as many people expressing a negative opinion of him as offering a positive one. Perhaps taking a cue from White House attacks, 59 percent agreed with the proposition that Mr. Starr was "mostly conducting a partisan investigation to damage Bill Clinton." A month ago, only 47 percent said he was being partisan.
While saying they were uninterested in whether Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had had an affair, the public was less dismissive of the accusation that he had encouraged her to lie about it. Sixty-one percent said it was important for the public to know whether or not he had done so.
But even if it turns out that Mr. Clinton obstructed justice by lying under oath or urging Ms. Lewinsky to lie, most Americans think that matter should be dropped or that he should simply admit it and apologize. Only 21 percent favor his resignation in that situation, while 12 percent say the Congress should begin impeachment proceedings.
White House aides said Mr. Clinton's high approval rating was consistent with their internal numbers, as it is with other public polls. While they are pleased with the rise in the President's ratings, some Clinton advisers predicted that the high numbers could not be sustained, with Republicans and conservatives likely to be the first to desert him.
But, even given those anticipated defections, one Administration official argued that Mr. Clinton, through his campaigning and governing since mid-1995, has gradually built up a large enough loyal following to guarantee a bulwark of support.
"We could get Reagan down to 51 or 52," the official recalled by way of comparison, "but it was like hitting a rock with a jackhammer getting him below 51 or 52."
It is clear that the economy, considered to be in good shape by an astonishing 88 percent of the public, is a central source of the President's popularity.
Fully three-fourths of the public is pleased with Mr. Clinton's handling of the economy, a higher proportion than has approved of any President's economic stewardship since pollsters began asking this question in 1971.
"Whether it's the economy, Social Security or education," Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, said of the American people, "they know that when he gets up in the morning he rolls up his sleeves and works on the issues that affect their lives. And they've see that again and again for the last five and a half years."
Since accusations first surfaced about Ms. Lewinsky, the White House has been at pains to show Mr. Clinton as preoccupied with the people's business. Given that strategy, the timing of the crisis was favorable for the President, since it came just before his State of the Union address and the presentation of his budget proposal.
The domestic crisis also came as President Saddam Hussein was provoking another impasse over weapons inspections in Iraq. The public gave Mr. Clinton high marks for his handling of that matter, with a majority saying he had tried hard enough to achieve a diplomatic solution even before Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, announced an agreement with Iraq on Sunday. Most Americans said Mr. Clinton had explained the situation well enough for them to understand why the United States might take action.
Given their choice, most Americans said before Sunday that they would prefer to see diplomacy resolve the crisis. But if Mr. Hussein refused to back down and permit weapons inspections, 66 percent said they were in favor of bombing. Reflecting a widely held frustration with Mr. Hussein's tenacious hold on power, 58 percent said the bombing should continue until he was toppled.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Thursday through Saturday with 1,153 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for self-identified Democrats, Republicans, or independents taken as a group it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON SAYS IRAQ IS PROMISING UNCONDITIONAL ACCESS TO SITES

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that Iraq had agreed to allow United Nations weapons inspectors immediate and unconditional access throughout the country, and he began to seek British, French and Russian support for a Security Council resolution that would warn Saddam Hussein of serious consequences if the deal is violated.
In a news conference today, Mr. Clinton indicated that the agreement, reached by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Hussein, would restore free and unfettered inspections by the United Nations Special Commission, known by its acronym, Unscom. 
 Mr. Clinton said, "If fully implemented, and that is the big 'if,' this commitment will allow Unscom to fulfill its mission." Transcript, page A10.
But Mr. Clinton also warned that the details and procedures of the agreement need to be clarified by Mr. Annan. Most importantly, he said, Iraq's promise would have to be tested before the crisis could be considered over.
If Iraq reneges this time, Mr. Clinton said, "everyone would understand that then the United States and hopefully all of our allies would have the unilateral right to respond at a time, place and manner of our own choosing." In other words, although he did not say it directly, he made clear that the United States reserved the right to respond with military force.
Washington's plan is for the American aircraft carriers and troops to stay in the Persian Gulf region, perhaps for months. "At this point it would be premature to declare peace and start bringing the troops home," an official said today.
Some of the gaps in the agreement, which consists of two pages and an annex, were larger than the President implied, officials said.
The agreement is vague in several areas, including exactly how presidential sites, properties that Iraq has declared off-limits, would be inspected and what would be the precise role of Richard Butler, the chairman of the special commission. Text of the agreement, Page A10.
The officials were also unhappy that the agreement commits the weapons inspectors to respect Iraq's national security, sovereignty and dignity. If the clause is linked to the special procedures yet to be established, the Iraqis may refuse inspections on the grounds of "national security."
A senior American official acknowledged the problem, but said: "What matters more than the clarifications is the testing. You can't know if the words are a problem until the implementation is tested."
But a senior French official agreed that Mr. Hussein had made "a clear commitment to grant unconditional access for inspectors, an agreement that is strong and in writing," that violation of the agreement "will mean military action," and that "everyone in the Security Council agrees we don't want to be in a new Iraqi crisis every six weeks."
For the first time since the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, Mr. Clinton said, Mr. Hussein has acknowledged that he must keep his commitment to allow weapons inspectors working for the special commission into any site without time limits.
"But the proof is in the testing," Mr. Clinton said, and if Mr. Hussein reneges again on his commitments, "there will be serious consequences."
American officials said that "serious consequences" is a diplomatic term that is understood to mean military action. Senior American and Western officials said that a new United Nations Security Council resolution was being drafted, to be put forward this week, that it would codify the agreement and warn Mr. Hussein of the consequences.
While the Americans do not expect France or Russia to sign a blank check, officials of both countries said today that there is no confusion about the military ramifications of the resolution.
Mr. Clinton spoke today with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, President Jacques Chirac of France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain to discuss Mr. Annan's agreement and a subsequent resolution.
"If Saddam were to violate this thing now, even the Russians would not stand up for him," a senior Administration official said.
Another senior official said, "We've made clear, and the French and Russians accept, that they won't be able to hold back military action, and they recognize that, and they are prepared to join us in issuing a stiff warning to the Iraqis."
French officials said they expected American troops to remain on station in the gulf for two or three months while the agreement is tested, but American officials said they expected to be able to test it "sooner rather than later."
Mr. Annan is expected to try to clarify these gaps and other points when he briefs the Security Council on Tuesday, upon his return after a stop in Paris. Knowledgeable French officials said tonight that some "oral agreements" were clear but were not easily put into writing.
Among them, an official said, was the French suggestion that the inspection of the eight presidential sites be carried out by a new, sixth subcommittee of Unscom headed by someone appointed by Mr. Annan, but who would report to Mr. Butler, preserving Unscom's authority.
"It seems what Annan got from Saddam includes this," the official said. "But we want to hear it from him directly."
The agreement now states simply that the special groups will include experts drawn from Unscom and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which inspects nuclear matters, and would include diplomats appointed by the Secretary General. Numbers and procedures are not delineated, and the text speaks only of "specific, detailed procedures which will be developed given the special nature of the presidential sites."
Mr. Annan went to Baghdad with instructions to delineate presidential residences within the eight presidential sites, which include many other buildings. It was unclear in the text, officials said, if he had succeeded, or whether these "special procedures" had to apply to the larger sites and not merely the palaces or residences.
But the text of the agreement, after standard references to the sovereignty and dignity of Iraq, does say that "the Government of Iraq reconfirms its acceptance of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council," and that "the Government of Iraq undertakes to accord Unscom and the I.A.E.A. immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access in conformity with the resolutions."
Toward the end, the text also says, as Iraq wanted, that the lifting of tough economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 is "obviously of paramount importance."
But criticism of the deal was quick to come, with some Republicans saying Mr. Clinton had abdicated the making of foreign policy to the United Nations and could once again be snookered by Mr. Hussein.
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, voiced concern that the Administration had "subcontracted" its foreign policy to Mr. Annan.
"I was worried that this initiative by Annan was going to put the President in a box, and that's exactly what's happened," Mr. Lott said. "He's in a very difficult position now to say, 'Oh, no, this is not good enough.' "
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said he had no qualms with the United Nations acting as a mediator. "I think as long as the Secretary General is operating within a framework established by the American President, we have nothing to fear," he said.
With Congress just returning from a 10-day recess, Democrats and Republicans gave guarded comments before having examined the details of the agreement. "We can only judge those details when we see them," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
"I have grave misgivings about this," Mr. Lieberman continued. "But if in fact there is an agreement in writing that provides for unlimited access by U.N. inspectors to all of the sites in Iraq, then I think it's going to be very hard for us to do anything but to let that agreement go into effect."
Other senators complained that Mr. Hussein had badly outmaneuvered the United States. "From the outset, the U.S. believed this was a military contest, and Saddam Hussein believed it was a political fight," Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who just returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman, said in an interview. "In retrospect, he was probably right. It may be incredible for most Americans to accept, but Saddam Hussein actually won the public relations battle."
Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, spoke for many of his colleagues when he listed questions about unresolved issues:
"What is the long-term policy, and where do we go in the long run here? What will the force deployment level be? How will we guarantee compliance? What happens if he doesn't comply down the road? How do we avoid this ratcheting up on an annual basis and sort of continual tweaking that Saddam Hussein seems to enjoy putting the United States to?"

Math Is Still Tough

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Just Because Grades Are Up, Are Princeton Students Smarter?" (front page, Feb. 18) does not provide the full story. 
 A study published in 1991 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives showed the effects of grade inflation on course choice at several United States colleges and universities. It concluded that not only have grades risen in the last quarter-century but also that the rise has not been uniform: certain departments (English, political science, arts and music) inflate grades more than others (mathematics, chemistry, economics).
This split is especially problematic for encouraging the study of the physical sciences and other low-grading disciplines. Students may retreat from a subject based on inflated grades elsewhere.
The obvious solution is the uniform deflation of grades across all departments. But no single university will enforce grade deflation unless alldo.

HEADLINE: Professors Fear to Grade Harshly;
Maybe They Earned It

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 18 front-page article portrays Princeton as a glorified summer camp where a 4.0 grade point average is the norm. Anecdotal evidence like the comments of four students who referred only to a few English classes cannot properly represent the university as a whole. 
 Princeton should not be singled out simply because it chose to investigate a national trend. Grade inflation is an issue that affects many universities, and Princeton is by no means the most egregious offender. You failed to mention one other hypothesis: quite possibly some students work hard and deserve the high grades they earn.

New System Needed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You report (front page, Feb. 18) that Dartmouth College, in order to combat grade inflation, will be providing the mean grade and class enrollment along with students' grades on college transcripts. Such policies do little to address the limits of a linear grading system, which reduces education to the level of a horse race. 
 If the goal of grades is to provide an honest evaluation as well as a system of ranking, then a revision of the system is required. There are alternatives like the narrative evaluations used at Hampshire and Antioch Colleges and the portfolio assessments used by some secondary schools.
Thoughtful changes to the grading system at Princeton could have a positive effect on schools throughout the country.

HEADLINE: Arrogance on NATO

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 17), in arguing against NATO expansion, makes strong points about Russia, nuclear weapons and the big world picture yet overlooks others. 
 Russian history shows a pattern of imperialism and aggression. The vulnerable countries of Eastern and Central Europe could be fair game once again in the future. Imagine that it's 2003, and Russia's economy and world prestige continue to founder. A neo-nationalist regime concludes that re-establishing the Soviet Union and its satellites is necessary.
With awesome tank forces and mobile ground units, a move by Russia into a weakly defended Budapest, Warsaw or Prague overnight is again plausible. There would be lots of screaming from the United Nations and Western countries, but Russian troops would already be dug in and a puppet leadership installed as the screaming continued.
However, if these countries were NATO members, the Western response would be immediate. Russia is the aggressor in the face of weakness. In the face of a formidable defense, it can be expected to stay home.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says 2 Chinese Offered Organs From the Executed

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

 BODY:
In an undercover operation that officials say could confirm suspicions about human rights abuses in China's prisons, Federal authorities in New York City have arrested two men, including one who claimed to be a former Chinese prosecutor, on charges of conspiring to arrange transplants of kidneys and other organs taken from the bodies of executed Chinese inmates.
Federal officials said yesterday that the case could provide the first evidence documented by the United States Government of what Chinese dissidents have long described as a thriving -- and in the United States, at least, illicit -- trade stemming from the harsh treatment of prisoners there. 
 The two men, Cheng Yong Wang, who described himself as a former prosecutor on Hainan Island, China, and Xingqi Fu, a Chinese citizen who lives in Flushing, Queens, were arrested on Friday after an F.B.I. agent posing as a medical executive met with them in New York.
During the meeting, Mr. Wang offered to sell kidneys from prisoners who had been executed in China and arrange for American patients to have the transplant operations in China, according to a Federal complaint filed in District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Wang told the undercover agent that working with Mr. Fu he could also supply corneas, at $5,000 a pair, to doctors who wanted to transplant them in the United States, and that he could obtain pancreases, livers, lungs and skin, the complaint said.
The F.B.I. mounted the sting operation shortly after receiving a tip from a well-known human rights activist, Harry Wu, who said in an interview that he secretly videotaped a meeting with Mr. Wang on Feb. 13 in which Mr. Wang first discussed kidney transplants.
Mr. Wu, identified in the complaint only as Person A, added that Mr. Wang also said he could guarantee access to the organs of at least 50 of the 200 prisoners executed on the island province of Hainan each year. Mr. Wu said Mr. Wang told him that the kidney transplant operations would cost $20,000 to $30,000 at Chinese hospitals, much less than they would cost in American hospitals.
The State Department said in a recent report that there have been credible allegations from human rights groups and former Chinese inmates that the organs of some executed prisoners have been removed and sold. Mr. Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps for criticizing China's leadership and is now an American citizen, has been urging the Clinton Administration for several years to put pressure on the Chinese Government to halt the practice.
Despite a scattering of press reports suggesting that people from other Asian countries have eagerly sought such transplants, the Chinese Government has long denied that the practice is widespread. Chinese officials contend that the transplants occur on a limited basis, and only when the prisoners or their families have given their consent.
But Mr. Wu said Mr. Wang disputed this in one of their conversations, saying that prisoners generally "have no political rights, so we don't ask." A State Department spokesman said yesterday that "we're naturally concerned about these allegations, and we're looking into it."
Mr. Wu and other rights activists, including Amnesty International of London, also have expressed concern that as the number of death sentences rises in China, to an estimated 6,000 a year, even people convicted of crimes like robbery and counterfeiting are being sentenced to death, and this could help expand the trade in body parts. The press office at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a call for comment yesterday.
Mr. Wang and Mr. Fu were charged with conspiring to sell human organs, a practice that is illegal under Federal law, which requires that any organs used in transplants be donated. The Federal complaint did not say whether Mr. Wang, who has been in the United States since May 1997, had arranged any sales or transplants, and law enforcement officials would not discuss that or whether they had verified that Mr. Wang had been a Chinese official.
Initial court records offered few details about the two defendants, who were arrested on Friday and taken on Saturday before a Federal magistrate judge in Manhattan. The magistrate ordered both men held without bond until further proceedings this week.
At a hearing yesterday, Marcia R. Isaacson, an assistant United States attorney, said Mr. Fu and his wife were Chinese citizens. Court papers said Mr. Fu earned $600 a month from a laundry he operates in Queens.
After the hearing, the magistrate, Ronald L. Ellis, ordered Mr. Fu released on $100,000 bond. Mr. Fu's lawyer, David B. Levitt, declined to comment. Mr. Fu's wife, Susan, said: "They wronged him. He never did any illegal thing."
Mr. Wang's lawyer, Oliver A. Smith, declined to comment other than to say that "we act on the assumption that the Constitution still works and he's presumed innocent."
Mr. Wang, who is scheduled to appear in court tomorrow for a bail hearing, listed himself in a court financial disclosure form as unemployed and said that he had about $3,000 in savings.
Mr. Wu said he got involved in the case after hearing about Mr. Wang from someone he would not identify. Mr. Wu said he arranged to meet Mr. Wang on Feb. 13 in a suite at the San Carlos Hotel in Manhattan.
Mr. Wu, who posed as a director of a dialysis center, said that Mr. Wang showed him documents indicating that he had been the deputy chief of criminal prosecutions for Hainan Province. An associate of Mr. Wu said Mr. Wang said he was on leave and would return to that job.
With a friend's video camera taping the meeting from inside a box, Mr. Wu said he signed a contract agreeing to supply Mr. Wang with a commission of 25 percent of the costs of each kidney transplant.
Mr. Wu then called the F.B.I., which taped a telephone conversation between a second informant and Mr. Wang on Feb. 17. According to the Federal complaint, Mr. Wang said in this conversation that he and Mr. Fu expected to earn a big profit on the sale of the corneas.
The F.B.I. brought its sting to a quick close on Friday, when an agent who introduced himself as another director of the dialysis center met with both Mr. Wang and Mr. Fu. As part of his marketing pitch, Mr. Fu assured the agent that any lungs they supplied "would come from nonsmokers," the complaint said.
The issue of transplanting organs from executed Chinese prisoners has been of great concern to the international transplant community, said Ronald M. Ferguson, chairman of the department of surgery at Ohio State University Medical Center and president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.
He and other American doctors said yesterday that even with the most sophisticated medical technology, organs like kidneys, which are in great demand worldwide, would survive only a short time and would need to be transplanted quickly. But the doctors said it would be possible to ship corneas long distances.
Mr. Wu said most of the kidney transplants so far in China have been done in military and other Government-run hospitals.
"If they don't have a national policy, no one could make it available." he said. "So the Chinese Government is responsible for all these inhuman practices."

HEADLINE: FLORIDA TWISTERS: THE OVERVIEW;
AT LEAST 38 DIE AS TORNADOES RIP CENTRAL FLORIDA

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: KISSIMMEE, Fla., Feb. 23

 BODY:
A series of tornadoes ripped swaths about 50 miles wide across Central Florida early today, killing at least 38 people and leaving patches of destruction that state officials said were as bad as anything they saw in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. It was the deadliest swarm of tornadoes on record in the state.
In addition to the dead, more than 260 people were injured and hundreds more left homeless as an undetermined number of tornadoes cut northwest across the state from midnight to 1 A.M. with winds of 158 to 260 miles an hour. 
 Rescue workers and witnesses described scenes of horror and heroism, from an 18-month-old who died after being sucked from his father's arms to a 11-year-old vacationer from England, who pulled her cousin, from their bedroom moments before their family's rented Dodge van was hurled through the wall and landed upside down on their bed.
Though local officials issued warnings late Sunday, most people here seemed to have been caught by surprise. Many of the victims had been asleep and died when they were hurled through the air or crushed by collapsing structures, state officials said.
The worst damage was centered on four counties -- Orange, Osceola, Seminole and Volusia -- where mobile home parks took the brunt of the storm and were reduced to piles of debris. No damage figures were available but 14 counties in Northern and Central Florida were declared Federal disaster areas, making them eligible for Federal aid. Seven counties suffered direct hits from the tornadoes, state officials said, while the other seven have experienced flood damage in recent months and were bracing for more as additional rain was expected.
The twisters tore off roofs and side walls from permanent structures, flipped over cars and mobile homes, and left at least 25,000 people without electricity. One strip mall in Osceola County was "completely leveled." said Kelley Thomason, a spokeswoman for the county emergency operation center.
At least 130 people sought refuge in public shelters. More than 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, many by the giant oaks, pines and other trees that were uprooted, but one state emergency official called the estimate "probably very, very low." Major tourist attractions like Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World, and hotel and motel strips were spared damage but many tornado victims were winter visitors in recreational vehicles.
In many areas like rural Seminole County, where cattle were counted among the missing, the tornadoes jumped over some homes and destroyed others. Within a few feet of houses splintered and in shambles were houses without so much as a shingle missing.
Witnesses said some mobile homes "exploded" under the awesome force of the wind.
Terry Tipton, 27, and her family walked in a daze amid the debris left by the storms, which took the life of her father, Tom Tipton, who had been sleeping inside his mobile home in Sanford when the tornado blew his trailer off its supports and smashed it into hundreds of pieces against nearby trees. All that remained were the concrete front steps and back patio.
To the south, Claire Roberts, 11, was vacationing from Liverpool, England, with relatives, but today only two of the exterior walls of the four-bedroom villa with a swimming pool the family had been renting were left standing. Their rented Dodge Caravan was tossed onto the bed of 6-year-old Emma Smith, Claire's cousin, seconds afer Claire pulled her from the room.
"I heard my brother, Daniel, screaming, and I sat up in bed," Claire recalled as she sat in the cafeteria of Horizon Middle School here, where the Red Cross had established a makeshift shelter for victims. "My mum was screaming too, and all the windows were smashed. I got Emma out of bed and then the van smashed through the window."
After their narrow escape, the two girls were trapped briefly in the hallway outside the bedroom when a doorway collapsed and debris pinned them to the floor. Claire's mother, Diane Roberts, pulled Emma from the debris by her hair and then helped her own daughter escape.
Members of both families suffered cuts and scrapes, but no serious injuries. They were released from a local hospital about mid-morning and moved to the shelter. They had planned three more days of sight-seeing, but yesterday they were ready to go home.
"She's a hero," said Emma's mother, Catherine Smith, hugging Claire and choking back a sob.
The tornadoes came after an active period of storms in Florida attributed to El Nino. Officials from the National Weather Service said they were produced by thunderstorms that formed in the Tampa Bay area.
"Based on our radar screens, we can tell where the thunderstorm path will be with great accuracy, but we don't know when a tornado will touch the ground," said Scott Spratt, a meterologist with the weather service in Melbourne.
Mr. Spratt said there were "numerous tornado touchdowns," up to a dozen. But he said he did not know how many of those were by the same tornado. Ranked 0 to 5 on the Fujita-Pearson Tornado Scale, today's tornadoes caused damage worthy of categories 3 and 4, with winds of up to 260 miles per hour, Mr. Spratt said. That made them the harshest tornadoes since 1966, when 11 people were killed, he said. Two tornadoes in 1962 killed 17 people, he said.
"This shows that El Nino is very dangerous for Florida" Mr. Spratt said.
Today's tornadoes were the deadliest in Florida since the National Weather Service started keeping detailed records a half-century ago, and were the deadliest storms since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew raked Florida and Louisiana, killing at least 32 people there and in the Bahamas.
Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency were already here assessing damage from flooding in the last two months, when the next emergency struck. The agency director, James Lee Witt, accompanied Gov. Lawton Chiles and members of Florida's Congressional delegation in surveying the damage.
President Clinton said he would tour the state on Wednesday to survey the damage.
At the Ponderosa Park Campground for recreational vehicles near here, where eight people died and 50 others were injured, search crews with dogs looked throughout the day for six people reported missing. Debris from the park was wrapped around trees and flung onto the Florida Turnpike close by.
A Ponderosa resident, William Asbill, 33, sat in a wheelchair in the lobby of the Osceola Regional Medical Center emergency room. Beside him were two small plastic bags filled with wet clothes, all he had salvaged from his wrecked camper. Two television sets in the lobby broadcase live pictures of the damage, some of the shots from helicopters, but Mr. Asbill, his head swathed in a huge bandage, paid no attention.
"I woke up with the wind smashing the windows," he said. "Then it hit, turned me upside down, cut my ear off. My camper was upside down. My neighbor's camper was on top of it. It blew all the windows out of my van. Crushed my motorcycle. It's under the camper."
By the time he got over the shock, Mr. Asbill's left ear dangled by a thread of skin. He pressed it to his head, and a surgeon later reattached it.
When the wind and lightning came, Mike Cowart, his girlfriend, Gloria Jones, and their 20-month-old son, Cody, were inside a 27-foot camper at the Ponderosa.
"The wind woke me up and I looked out the window and it was regular lightning," said Mr. Cowart, 40. "Next thing I knew the lightning was turning blue and I saw the twister coming right at us. I grabbed Gloria and Cody and put them on the floor and covered them. Next thing, I was flying through the air inside the camper. It was spinning side over side about five times. Then it slammed into a pine tree and stopped, wheels up. I thought we were going to die. I kicked the door open and got them out."
Mr. Cowart returned for his boots and Cody's slippers. It took 42 stitches to close a gash in his left hand. He said he moved his family to the camp two months ago from Orlando. Mr. Cowart is an unemployed heavy equipment operator and had no insurance for the camper or his family's belongings.
Cody suffered a bruised head and Ms. Jones a nasty bump on her chin.
"Trailers were wrapped around trees," Ms. Jones said. "Pieces of metal were twisted everywhere. Our pick-up truck was five feet away from the camper, and it only had a cracked windshield and a flat tire. We were lucky."

HEADLINE: The Newest Temps in Law Firms: Lawyers

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
After practicing law in California for 10 years, Gideon E. Mark realized that he preferred problem solving to confrontation and wanted to be a management consultant instead of a litigator. He got a master's degree in business from Columbia University but could not pay for the additional schooling he needed to switch professions.
So two years ago, Mr. Mark became a temp. 
 He joined the ranks of thousands of other New York lawyers who have temporary assignments at law firms and corporate legal departments, and wound up making more than $100,000 last year. Now he is a full-time student at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University as well as a part-time legal temp in the New York office of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, a large Chicago law firm.
"I would not say I am treated as an equal, but on the other hand I am not treated with disrespect," said Mr. Mark, now 38, alluding to the law firm. But to him these are acceptable trade-offs. "My temp job is paying for Harvard," he said. "It's worked out very well."
Not long ago, it was unheard-of for partners and associates in fancy New York law firms to work alongside lawyers provided by temp agencies, and even today partners at many law firms are unwilling to admit publicly that they are supervising lawyers that they themselves did not hire, train and inculcate with their firm's traditions.
But the hiring of temporary lawyers, which started as a trickle more than 10 years ago, is suddenly a growth industry. Nationwide, the temp lawyer business is growing at a rate of 30 percent a year, almost three times as fast as the staffing industry as a whole. Peter Yessne, the editor of Staffing Industry Report, an industry newsletter, says the temp lawyer business is making an estimated $500 million a year, with up to $200 million of that sum in the New York metropolitan region, the largest market for temp lawyers in the nation.
The growing acceptance of legal temps owes a lot to the downsizing that occurred at many law firms during the recession of the early 1990's, after the rapid expansion of the 80's. That experience has made the firms wary of overstaffing, even in more prosperous times.
Corporate clients have also become increasingly vocal about skyrocketing legal costs, and often demand that firms hold down fees by using contract help, especially for routine work like reviewing documents. A firm may bill as much as $350 an hour for an experienced associate, while the top rate for a temp lawyer is about $95 an hour.
"It's a wonderful way to control costs for the client," said Alan J. Pomerantz, a partner at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. "The key is to make sure that you screen these people very well."
To cut costs, the 62 law firms retained by the Prudential Corporation must agree to hire temps from the Wallace Law Registry of Hartford when they need to bring in extra lawyers, said Bill Fellers, the vice president for administration in the company's legal department in Newark. The legal department itself has 25 to 30 temp lawyers at a given time, he said.
Some of the people who work as temps are mothers of young children, like Jennifer L. Warren, a Yale Law School graduate who is filling in for a lawyer on maternity leave at a large cable television entertainment company. "If I were to sign on to a job full time in a permanent capacity," said Ms. Warren, 37, "I'd feel like I'd be putting my job before my family."
Employment agencies say that many temps are experienced lawyers who are making midlife career changes or want more flexibility than a full-time associate is likely to get. Still others are sole practitioners seeking additional income or recent graduates of less-than-elite law schools trying to jump-start their careers.
Brad Hildebrandt, the chairman of Hildebrandt, a Somerset, N.J., consulting company specializing in the legal field, said that some law firms were hobbled by an "elitist attitude" toward temps. "If you approach it by thinking that only mediocre people would do this," he said, "you don't understand the labor force."
In early 1995, Elie Gordis and Jay B. Horowitz, both associates at the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, were researching the possibility of starting a temp agency for lawyers and paralegals. They placed newspaper advertisements seeking applicants and drew 800 responses the first week, they said.
"The quality of the resumes made us realize we could do this," Mr. Gordis said.
In two years, they had expanded their offices in midtown Manhattan to 4,000 square feet, from 1,500, and last month their company, Strategic Legal Services, was acquired by Staffmark, a national staffing company in Fayetteville, Ark. Mr. Gordis and Mr. Horowitz will continue to run their old company.
One lawyer they placed was Victoria L. Watson, a former colleague at Skadden, Arps. After her father died, leaving her with a financially troubled restaurant in Cape May, N.J., she took a leave from the firm and soon realized she could no longer practice law full time and run the restaurant. Since then, she has worked as a temp at two New York firms. As part of her arrangement, she gets the summer off to spend in Cape May.
"I'm making a lot less money than I would be at Skadden," Ms. Watson, 42, said, "but I've learned how to live on less money. Between money and freedom, I think freedom is winning out."
Some New York law firms said they were not comfortable with the idea of using temporary legal help. "For the nature of our business, we can't bring people in when we don't know how good the person is," said Michael S. Mullman, a managing partner at Tenzer Greenblatt, a firm with 85 lawyers. "Our clients are paying us substantial fees."
But a number of other employers willing to talk about their contract lawyers said they were very satisfied with the service.
White & Case recently signed 100 temp lawyers to work on an antitrust case involving 10 million pages of documents, said Owen C. Pell, the administrative partner of the New York firm's litigation department.
"By using the temp lawyers effectively, I was able to focus my people on the really important stuff," Mr. Pell said. "We had a great result."

HEADLINE: Mancur Olson, 66, a Professor And Author of Economics Books

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Mancur Olson, 66, an economist at the University of Maryland widely admired for his research on how groups that represent specialized interests affect economic growth, died last Thursday. He lived in University Park, Md.
The cause of death was a sudden heart attack, the university said.
Mr. Olson graduated from North Dakota State University and was a Rhodes Scholar at University College, Oxford, before he earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1963. His first academic job, as an assistant professor at Princeton University, was followed by a two-year period in Washington as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. But most of his career was spent at the University of Maryland, where he joined the economics department in 1969 after leaving the Government. 
 His first book, "The Logic of Collective Action," published in 1971, was a seminal work in the then-new field of "public choice," the study of how economic decisions are made within organizations -- governments, unions and the like -- that are not subject to the direct discipline of the marketplace. But his most widely debated book was "The Rise and Decline of Nations," published in 1982, an ambitious effort to explain why economies eventually stagnate.
"There have been whole conferences devoted to Olson's work," said a Maryland colleague, Thomas Schelling. "But he was one of those strange economists who was always better known among political scientists and sociologists."
Mr. Olson put his insights to practical use, creating the University of Maryland's Center for Institutional Reform and the Informal Sector in 1990. Working with grants from the Agency for International Development, the center has advised 30 countries ranging from Russia to Egypt.
Surviving are his wife, Alison; a daughter, Ellika, of Blacksberg Va.; two sons, Severin and Sander, both of College Park, Md., and a brother, Gaylord, of Grand Falls, N.D.

HEADLINE: Clinton Budget Will Only Add to the Surplus

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Social Security and Abracadabras" (Op-Ed, Feb. 18): 
 John F. Cogan, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, asserts that President Clinton's budget spends the projected surplus, reverses course on the end of the era of big government, raises the Federal tax burden, and breaks the budget rules. This is wrong.
With Washington in a frenzy to spend the budget surplus, the President rallied the country around reserving every penny of it until we have strengthened Social Security. A closer look shows that our budget actually adds $800 million to the surplus over the next five years.
By doing that, we continue the fiscal discipline that has sparked an investment-led expansion. Unlike in the 1980's, the public sector is now shrinking, and the private sector is growing faster.
President Clinton has delivered lower taxes and smaller government. Spending as a share of the economy is the lowest in 25 years, and the typical American family of four now faces the lightest Federal tax burden since 1976.
Our budget builds on that success, offers new tax cuts and sticks to tough rules that make us pay for every dollar we spend. Will Congress do the same?

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
No doubt about it now: During 1997 air fares took the biggest annual jump in four years.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
AMERICAN EXPRESS has confirmed what business travelers have contended for months: During 1997 air fares underwent the largest annual increase in the last four years.
The company, which has been following air fares for six years, found that the typical business fare -- a three-day advance purchase ticket -- in the 215 domestic city pairs it tracks rose 16 percent last year over 1996. Fares in 1996 jumped 9 percent over 1995, while fares in 1995 rose 3 percent over 1994. 
 Since American Express began surveying fares, the highest year-to-year increase came in 1993, a 22 percent surge over 1992, following a recession and a fare-restructuring trial by carriers. The only time fares have fallen since American Express began monitoring them came in 1994, when they dropped 6 percent.
At least one Wall Street analyst believes the rate of these increases might actually moderate in the not-too-distant future. Sam Buttrick, airline analyst for Paine Webber, said: "We may have hit the near-term ceiling on high-end business fares, for political if not economic reasons. There seems to be a rising chorus in Washington about the level of business fares and the competitive practices of major airlines."
In fact, next month the Department of Transportation will issue a proposed competition policy for the airline industry. One of the main issues that will be covered will be domination of hubs by established carriers, which is seen by many as the primary reason for fare escalation.
Among other recent airline developments, UAL's United Airlines is starting one daily nonstop flight between Bradley International Airport in Hartford and the carrier's hub in San Francisco on April 5. The flight, on an Airbus A319, will be the only nonstop transcontinental service out of Hartford.
Also, the Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic has started "drive through" check-in for business-class passengers departing from Newark International Airport. Passengers, who receive limousine service to the airport, can check in from their car when they arrive at a special enclosed counter outside the terminal; their luggage is also collected and processed there. Security procedures are conducted before boarding. Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman for Virgin, said the carrier hoped to eventually institute the service at its seven other United States gateways.
 
Hotel Update
The 96-year-old Algonquin Hotel, a historic New York City landmark that is popular with some business travelers, is undergoing a $5.5 million restoration that will be completed by May. Home of the famous Round Table of literary lions earlier in the century, the 165-room hotel, owned by the Camberley Hotel Company, is being redecorated in the turn-of-the century Arts and Crafts style. Both public and guest rooms will be furnished with English and American antiques, and hall corridors will be decorated with wallpaper that replicates cartoons from The New Yorker, whose editors and writers were Round Table devotees. Fitness and business centers will also be added.
Gordon Campbell-Gray, the British hotelier and former owner of the Draycott in London, will open a new hotel there, to be called One Aldwych, in June. Situated at the corner of the Strand and Aldwych, the hotel is in a fully renovated 1906 landmark building by Mewis & Davis, the architectural firm that designed the Ritz hotels in London, Paris and Madrid. The hotel will have 105 rooms -- including 12 suites, two with private gyms and one with a fireplace and dining room; a private screening room; two meeting rooms; a health club and swimming pool, and two restaurants. All guest rooms will be furnished with electrical outlets that accommodate non-European appliances, as well as high-speed Internet connections. Guests will be assigned private phone and fax numbers. Room rates will range from $295 to $400 a night through the end of August, when they will increase to $380 to $485. Suites will begin at $525 initially, then rise to $650.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chairman's Testimony Before House Panel

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the House Banking Committee: 
 The key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending and tightening labor markets. The depth of the adjustment abroad will depend on the extent of weakness in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed with which structural inefficiencies in the financial and nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected. If, as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient to bring the demand for American labor back into line with the growth of the working-age population desirous of working, labor markets will remain unusually tight, but any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very gradual, and readily reversible. However, we cannot rule out two other, more worrisome possibilities. On the one hand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be offset significantly by Asian or other developments, the U.S. economy would be on a track along which spending could press too strongly against available resources to be consistent with contained inflation. On the other, we also need to be alert to the possibility that the forces from Asia might damp activity and prices by more than is desirable by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of net exports and the prices of imports. . . .
Without doubt, lenders have provided important support to spending in the past few years by their willingness to transact at historically small margins and in large volumes. Equity investors have contributed as well by apparently pricing in the expectation of substantial earnings gains and requiring modest compensation for the risk that those expectations could be mistaken. . . .
But we must be concerned about becoming too complacent about evaluating repayment risks. All too often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that banks extend later make up a disproportionate share of total nonperforming loans. In addition, quite possibly, 12 or 18 months hence, some of the securities purchased on the market could be looked upon with some regret by investors. As one of the nation's bank supervisors, the Federal Reserve will make every effort to encourage banks to apply sound underwriting standards in their lending. Prudent lenders should consider a wide range of economic situations in evaluating credit; to do otherwise would risk contributing to potentially disruptive financial problems down the road.
A second area of concern involves our nation's continuing role in the new high-tech international financial system. By joining with our major trading partners and international financial institutions in helping to stabilize the economies of Asia and promoting needed structural changes, we are also encouraging the continued expansion of world trade and global economic and financial stability on which the ongoing increase of our own standards of living depends. If we were to cede our role as a world leader, or backslide into protectionist policies, we would threaten the source of much of our own sustained economic growth.
A third risk is complacency about inflation prospects. The combination and interaction of significant increases in productivity-improving technologies, sharp declines in budget deficits and disciplined monetary policy has damped product price changes, bringing them to near stability. While part of this result owes to good policy, part is the product of the fortuitous emergence of new technologies and of some favorable price developments in imported goods. However, as history counsels, it is unwise to count on any string of good fortune to continue indefinitely.

Greenspan's Comments and Scuttled Merger Dampen Market

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Rising Treasury bond yields and the scuttling of what was expected to be the largest merger ever dampened enthusiasm for stocks yesterday.
Stocks were dragged lowered after comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, dashed the bond market's hopes that the Fed would lower interest rates sometime soon. 
 In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan said that the effects of Asia's economic crisis on American companies might be partly offset by rising labor costs in the United States. Analysts and investors interpreted the remarks as a sign that the Federal Reserve would not lower short-term interest rates to stimulate economic growth.
Bond prices fell sharply, causing the yield on the 30-year United States Treasury bond to jump 6 basis points, to 5.96 percent. Those rising yields increased the attractiveness of bonds as an investment and caused some investors to shed stocks and buy Treasuries, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. Stock investors were also disheartened by the breakdown of merger talks between SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome.
They announced after the market closed on Monday that the talks had ended.
"Those elements that had been driving the market -- particularly takeovers -- became unglued," Mr. Cripps said. The breakup of the drug deal "interjected a degree of uncertainty" and alerted investors to the risks of investing in takover stocks because "not all takeovers that are rumored out there happen," Mr. Cripps said.
Drug company shares including Merck, Pfizer, American Home Products and Eli Lilly fell on the news and helped to push both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index lower. The Dow fell 40.10 points, to 8,370.10. The S.& P. 500 slipped 7.58 points, to 1,030.56.
Those declines dragged the Amex pharmaceutical index, which has been one of the year's best perfomers, down 2.5 percent yesterday. The index is up 13.06 percent this year. After reaching a new closing high on Monday, the Nasdaq composite index slumped 13.05 points, to 1,738.71, with shares of Intel, Worldcom, Cisco Systems and Dell leading the declines.
Earnings disappointments also cast a pall on the market.
Nike shares closed down 3 9/16, to 43 1/8, after the company warned that fiscal third-quarter earnings may fall below analysts' expectations because of larger-than-expected order declines in Asia and retailers' price cuts on its products.
The revenue shortfalls will cause Nike to lay off workers and cut costs, said Rick Anguilla, director of investor relations at Nike. Previously, the company had layoffs in the 1994 fiscal year.
The company said it expects diluted earnings per share to be between 24 cents and 28 cents a share, below analysts' forecasts of 38 cents.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Injects a Note of Caution on the Good Times

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned investors and lenders today against assuming that economic good times would last forever and suggested they could be underestimating the risks confronting the economy's powerful seven-year-old expansion.
Saying he wanted to add some cautionary notes to an otherwise upbeat assessment of the economy on a day that brought new evidence of stable prices and buoyant consumer confidence, Mr. Greenspan said "events in the months ahead are not likely to unfold smoothly," especially given the financial turmoil in Asia. 
 He gave no clear indication of whether the central bank felt it must raise or lower interest rates this year, saying in testimony to a House panel that the economy remained balanced between potential inflationary pressures and forces that could lead to recession and falling prices.
While acknowledging the ideal combination of strong growth, low unemployment and price stability over the last year, Mr. Greenspan said the country should battle "complacency about inflation prospects." He said banks and investors in particular might want to re-examine their relentlessly optimistic outlook.
"All too often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that banks extend later make up a disproportionate share of total nonperforming loans," Mr. Greenspan said, referring to loans paid delinquently. "In addition, quite possibly, 12 or 18 months hence, some of the securities purchased on the market currently could be looked upon with some regret by investors."
By many measures, lenders and investors in the stock market are demanding less in the way of protection against risks by historical standards, Mr. Greenspan said.
"The implication is that the market is saying that there is something different about this particular economic environment," he said. "I am not inclined to go that far."
His remarks had a dampening influence on the financial markets, partly countering the effects of the latest evidence of the economy's healthy performance, which showed no overall inflation in January and a surging level of consumer confidence.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.10 points, to 8,370.10, partly dragged down by a slump in the bond market. Bond prices weakened after Mr. Greenspan gave no indication that the Fed would cut interest rates anytime soon.
The Consumer Price Index was unchanged last month, the Labor Department said, the first time in four years that the monthly gauge of price pressures did not rise on a seasonally adjusted basis. For the last 12 months, the inflation rate was just 1.6 percent. The lack of inflation last month partly resulted from a drop in oil prices, but even after excluding volatile food and energy prices, inflation edged up just two-tenths of a percent in January.
The January figures were the first calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using a revised market basket of consumer goods that takes into account changing consumer behavior and changes in technology. Economists said the changes, including the addition of expenses like cellular phone services and steps to account for the improving quality of computers, would shave small amounts off the price index over the course of the year but had no effect in January.
The combination of robust growth, low unemployment and dormant inflation helped push consumer confidence in February to its highest level since 1968, said the Conference Board, the research organization that conducts a widely followed monthly survey.
In his testimony before the House Banking Committee's monetary policy subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged the economy's "exemplary" performance last year and its continued strength early this year.
But he reiterated his projection that the effects of the financial turmoil in Asia were likely to slow growth in the United States this year.
So far, though, the Federal Reserve has been unable to determine how much the economy will slow, he said.
Indeed, the central bank confronts two conflicting possible situations: that Asia's problems will not slow growth enough in the United States to avert an upturn in inflation driven by rising labor costs, and that Asia's problems will slow the economy too much, tipping the United States into recession and leading the general price level to decline.
Confronted with what he called these "finely balanced though powerful forces" tugging and pulling at the economy, Mr. Greenspan suggested the Fed was uncertain whether it would need to raise or lower interest rates this year.
Mr. Greenspan said one of the major developments in the economy in the last year has been an increase in the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour worked. Productivity growth has fallen gradually over much of the last 25 years, a trend that now shows some signs of reversing.
But while productivity has helped dampen inflation, Mr. Greenspan said strong demand for goods and services continued to force employers to scramble for new workers at a time when unemployment, at 4.8 percent, is near a quarter-century low. As a result, wage gains are accelerating -- good news for workers but historically a warning sign of incipient inflation.
"Should demand for new workers continue to exceed new supply, we would expect wage gains increasingly to exceed productivity growth, squeezing profit margins and eventually leading to a pickup in inflation," Mr. Greenspan said.
The question now, the Fed chairman said, was whether the crisis in Asia would slow growth in the United States sufficiently to avert that inflationary outcome. An expected downturn in exports to Asia would create a "discernible drag" on growth in the United States, Mr. Greenspan said, but he added that the Fed did not yet have a sense of how sharp the downturn would be.
As a result, he said, the Fed's economic forecasts for the year are particularly tentative. Fed policy makers see growth slowing this year to between 2 and 2.75 percent, compared with 3.8 percent last year, with unemployment and inflation remaining at around current levels. Fed economists, along with most of their counterparts in the private sector, have been predicting a slowdown in growth for the last several years, and have been regularly confounded by the economy's resilience.

HEADLINE: Citing Improving Economy, Moody's Raises City's Bond Rating

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
A major Wall Street credit-rating agency raised New York's long-term creditworthiness yesterday, citing the city's improving economy and City Hall's prudent budget management.
The announcement, by Moody's Investors Service, increased the city's rating to A3, up one notch from Baa1, where it was since 1991. That kept New York ahead of other big cities like Philadelphia and Detroit and behind Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. 
 The upgrade was not unexpected and, in fact, the city's bonds had been trading at the higher level for several months, experts said. But the news -- coupled with a recent announcement by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the other major credit agency, that it was considering raising the city's rating -- was an important psychological endorsement of the city's financial condition.
"The city's finances are probably as good as they've been since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's from a credit-rating perspective," said Robert A. Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's. Mr. Kurtter added that although the new ranking was the same one that the city held from 1988 to 1991, the city's financial underpinnings were not so solid then because its employee payroll and the cost of its social programs were spiraling upward.
Moody's tempered its report by saying that the city's economic growth still lagged the rest of the nation's and that it faced enormous challenges, including a "high and growing debt burden, a history of structural budget imbalance and a cyclical economy."
But the agency's decision to issue the upgrade months before the city's adoption of a final budget for the next fiscal year gave a symbolic boost to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's stewardship over the city's multibillion-dollar budget. Just three years ago, S. & P. had cited the Mayor's use of fiscal gimmicks when it downgraded the city's' rating.
"We've worked hard to achieve this upgrade," said Randy M. Mastro, Deputy Mayor for Operations. "It's a reflection that Moody's realizes this Mayor is committed to keeping this city on this kind of sound financial course in the future."
The Moody's upgrade had been anticipated since last July, when the agency gave the city a positive credit outlook. But its timing -- months before the adoption of a final budget in June -- surprised some officials and investors. S. & P., for example, is waiting to see what shape the budget takes following negotiations between the Mayor and City Council before making its announcement.
Mr. Kurtter said that Moody's decided to make its announcement yesterday because, if history was any indication, City Council leaders and Mr. Giuliani would agree on a budget that resembled the preliminary version the Mayor presented last month. In that, he proposed using 73 percent of this year's $1.2 billion surplus to help close next year's budget gap. That idea drew mostly positive feedback from City Council leaders.
Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the Council, said that coming negotiations would produce a budget that was "fiscally responsible."
The rating change affects the $30 billion in general-obligation bonds the city has issued over the years to finance the construction and renovations of projects like bridges, roads and buildings. In theory, the city's improved bond rating would save millions of dollars by making its bonds attractive to more investors and allowing the city to offer them with less interest. Many institutions, like banks and mutual funds, do not invest in bonds with a rating lower than the A level.
"Most New Yorkers who trade bonds live here," said Duncan K. Smith, a senior managing director at Lebenthal & Company, which deals heavily in the city's bonds. "We're pretty much in agreement that the quality of life in the city has improved, unless you have kids in the public schools, which is one of the city's big problems."
Mr. Smith said that the city's bonds had been trading at the higher level for several months and that many traders received confirmation that the bonds deserved such a rating last fall, when it became clear that the city would enjoy a huge surplus for the second straight year.

New Diagnostics for Building Facades

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
As the recent partial collapse of the facade of a building at Madison Avenue and 55th Street and other incidents around the city have shown, problems with construction and weathering can cause brickwork to peel away from the main part of a structure.
As a result of the recent accidents, the city appears ready to stiffen facade inspection requirements and expand them to the entire outside of a building, not just the part overlooking sidewalks. 
 This, in turn, is prompting some property managers to adopt new technologies to measure more accurately the condition of brick facades. Fiber optic devices can look inside walls through relatively small holes, making it unnecessary to chop out whole sections, and a laser measuring system can produce precise written and visual reports on the location and, over time, changes in location of each section of brick in a facade. If those bricks appear to be in a different position in subsequent inspections, managers would have reason to suspect that something is amiss.
Engineers say modern construction spaces brick facades one to two inches from the main structure of a building to add a layer of insulating air that acts much like a two-pane storm window.
Although it appears from the outside that the brick walls are continuous from bottom to top, in practice there is a steel shelf at each floor, so the bricks at the bottom do not have to bear the entire weight of those higher up, explained Anthony Pagnotta, an engineer with HLW International, a New York architectural and engineering firm.
To tie the bricks to the main structure of the building, bricklayers are supposed to use thousands of strips of metal, called wall ties, that are fixed in the building and are inserted into the mortar that binds the individual bricks together. It is good practice to use the ties on every other course of brick vertically and about six inches apart horizontally, Mr. Pagnotta said.
City officials said it was a lack of these ties that helped cause the partial collapse of a facade on the building at 540 Madison Avenue late last year.
But other things can go wrong, most of them involving water. If rain seeps between the bricks and collects inside the air gap, the wall ties and supporting shelf can corrode, destabilizing the facade.
City regulations require landlords to hire a qualified architect or engineer to visually inspect the front and the first 20 feet of the side walls of a building more than six stories tall. They are to look for cracking, rust stains and other signs of distress.
But some managers say they want earlier warnings so they can make repairs before problems spread and become more expensive. "Any property manager who relies on city minimum inspections is crazy," said Bill Porceller, a manager at the Sage Realty Corporation. Measuring with a laser, he said, produces a report that positions the brick facade within one-sixteenth of an inch, which is more precise than is possible with a visual inspection.
Others say detailed examinations of facades are most economically used when trouble has already developed. "The laser is a great technology, but it is best used when you have a problem," said John Santora, senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield, which manages 60 million square feet of property in the New York metropolitan region.
Lon Best, the president of A Best Contracting Company, which specializes in facade repairs, said that during an inspection the laser light source is installed near the brick wall, sending out a vertical wall of light parallel to the wall. With this in place, workers on a scaffold position an instrument directly over the laser beam and measure from there to the surface of the bricks with a ruler.
With this information and follow-up inspections, a building manager or owner can decide whether parts of the wall are shifting because of deterioration or whether the undulations in a wall are the result of the original construction because they do not change from year to year. Mr. Best said that a planned $4 million repair of 425 Park Avenue, at 55th Street, was cut to $360,000 as a result of a laser survey.

GRAPHIC: Diagram: "HOW IT WORKS: Reading a Building's Face"
Engineers are using lasers to inspect the facades of buildings and monitor deviations over time.
 
1. ALIGN TO LASER -- Working across the building at about every half floor, surveyors align a device called a catcher to a beam from a laser attached to the building.
 
2. MEASURE DISTANCES -- With a slide ruler, they then measure and record the distance between the laser beam and the wall.
 
3. ESTABLISH SURVEY POINTS -- Measurements are documented to establish an initial surface of surveyed points that future inspectors can reread and compare to detect movement.
 
4. ALIGN LASER TO WALL -- Two rods attached to the building's steel structure on either side of the laser are marked where the beam hits them. The next time the laser is activated, the points are used to align the beam for future readings.

After several years of cutting deeply into some of Canada's most cherished social programs, the Government today introduced the first balanced budget in nearly 30 years, cautiously promising to restore some services and lower taxes without returning to the big spending that first put the budget in the red in 1970.
The budget, the equivalent of $104 billion (United States), increases spending on education and health and offers modest tax cuts to 5 million lower-paid Canadians. 
 Officials forecast balanced budgets for the next two years as well, and pledged to direct up to $2 billion a year toward reducing Canada's $410 billion debt.
The budget offers Prime Minister Jean Chretien a chance to stake out a more active role for his Liberal Government after many years in which spending for universal health care, welfare and education had to be curtailed. The cuts often had a painful effect on those parts of Canadian life that people here believed made Canada a more compassionate nation than the United States.
Balancing the books also allows Mr. Chretien to divert attention from the growing discord in the French-speaking province of Quebec. Separatist leaders have stepped up their attacks on the federal Government since Ottawa challenged the legality of Quebec secession in the Supreme Court last week.
Quebec leaders say they are prepared to call provincial elections this spring, which could be followed by a third divisive referendum on separation.
But as the budget was presented in the House of Commons this afternoon, the Liberals glowed confidently behind Finance Minister Paul Martin.
"We today are living a turning point in our history," Mr. Martin declared. "Never again will we allow the specter of overspending to haunt this land."
Mr. Chretien's balanced budget comes just three weeks after President Clinton announced the first balanced budget for the United States in 30 years.
Cautious accounting allowed both leaders to get spending under control. They also benefited from improving economic conditions that generated additional tax revenues and lowered interest payments to such an extent that balanced budgets were reached years before they had been expected.
When Mr. Chretien took office in November 1993, he inherited a deficit of nearly $30 billion.
The Canadian leader, elected to a second term last year, has made it clear that after slashing social spending to eliminate the deficit, he wants his Liberal Party Government to regain some of the compassion for which past Liberal governments have been known. In particular, he is establishing a $2 billion scholarship fund that will provide 100,000 college students up to $2,100 a year for the 10 years, starting in 2000.
Preston Manning, leader of the opposition Reform Party, said that instead of increasing spending, the Government should have focused on giving taxpayers real relief. The new budget raises the personal exemption for low- and moderate-income taxpayers. A surtax imposed by the previous Government to help wipe out the deficit will be lifted for 13 million middle-income taxpayers.
But many Canadians feel the cost of balancing the budget has been too high. Unemployment continues at 8.9 percent, about twice the United States average. School spending has declined, hospitals have been closed and nursing staffs have been reduced because of budget cuts.

HEADLINE: Grand Central Gets Northern Exposure;
The Terminal Is Looking Uptown With a New Maze of Passageways

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
While no one was looking, Grand Central Terminal grew four blocks longer.
When the transformation is complete, travelers should be able to enter or leave the terminal directly through a glass-walled pavilion at the corner of Park Avenue and 48th Street. Or on 47th Street, near Madison Avenue. Or through the arcades of the Helmsley Building, at Park Avenue at 46th Street. 
 For the 40,000 commuters whose destinations are north of Grand Central -- half the rush-hour ridership on the Metro-North Railroad -- these entrances will reduce travel time by up to 15 minutes, railroad officials said. They plan to have some entrances open later this year, with the whole project completed in January.
The new entrances, connected to underground passageways and walkways, will fundamentally reorient Grand Central to the north, reflecting the uptown shift in Manhattan's center of economic gravity since the terminal was built 85 years ago resolutely facing south, with its most sumptuous facade and monumental entrance on 42d Street.
But what may be most remarkable about the five-year, $95 million construction project, known as North End Access, is that it has happened almost without notice.
Even as passengers scurried to catch the 5:44 to Stamford or the 5:56 to Dobbs Ferry, an army of workers has been creating a three-level labyrinth through the double-deck railyard beneath Park Avenue. To commuters, the only visible traces have been glass-block bulkheads sprouting on the platforms. This low public profile has actually been cultivated by Metro-North, a division of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"We knew this would be a long project and we knew we would come up against unforeseen obstacles," said Donald N. Nelson, the railroad's president until March 5, when he is to leave to become an executive at Conrail. "It was not a project we wanted to tout until we were ready to open it up."
In fact, Mr. Nelson's caution was well founded. The project was originally supposed to cost $70 million and take only three years, but it has been repeatedly delayed by the unexpected challenges involved in threading the new pedestrian system through the ganglia of Grand Central and surrounding buildings. And even more dexterity was needed to do so without curtailing passenger service.
"When you boil it all down, it's fairly straightforward work erecting steel and pouring concrete," John R. Seaboldt, the project manager for Metro-North, said. "When you try to do it around an operating railroad, that's the biggest challenge."
The basic layout of the plan is simple. Two walkways running parallel to the tracks will take the place of passenger platforms along Tracks 22 and 31. Two passageways will cut across, perpendicular to the tracks: one, created from an old mail and baggage transfer tunnel, runs under 45th Street below the lower-level tracks, while the other, a newly constructed mezzanine, runs under 47th Street between the upper and lower tracks.
Along the passageways will be mosaic, glass and bronze panels depicting cosmological ideas about the night sky. The work, by Ellen Driscoll, was commissioned by the M.T.A. Arts for Transit program. Ceilings in the passageways will be painted blue, echoing the constellation-studded ceiling over the main concourse.
"The route should have some degree of recall of Grand Central Terminal itself," said John Belle of Beyer Blinder Belle, the architects responsible for design, in association with STV Inc., the overall architects and engineers on the project.
Already at the west end of the 45th Street passageway, buff-colored terrazzo walls have been installed. But the east end of the 47th Street passageway is still a gaping incision, with trains rumbling above and below, framed by jagged edges of steel girders that have been cut away.
In this Stygian setting, it is not hard to imagine muggers on the prowl. But Mr. Nelson said as many as seven Metro-North police officers might be assigned to patrol the north end. And Mr. Seaboldt said there will be closed-circuit cameras along the brightly lit passageways, and at every stairway and elevator. There will also be a police office near the 47th Street entrance.
"We expect we have covered all the bases with respect to security," Mr. Seaboldt said.
The passages, which can be locked off from the rest of the terminal, might be open from 5:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. on weekdays, with shorter hours on weekends and holidays.
Assuming that the system is well received and heavily used, however, would that not drain thousands of potential customers away from the retail and restaurant complex being built within the landmark terminal? LaSalle Partners, the retail developers at Grand Central, would not hazard a guess publicly -- nor, indeed, say anything at all. Paul F. Kastner, the marketing director, referred all questions to the M.T.A.
Mr. Nelson said he did not foresee a problem. "The revitalized terminal is going to attract so many additional people that it will more than make up for the loss of those who go out the north end," he said.
The notion of opening up the northern end of Grand Central goes back at least to the 1970's; one plan in the 1980's called for eight new entrances. Work on the current, more modest approach began in earnest in 1994.
Many construction delays occurred because of differences between actual conditions and those documented in existing plans: three layers of steel plates where blueprints showed two, cross-bracing where drawings showed none, an unmapped level of groundwater below 45th Street and uncharted electrical conduits and utility lines almost everywhere.
"There are hidden gems that keep getting discovered," said Alfred Klein, vice president of STV. (He allowed that "gem" was not the word generally used by workers for the contractor, Yonkers Contracting Company, when they came across an unexpected piece of steel.)
Nothing was easy. Temporary chutes had to be built through abandoned elevator shafts and street gratings to deliver concrete. A 16-inch steam line serving the huge Met Life Building had to be shifted north.
Then there was the X that marked the spot of perhaps the greatest structural challenge. The X was a railroad crossing under a giant girder that had to be cut in order to link the 47th Street passageway on one side to the platform for Tracks 29 and 30 on the other side.
The girder could not be cut unless it was reinforced from below. Because of the crossing, however, there was no room to erect extra columns under the girder. Complicating matters further, the girder carried the weight not only of the upper-level tracks but also supported columns coming down from the street.
"We were not going to take out Park Avenue," Mr. Seaboldt said, with an engineer's understatement.
Instead, the answer was to design and fabricate two entirely new girder sections, 32 feet long and weighing 15 tons each, with a hump in the middle about 12 feet high. They were brought into the terminal on a specially modified railroad car.
While he is obviously proud of the accumulated expertise, Mr. Seaboldt is unsure how applicable it will be after next year. "I don't know whether this is a learning experience or not," he said, "because I don't think we're going to be doing this again."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Retreat After Fed Chief Dims Hopes for Rate Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell sharply yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, delivered a cautionary message on the economy that indicated that the central bank was unlikely to change its current monetary policy any time soon.
The market's response to Mr. Greenspan's comments, which came during his semiannual report to the House Banking Committee's monetary policy subcommittee, made it clear that many investors had been looking for the Fed to cut interest rates in the near future. 
 But Mr. Greenspan said policy was "on hold," in part because uncertainties in the outlook in the United States and in Asia made it more difficult than normal to gauge the direction of the economy. That, he said, meant that a pre-emptive strike, in which the Fed changes policy well before a trend gathers steam, would have to be delayed.
"It is quite conceivable to me that even though we would like to be pre-emptive, we may not be able to be pre-emptive, largely because there are certain types of events in world economies which are very difficult to anticipate," Mr. Greenspan said. "So we may find ourselves being less pre-emptive than we would like to be."
His comments led to a selloff, especially in the short end of the market, where the yields on two-year notes had fallen below the Fed's 5.5 percent target for overnight loans between banks, known as the Federal funds rate, which has been held at that level since last March.
The yield on the expiring two-year note jumped to 5.54 percent, from 5.42 percent on Monday, and yesterday's auction of a new two-year note suffered, with the new issue awarded at 5.537 percent and ending the day's trading at 5.54 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond, which was down more than one point during the day, finished off 26/32 at 102 11/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.96 percent from 5.90 percent.
"The market had definitely been building in an ease in interest rates," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "Now the market is building in a neutral stance."
Neil M. Soss, the chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that Mr. Greenspan had given a balanced picture of the economic outlook but that bond investors were expecting a rosier -- at least for them -- view: that the Asian turmoil would slow growth enough in the United States to keep inflation in check and even allow the Fed to cut interest rates.
Mr. Greenspan may have helped promote this view when he testified before the Senate Budget Committee on Jan. 29. At that time, he said that the Asian turmoil would begin to slow the American economy before spring was over. But he left out the qualifiers that he added in yesterday's testimony, leaving investors the opportunity at the time to hope for a rate cut.
Yesterday, he reiterated that the Asian crisis would slow growth in the United States. But he also warned, "We cannot rule out two other, more worrisome possibilities." One was that growth here would not be slowed much by Asia, increasing inflation pressures. The other was that Asia could dampen growth much more than expected. And Mr. Greenspan made clear that it would be hard to decide quickly which alternative was actually occurring.
The fall in bond prices yesterday was also helped by a report that consumer confidence jumped to a 30-year high in February, providing investors with another piece of data that indicates that the hoped-for economic slowdown has not materialized yet. That report and Mr. Greenspan's comments easily offset the positive news yesterday on inflation for January, when the Consumer Price Index was unchanged, pulling the inflation rate for the last 12 months down to 1.6 percent.
In when-issued trading ahead of today's auction of five-year notes, the new issue was being offered at a price to yield 5.63 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Mondale to Visit Jakarta to Press Suharto on I.M.F. Reform Plan

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
President Clinton has asked former Vice President Walter F. Mondale to travel to Indonesia this weekend, the White House said today, as Mr. Clinton's second special envoy to see President Suharto in the past month.
Mr. Mondale's trip will come about 10 days before Mr. Suharto's widely expected re-election for another five-year term by a Parliament that he closely controls. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Mondale would seek to reassure Mr. Suharto, 76, that the United States would seek to help Indonesia through its economic crisis, which has led to an 80 percent devalution of the country's currency and sporadic rioting. But he is also expected to tell Asia's longest-serving leader that Indonesia must begin to carry out the reform plan that Mr. Suharto signed with the International Monetary Fund last month.
Today Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told reporters that Mr. Mondale's trip was intended to re-establish a dialogue with Mr. Suharto on Indonesia's reform efforts.
"I think that in Korea and Thailand, Governments have worked very well toward implementing the I.M.F. programs," Mr. Rubin said. "I think they are on a very constructive path. In Indonesia you obviously have a somewhat difficult situation."
Until a few days ago Mr. Suharto was planning an economic experiment that would peg the country's beleaguered currency, the rupiah, to a fixed exchange rate with the United States dollar. The plan was strongly opposed by the United States and other Western nations, who feared that it was unworkable at a time of both economic and political instability in Indonesia.
The plan, they said, would have forced Indonesia to deplete its $20 billion in foreign currency reserves to protect the exchange rate. After those reserves were gone, they feared, the currency would again devalue.
But Mr. Mondale's trip, officials said, will chiefly deliver a political message: that Mr. Suharto must choose his next Cabinet carefully, avoiding longtime cronies, and create an economic team that the markets will perceive as willing to work with the I.M.F. program.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawerence H. Summers traveled to Jakarta on a Presidential mission in January to warn Mr. Suharto that Indonesia was failing to comply with the conditions for the $43 billion in loans from the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: China Breaks the Ice to Offer Political Talks With Taiwan

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 24

 BODY:
After two and a half years in deep freeze, China sought today to thaw its relations with Taiwan by offering to resume talks on the future of the island. Beijing still regards Taiwan as a rebel province and still threatens to retake it by military force.
The invitation, in a letter received today in Taiwan, says, "We are willing to discuss procedural matters regarding opening political talks across the Taiwan Strait, and we are prepared to resume discussions of economic and technical issues." 
 In a muted response, Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council in Taiwan, described the letter as "positive."
Taiwan's leaders are feeling growing pressure from the United States to renew contacts with Beijing. But while Taiwan officials say they are ready to talk, they adamantly insist that discussions be limited to topics like commercial relations and travel links; political issues are not on the table.
Since Mao Zedong's armies marched into Beijing in October 1949, and then quickly captured the rest of the mainland, sending Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army fleeing to Taiwan, the two sides have been formally at war. Only in 1993, after virtually all of Taiwan's diplomatic relations with the world had evaporated, including those with Washington, and as China was beginning to exert growing influence on Asia, did both sides agree to meet.
While Beijing has repeatedly declared that Taiwan is an integral part of China, Taiwan espouses a belief in a single China while insisting that Taiwan remain "an independent, sovereign state."
Even so, the two sides gingerly approached one another in 1993 to discuss issues like fishing disputes, cultural exchanges and scientific cooperation.
Mention of any political issues, much less the inflammatory question of reunification, was avoided. But the Chinese Government underlined every invitation to Taipei with a reminder that it has never abandoned the option of using force to regain the island.
Taiwan struck back by orchestrating an elaborate public relations campaign in Washington to win a visa for President Lee Teng-hui to visit Cornell University, his alma mater, in June 1995.
Beijing reacted with fury, immediately ending contacts with Taipei.
Then, in March 1996, just as Taiwan was preparing for its first democratic presidential election, Beijing fired missiles into waters off the island's north and south coasts and conducted huge military exercises in Fujian Province, just across the straits. The exercises were widely seen as an effort to intimidate Taiwan's voters.
Now, with relations between Beijing and Washington far warmer, Taipei's leverage on Washington is slipping. And Taiwan's business community, which has $30 billion to $60 billion in investments on the mainland, is also pressing the Government to speed its discussions with Beijing.
In recent interviews in Taiwan, many officials and opinion-makers said they thought the Clinton Administration, using visits by former senior American officials and comments from American representatives in Taipei, was trying to nudge Taipei back to the negotiating table.
"I agree that there is pressure from Washington," said Huang Chao-sung, president of The China Times, the largest paper in Taiwan. "We think it's because of Clinton's visit to China," a reference to a planned trip by President Clinton to Beijing later this year.
Last month a procession of former Clinton and Bush Administration officials came through Taipei, all bearing a message from Beijing: sit down and talk. The most prominent mission was led by the former Defense Secretary, William J. Perry, who was sponsored by the private National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and who arrived after meeting senior officials in Beijing.
"The message was, 'They're ready to talk,' " said a senior official who had notes of Mr. Perry's visit.
American diplomats in Taipei at the nominally private American Institute in Taiwan contend that Washington is not attempting to push Taiwan toward the negotiating table, but they say that resuming discussions would ease tensions.
Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who represented his country in Washington before joining the cabinet last year, said he did not think Washington was exerting formal pressure.
"I don't think the United States would want to make us feel pushed or hastened or pressurized into any talks," Mr. Hu said in an interview. But he added, "They would express an earnest desire to see the earliest possible resumption of dialogue."
Mr. Hu argued that Taiwan had to tread cautiously. "We have to be very careful," he said. "We don't have that many cards in our sleeves."
Although talks have been stalemated for 31 months, Taiwan is drawing closer to the mainland in other ways: More than 43 percent of Taiwan's outside investment is on the mainland, and about 300 mainland academics, performing artists, scientists and business people visit each month.

HEADLINE: Words of Kim Dae Jung: Call for Reconciliation

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Kim Dae Jung's inaugural address today, as translated by the South Korean Government:
At this very important juncture, we have run into a foreign exchange crisis that is the most serious national crisis since the Korean War. We are faced with a crisis that could bankrupt our country. Burdened by enormous debt, we are anxious to settle the maturing foreign debts that are surging over us every day. 
 It is, indeed, a stupefying situation that we find ourselves in. The reason we are managing to escape from catastrophe is because of the cooperation from all of you, my fellow countrymen, united with patriotism, and because of the assistance of our friends, including the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and the European Union nations, as well as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Consumer prices and unemployment will rise this year. Incomes will drop and an increasing number of companies will go bankrupt. All of us are being asked to shed sweat and tears now.
We must calmly and squarely look back to find out how we arrived at this state of affairs. This unfortunate development was able to take place because political, economic, and financial leaders of this country were tainted by a collusive link between politics and business, and because of government-directed banking practices, and because large business groups set up a large number of uncompetitive subsidiaries. . . .
I earnestly appeal to the opposition, which is the majority party in the National Assembly; we will never be able to overcome today's crisis without cooperation from you. I will consult with you on all issues; you, in return, must help me if only for one year -- this year -- when the nation is standing on the bring of disaster. I believe my wishes are shared by all the citizens.
My fellow countrymen, right now this country is undergoing a time of frustration and a crisis in all areas, including politics, the economy, society, national security and South-North relations. To overcome these, we must carry out comprehensive reform.
Political reform must precede everything else. Participatory democracy must be put into practice; the people must be respected as masters and must act like masters. Only then can national administration become transparent and corruption disappear. I will do whatever it takes to realize politics by the people and politics in which the people truly become the masters.
This Government of the people will not indulge in political retaliation of any kind. It will not condone discrimination and preferential treatment of any kind. I firmly pledge here and now that there will not be a government for one region, or discrimination against a province any longer.
The Government will be made more efficient by bearing its share of the pain. A large portion of the power and functions that have been concentrated in the central Government will be transferred to the private sector and local autonomous governments. On the other hand, we will make strengthened efforts to protect the lives and property of the people. We will also endeavor to protect the environment and expand social welfare. . . .
Inter-Korean relations must be evolved on the basis of reconciliation and cooperation as well as the establishment of peace. The Cold War-style South-North relations that have not allowed members of separated families, for over half a century, to ascertain even whether their own parents and brothers and sisters were alive or dead, let alone carry on dialogue and exchanges, must end as soon as possible. I cannot but feel boundless shame before our ancestors who maintained one unified country for more than 1,300 years.
The path toward resolution of South-North problems is already open. It lies in the enactment of the South-North Basic Agreement, adopted on Dec. 13, 1991. The authorities in the South and the North have already reached complete agreement on three issues, namely reconciliation, exchanges and cooperation, and non-aggression between the South and the North. . . .
I earnestly appeal to North Korean authorities. Many members of separated families have grown old and are passing away. We must let those separated from their families in the South and the North meet and communicate with each other as soon as possible. On this point, I take note of some positive signs North Korea has shown of late. I also hope that the two sides will expand cultural and academic exchanges as well as economic exchanges on the basis of separating the economy from politics.
I hope that interaction between the South and North will expand in many fields based on the South-North Basic Agreement. First of all, I propose an exchange of special envoys for carrying out the South-North Basic Agreement. I am ready to agree to a summit meeting, if North Korea wants. . . .

HEADLINE: College Endowments Top $150 Billion On the Wings of a Soaring Economy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Robust investment returns coupled with strong donations to higher education have created a financial boom for American colleges and universities, 25 of which now have endowments of $1 billion or more.
The total value of all of their endowments grew 21.9 percent in the academic year that ended last June, topping $150 billion -- $27 billion more than the year before. 
 Among the new billionaires are Duke, Case Western Reserve and Johns Hopkins universities.
The University of Virginia, one of a small but growing number of public institutions entering the major leagues of fund-raising, is doing so well that it is increasing the goal of its current fund-raising campaign to $1 billion by the end of the century from $750 million.
The huge increase in the value of stocks, real estate and other university endowment assets is not merely a change on paper. Income from endowments pays for financial aid, faculty salaries, graduate fellowships, advanced information technology and new buildings and services like a library extension at Dartmouth College and a new art exhibition space at Virginia.
Development officers are jubilant about the gains.
"We're experiencing some happy times," said Bill Nugent, president of the University of Illinois Foundation. "We more than doubled our endowment in four years. The $1 billion drive we started in 1992 now stands at $980 million. The money is coming in at the rate of $25 million a month, so we should reach our goal by the end of March."
Thomas Kinnear, the vice president for development at the University of Michigan, which completed a billion-dollar drive last September with an overrun of $413 million, said, "The mine was a lot richer than we thought it was."
Yale University has done so well in fund-raising that its development officer, Charles Pagnam, said he could afford to relax.
"We kicked off a $1.5-billion drive in 1992," Mr. Pagnam said, "and ended it last June with $1.72 billion. Now it's important that we take a little bit of a rest."
Most of the major fund-raisers are private universities like Harvard, Cornell and Stanford; a few are public, like Michigan and Illinois.
A handful of others, including Virginia, sometimes call themselves "state assisted" because only a small part of their income derives from state appropriations. Virginia receives only about 11 percent of its income (including money for University Hospital) from the state.
Academic fund-raisers are not troubled by the prospect of a stock market decline.
"We're hedging against that with a very conservative and varied portfolio," Mr. Nugent said. "If the market does go down, it will probably be down from the 20 percent growth that we see today to a more normal 6 percent. That might mean we just wouldn't be able to grow so fast."
Last year the average investment return rate for colleges and universities was 20.4 percent, an increase over the average 1996 return of 17.2 percent, according to an annual study conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.
The study notes that college and university endowments have achieved double-digit return rates on their investments six times in the 1990's. The highest rate of return ever reported since the study began in 1974 was in 1986, when the average rate was 26.9 percent.
Thomas M. Reardon, the vice president of development for Harvard, which is now 85 percent of the way toward its goal of raising $2.1 billion by the end of the century, said the stock market rise was chiefly responsible for the money coming in ahead of schedule.
"With the market up," Mr. Reardon said, "if you have a pledge outstanding there's certainly an advantage to paying it off earlier. That also allows the university to have the full impact of the gift sooner."
But some development officers play down the performance of the market. Mr. Kinnear of Michigan said: "I'm not aware of any giver who contributed just because of the rise of the market. Many of the larger gifts, probably 90 of them who gave a million or more, had sources of income other than the market, so they were unaffected by its rise."
Another factor in the boom is more aggressive fund-raising by state-supported colleges and universities in response to a decline in state support in the early 1990's. Most of these drives have been remarkably successful. Virginia is a good example.
"With the collapse of state funding between 1991 and 1993," John T. Casteen, Virginia's president, said, "we were faced with making desperate financial choices. The state contribution fell from $128 million in 1989-90 to $109 million three years later, and by 1993 we came to understand that the State of Virginia -- unlike Michigan, Texas and California -- was not going to be putting the money back."
Mr. Casteen added: "Furthermore, because of state restrictions and reductions, our faculty salaries were no longer competitive. In one extreme case in the mid-1990's, seven senior professors in the department of economics left. We had to decide whether we wanted to see the university disintegrate or pursue an earlier plan we had started to develop in 1990 to become one of a handful of the dominant public universities. We decided to take the latter course and be in the top tier regardless of state support."
Richard Chait, a professor of higher education at Harvard, listed yet another reason for the growth in endowments.
"The smart money," Mr. Chait said, "sees that knowledge will be to the 21st century what natural resources and raw materials have been to the 20th century, and if you're a corporation or a wealthy individual who wants to generate intellectual capital to meet that change, what better place to support than a university?"

HEADLINE: U.S. Trails the World in Math and Science

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
The most comprehensive and rigorous international comparison of schooling ever undertaken reveals American high school seniors to be among the industrial world's least prepared in mathematics and science, prompting educators and political leaders, including President Clinton, to call for a re-examination of the nation's approach to teaching quantitative skills.
Particularly devastating, the American officials said, was the bleak performance of the best American students in advanced subjects. In physics and advanced mathematics, not one of the countries involved -- including less well-off nations like Greece, Cyprus and Latvia -- scored lower than the United States. 
 "This study has burst another myth," said William H. Schmidt, an educational statistician from Michigan State University who coordinated the American portion of the study. "Our best students in mathematics and science are simply not world class. Even the very small percentage of students taking Advanced Placement courses are not among the world's best."
The results seemed particularly jarring given the continuing dominance of the United States in a global economy based increasingly on information and technology. Some wondered whether American colleges and universities were making up for the gaps.
The data, released yesterday, are from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, which in the spring of 1995 tested samplings of 4th, 8th and 12th graders. More than 40 countries participated in the 8th-grade portion and about half that number in each of the other two sections. The Asian nations, traditional high performers, did not take part in the high school portion.
The fourth-grade results, released in June, showed the United States to be above the international average and were hailed as evidence that the attention paid in recent years to improving schools was paying off.
The eighth-grade results, released seven months earlier, had raised some concern because Americans dipped below the international average in mathematics although they scored above it in science.
But the latest results, for high school seniors, are being greeted with shock and dismay by large numbers of educators and officials who see them as evidence of a fundamental national failing.
"There is something wrong with the system and it is our generation's responsibility to fix it," President Clinton said yesterday in response to the results of the study. "You cannot blame the schoolchildren."
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the results confirmed what the Administration has been saying: that the country needs clearer, firmer academic standards and better prepared science teachers.
Conservative lawmakers have opposed the national tests on grounds that they would represent a centralization of education, which they view as more properly controlled locally.
While versions of the international study in the 1960's, 70's and 80's produced equally poor results for American high schoolers, they were largely discounted because of perceived societal and educational differences between the United States and other countries. This time, officials say the differences have narrowed, and those that remain were statistically accounted for.
Those who carried out the study said there were no clear or simple explanations for the low level of American performance. "It is not class size or homework or social life or television," said Ina V. S. Mullin of Boston College, co-deputy director of the study. "Around the world, everybody watches television."
The examination given to the 12th graders consisted of four parts: general mathematics, which includes fractions and percentages, graphics and some algebra; general science, which includes earth science, life science and physical science; advanced mathematics, which includes calculus, geometry and equations, and physics.
Students were selected to represent their nations; 23 countries participated in some part of the exam. To account for margins of error, results were clustered into groups.
In general knowledge of mathematics, American 12th graders did better than those in only two countries, Cyprus and South Africa. Students in four countries, Italy, Russia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, performed at the same level as those in the United States. Fourteen countries outperformed America, led by the Netherlands and Sweden. The results were similar for science.
The advanced mathematics assessment was given to students who had taken or were taking pre-calculus, calculus or Advanced Placement calculus, and the advanced physics assessment to students who had either taken or were taking physics or Advanced Placement physics. In advanced math, 11 countries outperformed the United States and no country performed more poorly; in physics, 14 countries did better than the United States and none did worse.
One ray of light was performance by American students who took Advanced Placement calculus. When these students -- about 5 percent of those in the nation -- were separated out and measured against students abroad in advanced mathematics, they did slightly better than the international average. But in physics, when the same statistical exercise was done, Americans were still below the international average.
One of the nagging problems worldwide seen in the study was a sex gap favoring boys in math and science. Boys significantly outperformed girls in mathematics and science in all 21 countries tested in the fields except Cyprus, South Africa and the United States.
Pascal D. Forgione Jr., the United States Commissioner of Education Statistics, said that previous explanations for the country's comparatively poor performance no longer held true. In the past, Mr. Forgione said, other countries tended not to keep the less academically oriented youngsters in school whereas the United States did, meaning different populations were being tested. Also, the American high school population was seen as more diverse. The international studies were often dismissed as a comparison of apples and oranges.
Now, Mr. Forgione said, "the gap between our kids finishing their schooling and those of other countries has closed. And the level of diversity in other countries now matches that of ours."
Many experts argued that American pupils start out ahead of their foreign peers in elementary school but as they move through middle and high school are challenged less and less because the curriculum tends to be repetitive. In other countries, the curriculum in middle school enters more advanced fields, like geometry and chemistry.
Only a handful of American states require mathematics or science through all four years of high school. Last year, the New York State Board of Regents toughened graduation standards, requiring students planning to graduate in 2005 and beyond to take three years each of mathematics and science and pass college preparatory exams in five subjects.
New York City schools have started programs to prepare students for the more rigorous standards, including weekend and evening tutoring in math and science.
The study released yesterday was sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, an international cooperative of research centers based in Amsterdam.

HEADLINE: Nike Earnings Won't Beat Expectations

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Nike Inc., the world's largest sports shoe maker, said today that its earnings for the latest quarter would be lower than Wall Street expectations and that it was planning job cuts.
Citing order cancellations in the Asia Pacific region and close-out sales in the United States, Nike said it expected diluted earnings of 24 cents to 28 cents a share for its third quarter, ending on Saturday. 
 That compares with the Wall Street consensus of 38 cents a share, according to First Call, and earnings for its second quarter of $141 million, or 48 cents a share. The second-quarter earnings were also well below analysts' expectations.
Nike said it was examining its overall cost structure and planned "realignments and reductions in its global work force, aimed at improving profitability." The company said this would probably result in a revamping charge in the fiscal year ending May 31.
The Asian financial crisis has been cutting into Nike's profits and battering the stock. The company also had a $1.4 billion inventory glut at the end of the previous quarter. Nike also said earnings for the full year would be below the previously stated range of $2 to $2.15 a share. In the last full fiscal year, Nike earned $796 million, or $2.68 a share. Nike's stock closed today at $43.125, down $3.5625. The news was released after the stock market closed.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE WAY IT HAPPENED;
Fingerprints on Iraqi Accord Belong to Albright

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Early on Sunday morning, Feb. 15, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright boarded a small C-20 Air Force plane at Andrews Air Force base and flew to New York for a secret meeting with Secretary General Kofi Annan at his Sutton Place town house.
Ms. Albright was carrying a confidential paper that laid out the "red lines," or American requirements for his mission to proceed. In her meeting with Mr. Annan, the two diplomats discussed what eventually became Iraq's agreement with the United Nations to open its so-called presidential sites to weapons inspectors. 
 The conversation, which lasted for almost two hours, also resolved weeks of debate by President Clinton and his top security aides over the best way to settle the most recent crisis with Iraq, according to senior Administration officials.
And it demonstrated that Washington was far more actively involved in planning the United Nations chief's mission than it previously acknowledged.
During intense discussions, Mr. Clinton and his national security advisers moved away from from a plan to hit Mr. Hussein with the biggest military strike of the Clinton Presidency. They concluded that in the absence of solid international and domestic support, it was best to mount yet another diplomatic effort.
As the crisis grew, Bill Richardson, the United States representative to the United Nations, strongly opposed Mr. Annan's mission, arguing that the chief United Nations diplomat was too likely to give in to Iraqi demands and that an agreement with President Saddam Hussein could not be trusted.
At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen was skeptical. For months he had argued passionately about the threat of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons. When Mr. Hussein refused to allow inspectors access to the presidential sites in December, Mr. Cohen made the case for a prompt military strike.
The discussions were so far-reaching that at one point Vice President Al Gore suggested that the Administration consider designating Mr. Hussein a war criminal, a proposal that prompted a debate on its risks and merits.
Ms. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, told Mr. Clinton that Mr. Annan's trip was a potential opportunity and not a trap. Together, the two aides developed the American "red lines" for the mission. During one meeting at the White House, the President made clear that the Administration would support Mr. Annan's trip -- but only if Washington's requirements were met.
"You can't have Kofi going there and the United States not support it and then have military action," a senior White House official quoted Mr. Clinton as saying. "The President said: 'Look, I don't want him negotiating. It's our military that is getting the inspectors back in. I want a clear consensus among the international community, a consensus on his instructions before he goes to Baghdad.' " And, Mr. Clinton reportedly added, "I want a written statement with a signature."
Iraq had been testing the will of the inspectors since a Security Council resolution passed at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 gave them unlimited access to Iraq with the aim of eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
But the debate reached a critical point in November, when Mr. Cohen sounded the alarm over Iraq's suspected cache of chemical and biological weapons. Mr. Cohen, a Republican and former lawmaker who served on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, had long warned about the spread of weapons of mass destruction and highlighted it in his speeches.
He was not counting on diplomacy to solve the problem. Last November, when the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, brokered a diplomatic settlement to resolve an earlier crisis over the inspections, the Pentagon predicted that it was just a matter of time before Mr. Hussein blocked the inspectors again.
It took only a few weeks. In mid-December, Iraq told Richard Butler, the chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, that it planned to exclude the inspectors from the presidential sites.
 
Pentagon Ready To Attack in December
The Pentagon was ready to act. The plan was to launch a military strike against Iraq before Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, which began on Dec. 31.
"The Pentagon was on a clear track to take action before the holiday and had a plan to do it," an Administration official said.
Mr. Clinton also seemed ready this time for military action, an official said.
Not everybody in the Administration was prepared to act that quickly. There were many unsolved issues. The Administration had not consulted extensively with Congress or lined up support among its allies. Nor had it won over the public.
According to the Pentagon, the next opportunity to strike Iraq would come after Ramadan ended on Jan. 29.
By late January, Mr. Clinton had signed off on a military plan that could be carried out should diplomacy fail. But in Moscow and Paris, there was opposition to a military strike. Both the Russians and the French worked hard -- separately and together -- to head of an American attack.
A French official paraphrased President Jacques Chirac as telling the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in a phone conversation: "You know, Boris, you and I are trying to avoid a war over there. Bill wants to strike. Maybe you and I have a role to play."
Some of the closest Arab allies of the United States, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, agreed, and made their opposition to military action clear.
By early February, there was strong international pressure for sending Mr. Annan to Baghdad, but the Administration initially urged him not to go.
In a meeting with Security Council representatives from France, Russia, Britain and China on Feb. 11, Mr. Richardson said he could not see the value of a mission to Baghdad by Mr. Annan, participants in the meeting said. It did not seem to matter to him that Mr. Annan was in the room.
By the time Ms. Albright met the Secretary General four days later, the American position had changed.
She, along with Mr. Berger, knew that if the United States was the lone holdout on an Annan mission, Washington would appear isolated. It could not stop Mr. Annan from going to Baghdad on his own authority.
The State Department was also concerned about the effect of bombing on the Middle East peace effort and on American relations with the gulf Arabs. If the Secretary General went to Baghdad, won Iraqi agreement and then Iraq reneged, the United States would be able to make a stronger case with its allies for military action.
Sitting in Mr. Annan's town house over lunch, Ms. Albright laid out the "red lines:" The inspectors must have "operational control" over all investigations of suspected biological and chemical weapons sites in Iraq. They would also have to have unrestricted access to all sites and must serve as the sole judge of Iraqi compliance.
If Mr. Annan reached an agreement with Mr. Hussein, she added, the United States wanted it in writing. Its violation would have "the severest consequences," she said, alluding to punishing air strikes already planned by the Pentagon.
In heated discussions in the Security Council, the Russians gave up their demand that the inspections of presidential sites should be limited; the United States agreed to the French idea for the appointment of diplomatic "chaperones" for the inspectors for the presidential sites and the postponement of a military strike.
But much to Washington's dismay, the Council could not agree on written instructions for Mr. Annan.
Before Mr. Annan left, Sir John Weston, the chief British representative, read him words of "advice" based on what he said was "a level of agreement." The advice met the American requirements. But Mr. Annan insisted that he needed some room to negotiate and would not be a mere messenger.
 
A Dozen Hours Of Annan-Aziz Talks
From the moment Mr. Annan arrived in Baghdad on Friday, he knew that the Iraqis were serious about making a deal, his aides said. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, insisted that he and Mr. Annan talk privately that night instead of waiting until their first scheduled meeting in the morning.
It was the start of a dozen hours of meetings with Mr. Aziz, Mr. Hussein's English-speaking aide who had signaled in telephone conversations with Mr. Annan that Mr. Hussein was ready to negotiate seriously. By Saturdaymorning, Mr. Annan realized how difficult the negotiations would be.
He presented Mr. Aziz with the outline of an agreement that was based loosely on the "advice" he had received from the Security Council.
Mr. Aziz did not seem happy. And when the meeting broke up, the two men summoned all their aides for a formal two-and-a-half-hour encounter.
Mr. Aziz accused the inspectors of being too intrusive, according to a participant in the meeting, saying they wanted to wander through Mr. Hussein's residences and rifle through his personal belongings, something he said no sovereign leader could tolerate.
At the end of the meeting, Mr. Annan thanked his host for his "frank expose," adding, "We will try to do the best job; we can try to do an honest job," a United Nations official quoted him as saying. He called the inspections "a sacred requirement for us."
Mr. Annan dismissed much of what Mr. Aziz said as posturing for colleagues, and from then on, the two men met one on one.
But they could not agree on the most sensitive issue: how intrusive inspections of the presidential sites would be.
Mr. Aziz insisted throughout the day that inspection of those sites be conducted only once and last only 60 days. When the meetings broke up at 2 A.M., there was no deal.
At one point, Mr. Annan called Ms. Albright in Washington to tell her that the Iraqis would not budge and that he might not be able to get them to do more. She told him the restrictions on presidential site inspections were a "deal-breaker," an Administration official said.
Mr. Annan also called Mr. Primakov to ask for his intervention. The Russian Foreign Minister, who has known Mr. Hussein for three decades, called Mr. Aziz and told him that, indeed, there could be no time constraints placed on the inspectors.
Given Russia's decades of support for Iraq, that was a serious setback for Iraq.
Mr. Annan told Mr. Aziz that no country in the Security Council would support such a limitation. "I simply cannot agree to anything that implies it be a time-limited exercise," an aide to Mr. Annan paraphrased him as saying.
But Mr. Annan was so discouraged that late on Saturday night he asked an aide to draft two statements by the next morning -- one that expressed satisfaction that a diplomatic agreement had been reached, another that expressed deep "regret" that the mission had failed.
Mr. Annan approved both statements. The issue was still not resolved by noon Sunday, when Mr. Annan and three aides were picked up at the pink stucco villa where they were staying and driven in government limousines to a location not disclosed to them. Their destination: the Republican Palace, Mr. Hussein's primary residence on the banks of the Tigris River and, ironically, one of the buildings off-limits to weapons inspectors. There Mr. Hussein, who had shed his military uniform for a dark blue business suit, greeted his guests warmly, posing with them for pictures.
Mr. Annan was described by aides as respectful of Mr. Hussein, calling him a leader who needed to take a bold step for peace.
"He made clear to Saddam that he had a tremendous responsibility and that he should have no illusions about what the consequences would be if there should be no agreement," a United Nations official said. But Mr. Annan added, "I cannot back away from my bottom line."
 
Deal Is Struck For Full Access
After three hours of talks that focused not only on the inspections but also on Mr. Hussein's insistence on a deadline for lifting economic sanctions against Iraq, they struck a deal allowing inspectors immediate and unconditional access throughout the country. It also provides for diplomatic chaperones on inspecting the eight presidential sites.
In his news conference today, Mr. Annan praised the Iraqi leadership for its "courage, wisdom, flexibility."
"Homage to Saddam" was how one diplomat at the United Nations described the news conference.
In Washington, the Administration tentatively embraced the agreement it helped formulate, adding that important ambiquities needed to be resolved. But to some officials, the new agreement seems more like a temporary truce than a final settlement of the bitter inspection issue.
Mr. Clinton said the agreement might, at long last, enable the United Nations inspectors to carry out their mission.
But picking up the theme of the Adminstration's "red lines," he also warned that if the accord collapsed, the United States was poised to strike "at a time, place and manner of our choosing."

Regulators Approve Niagara Rate Plan

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
After several false starts in recent weeks, state regulators yesterday unanimously approved the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's rate plan, which the utility claimed it needed to avoid bankruptcy.
Large industrial and commercial users would see rates drop by up to 25 percent over three years under the plan. Utility executives hope that will stimulate the economy throughout Niagara Mohawk's service territory in upstate New York. 
 Residential and small commercial customers would get far more modest rate decreases of 3.2 percent over the first three years of the five-year plan.
Critics say "Power Choice" does little to open up the market to competition and leaves New York's rates about 40 percent above the national average.
John F. O'Mara, chairman of the State Public Service Commission, conceded that he would have liked to see a greater rate decrease for residential users, but he called the plan the "best available solution."
The commission's approval of the Niagara Mohawk proposal brings to six out of the seven investor-owned utilities in New York that have established revamping plans. All have been constructed along the same general lines: holding current rates steady or rolling them back and requiring the utilities to give customers a choice of electricity suppliers.
In return, the utilities have got the right to venture into other, potentially more lucrative, business ventures.
Niagara Mohawk provides gas and electricity to 2 million customers in upstate New York.

Interest on State Bonds Is Lowest Since 1971

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
The state sold $410 million in bonds yesterday to pay for programs ranging from historic preservation to assistance for people with disabilities, and the interest rate, 4.77 percent, was the lowest since 1971, state officials said.
Mary Lou Murphy, a spokeswoman for the State Treasury Department, attributed the low interest rate to the state's strong bond ratings. Moody's Investors Service gave New Jersey an Aa1 rating, the second highest of 19 classifications. That is the same rate the state has had since 1992. 
 But factors outside the state also played a role in the low interest rate on the bonds. James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, noted that interest rates on long-term Treasury bonds are also hitting record lows.
The rating was based in part on Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's proposed budget for the 1999 fiscal year, which for the first time in several years has not relied on borrowing, refinancing and other one-time methods of raising revenue, said Renee Boicort, a Moody's analyst.
But Ms. Boicort said Moody's credit outlook for the state remains negative, reflecting concern that New Jersey is not prepared for an economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Opposition in South Korea Blocks Leader's Choice for Premier

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 25

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung faced his first political crisis today just a few hours after he was inaugurated, when the political opposition blocked his choice for Prime Minister and delayed formation of a Cabinet.
Negotiations are under way, and Mr. Kim may coax enough votes in the National Assembly to allow approval of his Prime Minister. But the incident underscored the difficulties that Mr. Kim will face while ruling the country with a party that commands a minority of the votes in the National Assembly. 
 The nominee for Prime Minister, Kim Jong Pil, is an odd figure in today's South Korea, in part because he represents much of what President Kim does not. While Kim Dae Jung was a lifelong democracy campaigner, Kim Jong Pil started out as a military officer and was the architect of the 1961 coup that led to more than a quarter-century of harsh military rule.
Kim Jong Pil, who even his critics acknowledge is brilliant and charming, was also the founder of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, which was responsible for brutal repression for more than two decades. The agency in 1973 -- after Kim Jong Pil had left it -- kidnapped Kim Dae Jung in Japan and apparently planned to kill him, until the United States intervened.
Still, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong Pil joined forces in the election campaign last year for what both sides generally agree were reasons of opportunism rather than policy: it was the only way that they could get elected.
Kim Dae Jung almost certainly would not have won the presidency without the support of Kim Jong Pil, and their deal stipulated that if elected Kim Dae Jung would become President and Kim Jong Pil would become Prime Minister.
The Grand National Party, which in the past controlled the presidency and still controls a majority of the National Assembly seats, boycotted today's session -- meaning that there was no quorum and no action could be taken -- because it opposes Kim Jong Pil. It argues that Kim Jong Pil is a figure from Korea's repressive past and that he lacks the experience to revive the economy.
"It's improper to ram through the appointment of Kim Jong Pil as Prime Minister," Maeng Hyung Kyu, a party spokesman, said today. "We urge the Government to select a wise figure who will help the nation overcome its present crisis."
Kim Dae Jung and his associates argue that the voters knew about the arrangement, and that the appointment of Kim Jong Pil to be Prime Minister is thus the voters' will. They say that Kim Jong Pil will not withdraw his candidacy and that they will try to get enough defectors from the opposition to win approval for Kim Jong Pil.
"I sincerely hope that there will be agreement over the appointment of Kim Jong Pil as Prime Minister," Kim Dae Jung told dinner guests tonight. Referring to the opposition, he added, "I also hope that I will receive cooperation so that I can fulfill the tasks of the presidency."
The prospect of a political battle sent the Korean stock market tumbling, with the main stock index closing down 4.5 percent.
The delay in selecting a Prime Minister has also forced a postponement in the announcement of the Cabinet, which is nominally chosen by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's job has far less weight than the President's, but if the President dies then the Prime Minister takes over -- and that is a consideration since President Kim is 74 and beginning a five-year term.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Rise After Greenspan's Testimony Is Shrugged Off

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities gained for the first time in six days yesterday, as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, concluded two days of Congressional testimony by saying little else to alarm investors in bonds.
Bond prices had slumped on Tuesday as Mr. Greenspan, speaking before the House Banking Committee, warned the financial markets not to be complacent about the outlook for inflation and investors concluded that no cut in interest rates by the Fed was likely in the near term. Yesterday he repeated much the same message, this time to the Senate Banking Committee, but investors apparently concluded that the market had moved too far in recent sessions. 
 The gains were also supported by a solid reception for the Government's auction yesterday of a new five-year note.
As a result, the price of the 30-year bond rose 18/32, to a price of 102 29/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.92 percent, from 5.96 percent on Tuesday. Still, bonds with shorter maturities lagged behind the 30-year bond, held back by the belief that the Fed will keep interest rates steady for the time being. Yields on shorter-term securities are already near the 5.5 percent of the Federal funds rate, the Fed's main monetary policy lever.
"The reality is that the market always overreacts to Greenspan comments," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla. Though Mr. Greenspan is always vigilant about inflation, Mr. Pugliese said, the Fed chairman also said that the United States economy had not yet felt the impact of the Asian economic crisis, which is expected to keep inflation in check by lowering prices -- first of imports, and later of domestic goods that compete with them.
In the bond market, "the last two days and the next few will probably be the best buying opportunity for quite some time," Mr. Pugliese said. "The long-term trend for bonds is for higher prices and lower yields," he said. "The economy has shown it can operate at near full capacity without generating inflation."
Evidence of the robust economy could be seen yesterday in a report from the the National Association of Realtors, which said that resales of homes increased by seven-tenths of a percent in January, to a record high annual rate of 4.40 million units.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "Quite obviously housing has yet to display any signs of slowing."
"The key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil in Asia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending and tight labor markets," Mr. Fine said.
Yesterday's auction of $11 billion in new five-year notes came in better than the sale of two-year notes on Tuesday, with the yield coming in as expected at 5.605 percent. While the level of noncompetitive bidding was weaker than the average during the last 12 auctions and below the level of the January auction, the bid-to-cover ratio -- which measures the total bids with the value of the auction -- was decent at 2.72 to 1, traders said. Tomorrow the Treasury will sell $12 billion of 52-week bills and $23 billion of 44-day cash management bills.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Devalue the yuan? China doesn't seem about to do that.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
CHINA faces slower growth, increased pressure from Asian competitors for its export markets and a desperate need to create real jobs for millions now ungainfully employed in bloated state enterprises. Devaluing its currency, the yuan, could ease some of these pressures. Last week Lee Hsien Loong, the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, told The Wall Street Journal that Chinese "devaluation can't be entirely ruled out."
But the closer one looks at the case for devaluation, the weaker it seems. The political and economic downside from devaluation is so great that China-watchers are nearly united in their conviction that at least for the immediate future the yuan is as good as gold. "The guys running China aren't bluffing," argued Gregory Chow, an economist at Princeton University. "There is no chance they'll devalue." 
 A devaluation, the textbook argument goes, would begin by easing work force strains. With productivity exploding and displaced rural workers flooding the cities, China needs rapid economic growth simply to keep the unemployment rate from rising. The issue has taken on fresh urgency as Zhu Ronghi, the brains behind China's current economic planning, struggles to detach cash-hemorrhaging state enterprises from their artificial financial supports.
Chinese devaluation would also prevent the loss of markets to Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian and Philippine manufacturers that now have an advantage thanks to the recent depreciation of their local currencies. And it would give heavy industry in China's state sector a better chance of competing against imports. "There's no question pressure for devaluation will come from both provincial leaders looking for export growth and the state enterprise managers," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
But the arguments for ignoring the textbooks are formidable. Devaluation would make imports more expensive and slow the rise of living standards. Put it another way: the number of hours a Chinese teen-ager would have to labor making Beanie Babies to buy a Honda motor scooter or an airplane ticket to Hong Kong would increase sharply.
Devaluation would also have less impact on export volume than is widely assumed. For starters, Mr. Hormats notes, much of the potential for export growth in southern Asia is in apparel. But volume is artificially constrained by European and American import quotas. And virtually all Asian apparel exporters are already bumping up against their limits.
Equally important, suggests Rudi Dornbusch, an economist at M.I.T., devaluation is a moving target. "China recognizes that as a large actor it almost inevitably invites a reaction from other countries, forcing second helpings -- competitive devaluations -- from everyone else," he said. The export-stimulating effect of cheapening the yuan might even be fully offset by a cheaper rupiah, baht and ringit.
Note, too, that devaluation would put immense pressure on Hong Kong to abandon its anchor to the United States dollar. In theory, there is no reason Hong Kong's currency should be especially affected by the yuan: Hong Kong, a giant financial services and marketing center for the region, doesn't compete much with the rest of China. But any weakness in Beijing would probably cause speculators to test Hong Kong's commitment to its currency board. And to survive the assault, Hong Kong would have to cope with higher interest rates and an even deeper recession -- not to mention a serious loss of face for the city's masters in Beijing.
In the final reckoning, though, the best reason to believe China won't devalue anytime soon is that it won't have to. Unlike countries with freely convertible currencies, China is under no obligation to trade dollar reserves for yuan with anyone who asks. And unlike Indonesia, Korea or Thailand, it has plenty of reserves to pay those who do have contractual claims to foreign exchange. Mr. Dornbusch estimates that China's war chest of dollars and yen is three times the foreign debts of its banks and six times the nation's entire foreign debt coming due in the next year.
Nor is this picture likely to change anytime soon. By estimates of Goldman, Sachs, China will continue to run a balance-of-payments surplus, implying that its reserves will increase in the near term.
Few analysts argue that China will be able to ride out the Asian economic storms without getting damp. Indeed, the almost inevitable decline in China's growth rate spells real trouble for a ruling elite whose political legitimacy depends on its economic success. But trouble hardly translates into a self-induced currency crisis.
"China has big economic problems," Mr. Dornbusch said. "Devaluation would only add to them."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Big Newsprint Maker Offers $1.4 Billion to Acquire Rival

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MONTREAL, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. said today that it had offered $2 billion (Canadian), or $1.4 billion (United States), to acquire Avenor Inc., a rival newsprint producer that rejected the unsolicited proposal as inadequate.
Shares of Avenor rose above the price being offered by Abitibi, indicating that investors expected a higher bid to be made by Abitibi or a competing company. 
 Abitibi, the world's biggest newsprint maker, was created by the merger last May of Abitibi-Price and Stone Consolidated. Like other forestry companies, it is trying to cut costs to increase profits. Although newsprint prices have risen in recent months, some analysts expect them to fall back if Asian economies deteriorate further.
"What's driving it is the lack of profitability in the industry and the fact that the newsprint business is mature," said Brian Topp, an analyst with the Deacon Capital Corporation of Toronto. "You can grow better by acquisition."
Abitibi offered to pay $28 (Canadian) a share in cash, or 1.425 Abitibi shares, for each Avenor share. It would also assume about $1 billion (Canadian) of Avenor debt.
Avenor shareholders may choose cash or stock, but Abitibi said it would not pay more than one-third of the offer's price in stock or more than two-thirds in cash.
The bid was 21 percent above Avenor's closing share price in Toronto Tuesday. Today, however, Avenor stock jumped $7.30, or 31 percent, to $30.40. Abitibi fell 45 cents, to $19.20.
John Duncanson of Duncanson Investment Research in Toronto said Avenor was a takeover target because it had cut costs recently and had good assets.
The company has not had a full-time chief executive since late last year. Last March, Avenor shareholders rejected a $2.44 billion plan to buy the debt-laden Repap Enterprises Inc., a vote that ended a proposal by Domtar Inc. to buy the combined companies.
"The 28 bucks won't fly," Mr. Duncanson said of the current offer. "It's got to be all cash, and I figure it's going to take $30 or $32."
Abitibi said the takeover of the Montreal-based Avenor would generate annual cost savings of $140 million and would give Abitibi 22 paper mills, with 17 in Canada, 4 in the United States and one in Britain. The combined company would have annual newsprint production of 4.2 million tons.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Most of the Major Market Gauges Surge to Record Levels

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
If investors were concerned about the fate of the stock market this year, their fears seem to have dissipated.
Yesterday, share prices rose sharply, extending a torrid, monthlong run and pushing most of the major stock market indexes up to record levels. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 87.68 points, or about 1.05 percent, to close at a record 8,457.78. Those gains mean the Dow is up 757 points, or nearly 10 percent, in the last five weeks.
Broader gauges followed suit, furthering the notion that as long as the American economy remains healthy, with tame inflation and solid profit growth, investors will pour their money into their favorite equities. There continue to be some worries about the economic crisis in Asia and about a possible slowdown in American corporate profits this year, but analysts say investors show no sign of renouncing their love affair with stocks.
"It's almost hard to imagine a better environment than the one we have right now," said William Paternotte, a market strategist at BT Alex. Brown. "Everything seems to be going our way: inflation, interest rates and the steady economy."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also reached a record, climbing 12.34 points, to 1,042.90. And the Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted in technology issues, rose 27.77 points, to a record 1,766.48.
Buyers were especially keen on technology issues, banks, pharmaceutical, airline and even the recently battered oil company stocks.
The surge in stock prices seems stunning to many on Wall Street, but some say stock prices are just recovering from October's selloff, when the Asian economic crisis seemed certain to depress corporate profits.
But after the crisis stabilized early this year, global markets soared. In most of Asia, stock markets are regaining lost ground. And in Europe, many of the major stock indexes are at record highs.
Indeed, stock markets in six of the seven Group of Seven nations (the exception being Japan) ended yesterday at or just slightly below all-time highs.
"People have been pooh-poohing the U.S. market, but one-third of the world's major markets are trading near all-time highs," said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.
Mr. Birinyi, however, has had his sights focused on the American market, where he tracks buying patterns through a computer program that lists money flows into stocks.
Despite the periodic selloffs over the last few years, he said, investors have remained upbeat and have fed large sums of money into selected stocks, even when they seemed to be slumping. That can happen because stock prices sometimes reflect small and large orders equally, and therefore large purchases are masked behind a lagging stock price. Eventually, however, prices usually rise to reflect the heavy interest in a stock.
He calls his charts a "lead indicator," and when many were predicting that the Dow would fall sharply or, at best, rise 6 to 8 percent in 1998, Mr. Birinyi forecast that the Dow might reach 10,000 this year.
Still, other Wall Street strategists are worried that corporate earnings this year might weaken enough to bring stocks down from their lofty levels. Some companies will start providing hints about first-quarter earnings in March, and analysts worry that these announcements could include unpleasant news.
Indeed, although corporate earnings rose about 8 to 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, First Call Inc., which tracks profits, said that analysts have steadily revised their first-quarter estimates downward in recent weeks.
On Jan. 9, before the fourth-quarter earnings reporting period began, First Call said analysts were projecting gains of about 10.1 percent in the first quarter of 1998. But then the revisions started to come in, and estimates "started falling like stones," said Charles Hill, director of research. Now, he said, analysts are projecting gains of just 4.4 percent for companies listed in the S.& P. 500.
But Mr. Paternotte says the market is rallying on the overall economic environment.
"In spite of the earnings slowdown," he said, "there hasn't been any sign of weakness in the market."

HEADLINE: Court Denies Indian Authority in Alaska Case

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that a remote village in north-central Alaska inhabited by 350 Athabaskan Indians was not "Indian country" and so could not displace the state's taxing and regulatory authority over an area that is about the size of Delaware.
The ruling overturned a lower court's decision that had sent shock waves throughout Alaska. 
 At stake in the case, beyond the boundaries of the Native Village of Venetie, was the status of some 44 million acres, more than 10 percent of Alaska's territory, that were transferred to native corporations under a Federal law, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. Alaskan Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts received nearly $1 billion, in addition to the land, in exchange for yielding all "aboriginal claims" to territory within the state.
A 1996 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, held that the Village of Venetie's 1.8 million acres, while not a reservation, were nonetheless Indian country. In the lower 48 states, that term conveys a degree of sovereignty far beyond the Alaska state government's expectation of the 1971 law, which Congress passed to clear the way for building the Alaska oil pipeline.
For Alaskan natives, many of whom have been disappointed by their lack of economic progress despite the promises of the 1971 law, the Ninth Circuit decision offered the prospect of a new playing field on which the native villages could meet the state as sovereigns within their vast territory.
For the state, which made a special appropriation of $1 million to take the case to the Supreme Court, the decision raised the specter of losing the ability to collect taxes and regulate the use of land and resources that Alaska had assumed remained within its jurisdiction.
While the issue in the case was specific to Alaska, the case captured the attention of other states with Indian populations, because the Ninth Circuit's approach suggested that other Indian communities might be able to win the designation of Indian country more easily than had been anticipated.
The case before the Court today, Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie, No. 96-1577, began as a tax dispute. The village, which is above the Arctic Circle and 60 miles northwest of Fort Yukon, asserted what it said were its sovereign rights as Indian country when it tried to tax a contractor that the state had hired to build a public school in the village.
The state, arguing that the village had no jurisdiction over nontribal members, went to Federal District Court in Alaska for an injunction against the village's efforts. The state won at the District Court level before losing in the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that Venetie was a "dependent Indian community" within the meaning of a 1948 Federal law that defines various categories of Indian lands that make up "Indian country." The Ninth Circuit's opinion suggested that not only could Venetie tax state operations and avoid state regulations, but so could 225 other native villages.
The Supreme Court unanimously reversed that decision today, ruling in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas that while Congress could declare the native villages to be Indian country, it had not done so in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Justice Thomas said Congress had intended the phrase "dependent Indian community" to apply only to a small category of nonreservation Indian lands that satisfied two precise requirements: The property had to have been set aside by the Federal Government as Indian land and it had to be under Federal supervision.
The Native Village of Venetie met neither requirement, Justice Thomas asserted. He said the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act had abolished existing reservations and transferred the reservations' property to private native corporations, which were free to use the land for any purpose they chose, including sale or transfer to non-Indians. Thus, there was no Federal "set-aside" of the lands for exclusive Indian use. The 1971 law also ended active Federal supervision of the land, with the goal "to effect native self-determination and to end paternalism in Federal-Indian relations," he said.
"Whether the concept of Indian country should be modified is a question entirely for Congress," Justice Thomas said.
Michael R. Lazerwitz, a Washington lawyer who filed a brief in the case on behalf of the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of State Legislatures and other state and local groups, said the Court's decision offered a "clear standard" for defining Indian country under current law. "It will be hard now to have a 'dependent Indian community' crop up when a state doesn't expect it," he said.

HEADLINE: Depositors Hope for Windfall When Independence Savings Goes Public

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
When Independence Savings Bank, a venerable savings institution based in Brooklyn, offers its stock to the public in the next week or so, about 50,000 depositors, many of them with small accounts, may have a chance to cash in as insiders on an initial public offering, just like Wall Street high rollers.
"The average guy can't get Netscape as an I.P.O., but they can get this," said Jason Werner, an analyst with Tucker Anthony in Chicago, a stockbroker who follows the little-known world of small banks that convert from mutual to stock ownership. 
 The Independence Savings offering is the culmination of a conversion that began last April when the 148-year-old thrift institution, one of the few remaining mutually owned banks in New York City, announced its intention to sell 70.4 million shares of stock, the fourth thrift in the city to convert from mutual to stock ownership in the last 13 months.
Depositors as of March 31, 1996, were then offered the chance last month to buy up to $500,000 worth of stock each at $10 a share before the stock was offered to the public. And about 25 percent of the bank's 250,000 customers sent in checks for 70.4 million shares of stock.
Final Federal and state regulatory approval was granted last week for the conversion, which is the second-largest thrift conversion in history; the largest was Greenpoint Savings of Manhattan in 1994. And when the stock begins trading in the coming days, it will probably climb, some analysts say, enabling shareholders to sell their stock for a fast and large profit, if they desire. Mutual banks are nominally owned by depositors, though they have little legal control. Profits translate into lower rates on loans and higher rates on savings accounts.
"I have heard that in the past in cases like this, the stock has gone straight up," said Dee Weber, a 76-year-old retiree and longtime depositor who subscribed to the conversion in an amount he would describe only as being in "four figures."
"I think it will at least go up to $13 a share the first day," he added.
Such prognostications are not wild guesses or pipe dreams, either. On Feb. 18, for example, the Richmond County Financial Corporation went public and the stock shot up 63 percent the first day of trading. And on Dec. 22, Staten Island Bancorp went public in a conversion and the stock soared 59 percent in its first day. In January 1997, Roslyn Bancorp went public and its stock rose 50 percent the first day. Greenpoint's stock increased 27 percent its initial day of trading.
Nationally, there have been 26 thrift mutual-to-stock conversions completed since Sept. 30, returning an average first-day rise of 46.1 percent from their offering prices.
"Mutual-to-stock conversions represent a unique and almost unparalleled opportunity for individual investors and for depositors in mutual thrifts," said Chris Smith, research editor at SNL Securities in Charlottesville, Va., which tracks conversions.
"They gave depositors an opportunity to buy at 70 to 80 percent of book value a stock which the market might immediately value at 110 to 120 percent of book value, and down the road could value at 170 to 200 percent of book value," Mr. Smith said, "and all just for opening a certificate of deposit or savings account at the right institution."
To be sure, there is no guarantee these stocks will rise the first day of trading. In 1994, Carver Federal Savings in Harlem declined in price to $7.75 a share from an initial public offering of $10. It is now trading at $15.125 a share. Bank stocks, of course, are very sensitive to interest rates, and a negative change in the economic environment could send many of those stocks down.
But the potential for immediate gains attracts professional investors as well as small depositors. Some speculators will open accounts at banks where conversions are expected with the hope of buying hundreds of thousands of dollars of stock at a discount.
Conversions have become so popular, however, that they often become oversubscribed, as the offering at Independence is, and the depositors get only a small percentage of the stock they requested; the balance of their payment is returned to them. (The formula used to determine how many shares a depositor is allotted is complex and is determined by factors like the size of the deposit and the ratio of large subscribers to small subscribers.)
"Most of the small subscribers will get what they subscribed for, and many of the large ones will not," said Charles J. Hamm, the president and chief executive of the bank. "Many of the subscribers were good community depositors."
Mutual banks in New York State are nonprofit thrift institutions, set up decades ago to provide safe havens for deposits. All the money from the stock sale will go to the bank's balance sheet.
Mr. Hamm said the conversion to a publicly held company would enable it to offer stock, not just cash, for any potential acquisitions. Independence, which raised $704 million in its conversion, has been on an acquisition roll since 1992, buying Long Island City Savings and Loan, State Mutual Savings Bank, Bay Ridge Federal Savings and Loan, five branches of First Nationwide Banking Corporation and a branch of Apple Bank for Savings in Astoria, Queens, with $62 million in assets.
"As a mutual, you can't raise capital, you have to earn it, and that's a long, slow process," Mr. Hamm said. "Having stock also helps us attract talent because we can grant options."
Independence, which has $386 billion in assets and 34 branches in the city, also plans to set aside 8 percent of the value of the stock sold -- $56 million -- to form a community trust that would make loans and grants to low-income housing, charitable groups and for health, educational and social services.

In addition to Independence Savings Bank, other institutions have given their depositors an opportunity to buy stock at an initial public offering price before it was traded. Here's how their stock behaved.

Bertelsmann Plans Website For Book Sales Via Internet

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Bertelsmann A.G., the German media conglomerate, announced plans yesterday for a global electronic bookstore that has the potential to become the world's largest merchant of books. The entry of Bertelsmann, with its vast resources, publishing experience and international distribution network, would challenge the Internet pioneers that now reign in electronic bookselling.
Bertelsmann said it would open for electronic business sometime this year with a venture tentatively called Books Online. It will offer books in major languages with discounts that could compete with the rates of dominant electronic booksellers like Amazon.com, the Seattle-based pioneer that has been battling for primacy with Barnes & Noble's new on-line venture. 
 "It's the first time that you'll be able to buy a book in any language, anytime, any place and have it locally fulfilled," Chip Austin, the newly appointed chief executive of Books Online, said. For example, he added, a customer could order a book from Britain even if it had not been published yet in the United States.
Although Bertelsmann is moving late into the digital world behind Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble Inc. and, shortly, Borders Group Inc., the company boasts that it has resources no rival can match: an elaborate data base of more than 35 million active book and music club members in North America and Europe and a distribution network of more than 40 warehouses in the same regions.
"Our goal is not to be No. 2 or No. 3," Markus Wilhelm, the chief executive of Doubleday Direct, who is overseeing the venture for Bertelsmann, said. "We will try to be the best on line."
And, indeed, Bertelsmann's announcement was chilling to the American Booksellers Association, the national trade group that is dominated by independent booksellers who have been buffeted by superstore expansion.
"This new venture from Bertelsmann is a tremendous, regressive step," Avin Mark Domnitz, the organization's executive director, said, warning in a brief statement that the move could have "significant negative consequences."
Some technology analysts expressed reservations about Bertelsmann's late entry into electronic commerce, pointing out that even a successful bookseller like Borders has repeatedly delayed the opening of its electronic bookstore. "They're going to have to scrap for market share," Joe Sawyer, an analyst for Forrester Research, a technology and market research firm, said.
Chris MacAskill, who founded Computer Literacy and built the company into an electronic bookstore with more than $20 million in sales, said it was difficult for a corporation to move nimbly on line.
"I'm generally a little bit skeptical about people thinking that it is easy getting into the marketplace," Mr. MacAskill said. "Most often, the successful Websites were built by new people who started in this space to be Internet sellers. It didn't come from established players."
The specific look and feel of Bertelsmann's on-line venture is still evolving. Even the name, Books Online, is labeled a working title. Mr. Austin, who heads a group of 25 American employees hired in the last three months for the project, said Bertelsmann would look for inspiration from the "best of the breed competition, like Amazon," which offers descriptions, summaries and reviews of individual titles.
Last month, Bertelsmann opened an on-line bookstore based in Germany called Boulevard Online, which includes common features of Amazon.com like best-seller lists, live chats, reviews and recommendations. That site allows users to search a catalogue of 290,000 books.
But Mr. Austin said he could not give an estimate for the number of titles Books Online will offer for sale globally -- a figure that has led to disputes between Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com. Amazon.com claims an inventory of 2.5 million titles, although many are not physically in stock. Barnes & Noble stocks more than 350,000 titles in its distribution center, which it says is the largest standing inventory of any bookseller on line.
"I can tell you," Mr. Austin said, "that breadth and depth of catalogue is one of the ways we're going to differentiate ourselves."

EMI Bookstore Venture
 LONDON, Feb. 25 (Reuters) -- A venture set up by the British music giant EMI Group P.L.C. agreed today to buy Waterstone's bookstores from the retailer W. H. Smith P.L.C. for 300 million ($495 million).
Under the deal, which was expected, EMI and a private equity group, Advent International, are setting up a joint venture that will be headed by the Waterstone's founder, Tim Waterstone, to buy the book chain. The new venture will, in turn, buy EMI's HMV Group, which consists of the HMV music stores and Dillons bookstores, for up to 500 million.
The deal will create one of Britain's biggest book and music retailers, while paving the way for EMI Group to exit retailing and focus on its core recorded music business.

HEADLINE: Risking Dissent, U.S. Is Expected to Waive Drug Sanctions Against Colombia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The United States has decided to waive drug sanctions against Colombia on national-security grounds, senior Administration officials said today.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has approved the waiver, which is expected to be signed by President Clinton on Thursday and announced later in the day, the officials said. But they cautioned that Mr. Clinton had in the past altered such recommendations at the final stage. 
 Mexico will also be certified again this year as cooperating fully in the war against drugs, the officials said, because of improved counter-narcotics efforts over the last year.
The Administration's decision last year to certify its close ally Mexico in the face of evidence of political corruption by drug traffickers there provoked Congressional protests that the Administration was strong in speaking out against drugs but weak in action.
The decision to waive sanctions on Colombia, which was fully decertified last year and the year before without a waiver, is bound to be controversial. The decision is based on the progress made against the Cali cartel and other drug traffickers by Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, who is praised by key House Republicans for turning a corrupt Colombian police force into a more efficient and professional one.
Furthermore, the officials said, the term of President Ernesto Samper of Colombia, who is accused by Washington of accepting $6 million in campaign contributions from drug traffickers in 1994, ends in August and he cannot be re-elected.
Colombia is also facing increased consolidation of the cocaine cartels on its territory because of a drop in Peruvian production, the officials said, making it more important that Washington work with the Colombian Government and not isolate or alienate it. In addition, the officials said, guerrillas trying to overthrow the Government are obtaining increased aid from drug cartels.
Those countries not certified can lose United States foreign aid and support for development bank loans unless President Clinton grants them a waiver for national-security reasons.
Latin American countries generally regard certification as an exercise in Yankee arrogance, given that Americans are choosing to buy the drugs that Latin Americans grow, and suggest that Washington do more to reduce domestic demand.
Officials said that Colombia still provided the largest amount of cocaine entering the United States, but, one said, "we believe Colombia has made progress, especially in destroying crops, even if not enough to fully certify them."
Praising General Serrano and the police, the officials said the Colombians were working with Washington on legislation against money laundering and corruption. The waiver will be criticized by those who believe that the Colombian security forces are engaged in political violence and repression alongside paramilitary groups, many of which operate in drug-producing areas.
Among the supporters of General Serrano has been Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, an influential New York Republican and chairman of the House International Relations Committee. The United States has continued to provide large amounts of aid to Colombia -- about $100 million last year. It is the largest recipient of United States security assistance in the hemisphere.
Narcotics experts say that Mexico has become a bigger drug problem than Colombia, but has special status as Washington's close partner in the North America Free Trade Association. Mexican traffickers do not produce cocaine, though they tranship it, but they do produce a third of the heroin coming into the United States.
Nonetheless, the officials said, Mr. Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico have formed a close relationship to expand extraditions of drug traffickers and other criminals and worked together to issue a "binational counter-drug strategy."
Last year's certification of Mexico was controversial in part because of timing.
The same week that certification was announced, the Mexican "drug czar," Gen Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was found to be corrupt.

HEADLINE: Nike's Problems Don't Seem To Be Short Term to Investors

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Nike remains the king of the hill in athletic footwear, but its kingdom is under assault.
The leading maker of sneakers in the world, Nike warned on Tuesday that its earnings would be disappointing for the current quarter and said a corporate restructuring was to come. Stock analysts raced to lower their Nike profit forecasts for up to two years. Josie Esquivel, who follows the company for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and at one time expected annual earnings growth of 30 percent, is now forecasting "zero growth over a three-year period." 
 The drastic revision suggests far more than a short-term inventory problem. As Asia's economies falter, bloated inventories have indeed stunted growth in what Nike has long described as one of its most burgeoning markets. But far worse, retailers there have begun canceling orders.
The company has similar problems in its core market in the United States. Sneakers are falling out of fashion in some circles. "Brown shoes," like Wolverine's Hush Puppies and Caterpillar brands, are being rediscovered by young adults. In addition, a number of new stores specializing in athletic footwear have opened in the last year, saturating the market and leading to huge price cuts on some of the company's most popular styles.
While the facts spell problems for the sneaker industry over all, Nike has suffered the most. It is the industry Goliath, with 47 percent of the United States market. Reebok is a distant second with 15 percent.
The company's announcement on Tuesday included a reference to an unspecified number of layoffs and an unspecified charge against earnings for restructuring. Details are expected when the company posts earnings at the end of March. Analysts say the company may drastically reduce advertising and endorsement spending, cut 1,200 to 1,500 of its 22,000 workers and take a restructuring charge of $300 million to $500 million.
Instead of heading for the exits, investors pushed Nike's stock higher.
While investors looking for beaten-down stocks in this pricy market may be forgiven for latching onto Nike, they had better brace for a turnaround that could take at least a couple of years, analysts say. And then, Nike must reinvigorate itself with some innovative products.
Nike says it will take longer to clear up the inventory problems in Asia than in the United States. With the restructuring, the company says inventory could be manageable domestically by the end of its fiscal year in May, with Asian relief not coming until early 1999. Nike's stock, which rose more than 10 percent last week on rumors that the famed value investor Warren E. Buffett was increasing his stake, gained $1.875 yesterday to close at $45.
Meanwhile, 13 of the 19 analysts whose earnings estimates are collected by First Call lowered their 1998 Nike forecasts yesterday to $1.76 a share from $2.
At its current price, the stock is trading at 26 times the forecast for fiscal year 1998 earnings per share, ahead of the broad market average and a lofty level indeed for a company with seriously diminished growth prospects for the near term."
"I'm surprised that the price went up," said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager and head of value investing at the Dreyfus Corporation. "The announcement was a bit worse than people thought," he said.
Still, the restructuring announcement hinted that big changes might be in store.
"If they can cut costs and get rid of inventory, it's a very positive thing," Mr. Ghriskey said, adding that Nike is a core holding in the $4 billion investments he oversees.
Nonetheless, Nike will have to do some quick reshuffling. Analysts' views differ on whether the inventory problems will cause revenue to suffer throughout 1998 or just until the back-to-school season.
In the meantime, things are expected to be tense for top management. Two top executives are already out: Liz Dolan, corporate vice president and director of marketing, stepped down last September, and Stephen Gomez, a 17-year veteran and head of the global apparel business will leave in April.
While a Nike spokesman, Rick Anguilla, says neither was forced to leave, he acknowledged that the company would be reviewing management and did not rule out executive changes.
Many Nike employees identify themselves closely with the company; some, like the chief executive, Phil Knight, are known to sport tattoos of the company's famous "swoosh" logo. But the pressure to bring the company back to its glory days could cause some longtime executives, with sizeable stock holdings, to leave, said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter.
"Nike's biggest challenge is itself," Ms. Esquivel said. "They need to come up with another identity that they can still say, 'This is Nike,' but it's something beyond the swoosh."

HEADLINE: Credit Unions Lose to Banks In High Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
The Supreme Court gave the banking industry an important if perhaps temporary victory today in an intensifying battle to stop the expansion of credit unions. It invalidated a Federal regulation that had allowed millions of people to join the alternatives to banks.
The Court's ruling threw into question the status of as many as 20 million customers of credit unions, the organizations that were born out of the hardships of the Great Depression and have grown into pesky bank rivals in recent years with an array of basic, affordable services ranging from mortgages to checking accounts to A.T.M.'s. 
 "If this decision is allowed to stand, it would be a massive loss for consumers and choice," said Dan A. Mica, president of the Credit Union National Association. "We think we are a counterbalance to banks, and if we were not there the cost of services would go up for all consumers."
Partly because they expected such a ruling, credit union leaders had been gathering support in Congress for a bill that would permit them to expand their membership, effectively overturning the Court's decision. The battle will now shift to that bill, which has 138 co-sponsors from both parties.
But banks have vowed to fight the bill, and it remains unclear how many credit union customers will ultimately be affected when the battle is resolved.
Representatives of the banking industry disavowed any desire to force credit unions to drop members.
"It is not our intent to create credit union widows and orphans," Monique E. Hanis, director of marketing for the Independent Bankers Association, said. The American Bankers Association, the industry's main trade group, also said it would not seek a solution that forced credit unions to give up members. However, Virginia McGuire, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said it was possible that credit unions might have to give up some groups of members that joined since July 30, 1996, when a lower-court decision set the stage for the Court's ruling today.
The question of how to remedy the regulation's invalidity is now before the Federal District Court here, which has delayed that phase of the case for more than a year while the Supreme Court reviewed the merits of the issue.
By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court invalidated a 1982 Federal regulation that had permitted thousands of credit unions to expand their membership base far beyond the relatively narrow employee and community groups around which credit unions were originally organized.
The American Bankers Association had challenged the 1982 regulation on the ground that it violated a 1934 Federal law requiring credit unions to limit membership to "groups having a common bond of occupation or association." In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court agreed.
The regulation issued by the National Credit Union Administration interpreted the phrase "common bond" so broadly, Justice Thomas said, that "it would be permissible to grant a charter to a conglomerate credit union whose members would include the employees of every company in the United States."
The majority opinion, which upheld a 1996 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia.
The four dissenters -- Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer -- did not address the merits of the case. Rather, they disputed the bankers' right to have brought the suit in the first place. Banks did not have standing to challenge the regulation, the dissenters said in an opinion by Justice O'Connor, because banks' competitive stake in the outcome did not place them within the "zone of interests" of the statute at issue, which was aimed at regulating credit unions.
Even though the effects of the Court's decision may be temporary, leaders of the credit union industry continued to warn today that membership for millions of people was still at risk. By coincidence, 4,000 credit union members were in Washington today for the first phase of a lobbying effort in expectation of a Supreme Court defeat. "This is a major, massive survival issue for us and we plan to win," Mr. Mica said.
While the legislative outlook is uncertain, the credit unions appear to have won the initial support of some of the more powerful members of Congress.
On the question of the implications of applying the ruling retroactively. "It is inconceivable to me that Congress will allow millions of Americans to be kicked out of the financial institution of their choice," said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican and the House Banking Committee chairman. He plans to hold hearings on credit union membership next month.
On Tuesday, the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, announced his support of the bill that would write the invalidated regulation into law. The sponsors are Representatives Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, and Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania. While no corresponding measure has been introduced in the Senate, Senator Alfonse M. D' Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said today that "Congress should and will enact legislation to restore the basic right of Americans to join credit unions."
Given the lobbying power of both sides of the debate, analysts said they expected a real struggle when legislation was presented before the House Banking Committee.
"We intend to nullify the court's decision," Mr. LaTourette said today. "I would be shocked if the House and Senate didn't get something to the President before we adjourn for the year."
Edward F. Furash, chairman and chief executive of Furash & Company, a Washington-based financial service industry consultancy, said he expected a "big huge fight" on Capitol Hill.
The case today, the National Credit Union Administration v. the First National Bank & Trust Company, No. 96-843, is rooted in the recession of the early 1980's. Faced with the prospect of bailing out the credit unions of small companies that were failing in substantial numbers, the National Credit Union Administration looked for ways to insulate credit unions from the fortunes of single employers.
For nearly 50 years, the agency had interpreted the Depression-era statute that put credit unions under Federal regulation as placing sharp limits on membership. Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 provides that "Federal credit union membership shall be limited to groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community, or rural district." For employee-based credit unions, the agency had interpreted this language to require all members of the credit union to be united by a "common bond."
Under its reinterpretation issued in 1982, however, the credit union administration began permitting membership by wholly unrelated employee groups, as long as each group had its own common bond. A rapid expansion of credit unions resulted. Today, 3,600 of the 7,000 federally chartered credit unions have members from multiple occupational groups, including many of the biggest credit unions, with 32 million members and 79 percent of all deposits.
Enabled by Federal tax regulations to offer relatively low rates on loans and services, the credit unions began vigorous head-to-head competition with local banks for home mortgages, car loans and checking accounts. Not surprisingly, the banks fought back with lawsuits.
The target of the case before the Court was the AT&T Family Credit Union, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., and originally created in 1952 to serve employees of the Western Electric Company. It now has 300 separate employee groups, including employees of a Coca-Cola bottler and the Duke Power Company. A group of North Carolina banks joined the American Bankers Association in filing suit in 1990.

While their cousins, mutual savings banks and S. & L.'s, were evolving away from community self-help origins into ordinary profitmaking businesses, credit unions have stayed closer to their original mission of providing basic banking services and loans inexpensively to their owner-members.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: SECRET ARSENAL: The Hunt for the Germs of War -- A special report.;
Iraq's Deadliest Arms: Puzzles Breed Fears

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
On a January day in 1995, Dr. Rod Barton, a United Nations weapons inspector with a gambler's instinct, decided to try bluffing the Iraqis. Ever since their defeat in the Persian Gulf war, they had steadfastly denied ever making any kind of germ weapons, despite much evidence to the contrary.
Dr. Barton, a 46-year-old Australian microbiologist, did not have much in his hand -- just two pieces of paper. The documents proved nothing but were provocative: They showed that in the 1980's, Iraq had bought about 10 tons of nutrients for growing germs, far more than needed for civilian work, from a British company. 
 "That was all I had," Dr. Barton recalled in an interview. "Not a full house, just two deuces. So I played them both."
Sitting across from four Iraqi generals and scientists in a windowless room near the University of Baghdad, Dr. Barton laid the documents on the table. Did these, he asked, help refresh the Iraqis' memories?
"They went ashen," he recalled.
That meeting marked a turning point. In the months that followed, Iraq dropped its denials and grudgingly admitted that it had run an elaborate program to produce germ weapons, eventually confessing that it had made enough deadly microbes to kill all the people on earth several times over.
United Nations officials say these disclosures are still seriously incomplete, as does Washington, which has come to the brink of military conflict with Baghdad over the issue.
The United Nations inspectors are now poised to return to Iraq under an accord in which Iraq has promised full cooperation. But the story of the seven-year hunt for secret biological weapons, as recounted by United States, United Nations and private experts, suggests that the inspectors may have a rocky time. It also shows why they believe that Baghdad is still hiding missiles and germ weapons, and the means to make both.
Among the disclosures were these:
*Just before the gulf war in 1991, President Saddam Hussein's son-in-law began a crash military program intended to give Iraq the ability to wipe out Israel's population with germ weapons, an Iraqi general told inspectors. MIG fighters, each carrying 250 gallons of microbes, were to be flown by remote control to release anthrax over Israel. One pilotless plane was flight-tested with simulated germs just before the war began, but the attack was never attempted.
*The locations of more than 150 bombs and warheads built by the Iraqis to dispense germs are a mystery, as are the whereabouts of a dozen special nozzles that Iraq fashioned in the 1980's to spray germs from helicopters and aircraft.
*On nearly all recent missions, inspectors have found undeclared "dual use" items like germ nutrients, growth tanks and concentrators, all of which have legitimate uses but can also make deadly pathogens for biological warfare.
Today, despite progress in penetrating Iraqi secrecy, inspectors say they remain uncertain about most of President Hussein's facilities to wage biological warfare.
The inspectors have found traces of military germs and their seed stocks but none of the thousands of gallons of biological agents that the Iraqis made before the 1991 gulf war. Baghdad says it destroyed the older material but offers no proof.
And the inspectors are unsure of the extent to which Iraq has solved the technical challenges of delivering germs to targets -- a problem that bedeviled other states experimenting with biological arms.
Finally, the United Nations inspectors have suspicions -- but no proof -- that Baghdad is hiding germs and delivery systems. Their worries are based, in part, on a chilling calculus of missing weapons: The United Nations can account for only 25 of the 157 germ bombs that Iraq has acknowledged making for its Air Force.
And inspectors have no idea of the whereabouts of some 25 germ warheads made for missiles with a range of 400 miles; Baghdad says it destroyed them but, again, offers no proof.
Richard Butler, chairman of the United Nations Special Commission charged with eliminating such weapons, said in report after report that the uncertainties are disturbing and legion.
And he recently told the Security Council that the 639-page document that comprises Iraq's latest "full, final and complete" declaration, its fifth to date, "fails to give a remotely credible account" of Baghdad's long effort to make biological arms.
 
The Prologue
Iraq Renounces Germ War, but . . .
In the 1950's and 60's, the world's major armed forces experimented widely with germ warfare. Eventually they concluded that the nightmarish weapons were too repugnant and too difficult to use.
By 1972, the global threat of biological war seemed to recede as Iraq joined the United States, the Soviet Union and more than 100 other nations in signing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. The accord banned possession of deadly biological agents except for defensive work like research into vaccines, detectors and protective gear.
But it was only a pledge. It had no formal means of enforcement and plenty of room for activities that were ambiguous as to whether they were defensive or offensive.
Indeed, Iraq's clandestine effort to acquire biological weapons, some inspectors now suspect, actually began shortly after it signed the convention.
The allure was great. Unlike nuclear arms, dangerous germs are cheap and easy to come by. Yet their effects on people are potentially just as extensive and grim as those of a nuclear bomb, if slower to act. A microbe that divides every 30 minutes can produce a bubbling vat of offspring in a week or so. Even a few can be dangerous.
Anthrax, normally a disease of cattle and sheep, can kill a human after exposure to less than 10,000 germs, all of which would fit comfortably on the period at the end of this sentence. Signs of pulmonary anthrax infection include high fever, labored breathing and vomiting. It is usually fatal within two weeks. A vaccine can prevent the infection, and it can be treated with huge doses of antibiotics if caught in its early stages.
American military and intelligence officials in the 1980's gathered much evidence that Iraq had developed a large program to build biological arms, with the work focused on anthrax.
The West tried to block the effort. In 1988 the Iraqis ordered a 1,325-gallon fermenter to grow germs from a Swiss company, Chemap, and arranged to buy more. But the United States and its allies persuaded Switzerland to block the sale, said Jonathan B. Tucker, a former Federal arms-control official who is now a germ-weapon expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California.
The perceived threat was so great that on the eve of the gulf war, President Bush warned President Hussein that Iraq would pay a "terrible price" if it used biological or chemical weapons.
But the intelligence about germ warfare was generally imprecise, and as the American-led coalition prepared for war after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, planners could identify only one potential germ factory in Iraq. That site, Salman Pak, not far from Baghdad, was bombed in the gulf war.
Though only one factory was identified, the American military started a crash program to vaccinate as many troops as possible against anthrax and opened a campaign to knock out refrigerated bunkers suspected of holding biological arms. After the war, American officials were embarrassed to find that the suspicious bunkers held only conventional arms, sheltered from the desert sun.
After losing the war, Mr. Hussein, as a condition of surrender, agreed to declare within 15 days all his nuclear, chemical and biological arms and the long-range missiles needed to deliver them, and then to destroy them all.
The United Nations set up a group to make sure he kept his word. Until it verified destruction of the weapons, Iraq was barred from selling oil, virtually its sole source of foreign exchange. Later, the United Nations relented a bit and allowed some oil exports to pay for food and medicine and to make reparations to Kuwait.
 
The Hunt
Hide and Seek In the Wilds
Dozens of science detectives, many with military backgrounds, were assembled from several nations after the war to discover the truth about the biological arms. The inspectors, men and women ranging in age from their 20's to their 60's, worked out of dingy, roach-and-rat-infested hotels in Baghdad.
Their first foray was to Salman Pak, a town and military center southeast of Baghdad on an isolated bend of the Tigris River. About 30 inspectors with the commission, known as Unscom, went there in August 1991 because the site was considered the heart of Iraq's germ-warfare complex.
Sheltered by high walls, air defenses and a military unit, the installation had been bombed during the war, and inspectors were eager for a close-up look at what remained.
They were shocked, inspectors recalled. Two weeks before the team's arrival, the Iraqis had leveled much of the site, removing production gear, demolishing two buildings and bulldozing the rubble. Piles of ashes and melted binders suggested that the Iraqis had kindled bonfires of documents.
Iraqi officials insisted that research at the site was peaceful, intended to develop vaccines and other protection against dread diseases.
But the investigators suspected the site had a military purpose, and eventually found a chamber for dispersing germs on test subjects that was big enough to hold "large primates, including the human primate," one inspector recalled.
The Iraqis said the chamber had been used merely for testing the effectiveness of vaccines on such animals as sheep, donkeys, monkeys and dogs. But they had hauled the chamber to a garbage dump some 20 miles from Salman Pak and then crushed it with a bulldozer, apparently trying to keep it out of sight.
Dr. Tucker, of the Monterey Institute, a former Unscom member, said the inspectors had detected "a pattern of circumstantial evidence" of germ-weapon production at Salman Pak but had found no smoking gun.
While at Salman Pak, the Iraqis told the inspectors of another plant at Al Hakam, a site an hour's drive southwest of Baghdad that sprawled across seven square miles of isolated desert.
Filling some of the buildings at Al Hakam were mazes of pipes, valves, pumps and stainless-steel tanks. The Iraqis said they were for making animal feed and bacterial pesticide. But the buildings were spaced unusually far apart and surrounded by barbed wire, dummy bunkers, air defenses and many guard posts.
Again, the evidence was equivocal. The inspectors suspected much but had no proof.
In May 1992, Baghdad finally gave the United Nations its first "full, final and complete disclosure" about its germ program, a report in which Baghdad denied having ever dabbled in biological arms and called for the inspections and sanctions to end.
Though the germ team kept running into dead ends, their colleagues seeking other types of weapons kept making breakthroughs. Inspectors seeking chemical arms found arsenals full of nerve agents like tabun and sarin, tiny amounts of which are lethal. And to their shock, nuclear teams found Iraq had made considerable progress in building an atomic bomb.
The germ sleuthing from 1991 to 1994 was hindered, in part, by the lack of a experienced professionals at headquarters in New York to direct the effort: Three years after the gulf war, the headquarters still had no full-time staff biologist.
But Congressional investigators were zooming ahead. By early 1994, they had learned that the American Type Culture Collection, a company in Rockville, Md., that sells microbes to scientists, had shipped up to 36 stains of 10 deadly pathogens to Iraq in the 1980's, doing so with Government approval. Some had come from Fort Detrick, Md., the Army's main center for defensive germ research.
"I was horrified," recalled James J. Tuite 3rd, a Congressional aide who tracked the shipments for Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "These were clearly agents that could be used for biological warfare." Arguably, they also had use in making vaccines, though experts with access to intelligence data about Baghdad's ambitions doubted that explanation.
 
The Sleuth
Trying to Unravel A Tangle of Clues
In April 1994, under increasing pressure from the United Nations to come up with something or drop the germ investigation, Unscom hired Dr. Richard Spertzel, who soon became the head of the biological team.
A portly man of military bearing, Dr. Spertzel, then 61, had served for nearly three decades in the Army before retiring in 1987 as a colonel. For 21 years he had worked in the world of military germs, both defensive and offensive, much of the time at Fort Detrick.
Dr. Spertzel brought valuable expertise. He belonged to a generation that knew about germ weapons from personal experience, from the days when the United States had made them and envisioned their use in war.
By all accounts, Dr. Spertzel re-energized the Iraq inquiry. He pored over documents -- "the evidence was almost shouting out," he recalled -- and took his worries to Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who then headed the United Nations effort to eliminate Iraq's weapons systems.
Mr. Ekeus ordered new inspection teams into the Iraqi hinterlands. But he also warned Dr. Spertzel that they had to find evidence of military germs soon, or give Iraq a clean bill of health.
By November 1994, Dr. Spertzel and three other experts in Iraq were interviewing and re-interviewing Iraqi scientists, picking apart their accounts and analyzing statements and records for discrepancies.
The team included Dr. David Kelly, a former Oxford University microbiologist; Dr. Barton, the Australian biologist, and Lieut. Col. Hamish Killip, of the British Royal Engineers. They came together in argumentative camaraderie, at times calling themselves the Gang of Four.
The team soon uncovered a secretive Iraqi group known as the Technical and Scientific Materials Import Division. Part of the Organization of Military Industrialization, it appeared to focus on germ warfare; for instance, it supplied Salman Pak. The inspectors immediately knew the discovery was significant.
"We were all very awake," recalled Dr. Barton, who recently left the United Nations commission.
With that high card, the team was able to conduct a very narrow, pointed search for records. To aid its hunt, the commission wrote in December 1994 to a handful of nations seeking help in uncovering documents about sales of biological materials to Iraq.
One reply came from Israel, said two American intelligence experts familiar with the episode, confirming a recent account of it in The Times of London. The Israelis provided key trade documents that helped illuminate a central if seemingly mundane foundation of the Iraqi germ program -- microbial food.
The nutrients that bacteriologists use to feed and breed germs are known as growth media. A specialized blend of sugars, proteins and minerals that keep microscopic life flourishing, growth media have many legitimate uses in hospitals and clinics, mainly as a way to identify illnesses. For instance, a swab from the back of a patient's throat is placed in a small dish of diagnostic media, and the presence of disease germs is indicated by the visible growth of bacterial colonies.
But Iraq was found to have been importing growth media by the ton, enough for growing teeming hordes of germs and filling many hundreds of biological weapons, if not thousands.
The intelligence experts said the Israelis had documented exports in the 1980's to Iraq from Oxoid, a British company. Israel, the experts said, provided copies of two letters of credit that referred to sales of about 10 tons of growth media to Iraq.
The papers were vital in building a case that Iraq had produced biological weapons. The inspectors, who under United Nations rules cannot talk about companies or countries other than Iraq, refused to discuss how the documents were obtained but emphasized their importance.
"That clinched it," said Dr. Kelly, the former Oxford don.
Dr. Spertzel, the chief biological inspector, called it "breakthrough information, frankly," adding, "It was conclusive enough to sit down with Iraq and be very challenging."
Dr. Barton used the bank documents to play his bluff in January 1995 -- and it worked. Almost immediately, Baghdad acknowledged the purchases and produced evidence that it had bought even more germ nutrients. All told, from Iraq and other sources, the team eventually found that Iraqis had imported about 40 tons of growth media, roughly 30 times more than needed for civilian use
And where was it now?
Iraqi officials had an answer. It had been sent to regional hospitals and laboratories that were making vaccines and detecting diseases.
Dr. Spertzel asked Gabriele Kraatz-Wadsack, 44, a German member of the team, to test that explanation. During March 1995, she and her colleagues tracked down the growth media at warehouses and pharmaceutical factories; much of it turned out to be stored at Al Hakam, the big plant in the desert.
"But I could still only account for 22 to 23 tons," she recalled. "That meant that more than 17 tons were missing."
Clearly, Baghdad had more explaining to do. Tensions rose. Eventually the Iraqis said much of the growth media sent to hospitals had been destroyed in riots after the 1991 war.
As the team kept up the pressure, the Iraqis panicked. The meetings between Unscom members and the Iraqi officials turned into shouting matches. "It was a free-for-all," Dr. Barton said.
The breakthrough came on July 1, 1995, at an evening session in Baghdad. Dr. Rihab Taha, an acknowledged leader of Iraq's civilian germ effort, made a huge admission. It came grudgingly, inspectors said, and with no direct eye contact. Dr. Taha kept looking down at her notes as she spoke.
Yes, she said, almost in tears at the strain of the moment, Iraq had produced a horde of germs for biological warfare.
An eerie quiet followed. Inspectors wanted to ask questions but refrained.
"There was not a lot of discussion," Dr. Barton recalled. "None of us thought we would hear a real confession."
The Iraqis acknowledged, among other things, that the factory at Al Hakam had produced thousands of gallons of deadly anthrax and botulinum toxin -- enough, in theory, to wipe out whole cities and even nations.
For the first time, the Iraqis had confessed to a military program for making germs. But no more than that. They still denied having ever developed weapons designed to release those germs over enemy targets.
 
The Defector
A Breakthrough In a Chicken Coop
The overlord of the Organization of Military Industrialization was Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamal, President Hussein's son-in-law and the second most powerful man in Iraq. He had risen from a lowly bodyguard to become director of Iraq's advanced-weapons procurement program and reportedly had a personality almost as swaggering and domineering as his father-in-law's, seeing himself as the natural successor.
Al Hakam had been his pet project, the inspectors learned, a personal triumph with which he planned to increase his prestige in the feuding family that ruled Iraq. But now, in early July 1995, his subordinates had been forced to reveal its dark purpose.
After Dr. Taha's dramatic admission, Iraq gave the United Nations team an ultimatum. According to team members, the Iraqis demanded that the United Nations bring all inspections to an end within a month. If not, the inspectors would have to go. The Iraqi Ambassador who delivered the message said he was speaking on behalf of General Kamal.
The inspectors replied that quick settlement was impossible given the new questions swirling around the germ work.
Iraqi threats mounted, and the inspectors prepared to leave Baghdad, some fearing for their safety.
"He was in an impossible situation," Dr. Barton said of General Kamal. "He had given us an absurd ultimatum."
Then, suddenly, everything changed.
Late on the evening of Aug. 7, 1995, General Kamal defected to Jordan. The move reportedly occurred after he had quarreled at a family dinner that was called to discuss Iraq's worsening economy and security, and that ended with shooting that left six bodyguards dead. After that he fled.
Inspectors said his flight was caused partly by their discovery of his biological weapons program, which damaged his standing with the ruling family.
Seeking to pre-empt any disclosures, Baghdad withdrew its ultimatum and, on Aug. 20, presented a trove of documents that it said "the traitor General Kamal," as they now called him, had hidden from the Iraqi Government.
To reinforce the accusations against the general, the handing over of the documents took place at a shed on General Kamal's chicken farm.
The documents ran to more that half a million pages, stored in boxes and steel trunks. There was a single, small, wooden box of documents about the biological-weapons program. Though far from complete, the papers showed that Iraq had done nearly everything in its power to prepare and use biological weapons.
In documents and additional admissions that year, Iraq said it had taken these actions:
*Set its germ policy in 1974, seeking to build a stockpile of biological arms.
*Did research on anthrax, botulinum toxin (which causes muscular paralysis resulting in death), aflatoxin (which causes liver cancer), tricothecene mycotoxins (which cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), wheat cover smut (which ruins food grains), hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (which causes extreme pain and temporary blindness) and rotavirus (which causes acute diarrhea that can lead to death).
*Field-tested germs in sprayers, 122-millimeter rockets, 155-millimeter artillery shells, tanks dropped from jet fighters and LD-250 aerial bombs.
*Began a crash program to speed germ development in August 1990, just as it invaded Kuwait.
*Built and loaded 25 germ warheads for Al Hussein missiles, which have a range of 400 miles. Botulinum toxin went into 16 of them, anthrax into 5 and aflatoxin into 4. It also filled bombs designated R-400, which hold 20 gallons each. Botulinum toxin went into 100, anthrax into 50 and aflatoxin into 7.
*Deployed these weapons in the opening days of the 1991 gulf war at four locations, ready for use, and kept them there throughout the war.
Iraq also said it had secretly destroyed all its biological agents and weapons in May or June 1991. This was a violation of the surrender agreement, and inspectors expressed serious doubts about the truth of that claim.
The date of the purported destruction was vague, Iraqi officials said, because no one could remember exactly when the order was given and no records were kept.
After the defection of General Kamal and the chicken-farm revelations, the United Nations inspectors and the Iraqis involved in germ warfare forged closer cooperation. Some inspectors feared that the honeymoon might not last, "so we decided to collect as much information as possible," Dr. Barton said. "We were vacuum cleaners."
In May 1996 the Iraqis, under United Nations supervision, began destroying Al Hakam, cutting up machinery with torches, burying items in cement and then dynamiting the rest of the plant. And the next month Iraq filed its fourth "full, final and complete disclosure," only to have the inspectors again dismiss it as sloppy lies.
United Nations officials eventually identified seven sites that had been directly used to produce biological weapons, including Salman Pak and Al Hakam.
In addition, the inspectors began monitoring universities, diagnostic laboratories and research centers, and installations that made vaccines, pharmaceuticals, beer and dairy products. All told, the United Nations was keeping its eye on about 100 biological sites, most with civilian equipment that could be turned to making germ weapons.
As for General Kamal, he eventually returned to Iraq, repentant over his defection. Days later, he was killed, and the circumstances of his death remain unclear.
 
The Mysteries
Germ-War Capacity Is Still an Enigma
Overlooking the East River in New York, on the 30th and 31st floors of the United Nations building, is the inspectors' headquarters. The windowless conference room, known as the Bunker, is constantly jammed these days. Cubicles are packed with file cabinets and safes and documents. Wooden crates from the chicken farm are visible atop cabinets, part of a mountain of evidence.
Over the years the United Nations commission, whose staff is drawn from more than 30 different countries, has become a lightening rod for Iraqi criticism. Its inspectors are routinely vilified by name in the Government-controlled press as spies. Some nations sympathetic to Iraq's plight, including Russia, have complained that the inspectors are overly aggressive and are taking too long. The inspectors, in response, have at times fired back, discussing their work with the news media.
United Nations officials say the inspectors still differ over how to interpret the evidence. Perhaps the most contentious issue is whether Iraq is now engaged in germ procurement and production.
The Russians recently acknowledged holding talks with Iraq in 1995 about selling a huge plant to be installed at Al Hakam, and inspectors say they have some evidence of other buying discussions and sales.
Sprayers are also an important part of the current mystery. Planes flying over farms use pipes and nozzles to spray fine mists of liquid pesticides. The Iraqis, an inspector said, have admitted adapting at least six sprayers to make a mist of germs that would rain down on enemies, and importing parts for a dozen such conversions in all.
But the agricultural sprayers, he said, have disappeared. None have been turned over to inspectors, and their whereabouts and status are unknown -- whether lost or destroyed or ready to fly into action.
Are they a threat? Even if they exist, hidden by the Iraqi military, their effective use is clouded by uncertainties, inspectors agree. A pilotless plane spraying 200 pounds of anthrax near a large city might kill a up to a million people -- if the winds were right, if no rain fell, if the nozzles did not get clogged, if the particles were the right size, if the population had no vaccinations, and so on.
Iraq tried to develop just such a weapon, using a sprayer of Iraqi design. Dr. Barton said an Iraqi general had told inspectors that Baghdad had tried just before the gulf war to develop the ability to wipe out most of Israel's population. MIG fighters were modified so they could be flown over Israel by remote control to release a spray of anthrax from specially modified fuel tanks.
"It would have caused massive casualties," he said, "if it was workable."
That kind of hedge appears in many of the analyses about Iraqi systems for dispensing germs, and it is a crucial unknown in assessing how far Iraq progressed toward making effective biological arms. The problem for the inspectors is that they have only limited information about how the dispensing systems would perform in war.
Inspectors also agree that unless they can go anywhere in Iraq without notice to hunt for documents, scientists and equipment, the United Nations can offer the world only a false sense of security.
There are doubts about whether the latest agreement, negotiated over the weekend by Secretary General Kofi Annan, provides sufficient access. Under the accord, the inspectors can visit the "presidential sites" that Iraq declared off-limits last fall. But they will be accompanied by diplomats appointed by the Security Council, and they must honor Iraq's "national security, sovereignty and dignity."
But while inspectors may disagree about what Iraq is doing now, there is no disagreement about Baghdad's potential to develop biological weapons.
"Most of us agree that if Unscom monitors left, the Iraqis could start up a biological weapons program the next day," Dr. Barton said.
Worry about Iraq's potential has been reinforced by what most inspectors agree is Baghdad's refusal in recent years to provide further documents about its biological program. Few inspectors seem to believe Iraq's assertions that most of the papers have been destroyed.
"Every little pencil they purchased has three requisition copies," said Dr. Kraatz-Wadsack, the German inspector. "We've found documents in other programs going back to the late 1950's. So I don't believe they destroyed their biological documents. They have them hidden somewhere."
Inspectors see the missing records as key to understanding the true dimensions of Iraq's effort to make germ weapons, saying they might provide a map to hidden plants, personnel and arms. The documents, inspectors say, are also useful to Iraq because they are thought to form a blueprint for resuming production of germ weapons.
Inspection teams may have been getting close to those records when Iraq began refusing the United Nations access to some sites last October. The inspectors also agree that as long as Iraq denies the inspectors access and information, they may never be able to certify that Baghdad is harboring no more germ weapons.
"I once asked: 'Is there an end game?' " Dr. Barton recalled. "We've been lied to so many times, can we ever trust the Iraqis to tell us the truth?"

Greenspan Criticizes Japan's Refusal to Bolster Economic Growth

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, today publicly joined the growing United States criticism of Japan's failure to invigorate domestic economic growth, deepening a rift between the world's two biggest economies.
Signaling Washington's frustration with Tokyo's apparent refusal to stimulate demand at home by cutting taxes or raising spending, the Fed chairman warned that Japan's economy was shrinking and said the Japanese Government was not doing much about it. 
 Asked during his semiannual report to Congress on the economy if Tokyo was doing enough, Mr. Greenspan replied, "I think not."
Japanese officials earlier today denied any need for fiscal stimulants to increase demand, squarely disagreeing with the American view and that expressed by finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations last weekend.
Vice Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara said in Tokyo that Japan had told other Group of Seven nations there was no need for new spending, even though the group's communique had called for such measures. "We do not agree with that," he told Parliament.
Financial markets reacted to the growing discord by pushing up the dollar against the yen in a sign of disillusionment over the state of the Japanese economy.
"At the moment the Japanese economy seems to be shrinking," Mr. Greenspan told lawmakers, devoting an unusually large part of his question-and-answer session following the formal part of the day's testimony to international economic developments.
Earlier, Mr. Greenspan reiterated the economic appraisal he presented to the House on Tuesday, asserting that the United States is enjoying an ideal combination of strong growth, low unemployment and price stability but that it is dangerous to become complacent about inflation.

HEADLINE: Help for the Needy

 BODY:
For 86 years readers of The Times have reached into their pockets to help the poor, the elderly and new immigrants by contributing to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. This winter's fund drive, which ends on Saturday, has raised more than $5.4 million, the largest amount ever collected by the annual appeal. Many readers were moved to give because they know that even in a strong economy the most vulnerable groups suffer from hunger, homelessness and abuse.
Although the stock market is booming and governments enjoy surpluses, the unemployment rate in New York City hovers near 9 percent and more than two million residents live below the poverty level. For these New Yorkers an illness can mean sudden joblessness and eviction. For abandoned children, finding a loving foster home is as difficult as ever. For the disabled and the elderly, a good economy does not remedy social isolation. 
 The Neediest Cases Fund helps by distributing every cent to seven prominent New York City charities that serve these groups. None of the money goes for administrative costs. Donations are used for direct services, like buying provisions for immigrants who have been cut off from food stamps, paying rent for destitute senior citizens and providing counseling for abused children.
A few donors have given more than $10,000, but most gifts are between $25 and $50, many from people who have given for decades. Some of these remember a time of hardship in their own lives and want to help others survive a crisis. Many new donors, particularly children, are starting their own tradition of aiding the needy. There is still time to join the 12,000 readers who have responded to this year's drive.
All donations received before Saturday will be tallied as part of this year's appeal. Gifts received after that will be counted in next year's drive. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: Clinton Talk to Oppose Internet Tax

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25

 BODY:
President Clinton will speak against taxing Internet commerce when he addresses a technology investors' conference here on Thursday, an Administration official said today.
The President's position, in support of a bill recently introduced in Congress that would bar state and local governments from enacting taxes on the Internet until 2004, places the Administration directly in opposition to state Governors. 
 On Tuesday, the National Governors' Association called on Congress to enact legislation creating a uniform system to collect state taxes on sales conducted over the Internet. Meeting in Washington, the governors said that as Internet purchases increased, states would lose a valuable source of revenue unless they could collect sales taxes on transactions conducted over the Internet.
But Mr. Clinton believes that the Internet is spurring the growth of new industries and that new taxes imposed by thousands of local jurisdictions would undermine that economic impact, said an Administration official, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified.
The President will support a moratorium on taxing Internet commerce, the official said, during which time he hopes for a long-term discussion about how to allow the Internet to keep growing without hampering the ability of state and local governments to pay for programs in areas like education and law enforcement.
The President's decision to appear before the investors' conference, sponsored by BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, was a surprise, and White House officials said he hoped to use the forum to make his case for the concept of a new economy based on high-technology industries.
He will also announce expansion of a network of universities connected to a Next Generation Internet, adding 29 schools for a total of 90. The project is developing a much higher-speed version of the Internet.

HEADLINE: TESTING OF A PRESIDENT: THE PUBLIC;
Clinton Finds Support in a Town's Prosperity

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: WESTFIELD, N.J., Feb. 25

 BODY:
With his 6-year-old brow creased in concentration, Jimmy Reardon raised his feet and began to pedal. His bicycle teetered in uncertainty before striking that magical moment of balance, and he glided across the high school parking lot here with the cheers of his proud father, James Reardon, ringing in his ears.
Mr. Reardon, a computer consultant enjoying a sunny day in sweat pants and a Seton Hall University baseball cap, has few complaints these days. 
 The value of his house in this affluent town is rising, the school system in which his son is enrolled is among the best in the state, and his job is going well. He wants nothing to disturb his family's peace -- including any fallout from the possible indiscretions of his President.
"I'm not the biggest Bill Clinton fan in the world," said Mr. Reardon, a Democrat who voted for Mr. Clinton in the 1992 and 1996 elections. "But the results are great. People are working. The economy is good. There are jobs. I don't think people really care about what is going on in his personal life."
Mr. Reardon, 39, said he did not want his support for the President's job performance to be construed as an endorsement of Mr. Clinton's personal behavior.
"I don't really respect him personally," Mr. Reardon said. "He's got flaws. But over all he's a good leader, and he's got the country as a whole in a good position."
The musings of a father on a lazy Sunday afternoon are similar to the views of his neighbors here in Westfield, a suburb of older, gracious homes about 25 miles west of Manhattan. They also mirror the results of a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, which found that President Clinton is enjoying record approval ratings, even as he is dogged by accusations that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
Those poll results indicate a seeming paradox: Many of the same people who believe those accusations nevertheless approve of the Clinton Presidency. But the trade-offs and nuances behind those attitudes became clear in more than three dozen recent interviews here -- at a church pancake breakfast, in a diner, in a beauty salon.
Most residents and merchants said they drew distinctions between Mr. Clinton's public duties and his private matters. They said his private life, no matter how unsettling, should not be of public concern -- in part because they personally knew people whose troubled private lives had not interfered with their ability to do their jobs. Ultimately, they said, President Clinton is doing a good job, a conclusion they based in part on the healthy economy.
How, they asked, could the nation risk change at a time of peace and prosperity?
Most people said they did not believe that the President was telling the entire truth about Ms. Lewinsky, nor would it bother them if he was lying about the relationship. But several people said they would be deeply troubled if they learned that Mr. Clinton or his aides had tried to obstruct justice by encouraging the intern to lie in the Paula Corbin Jones civil lawsuit. Even so, most said they would not want to see Mr. Clinton impeached or forced to resign over a case rooted in accusations of sexual misconduct.
Lawrence A. Goldman, a lawyer and a Democratic town councilman, paused before saying that he believed the Lewinsky matter did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
"How many people can look themselves in the mirror and say to themselves that if they were involved in an extramarital affair, they would be willing to step up and be forthcoming," Mr. Goldman said. "Not only to their spouse but to the rest of the world."
But that all-forgiving support is not universal.
"I don't care if he's sleeping with her," said Gene Jannotti, 51, a computer consultant who votes Republican, as he sat drinking coffee in a window seat at Bruegger's Bagels shop on Saturday morning. "If he truly lied, if he got her to change her testimony, then he does not deserve to be President."
Yet the consensus among most of those interviewed was to have the country move beyond the Lewinsky matter, mostly out of concern that further investigation could bring about changes in the White House and uncertainty about the future -- from the economy to an Al Gore Presidency.
 
A Case Transcends Political Allegiances
"At this point, there are so many other things to worry about," said Mr. Reardon's wife, Theresa, 34, as she watched their 3-year-old daughter, Tara, ride by on a bicycle with training wheels. "This is not the time to be really harping on this. Just let it go."
Images of children at play are common in Westfield, a predominantly white town of 29,000 in Union County with the sense of place that comes from wealth and community pride. People here celebrate the town's high school swimming teams, its distinction as the hometown of the illustrator Charles Addams, its restoration of the 130-year-old town bell. They tend not to dwell on the troubles, like the recent arrests of four people on prostitution charges, or the granddaddy of all local scandals: the case of John Emil List, who in 1971 killed five family members and then disappeared -- only to be captured 18 years later in a Virginia suburb, where he was living with a new wife and a new identity.
Westfield's political history is rooted in Republicanism. Although more than half of the voters describe themselves as independent, the town traditionally votes straight Republican. In the 1992 Presidential election, George Bush defeated Mr. Clinton in Westfield. But in 1996, Mr. Clinton became the first Democratic Presidential candidate in memory to carry the town -- although by fewer than 200 votes. That same year, the town also elected its first Democratic mayor in more than 80 years.
The Lewinsky case seems to transcend the political allegiances of Westfield, with many people here responding to it in acutely personal ways. One woman became choked up when she recalled a relative whom she greatly admired, but who had become involved in an extramarital affair; how, then, she asked, could she judge Mr. Clinton. And a local merchant became so angry in listing what he considered to be the President's many moral failings that he had to take several moments to calm himself.
Many people in town clearly have spent a lot of time considering the moral and political implications of a tawdry case that has an Administration on the defensive. And to hear their opinions, one need only trace Sunday's sweet aromas to the school auditorium of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, where dozens of parishioners had gathered for a fund-raising pancake breakfast after the morning's Masses.
 
A Generation Change On Morality Issues?
During a lull between the 9 o'clock children's Mass and the 10:30 Mass, the Knights of Columbus member who organized the breakfast, Frank Muggeo, struggled with what he felt was the elemental question: Did the President have an extramarital affair? All other matters -- whether the President is lying now, whether he encouraged the intern to lie -- pale in comparison for Mr. Muggeo, a Republican.
"I don't understand that,"he said, shaking his head in bafflement. "Are we just accepting this as standard? That bothers me. It shows a poor, weak, moral code of ethics."
Mr. Muggeo, an engineer, did not want to give his age and was only slightly more forthcoming on what he thought should happen next in the Lewinsky case.
"One day I think one thing, the next day I think something else," he said slowly. "If he did commit these acts, he really should step down. He should be a role model."
But a few tables away, Jennifer Murphy, 39 years old and bouncing the youngest of three daughters on her knee, scoffed at the idea that Americans should look to their President for moral as well as political leadership. Unseemly accusations against a President might have been taken more seriously by a previous generation, Ms. Murphy said, but not anymore.
"We are just not as judgmental about what goes on behind closed doors," said Ms. Murphy, a Democrat. "We have become more tolerant about people's private lives. People have been desensitized by the sexual exploits of politicians and celebrities because it has been so in our face -- everyone from J.F.K. to Frank Gifford."
Sitting around a fold-out table with other parents her age -- some of whom, like her, had moved from New York City and Hoboken in search of better public schools -- Ms. Murphy began to nurse Madeline, her 6-month-old daughter. But she had more to say: that she thinks the President is telling the truth "like a lawyer," but that "I don't think it's anybody's business" whether he had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
But for all the latitude Ms. Murphy and her friends gave the President, they acknowledged that the public's generosity of spirit rose and fell with the economy.
"I think people have a higher tolerance of immoral behavior when the economy is doing fine," she said as she cradled her daughter in her arms.
A Republican across the table agreed.
"If inflation went up to 10 percent," said Steven Dreyer, 39, "there would be a lot more concern about this situation."
Throughout the town, "this situation" brought sly smiles to faces, followed by expressions of concern about an issue cast in gray. The prospect of change worries young and old, Republicans and Democrats, and appears to be the primary reason why many people say they wish that the Lewinsky matter would disappear. They worry that the undermining of the Clinton Presidency -- by the news media, by the independent counsel, or by the President's own actions -- could jeopardize this moment of relative prosperity.
 
In a Good Economy, A Generosity of Spirit
"Let's assume he is impeached," said Martin Kaplan, 74, a Democrat who owns a downtown store that sells antique and decorative arts. "When things are not steady, the stock market will go down. The economy is gone for about two years. It takes that amount of time for it to get back. Meanwhile, everyone is suffering. And who are they going to get instead?"
Mr. Kaplan added: "He is doing an excellent job. He is a great politician, along with his wife. She knows him like a book. She has been through this before. Regardless of what he did -- I will assume that he did whatever he did -- I don't care. Is there any man who tells the truth about sex? It is so stupid it is not even funny."
Some of that fear of change comes from not knowing what to make of Vice President Al Gore, who would assume the Presidency if Mr. Clinton were forced to step down. Selma Wasserman, 64, a Democrat, struggled with this possibility after completing a Monday morning exercise class at the downtown Y.M.C.A. building.
"I like Gore very much, but I can't see him as the President," Ms. Wasserman said. "I really don't have confidence in him taking over. That is another problem I have with this. I feel badly about saying that. I don't know why. He doesn't have the charisma. He doesn't have the get-up-and-go."
The uncertainty regarding Mr. Gore, in fact, was strong enough to force grudging acceptance of Mr. Clinton and his supposed peccadilloes among some of the President's harshest critics, like Paul Busch, 56, a disgruntled-Democrat-turned-disgruntled-Republican-turned-independent.
"I think he's degraded the Presidency more than any of his predecessors, right back to Washington," said Mr. Busch, who works in government affairs for AT&T. "I don't want to see him impeached only because I have less regard for Al Gore than I have for Clinton."
At the same time, many people did not hesitate to volunteer opinions about Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel leading the investigation into the Clinton Presidency. They do not like him -- from Mikki Oraison, 50, a special education teacher sipping coffee at Starbucks ("Is Ken Starr out to win against the President? Is it an ego thing? Possibly.") to Jack B. Dunn, ruminating after breakfast at Vicki's Diner ("He may be acting like this for publicity and probably also for money later on.").
"I think he's starting to get on everyone's nerves," said Stacey Lawrie, 33, as she left a toddler's dance class at the Y.M.C.A. with her daughter, Caitlin, 3. "He didn't bother me until I read the first articles in Newsweek, from cover to cover. He is calling in everyone's friends, relatives. With all the supposed leaks, accusations. Move it along."
 
Tough Assessments Of Kenneth Starr
 But Joanne Muldoon, a Republican draped in a plastic cape while stylist Simon Higgins tended to her brown hair at the Visage salon, said that her Westfield neighbors were missing the point. "What Ken Starr is looking for, I think, is very serious," said Ms. Muldoon, 39, a former teacher who stays at home with her three children. "The least of it is a sex scandal. The higher issue is obstruction of justice."
The more Ms. Muldoon talked, the more pointed her argument became, her words laced with sarcasm.
"They like to paint themselves as victims. They felt no qualms about trashing Monica Lewinsky. 'She is so wonderful. We are going to get her a job.' Now she is a liar."
In the end, Ms. Muldoon said that while she would like "to see him just hang on in misery and have a lame-duck Administration," she thought that he had committed impeachable offenses. "Justice should be served," she said.
Mr. Higgins, 25, who had listened silently while brushing color into her hair, spoke up. "I think what happened, happened," he said. "But I just don't think that people should think he is doing bad as President because of it. That is his private life, and it should be dealt with privately. Everybody's private life should be dealt with in a separate way."
While many in Westfield tended to agree with the hairstylist, some still expressed a sense of something lost. "It has nothing to do with his Presidency," said Natalie Lark, 70, a retired nurse. "But I think that people have gotten away from church, from God. Their morals are down. I blame television. I blame movies."
Hy Abramowitz, who said he was in his 80's, framed the matter not in a religious context but in a humorous one. "I'm a Republican," he said, smiling. "But I say this much. You had Roosevelt. You had Kennedy. They all had lovers. They're men. You know, men are like dogs."
His wife, Sarah, who had just finished an exercise class at the Y.M.C.A., started to laugh. "They all had," she said. "So what? Everybody. They all had."
Mr. Abramowitz, moving his arm toward his wife, added: "We have only been married 63 years . As far as his love life, it has nothing to do with his political life. Forget about it. Ken Starr? It's a lot of malarkey. It will pass over. If he wants to have a love life, let him have it."
But when asked what he thought the Lewinsky matter said about the nation's moral standards, the easy smile disappeared from his lined face.
"I feel sorry for the younger generation," he said."My grandson, my children. "

HEADLINE: Storms Expected to Raise Price of Produce

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: PLANT CITY, Fla., Feb. 25

 BODY:
The rainstorms that pummeled Florida and California this winter are starting to have an economic impact beyond the human misery and dislocations caused by deadly flooding, mudslides and tornadoes.
The cost of a few damaged crops like strawberries here in Central Florida has shot up in recent weeks. But the real shock to consumers may not be felt for another month when experts warn of possible drops in the production and quality of vegetables like lettuce, broccoli and cauliflower. 
 Planting delays forced by muddy fields and steady rain in the Salinas Valley, the California region that produces about three-fourths of the iceberg lettuce on grocers' shelves in April, are creating the prospect of a spring "lettuce gap," said state, Federal and industry officials.
Artichokes, tomatoes, cabbage and other perishable winter crops are also under stress but may reach full production if extended dry periods give farmers time to pick and ship them to market.
"Consumers are going to face higher prices for specific vegetables this spring because of interruptions in planting and the possibility of harvesting problems," said Keith Collins, chief economist for the United States Department of Agriculture.
The outlook for summer farm production, when the bulk of American agriculture is planted and harvested, remains good, Mr. Collins said, but not without nagging concerns.
"A potentially bigger problem could occur if the El Nino system ends," he said, "and extended hot and dry weather takes its place over most of the farm belt this summer."
A severe drought followed the last severe El Nino onslaught in 1983, creating farm shortages and very high prices, Mr. Collins noted. But he said experts disagreed on when El Nino would retreat and what weather pattern would replace it.
A drought could have effects more widespread than usual, he said, because surpluses of major grains like corn are at the lowest levels in recent history. A setback in the corn harvest, Mr. Collins warned, could place pressures on feed for the livestock industry.
Meanwhile, consumers in much of the country are benefiting from lower heating costs as the same El Nino weather pattern that battered California and Florida has helped spread abnormally warm weather over much of the country.
"Heating demand is 10 percent below normal," said Jon Davis, a meteorologist with Smith Barney. "That's phenomenal. Even a 3 or 4 percent deviation from normal is generally considered a significant event in the markets."
Natural gas prices have also dropped by nearly half since the fall, when unusually warm temperatures in the West and Southeast created a huge demand on electricity.
"El Nino definitely has been the main contributor," said Michael Barbis, who tracks the natural gas industry for UBS Global Research.
Home heating oil, after a general drop in crude oil costs, sells today for about $1 a gallon compared with $1.17 a year ago, industry officials said.
What's more, a decline in weather-related travel delays has saved countless hours of labor and costs because airplanes, trucks and cars have operated without the usual seasonal impediments of snow and ice in many states.
Winter clothing and snowblower sales have slowed, but in many places retail stores are getting an early start on selling sportswear. Golf courses and other outdoor services are unseasonably robust.
Florida tourist destinations continue to insist that all the rain this winter and Monday's tornadoes -- which killed 39 people in Central Florida and destroyed millions of dollars' worth of property -- has not hurt tourism. Maureen Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the Peabody Hotel in Orlando, said that there had not been a single cancellation of a reservation and that all 891 rooms were filled with people attending a convention of the American Dermatological Association.
But it seems too early to measure the impact on potential travelers to Florida who have seen or read news of the weather here and decided to stay home or go elsewhere, or those who curtailed their visit in the state.
Florida and California both have tourist attractions that draw many of their own residents. In California, tourism has been a mixed picture this season, with the number of hotel cancellations reported to be higher than usual in San Francisco and other coastal destinations but with total demand continuing the strength of recent years.
But for fruit farmers like Carl Grooms of Plant City, nature's devastation is clear in this strawberry-rich region east of Tampa.
"This is a normal strawberry," Mr. Grooms said, holding up a scarlet, heart-shaped berry redolent with a fresh, sweet smell.
"And this," he said, picking up a smaller, gnarled berry between a thumb and forefinger, "is garbage."
With a snap of his fingers, the smaller berry squished into a piece of watery pulp that he threw to the ground with disgust.
"About 20 percent of the fruit we pick can't go to market, and some of what does is being rejected because some of the berries are rotten by the time they receive it," said Mr. Grooms, a third-generation farmer.
And although there was much sunshine today in Plant City and in Oxnard, Calif., the other center of winter strawberry cultivation in the United States, the land was still wet in both places as anxiety ran deep about the weather.
"I've never seen anything like this in my life," Mr. Grooms said.
His 72 acres contain 1.5 million plants, and last year he shipped to market 220,000 bright yellow cartons, each containing 12 pints of strawberries under the Fancy Farms label.
"We've picked since Thanksgiving," he said, "and so far we've shipped 100,000 flats and maybe we can pick another 50,000 in the weeks ahead."
Even worse growing conditions in Oxnard drove up his wholesale price to about $10 a carton, Mr. Grooms said, more than twice the $4 he received last year. But he was concerned that a poor crop would be costly to his bottom line, saying, "The shopper in the supermarket may turn her nose up at berries that may be smaller than usual and deformed."
Paul D'Arrigo, chairman of D'Arrigo Brothers, a large wholesale produce buyer in the Bronx, agreed that shoppers might not like some of the fruits and vegetables showing up in markets this spring.
"The quality of some items is already down," Mr. D'Arrigo said. "But January and February is a lousy produce season without much demand. In a month or so I expect prices are going to go up when a real void develops in the lettuce market because of California's problems and before Texas and Eastern harvests are available in late spring."
Mr. D'Arrigo and others said shortages would create higher prices if the quality of produce was marred by poor growing conditions. There is already evidence that at least part of the crops from California and Florida will be smaller than in normal growing years and bear external evidence of damage by the elements.
In Florida, shipments of fresh citrus fruit have slowed because wet groves have hindered picking in what is a record growing year, industry officials said. Juice quality has been affected by soggy groves that cut the acid content of oranges, making them taste more watery, said Bobby McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual, which represents an industry that accounted for $3.4 billion in sales last year.
Of more concern is the potential threat to groves south and southwest of Orlando, where the ground is not as sandy as in the rest of the state's citrus belt, meaning that drainage is more of a problem.
"A lot of trees in these groves have been flooded for an extended period, and there is some evidence of root damage," Mr. McKown said.
A tree with a damaged root system may yield its present crop but become barren in the future, he said. Mr. McKown emphasized that there was not yet any determination that significant numbers of trees in the affected groves -- which may represent about half of all orange trees in the state -- had suffered root damage. But the discovery was unsettling and would worsen if the groves were hit by more rainfall in the normally dry months ahead.

HEADLINE: THE DEAL ON IRAQ: THE C.I.A.;
C.I.A. Drafts Covert Plan to Topple Hussein

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency has been drafting plans for a major program of sabotage and subversion against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Government officials say.
Four prior covert operations, involving everything from radio propaganda to paramilitary plots, have failed to dislodge the Iraqi leader, just as smart bombs, cruise missiles and stiff economic sanctions have failed. 
 The C.I.A.'s new plan, months in the making, must still be approved by President Clinton. That approval is by no means certain, and some of his key advisers are skeptical of the plan.
The debate over the need for new covert action has intensified in the last few weeks, with senior members of Congress openly calling for the C.I.A. to destabilize President Hussein. But some of the President's advisers consider the new plan no more likely to succeed than the agency's earlier efforts, and they are likely to argue against approving it, the officials said.
The plan, still in the draft stage, has not yet been put into final form for a decision by the President. The fact that officials are disclosing it shows the depth of their doubts.
The Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, has told Mr. Clinton that the plan is risky, the officials said, and the President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, is skeptical of the C.I.A.'s ability to undermine Mr. Hussein.
The plan calls for enlisting Kurdish and Shiite agents to destroy or damage key Iraqi pillars of economic and political power, like utility plants or Government broadcast stations, the officials said. At the same time, the plan calls for increasing political pressure on Iraq through propaganda programs like a "Radio Free Iraq" broadcast to Baghdad.
The plan aims to try to undermine President Hussein by showing Iraqi citizens that he is not invincible, strengthening his opponents inside Iraq and trying to ignite a rebellion within his inner circle.
"This is not a propaganda operation," one senior Government official said of the C.I.A.'s plan. "This is a major campaign of sabotage."
For the plan to go forward, the President must sign a written order, known as a "finding." If it is approved as now conceived, it could become one of the biggest covert actions since the end of the cold war, costing tens of millions of dollars a year, officials said.
Since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, the agency has backed Kurdish dissidents in the north of Iraq, Shiite Muslim groups in the south, Iraqi exiles in London and Iraqi military defectors based in Jordan. These operations, which have cost about $100 million, have had little or no success.
Most recently, in August 1996, President Hussein sent tanks into northern Iraq to destroy a C.I.A. base staffed by American intelligence officers and Kurdish agents, arresting and executing scores of Kurds.
But now influential senators -- notably John McCain, an Arizona Republican; John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee -- are calling on the agency once more.
"It may well be that a covert action or covert actions might succeed in deposing Saddam Hussein," Senator Specter said Monday on the Senate floor. He said a covert action -- along with the establishment of an Iraqi government-in-exile, expansion of "no flight" zones to cover all of Iraq and a naval blockade -- could help "bring Saddam Hussein to his knees."
But the Iraqi opposition is fragmented, "plagued by divisions," in the words of Wafiq Samoraei, a former head of Iraqi military intelligence based in London.
"It is lacking in sufficient support in Baghdad-controlled Iraq to be a significant factor in internal politics in Iraq," said Kenneth Katzman, a Iraq expert at the Congressional Research Service and a former C.I.A. analyst of Persian Gulf politics.
The diplomatic, political and economic structures that can conceal C.I.A. officers and agents -- a United States embassy, a network of political contacts, a bevy of businessmen going in and out of the country -- do not exist in Iraq. That makes it exceedingly hard for agents to penetrate the inner circle surrounding President Hussein, who controls tens of thousands of soldiers and spies whose sole duty is to preserve his power.
The two major opposition groups in exile, the Iraqi National Congress, based in London, and the Iraqi National Accord, based in Amman, Jordan, have been riven by dissent. The Kurds, the world's largest stateless ethnic group, have bases in northern Iraq but also are bitterly divided. Shiite groups in the south of Iraq, some with ties to Saudi Arabia, some with ties to Iran, have proven politically impotent in the past.
Covert operations aimed at subverting Mr. Hussein's Government date back to the Bush Administration. Immediately after the gulf war, President Bush ordered the C.I.A. to support a coup against the Iraqi leader. The Kurds and Shiites were openly encouraged to rise up against him. The opposition was crushed.
Then the agency supported the Iraqi National Congress from 1992 to 1996. The group achieved little. In 1995, after some key Iraqi military officers defected, the agency shifted its support to the Iraqi National Accord. But in the summer of 1996, President Hussein's military and intelligence services crushed the small clique of Iraqi military officers working with the group and destroyed a C.I.A. base in northern Iraq.

Lawmakers Approve Africa Trade Plan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Legislation aimed at promoting growth in sub-Saharan Africa by offering trade and investment incentives was approved today by the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 The measure is being pushed by a bipartisan group and has the backing of President Clinton, who is scheduled to make his first visit to Africa as President next month.
The measure, expected to be taken up by the full House within the next two weeks, offers the prospect that goods from the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa will have greater access to the United States market. It would offer duty-free coverage to a variety of products as a first step.

HEADLINE: Power Deregulated. Consumers Yawn.;
California's Effort to Promote Plan For Electricity Is Off to a Slow Start

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
They've tried everything.
For the public, California officials have run a commercial that shows a motorcycle cop oblivious to the cars rocketing by him because he is so engrossed in thoughts of electricity deregulation. 
 For the state's 2.3 million Hispanic households, they've created a Spanish-speaking dancing dog named Chispita who stares into the television camera, spins around and declares, "I am as fast as a spark of electricity."
To get the attention of blacks, who their research indicates "spend little time thinking about electricity," they've developed an animated character called Electron Man as an "entertaining vehicle to deliver the educational message."
They've even recruited a Los Angeles radio talk show host, Michael Jackson, to promote a toll-free number that fields questions about the coming changes in 11 languages, including Tagalog, Hmong and Laotian. And before beginning their current $73 million media blitz, they held three years of hearings, then slashed electricity bills by 10 percent to let energy users know something big was in the works.
But try as they might, California officials just haven't been able to get consumers excited about the deregulation of the electricity industry. On March 31, after a three-month delay due to computer glitches, California will become the first state in the nation to throw the market open to something close to full competition -- and for the last five months, a host of marketers have inundated homes and businesses with pitches for cheaper and more efficient power delivery.
Yet, so far, a minuscule 25,000 customers out of 9.9 million have switched providers. Most Californians remain confused about the purposes of the program and doubtful about the payoff, if any, for them. As a result, they are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
"Consumers are being bombarded with all kinds of offers," said Jeff Dennard, a senior vice president for Makovsky & Company, a consulting group that is working with utilities. "Many are scared to switch."
Their reluctance is bad news for the people who are promoting deregulation as a way to lower energy prices and introduce competition to one of the last bastions of monopoly in the nation. It is also a setback for the nearly 300 marketers who have jumped into the fray in the hopes of getting a slice of a $20 billion pie (though so far only 30 have been given approval to do business). And because California has long been viewed as a national trend-setter in everything from popular culture to demographic trends, the public's nervousness poses a challenge to the 20 other states that are in the early stages of deregulating their own utility industries.
In New York, Consolidated Edison plans to start a pilot program on June 1 to allow 63,000 of its 3 million customers to choose alternate suppliers, and already, consumers are getting pitches from marketers and newspaper ads about the project. But similar experiments in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont encountered public responses every bit as tepid as California's.
"What we're going to see over the next four years is utter and complete confusion," said Erika B. Seamon, who has been working as a consultant to utilities with Kucvmarski & Associates, a management consulting firm in Chicago. What is happening in California is having an effect nationwide, she added.
Part of the problem is that most consumers have little incentive to study the brochures that arrive in the mail or to listen to the telemarketing pitches that seem to intrude just as they are sitting down to dinner. The savings on monthly bills that average $50 to $75, after all, amount at most to a few dollars.
Eventually, after a four-year transition period in which the costs of paying off old power plants that are no longer cost competitive are spread among all customers, the savings could become much more substantial. Industry executives predict an additional 10 to 15 percent cut in the bills of residential and small commercial customers. Larger industrial and commercial customers are expected to see rates drop 20 to 30 percent.
Most people, though, remain skeptical that they will enjoy even that meager reward. And most are unfamiliar with the utility industry and how deregulation will work. Under the California plan, anyone who pays a $100 fee and fills out a form can buy electricity from generating companies or a state power exchange, sell it to consumers and pay utility concerns a fee to deliver it, maintain lines and collect bills.
Moreover, said Mr. Dennard of Makovsky & Company, "There is also the residual knowledge that things did not go as advertised in telephone deregulation. Many are still wondering whether they are doing better after telephone deregulation." Even though telephone and airline deregulation did indeed foster innovation and lead to lower prices for most consumers, many people still find it difficult to grasp why the same should hold true for electricity. In a national survey in December by Makovsky & Company, 62 percent of those questioned predicted that utility deregulation in their states would lead to higher prices.
It does not help that many marketers indulge in hard-sell techniques or even outright fraud. Some tout freebies that are hard to evaluate, according to analysts. Some promise low rates without making it clear they will load on various charges and fees to make up the difference. And some contend that the electricity they deliver will come only from solar power, dams or other environmentally benign sources.
In recent weeks, California regulators have suspended the licenses of dozens of marketers until they provide more information on how they will deliver the power they are selling. In one case, the Public Utilities Commission banned a company founded by a 19-year-old entrepreneur, saying it had signed up 8,000 customers for $300 each, even though it had no supply agreements with utilities.
More commonly, marketers use perfectly legal ploys that some consumers nonetheless find misleading. When the Enron Corporation, a Houston-based energy giant with ambitions to become a national natural gas and electricity marketer, sent a mailing to Phil Branon offering a 10 percent rate cut and two weeks of free electricity if he switched from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the state's largest utility, he jumped at the chance.
But then Mr. Branon, who puts out a trade newsletter called Infoworld in San Francisco, did a little digging and discovered that neither offer had much value. The 10 percent savings was an automatic bonus -- mandated by the State Legislature and paid for by a special bond issue -- for every energy user in the state.
And after reading the fine print of his contract, he realized that he would get the free electricity, worth about $25, only if he stayed with Enron for a year.
"I felt like someone had pulled the wool over my eyes," he said. "I'm going to switch back." Gary Foster, a spokesman for Enron's marketing arm, said the offer was straightforward and contained no misleading information.
If the wariness of consumers like Mr. Branon is putting a crimp in California's deregulation plan, unexpected resistance from another quarter -- industrial and commercial customers -- is an even greater disappointment.
Most marketers had aimed at these big energy users as the quickest path to profits because signing up just a few would have given them the same economy of scale as recruiting thousands of homeowners and small businesses. But instead of grabbing the first money-saving deal, many such customers are using the prospect of deregulation to do in-depth studies of their energy needs.
"We see deregulation as destabilizing and potentially confusing," said Mick Spilsbury, an executive vice president of the Union Bank of California, the third-largest bank in the state, which spends $10 million a year on natural gas and electricity. "We have to get better educated before we get tied into a four-year deal that looks good today but four years from now everybody will be telling me we signed a bad deal."
Because of the expense and effort to come up with a serious proposal, he said, only two companies -- Enron and the marketing affiliate of San Diego Gas and Electric called Edison Source -- have made a serious effort. "They have not come beating our doors down," he said.
Mr. Spilsbury's caution is echoed at other companies. Glen Lewis, a regional procurement manager for Del Monte Foods, one of California's largest employers, said there were still too many unknowns about how deregulation would actually work. "It's such a dynamic thing right now," he said. "We're going to go slow and look at things gradually."
Some marketers have gotten the message and are wooing big corporate customers through painstaking analysis of their energy-consumption practices, rather than just by promising lower rates. To win a multi-year, $180 million account to supply electricity to 800 McDonald's restaurants in California, for example, the staff of P.G.& E. Services, the marketing arm of Pacific Gas and Electric, spent months looking into every corner of the company's operations.
"They want more than just prices," said Faye Worthy, the director of national commercial accounts for P.G.& E. Services, who spent endless hours alongside McDonald's executives and franchisees. "They're looking for someone who really understands their business."
Robert D. Glynn Jr., the utility's chairman and chief executive, said "You have to have the staying power and the fortitude to survive the early years."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 27, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the deregulation of the electricity industry in California misidentified the utility marketing company that sought Union Bank of California as a customer. It was Energy Pacific, a joint venture of the Enova Corporation and Pacific Enterprises; it was not Edison Source.

California will deregulate its electricity industry next month and dozens, perhaps hundreds, of companies hope to sell electricity to consumers and businesses. Much of the state's power will continue to come from the its three biggest utilities, from plants previously owned by them or from out-of-state sources. Here is where each utility gets its power and how much it cost. (Prices are for each kilowatt hour and include building and running the plants.)

For Heaven's Sake, Don't Fly a U.F.O.

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
Ho Hsien-jung cradled a bloated aluminum saucer on his lap and looked worried.
"We are scientists," he fumed, carefully placing the shining saucer alongside others on a shelf in his narrow living room. "Our research into U.F.O.'s is scientific. All these other people are cheats. They're cheating people." 
 As chairman of the Chinese Flying Saucer Research Association, Mr. Ho has good reason to be concerned: a growing number of people in Taiwan are reporting sightings of flying saucers and he has never seen one. Moreover, these sightings have been used by a growing number of religious prophets who promise everything from a fast-approaching apocalypse to instant wealth, alarming authorities at a spreading pattern of religious and financial fraud.
Many people here say they have been fleeced of their life savings by these cult leaders, who are preying on a society that has gone through tumultuous political and economic transformations in the last decade: from dictatorship to democracy, from developing country to one of the strongest economies in Asia.
"From ancient times to the Qing dynasty," which ended in 1911, "there are historical records showing more than 1,000 U.F.O. sightings," insisted Mr. Ho, leafing through a detailed listing of historical texts describing mysterious objects and lights in the sky. "But in Taiwan," he continued, "you can't really see U.F.O.'s. They don't come to Taiwan very often. Taiwan is just a small island. They can't see it from outer space."
Undeterred by such assertions from Taiwan's pre-eminent saucer authority, a former medical professor named Chen Heng-ming spent last year busily assembling devotees into his sect, the God Saves the Earth Flying Saucer Association.
Perhaps because Taiwan is so small, Mr. Chen has taken about 100 of his followers to the wide open ranges of Texas where they will, in the words of a follower, Wu Chun-sheng, "be meeting God, who would arrive on a flying saucer to save them." From Dallas, the believers will be whisked to Mars neat year in flying saucers. Living a year in a flying saucer, she said, "would be like 10 years on earth."
Interplanetary travel, however, appears to come with a price tag. The parents of several sect members have complained to the police that their children gave Mr. Chen huge sums of money for the privilege of a saucer ride.
In Texas, the authorities are reportedly worried that he intends to orchestrate a mass suicide in the fashion of Heaven's Gate, an American sect in which dozens of members committed collective suicide in San Diego last year.
In articles with blaring headlines here, Mr. Chen has repeatedly assured the people of Taiwan that he has no intention of committing suicide; indeed, he said, he and his 100 or so followers were just "waiting to ride a flying saucer into heaven," a trip that would start on March 31, 1999, at precisely 10 P.M.
While Mr. Chen was scuttling off to Texas for his promised encounter of the third kind, a man named Wu Tai-chung has been corralling members into his own sect, the Sky and Earth Enlightenment Association, by assuring them that he arrived from outer space to save them from planetary Armageddon. Brandishing photographs taken in Taiwan's central mountain district, Mr. Wu told his growing number of followers that the dots of sun glare marring the pictures were in fact "points of inner energy" from outer space; merging with those dots would, Mr. Wu declared, allow believers to soar into outer space on a flying saucer.
Like the rides offered by Mr. Chen, the ticket to salvation by saucer is no bargain.
"We believed, we completely believed," said Tai Chiu-fen, a 38-year-old mother of seven and owner of a car repair shop. "We got involved because my husband had these headaches and we were told he didn't have to have medicine and he would get better. We were very curious and decided to try it."
She and her husband gave Wu Tai-chung the equivalent of about $312,000, she said. "We have no money left. We spent it all, or rather, we were cheated of it all."
As the flying saucer cults spread, national authorities and officials in Taipei, a city of six million, are becoming increasingly alarmed at people's gullibility.
"This so-called religious problem is a social problem," said Chen Shui-bian, Taipei's Mayor, in an interview in his spartan office. "In Taiwan society many people do not have faith in themselves. They feel they can't place their faith in ordinary things, including science and technology, so they put it into these religions."
"These religions," he continued, "are not real religions. They are just another form of deception. People get deeply involved. It's not a question of education because a lot of professors, Ph.D.'s, they can believe in these type of things."
Mrs. Tai, who gave all her money to the Sky and Earth sect, reluctantly agreed with her Mayor when asked why she turned to Mr. Wu's group. Sighing deeply, she explained: "The pressure on our life is very heavy. We all seek spiritual sustenance. I believed in him. He had pictures. He showed them to us. Everyone said it was true, it was real."
She added: "He said that if you want to travel this road, you can't take belongings from this world. No possessions. Only then can you reach this force."
So uneasy are the Taiwan authorities about the spread of these cults that prosecutors have begun criminal investigations into whether adherents have been defrauded.
Liao Cheng-hao, the Minister of Justice, said in an interview that the reasons for the spread of the cults was "very, very easy to understand," adding: "People feel empty and are searching for a kind of civilized society. They are all looking for the true religion. But these flying saucer cults are a relatively strange phenomenon."
For Mr. Ho, for whom flying saucers are a serious business, there is no mystery about them. "If there's a U.F.O. in the sky, you can see it," he said. "It has a shape, a form, It has mass. All the others are cheats."
Despite the spread of cults claiming links with beings on flying saucers, Mr. Ho said he was determined to soldier on with his work. "Our research is scientific," he said. "How could we be affected by these cults? How could this hurt our reputation?"
"Religion itself is very mysterious," Mr. Ho said. "Adding U.F.O.'s only makes it more attractive. But if you're using U.F.O.'s in your religion, your religion has got real problems."

Viacom Posts a Less-Than-Expected Loss

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Viacom Inc. lost less money in the fourth quarter than analysts had expected, and the company's results are likely to improve further because of the record-setting success of the film "Titanic."
Viacom said yesterday that its MTV and Showtime cable operations performed well during the fourth quarter. Moreover, results at Viacom's Blockbuster video store chain are rebounding: Rental revenue at stores open at least a year rose in the quarter for the first time in almost two years. 
 "Titanic," released in this country by the Paramount Pictures division, has already generated a record $919.8 million in revenue since its release in late December.
"What made this quarter better was the cable assets," said Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc., which has a "buy" rating on Viacom's stock. " 'Titanic' is what we have to look forward to."
In the fourth quarter, Viacom's loss from continuing operations, before a gain, was $102 million, or 29 cents a diluted share. That was better than the loss of 35 cents a share that analysts, on average, had expected. A year earlier, the company had earnings from continuing operations of $17 million, or 1 cent a share.
Including a pretax gain of $1.2 billion from the sale of its share in the USA Networks cable business, Viacom had profit from continuing operations in the latest quarter of $597 million, or $1.60 a share. Net income was $573 million, or $1.54 a share, in contrast with a loss of $227.4 million a year earlier, or 68 cents a share.
Viacom's class B shares, which are widely traded, rose $1.75, to $46, on the American Stock Exchange yesterday. The improvements at Blockbuster and the success of "Titanic" have lifted the shares 50 percent since October.
Analysts believe the stock could reach the mid-$50 range in a few months, especially if Viacom proceeds with the sale of part of its Simon & Schuster publishing business and its stake in Spelling Entertainment Group.
Viacom wants to use money from asset sales to reduce its $8 billion debt, already cut by more than $2 billion last year. That could allow it to make acquisitions in its core film and cable television businesses.
Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 5.9 percent, to $3.61 billion from $3.41 billion. Cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose 6.7 percent, to $510 million from $478 million.
Leading the way in the quarter was MTV Networks, which includes the MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon cable channels. The division had a 25 percent rise in cash flow, to $220 million. Showtime Networks had a 14 percent gain.
MTV Networks benefited from higher advertising, driven by the strong economy, and increased subscription fees.
Despite the increase in same-store rental revenue at Blockbuster, cash flow fell 36 percent, to $123 million. Blockbuster has suffered from two years of shifting strategies and management changes, but a new executive team has won praise for focusing on Blockbuster's core rental business while forging agreements with some studios to reduce the costs of films.
Viacom's film business, led by Paramount Pictures, reported a 51 percent decline in cash flow, to $39 million, primarily because of lower syndication revenue for television programming. The quarter a year earlier was strong because it included hits like "Mission: Impossible" and "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America."
"Titanic" was released too late in the quarter to have much impact on the results. Paramount owns the domestic rights to the film, while the News Corporation's 20th Century Fox owns the international business.

HEADLINE: Union Pacific Predicts Loss and Cuts Its Dividend

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation, the nation's largest railroad company, forecast a first-quarter loss yesterday, announced plans to issue as much as $1 billion in securities and cut its dividend by more than half as it struggles to untangle an eight-month rail logjam.
Shares of Union Pacific fell $6.5625, or 11 percent, to $52.0625, in heavy trading. Earlier, the stock touched a 16-month low of $49. The share price has fallen about 26 percent since July. 
 Wall Street analysts said the announcements came as a surprise because the company said last month that it was profitable.
Union Pacific said its outlook changed in recent weeks because its strategy of running trains in a single direction on one track was not working. That strategy was the company's latest ill-fated attempt to resolve congestion resulting from its $5.4 billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation in 1996.
"They need more than a Band-Aid approach," said Doug Rockel, an analyst with Furman Selz. "It's good news for shippers but a negative announcement for shareholders," at least initially.
The company has yet to determine the form of the equity-based securities it will issue or when it will do so, a spokesman, Gary Schuster, said. But it said it planned to use the proceeds to expand rail yards and tracks, especially in the hardest-hit gulf region.
The company reduced its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 43 cents. That move is expected to save $230 million a year.
Richard K. Davidson, the chairman and chief executive, said Union Pacific's business could be hurt "perhaps a little bit into the second quarter while we get this thing back on its feet."
The Standard & Poor's Corporation cut its rating on Union Pacific's commercial paper and said it might lower its corporate credit, senior secured and unsecured debt ratings. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating.
Union Pacific has lost sales as it failed to deliver goods on time and shippers turned to other railroads or trucks.
The company's expenses have also risen as it has paid overtime crews and incurred other costs to try to clear up its lines.
Economists say the logjam has cost businesses in the United States about $2 billion, with as much as half the damage in Texas. Shippers are pressuring Federal regulators to consider ordering Union Pacific to sell some track to give shippers more alternatives for rail transportation.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Middle-Income Complex Planned for Rockaway

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Believing that the market for rental apartments for middle-income tenants is improving on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, a developer is building the first such project in the area in over a decade.
The $13.5 million development will have 130 apartments ranging from studios to three-bedroom units in five four-story brick buildings. It will take shape over the next 10 months on an empty patch of land at 2229-2259 Dix Avenue, between McBride Street and Beach Channel Drive in Far Rockaway. 
 The developer is Dix-McBride L.L.P. of Astoria, Queens, headed by George Fakiris, who has built some 70 apartment buildings with 18,000 residences, mostly rentals, throughout New York City in the last 25 years. He is financing the project with his own money and an $8.25 million construction loan from EAB, a Uniondale, N.Y., bank owned by the Dutch banking giant ABN Amro Bank, N.V.
The project is moving ahead at a time when there is renewed interest in redeveloping the former resort area, which fell into decline after World War II. About 16 percent of the land, or about 700 acres, in the area is vacant. Much of this stems from the razing of hundreds of acres of bungalows, modest homes and hotels from Beach 32d to Beach 73d Streets in 1965 as part of city urban renewal plans that never materialized.
But in the last three years, as the economy revived, planning resumed. Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager for Community Board 14, which helps guide growth in the area, said that in that time about 70 residences, mostly two-family homes, have been or are being built in the area.
More development is planned. At an old urban renewal site along Jamaica Bay between Beach 35th and Beach 51st Streets in the Edgemere section, there are plans for 800 housing units, primarily two-family homes, to be built under New York City's New Homes Program. Under it, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development will work with the nonprofit New York City Housing Partnership to choose a developer to build, with city and state subsidies, homes affordable to buyers with incomes between $32,000 and $70,000 a year.
The Edgemere project, to be developed in four phases, will also include up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, a new elementary school and 13 acres of parks. Construction of the first phase, 132 residences, is expected to begin in 2000, following site acquisition, which is to start in the fall. Construction of new streets and sewers is to begin in the summer of 1999, city officials said.
Plans were also announced in June for another urban renewal area, along the Atlantic Ocean from Beach 25th to Beach 73d in the Arverne section. A Canadian company, the Heathmount Arts and Entertainment Corporation, wants to build a 2.7 million-square-foot entertainment, sports and hotel complex, to be called the Technodome. Issues like the cost and extent of road and sewer improvements the area would need to accommodate the project are still being discussed.
Meanwhile, work continues on Dix-McBride's Dix Avenue project, begun in December. Mr. Fakiris bought the three-acre site for $1.1 million three years ago with the intention of building rentals for low-income tenants. That plan was abandoned when he was unable to get public subsidies to help finance the project.
He said he pursued the current project because of the new development planned in the area and what he sensed was "a big demand for apartments for middle-income tenants, which no one is building."
In addition, under the city's 421a abatement program, which provides partial tax exemptions to developers who build multiple dwellings on vacant, underused sites, property taxes will be kept to a minimum for 15 years.
Mr. Gaska said the community board had opposed the low-income rental project because it was important to the area's revival to encourage housing for middle-income families. He said the district is home to about 5,000 public housing units, and of its population of 106,000, about 30 percent receive public assistance.
"If successful, the Dix Avenue project will be a shot in the arm that could help turn that part of Far Rockaway around," Mr. Gaska said, adding that it, along with the plans for the urban renewal sites, "show that people want to invest here." But if the Dix Avenue project is not successful, he said, "the concern is that it will be converted into housing for low-income tenants."
Robin J. Cohen, senior vice president for the real estate lending division at EAB, added that the bank lent the money to the developer because the projected rents would be affordable to middle-income people, who are moving into the area.
Rents for the apartments, with 443 to 882 square feet on average, are expected to range from $550 to $1,100 per month. There will also be a playground and underground and surface parking for 200 cars. The complex will be gated and have security cameras. Leasing is expected to begin late in July.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faces Hard Choice as Suharto Balks at Economic Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has concluded that President Suharto of Indonesia has once again sent the effort to rescue his country wildly off track, ignoring most of the commitments he signed six weeks ago with the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Suharto's continued refusal to enact the economic and political reforms he committed to in return for a $43-billion bailout presents the Clinton Administration and the monetary fund with a tough choice. They must either threaten to suspend the huge rescue program and risk the further collapse of the Indonesian economy -- and further outbreaks of violence -- or let Mr. Suharto undermine the fund's credibility by taking its money and ignoring its dictates. 
 Today, Administration officials were still debating how stiffly to word their warnings to Mr. Suharto when former Vice President Walter F. Mondale sees the 76-year-old leader early next week. Mr. Mondale is the second personal emissary President Clinton has sent to see Asia's longest-serving leader, and one senior official preparing him for the trip called the mission "a last-ditch effort to let him know that his country is heading into chaos, and he's throwing away the life ring."
In his agreement with the monetary fund, Mr. Suharto said he would break up many of the cartels -- run by his family and friends -- that dominate Indonesia's economy, close down failing banks and take a series of steps to restore the confidence of investors who have fled the country. But the cartels have remained open, often under different guises, and the banks have done little other than announce that they cannot pay their international debts.
"We are still trying to send the message to Indonesia that it is in their overwhelming interest to implement the reforms to keep Indonesia from dissolving into further financial chaos," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said several days ago.
But the selection of Mr. Mondale and the daily meetings at the White House, rather than at Mr. Rubin's office in the Treasury, reflect how Indonesia's troubles are now regarded as a political crisis wrapped around a currency crisis. Mr. Clinton's four telephone calls with Mr. Suharto were described by one top official as "unsatisfying at best."
Between calls, Mr. Suharto has fired the central bank chief, who was pressing the monetary fund's reform agenda, and promoted the nomination of an old friend, B. J. Habibie, as Vice President, in a parliamentary election in two weeks.
Mr. Habibie is regarded as one of the "crony capitalists" whose Government-subsidized businesses are a target of the I.M.F. But American officials appear to have given up hope that Mr. Suharto would choose another candidate; they are concentrating now on preventing him from placing other close friends in top economic positions.
So Mr. Mondale, who met Mr. Suharto once before more than 20 years ago, is facing the task of derailing those moves, without seeming to directly interfere in Mr. Suharto's choices.
Today, Mr. Mondale and President Clinton had a long talk about his mission, White House officials said. A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr. Mondale would "push for both economic and political reform as a way of working through the Asian economic crisis."
Mr. Mondale seems unlikely to directly threaten that the monetary fund could cancel the $43-billion "stabilization program," officials familiar with his briefings say, in part because they are trying to sidestep a direct confrontation with the often-prickly Indonesian leader.
In fact, it is unclear how much of a message he will be able to send. Mr. Clinton's last emissary, Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, sat through a lengthy monologue by Mr. Suharto that filled much of their 90-minute session. "It was classic Suharto," one official familiar with the session said.
But there are signs that Washington and the I.M.F. are looking for face-saving ways to win Mr. Suharto's cooperation. In the past few days, the fund has told Indonesia it can continue to subsidize sales of basic foodstuffs, rather than risk seeing their price continue to rise. "We have no wish to see food riots," a senior monetary fund official said.
Mr. Mondale, officials say, will express a limited American support for Mr. Suharto, in part because the State Department is arguing that there is no credible alternative leader for the country.
In his talks with President Clinton, Mr. Suharto has seemed less concerned about his own hold on power or the sporadic rioting that has already taken a half-dozen lives than about the continued decline of his country's currency, the rupiah.
A week ago he told Mr. Clinton that he was considering a plan to fix the value of the rupiah through a system called a currency board because the I.M.F.'s strategy had failed. But the currency plan would have undercut many of the provisions of the agreement with the monetary fund and given Mr. Suharto's children and friends a brief window to get their money out of the country at a favorable exchange rate.
After receiving protests from Mr. Clinton and from leaders in Japan and Europe -- as well as a direct threat that the fund would reconsider its aid program -- Mr. Suharto backed away from his currency plan, at least temporarily. But the argument over the rupiah, notes Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist who has been highly critical of the fund's plan, "was a distraction that took up three valuable weeks when both sides could have been doing a lot of more useful things."
"Both sides have made a hash of this whole thing by not addressing the real problems," Mr. Sachs said, noting that the fund agreement "doesn't solve the basic problems of the failing banks, the sinking currency or the crushing foreign debt."
If Mr. Suharto is going to indicate a change of course, he may not have much time. On March 15, just four days after the Indonesian Parliament is set to re-elect him for another five-year term, the monetary fund must decide at a meeting here whether to send the next installment of its aid. A fact-finding team from the fund is in Jakarta now to evaluate Indonesia's progress.
American officials, who could effectively veto the disbursement of funds, say they have not yet taken a position on whether to keep money flowing to Mr. Suharto's Government. But privately, many doubt that, no matter what the Indonesian leader does, they can afford to take the risk of cutting him off. They said they feared that if the West appeared to turn its back on Indonesia, the economy would melt down so fast that the panic could spread to Thailand, South Korea and other economies that are finally showing signs of stabilization.
"We don't have a lot of leverage," one official said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Oil Service Companies Surge; Dow Hits 8th Recent High

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The stocks of oil service companies surged yesterday in the wake of the Halliburton Company's agreement to acquire Dresser Industries for $7.7 billion in stock. Some industry analysts said they believed that the agreement could lead to a stampede among other companies to find partners.
Arvind S. Sanger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said yesterday that some competitors could be disadvantaged by the combination, which would create another giant in the oil service sector, along with the current leader, Schlumberger Ltd. "It could increase the pressure for consolidation, but it's not imperative that others merge to prosper," he said in an interview at an energy conference sponsored by Donaldson in New York. 
 The gains in oil services stocks helped push the market up broadly. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 32.89 points, to 8,490.67, the eighth new high in the last 12 trading days. Other major market indexes also rose to new highs, with the Nasdasq composite index up 10.63 points, to 1,777.11, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks up 5.77 points, to 1,048.67. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks also rallied, rising 3.05 points, to 461.54. The index is now just 3.67 points from its all-time high of 465.21 reached Oct. 13.
The rally lifted stocks ranging from Boeing, which was up 211/16 , to 5315/16 , to Philip Morris, up 1 5/8, to 42 5/8. It was fueled by the same factors that have been carrying stocks higher for some time: low interest rates, low inflation and the prospect of continued growth in corporate earnings. In addition, despite this week's warnings from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, investors seem to think that the impact from the Asian economic turmoil will be minimal. Among the leading performers in oil services yesterday were Baker Hughes, which rose by 3 7/8, or 10.5 percent, to close at 40 5/8. Cliffs Drilling rose 2 1/8 a share, to 39 5/8, and Varco International also rose 2 1/8, to 24 3/8.
Mr. Sanger said Halliburton's acquisition of Dresser could increase the pressure on several of the smaller and midsize companies, including Cliffs, Varco, and Parker Drilling, which rose 13/16 , to 113/16 .
Though Mr. Sanger said the combination of Halliburton with Dresser was an excellent fit, he cautioned that pressure could lead to "me-too" deals that might not make sense. He said that some companies could end up overpaying and then not get the savings and synergies that they had hoped for in a merger.
At the conference, representatives of some drilling companies painted a rosy picture of tight supplies for their equipment, which is used to find oil, to bring existing fields into production and to increase production on fields. In response to the strong demand, which has come even though oil prices have fallen by about a third since last fall, services companies have begun to build new rigs, they said.
The demand for drilling equipment has been so strong that several executives said that they had been able to get new contracts for rental of their equipment at much higher rates than in previous deals.
C. Russell Luigs, the chairman and chief executive of Global Marine, a major drilling company in Houston that is one of the largest providers of equipment in the Gulf of Mexico, said at the conference that in the last seven weeks the company has been able to negotiate new contracts for 13 rigs at considerably higher rates than in the previous contracts.
He said that what was driving the oil industry to keep up spending for exploration was that significant new oilfields had been found in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years and, more recently, off the coast of West Africa.
Mr. Luigs said that the company had a large backlog of demand for equipment and that even though the industry was gearing up to build new rigs there would still be tight supplies in the future. The strong demand has led to an intense competition within the industry for workers. And oil services companies have been scouring the world to buy used equipment and investing heavily in new capacity to build rigs.
This has put pressure on the companies to raise capital and to find skilled managers to oversee their growth. All of this has also led somecompanies to seek merger partners.

HEADLINE: Durable Orders Rose by 0.7% Last Month

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in January, the Commerce Department said today, indicating that the Asian economic crisis had little impact on American manufacturers.
The increase was below the 1 percent gain that analysts, on average, had expected. Still, it was the sixth gain in eight months and contrasted with December's revised decline of 5.5 percent. 
 Excluding transportation equipment -- an expensive airplane order can skew results -- durable goods orders increased three-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The month's data suggested that the expansion in the manufacturing sector had not yet been slowed by declining demand from the troubled Asian nations, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation. "This continues to say that the economy is on a healthy growth path," he said. "The Asian economic hurricane has not been sighted in this report yet."
Still, Mr. Sohn said it would be only a matter of time before manufacturers began to feel the pinch from slackening Asian demand for their products. "The momentum is fairly healthy now, but by midyear orders could fall off the cliff," he said.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, agreed that the full impact of the Asian turmoil had not yet been felt. But, he said, "today's report shows that manufacturers will weather the storm successfully as long as strong domestic demand continues." He added, "And every indication is that domestic demand will remain solid in coming months."
The Government said the backlog of unfilled orders increased half a percent in January, the fifth increase in the last seven months. A growing backlog often suggests that businesses are unable to meet demand with current plants and employment levels. Shipments fell 1.4 percent, the third drop in four months.
In another economic report, the Labor Department said today that initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose by 10,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 320,000. Analysts had expected a gain of only 1,000.
The four-week moving average for jobless applications, considered a more reliable gauge of labor market conditions than the volatile weekly figures, rose 5,000, to 309,250.

HEADLINE: Labor Chief Visits to Rally Unions and Hear Workers' Hopes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O's president, brought the labor movement's road show to the Big Apple yesterday to hear what was on the minds of New York City's workers -- and they gave him an earful.
New York's never-timid workers addressed him the way they would a governor or even a president, urging him and the labor movement to help fix their problems, large and small: inadequate child care, expensive housing and insecurity on the job. 
 A hospital cook at a crowded town meeting at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in upper Manhattan, Edward Welch, told Mr. Sweeney that unions needed to do more to make housing affordable, especially for part-time workers.
At the same session, Hugh McCabe, a driver at the hospital, urged labor leaders to stop the hospital from contracting out cafeteria and housekeeping work to private companies -- moves he said had caused considerable layoffs.
In an earlier session in Brooklyn, at a Crown Heights day care center, Yim Man Mui, a garment worker, complained about the high cost and low availability of child care, noting, through a translator, that she spent about one-third of her wages on child care.
Linda Bullock, another union member, also bemoaned the child care shortage, telling Mr. Sweeney, "You sign up your child for day care when he's 2 1/2 and by the time you're called off the waiting list, he's 8 years old."
In bouncing around the city like a pinball during a visit that was part of his tour of 14 cities to hear what workers had to say, Mr. Sweeney soaked up dozens of such comments and pledged to take them into account when the 13-million-member labor federation shapes its agenda. He also met with Pakistani limousine drivers struggling to form a union as well as with union organizers who congratulated him for injecting some energy into the long-lethargic movement.
Sounding like a Congressman visiting his home district, Mr. Sweeney told the audience of 300 union members at Columbia-Presbyterian, "I'm personally a lot more interested in what you think here in New York than what all the experts think back in Washington because I firmly believe that the strength and wisdom of our movement lies here with rank-and-file union members like all of you."
In his visit, Mr. Sweeney, a Bronx native whose father was a bus driver, made clear that the city holds a special place in his heart -- and in the nation's labor movement. He said that a long-planned campaign to unionize tens of thousands of workers in hospitals, nursing homes and walk-in clinics should serve as a model for unions around the nation.
Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the National Hospital and Human Service Employees Union, who was Mr. Sweeney's host at Columbia-Presbyterian, hinted that he would announce the multimillion-dollar organizing drive as soon as 1199's members voted next month on a planned merger with the Service Employees International Union.
Mr. Sweeney said New York City's labor leaders were providing another model for the nation with an ambitious plan, announced yesterday, to create a multi-union fund to build child care centers and finance child care slots. As part of that campaign, union leaders said that they would lobby Albany to finance 50,000 more child care slots and would pressure employers in contract negotiations to contribute to the multi-union child care fund.
"What you're doing is the first of its kind in the country," Mr. Sweeney said. "They're all models of what we should be doing."
If there was any theme in Mr. Sweeney's day, it was child care. He spent the morning blessing the effort by a dozen unions -- including 1199, the teachers and state, county and municipal employees -- to make child care one of the local labor movement's main thrusts.
Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, said, "We hope we can make a successful push on child care the way the labor movement successfully pushed once upon a time on such fundamental issues as the eight-hour day, minimum wage and occupational safety and health."
In an interview on a school bus that was bumpily carrying him from Crown Heights to Columbia-Presbyterian, Mr. Sweeney made clear that the purpose of his visit was not merely to listen. He said he hoped his presence would not only cause workers to warm to labor's message but also persuade them to get more involved in union activity, especially in the push to recruit more members.
It was a feel-good day for Mr. Sweeney because even as workers occasionally scolded him to encourage him to do more, they enthusiastically praised him for reviving labor and paying attention to their concerns.
"I'm very excited about the visit," said Willie Mae Terry, a medical assistant at Columbia-Presbyterian. "It shows unity. It's people getting together."
Mr. Sweeney's message resonated with what was clearly a hometown crowd. He talked of making health insurance more affordable, of raising the minimum wage and of reducing the pay disparity between men and women.
At Columbia-Presbyterian, the crowd, made up of members of 1199, applauded thunderously when he said, "Everybody seems to agree that with corporate profits and executive salaries going up and with the stock market and the economy booming, it's time working families shared a bigger slice of the pie."
Mr. Sweeney used a similar applause line at recent town meetings he held in Atlanta; Kansas City; Topeka, Kan., and Toledo, Ohio
In Topeka, workers complained to him that local jobs had been lost because of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In Toledo, workers complained of heavy overtime, inadequate pensions and unaffordable health insurance.
Thirty-five minutes into the meeting at Columbia-Presbyterian, half the audience suddenly drifted away. Mr. Rivera rushed to the microphone to explain that it was due to the age-old tension between employer and employee.
"You see many of our members are leaving," he told Mr. Sweeney. "It's not a matter of disrespect. It's their lunch hour, and if they don't go back to work, they'll be written up."

HEADLINE: The Shrinking Military Complex;
After the Cold War, the Pentagon Is Just Another Customer

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
As the United States maintains an armed buildup in the Persian Gulf against Iraq, the nation's military contractors are completing a multiyear, multibillion-dollar reorganization that has left them less tied to the Pentagon's needs and more beholden to shareholder pressures and civilian market forces.
A decade-long slide in the nation's military procurement budget -- it is effectively 69 percent lower today than in 1985 -- set off a wave of mergers among military contractors so broad that there are now only three prime military contractors left: the Boeing Company, the Raytheon Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation. 
 But more importantly, all three expect military contracts to become an increasingly smaller part of their business. And even at Lockheed, which has led the consolidation, military sales will represent a minority of its business in five years.
In fact, what was seen as a military-industrial complex of hundreds of contractors ready to churn out military hardware at the Pentagon's behest does not exist at anywhere near the same scale it once did. It has been replaced with an industrial base of three major companies, along with many small niche suppliers, where the distinctions between a military contractor and a civilian corporation are increasingly blurred. The Pentagon is becoming just another customer to do business with.
"We will have American industry providing for national defense," said Norman R. Augustine, chairman of Lockheed Martin. "But we will not have a national defense industry. This is not the best of all worlds. We'll have to draw on our industrial base rather than having the defense capability of the past."
Jacques S. Gansler, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, agreed. "We now think of the defense-industrial base as the U.S. industrial base," he said.
It is, of course, too early to determine the impact of these recent mergers on the nation's overall military capability. And no one is saying that the United States is unprepared in its test of wills with Iraq. Still, there are concerns that over time what is being done for economic reasons today may have battlefield consequences tomorrow.
"Many of the things we do in peacetime for economic reasons in our defense consolidation could have a downside in terms of war preparedness," said Lauren Thompson, director of defense programs at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute, a Washington research organization. "When you eliminate excess military productive capacity, the day may come when it is not available for rapid mobilization in wartime."
For instance, while the United States Navy has sufficient supplies of Tomahawk cruise missiles, the number of makers of these missiles has been reduced since the Persian Gulf war from two to one. Raytheon says it has plenty of capacity to make the Amraam-AIM 120 air-to-air missiles used in the Persian Gulf war. But what happens if a shortage occurs and the Pentagon can no longer turn to the only other Amraam supplier, Hughes Aircraft, because Hughes is now part of Raytheon?
"Industry consolidation has gotten to the point of increasing concern," Mr. Gansler said. "It needs closer watching."
Meanwhile, there are some benefits, too. A new focus on the civilian business practices means that the Pentagon will be piggybacking more on existing commercial technologies rather than engage in the costly process of building from scratch. The Pentagon is also streamlining its buying practices so that companies that avoided selling to the military because of onerous red tape will find the Pentagon an easier customer.
The military procurement budget, which pays for new weapons, fell from a peak of $97 billion in 1985 to $44 billion today. When political considerations prevented the Pentagon from closing as many military bases as planned in the post-cold-war world, weapons outlays absorbed the brunt of the budget reductions.
As a result, there are now significantly fewer Pentagon contractors bidding on any given military contract. The three prime contractors now represent about two-thirds of all military product sales. The price of this change, industry analysts say, is the potential for less innovation in the design of military products, and less control by the Pentagon over its suppliers, in times of peace as well as in war, because the Pentagon has less financial clout over them.
A report on these mergers prepared last May for the Secretary of Defense by the Defense Science Board, a civilian advisory panel, found that while there is "little evidence" of problems to date, military industry consolidation "poses potential concerns over time." Among them are fears that monopolistic practices could be "harmful to defense product cost, quality or performance" and that reduced competition could depress innovation, especially among smaller military suppliers.
"Power has shifted from the Defense Department to the defense contractors," said one Congressional military analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The Pentagon has less leverage when there are fewer places to go to fill mission needs. Companies have fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders."
Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, made a similar point: "The big challenge will be to provide military products when a threat has receded. It's not a picture of the Big Bear threatening Uncle anymore."
A vision of the military contractor of the future exists just a few miles from the Pentagon in Bethesda, Md., where Lockheed Martin has grown by acquiring 22 weapons suppliers to become the nation's second-largest military contractor. Along with Boeing and Raytheon, Lockheed has been dubbed one of the mega-dominant defense companies, in industry jargon. Its $28 billion in sales comes from the acquisition of such companies as Martin Marietta, Loral, Unisys Defense and Ford Aerospace. It is currently seeking to acquire the Northrop Grumman Corporation, the maker of the B-2 bomber, for $8.3 billion.
Still, for all this consolidation, military contracts, which accounted for more than 80 percent of Lockheed's revenues in 1989 and for around 50 percent today, are expected to drop to 25 percent in the next decade as Lockheed branches into satellite, electronics, telecommunications and information services for civilians.
"We will be a diversified, high-tech company that does defense work," Mr. Augustine of Lockheed said.
The company's strategy is to use technologies developed for the military to create new civilian profit-making uses. It formed a joint venture with Intersputnik, an old Soviet-bloc satellite company, to orbit four Lockheed telecommunications satellites to broadcast into Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.
The company also formed a joint venture with the Intel Corporation to market a 3-D graphics computer chip that Lockheed had developed for military simulations and that is now incorporated into Intel's personal computer mother boards. It is also embarking on a new program in which high-resolution satellite transmissions, once used for military eye-in-the-sky surveillance, are being marketed to foresters, agribusiness, city planners, cable television operators and anyone who needs sophisticated topographical maps.
Lockheed's new face is being displayed in television commercials shown on Washington's Sunday morning talk shows. The advertisement features an F-16, made by Lockheed, flying (in a computer simulation) through New York to trumpet the E-Z Pass toll collection system that the company developed from technology used to differentiate friendly tanks from enemy tanks.
"We have to look to adjacent markets for business," said Brian D. Dailey, Lockheed's vice president for strategic development. "The Defense Department is still a critical customer to us and we will continue to give it first-order services. But the reality is we can no longer look to the Defense Department as our only market for growth."
For some companies, like Boeing, mergers may temporarily increase their overall military dependence. Still, for most, commercial work is considered the growth area. In contrast, military contracts are seen as a way of providing a steady revenue stream, often for 10 to 20 years.
The changes now occurring began in the early 1990's. Industry executives recall the famous "Last Supper," a 1993 Pentagon dinner whose host was Les Aspin, then Secretary of Defense, and his deputy, William J. Perry, who succeeded him. At the dinner were executives from a dozen contractors who were told by Mr. Perry that there were twice as many military suppliers as he wanted to see in five years and that the Government was prepared to watch some go out of business. From 1992 to 1997, a total of $55 billion in military-industry mergers took place, according to Securities Data Company, a research concern in Newark.
At the same time, the nature of war has changed. Pentagon planners believe that conflicts of the 21st century will mostly be waged by terrorists and rogue nations using weapons of mass destruction, such as chemical, biological and nuclear devices that are stockpiled but no longer made, or using high-tech communications to wreak havoc against troops and civilians.
Pentagon officials are convinced that future warfare will draw heavily from the high-tech innovations dominated by American enterprises. That allows military planners to assume that much of what they need can simply be purchased off the shelf and modified, if necessary, for the military. This can be less costly than items often made to needlessly complex military specifications, said Mr. Gansler, the Defense Under Secretary.
But it also means that private companies, not the Pentagon, will have a greater sway over the development of military technology. "Are we really sure we want to have large private companies developing the next generation of weapons, which they feel are best suited to the marketplace?" asked Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown. "This is as opposed to our existing system where contractors are essentially the agents following the suggestion of the Government. This does change the nature of the beast."
Of course, there will still be plenty of business in traditional military hardware. For the first time in a decade, the military procurement budget was not cut in the Defense Department's 1998 budget and the Pentagon is counting on it to rise to around $60 billion by 2000. The 1998 military budget of $255 billion -- with around $100 billion a year for procurement and research -- makes the Pentagon one of the biggest customers around. And the few companies still in the business know it.
"A lot of this commercialization talk is really bogus," said William Anders, the retired chief executive of the General Dynamics Corporation, a second-tier military contractor that has deliberately shrunk itself in the post-cold-war era rather than seek nonmilitary business. "There are some successes, but you can't spread it to a total situation. You won't get a civilian use of a submarine, a tank, a ship or a gun. I don't know of any commercial use for torpedoes."

Military contractors, faced with a shrinking Pentagon budget, are moving more into commercial ventures. Lockheed adapted its technology to create New York's E-Z Pass, shown at right. Others have followed Lockheed's example or been swallowed up. Only one major contractor still gets most of its revenue from the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: New York City's Budget Surplus Is Expected to Surpass Record

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
New York City will end its fiscal year with a budget surplus between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, almost certainly surpassing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's prediction and last year's record surplus of $1.4 billion, city and state auditors said yesterday.
The additional windfalls come, as they have for the last two years, largely from the continued boom on Wall Street. Bonuses in the securities industries totaling more than $11.1 billion, up from $9.6 billion last year, are expected to swell the city's coffers with tax revenues for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, said H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller. 
 Mr. McCall's office and the City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, included the surplus figures in separate reports that examined the first half of the current fiscal year and the $34.3 billion preliminary budget that Mr. Giuliani presented last month for the next year. In his plan, the Mayor said he anticipated a $1.2 billion surplus and proposed using 73 percent of it to help close projected budget gaps for the next fiscal year.
The reports presented generally upbeat assessments of the city's financial condition and Mr. Giuliani's spending plan. The auditors said that the Mayor's plan relied less on the onetime revenue gimmicks that had drawn criticism for Mr. Giuliani in previous years. And they said that the Mayor had cautiously estimated anticipated revenues, including those from Wall Street.
But the auditors also pointed out long-term problems in the city's finances. Mr. Hevesi's office, which predicted a budget surplus of $1.5 billion, said that to be able to balance spending and revenues over the long run, the city has to find savings by restructuring its agencies and getting its workers to be more productive.
Mr. McCall's office warned that New York's economy and budget were becoming increasingly dependent on Wall Street's unpredictable fortunes. Although jobs on Wall Street accounted for 4.5 percent of the city's employment, they amounted to 17 percent of its wages, up from about 11 percent a decade ago, according to the State Comptroller's report.
Only a few years ago, the city was struggling to balance its annual budget, as it is legally required to do. But, in a measure of how things have changed, city officials are already projecting a surplus at the end of the next fiscal year -- $269 million, according to Mr. Hevesi's calculations. The projection assumes that the financial markets would perform only modestly over the next year.
Although some independent fiscal monitors and education advocates have argued that some of this year's surplus should be earmarked toward the city's schools and aging public works, City Hall officials who will decide the final shape of the budget in June have said they agreed with Mr. Giuliani's proposal to use most of the surplus to close future budget gaps. About 27 percent of the surplus, he said, should be used to pay for tax cuts and to finance some programs.

HEADLINE: Clinton Continues to Stumble Over the 'E' Word (Encryption)

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26

 BODY:
President Clinton described the economic impact of the Internet today in glowing terms to an audience of technology investors here, but he failed to touch on the issue that increasingly appears to matter most to Silicon Valley: the fiery debate over the Administration's policy on data scrambling.
The Clinton Administration has endeared itself to the nation's high-technology center by cutting capital gains taxes and by calling today for a bill that would bar state and local governments from enacting taxes on the Internet until 2004. But encryption may prove to be the Administration's Achilles' heel in its otherwise friendly ties with Silicon Valley. 
 The debate over encryption -- which has pitted industry and civil liberties groups against law enforcement and intelligence agencies -- has sharpened in recent weeks. New legislation that would restrict the unlimited use of encryption is about to be introduced on Capitol Hill. A series of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations over a compromise solution between the Clinton Administration and a small group of high-technology executives suggests that no simple resolution is in sight.
Encryption policy has become a flash point because it is both essential for the growth of Internet commerce and vital for the protection of privacy. Techniques that use mathematical formulas permit computers to scramble data so they cannot be read without access to a special "key," usually a large number that permits a user to unscramble the information. Law enforcement officials want to force users to put such keys in escrow with independent authorities to allow for electronic surveillance in criminal investigations.
President Clinton has told Silicon Valley executives in private meetings that he is sympathetic with their viewpoint but that he is under great pressure from law enforcement and national security officials to put even greater controls in place on encryption technology.
"To us this is really important, but it's just an irritant to him," said one Silicon Valley executive who met with the President before his speech today and asked not be identified further. "His basic message to us was, 'Can we get this thing done?' "
Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, are circulating a revised version of their encryption bill, which includes several changes in response to industry and privacy concerns but it has so far won few adherents outside of the law-enforcement community.
Critics say the legislation is simply a placeholder for future laws that would restrict the use of the technology.
"Everyone who is looking at the export issue is looking at it as a prelude to domestic controls," said Mark Rasch, a former Federal prosecutor who is now a specialist in encryption and computer security issues at the Science Applications International Corporation in McLean, Va.
Industry opponents of encryption controls, heavily financed by high-technology companies, are preparing to announce on Wednesday a new coalition, Americans for Privacy, aimed at ending restrictions on encryption technology exports.
At the same time Hewlett Packard plans to announce on Friday a new set of encryption technologies, with endorsements from the Department of Commerce and companies like I.B.M.. These technologies known as the International Cryptographic Framework, would let individual governments establish potentially conflicting encryption policies -- or even place no restrictions.
Silicon Valley executives argue that the law-enforcement demand for the continued ability to wiretap in the information age is wishful thinking at best. The easy availability of powerful encryption software has made it possible for any two people, anywhere in the world to hold a secret conversation beyond the prying of even the most powerful code-breaking computer, they say.
The White House is now considering several other industry proposals intent on finding a compromise between industry and law enforcement interests.
Another approach that is now being raised in negotiations between industry executives and the White House has been put forth by executives from Cisco Systems, the company that is the dominate provider of Internet routing equipment.
The Cisco proposal, known as Clearzone, would place encryption in the network instead of from personal computer to personal computer. Then, if a law-enforcement agency had a warrant to wiretap, it would be possible to go to an Internet provider that could then turn off encryption. But this proposal makes no provision for retrieving stored information also sought by law-enforcement agents.

HEADLINE: Bid to Save Fish Puts West on Notice

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 26

 BODY:
After nearly half a century of breakneck urban growth, the West Coast was given a bill, of sorts, by the Federal Government today. Federal officials announced that wild Pacific salmon are nearly extinct and put major urban areas on notice that millions of people are likely to face disruptions and higher living costs if the fish are to be restored as the law requires.
The proposed listing of at least a dozen salmon runs from California's Central Valley to the entire Puget Sound basin as endangered or threatened is not just the most ambitious effort to save a species. It also marks the first time that vast urban areas could have land and water use restricted under the Endangered Species Act. 
 But unlike 10 years ago, when the listing of the northern spotted owl threw the timber industry into revolt, this time industries that would be most affected by the proposal say they will largely go along with efforts to save salmon.
In trying to bring back the once-mighty runs of chinook, or king salmon, to areas crammed with skyscrapers, office parks, housing developments and malls, supporters of salmon recovery are trying to restore much of the natural world to an urban environment.
Most of the fresh water that flows to San Francisco, Sacramento, Calif., Portland Ore., and Seattle will need to be cleaner and colder -- and people will have to use less of it -- if the salmon are to be brought back. Farms, logging operations, housing tracts, roads and power-generating plants are likely to be altered.
"Ironically, as we work to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us," said Paul Schell, the Mayor of Seattle.
Never before, said Federal officials, has so much land or so many people been given notice that they will have to alter their lives to restore a wild species. This broad-scale approach is being billed as the wave of the future for threatened-species listings.
"This proposal is not just significant for the geographic scope, but for the national message it sends," said Terry Garcia, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce. "We will not allow species to go to extinction. The states have a choice to develop their own plans for recovery or have the Federal government impose it on them."
On the West Coast, officials have known for years that salmon stocks were in precarious shape. In Sacramento, winter chinook have fallen from an average 86,500 fish a year in the 1960's to 830. In the Puget Sound area, 22 of the 25 known chinook salmon runs are in rapid decline. The proposal today gives the three West Coast states about a year until the fish are formally protected, at which point the Federal Government could take any steps necessary to protect rivers where salmon spawn.
But it appears unlikely that the Government will force a shutdown in road building or industrial expansion, because the states and counties have already started to slow growth in preparation for the day that salmon would fall under Federal protection. They will present these plans for Federal approval.
The very threat of restrictions on virtually every river on the West Coast has forced the people who live on or near them to consider changing patterns of pollution and use.
Corporate heads of Boeing Microsoft, and Weyerhaeuser, among the biggest companies in one of the most prosperous economic areas in the country, as well as farming, logging and civic leaders expressed willingness to make changes in the landscape in order to restore salmon.
"We know we're going to take some hits," said Jack Larsen, a senior vice president for Weyerhaeuser. "But we learned during the spotted owl conflict that the adversarial approach didn't help anybody."
The spirit of compliance could disappear if, as happened recently in Oregon, Federal officials called for much greater land restrictions than the industry proposed.
But for now, there seems to be consensus among groups that normally fight each other to put aside lawsuits and political position papers to see if salmon can be brought back by a group effort.
Dairy farmers applauded the effort today, though runoff from their farms has been blamed for fouling salmon streams. Commercial fishermen, some of whom will be bought out under the proposal, backed the idea. Some Republicans, who have decried past environmental efforts as an infringement on private property, also expressed support.
State and Federal money would be used to buy out property that is critical for salmon, Republican officials said. "I don't think anybody wants to be like the generation, similar to a century ago, that saw the near extinction of the buffalo," said Jim Buck, a Republican Washington State representative.
Sports fishing of certain stocks of salmon that are not endangered would continue on the West Coast. But commercial fishing, once a thriving industry, has all but disappeared and will not return in a big way until the fish runs are restored.
The proposed listing by the National Marine Fisheries Service came after nearly 10 years of studying the signature fish of the Pacific Northwest. In the past, a few small runs on the Columbia and Sacramento rivers have been given Federal protection, but nothing of this magnitude has been considered.
In a show of political and corporate power, Pacific Northwest leaders staged a news conference to underline the iconic status of wild salmon in the region.
"This is like being told that Mount Rainier will disappear from our skyline," said Gov. Gary Locke, Democrat of Washington. "Life without salmon is unthinkable, but today, the unthinkable is in danger of coming true."
Federal officials have refused to put a price tag on salmon restoration. Nor are they willing to say what specific projects or activities might be slowed. But, in Washington, the state most affected by the proposed listings, Mr. Locke estimated it would cost the Federal and State Governments more than $170 million to restore the rivers for salmon. That does not address what private land owners would pay.
The Puget Sound basin, all of which would be under the Endangered Species protection under the plan, has more than 3 million people, and 63 percent of the land is in private hands.
"It is a daunting challenge because we have one of the hottest economies in the United States and this listing of species could threaten that," said Ron Sims, the Executive for King County, which includes Seattle. "But we feel this is something that future generations are entitled to."

HEADLINE: F.B.I. to Pay Whistle-Blower $1.1 Million in a Settlement

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26

 BODY:
The F.B.I. agreed today to pay a settlement of more than $1.16 million to the agent who brought about an overhaul of its crime laboratory.
The agent, Frederic Whitehurst, who is a chemist, returned to work from a yearlong suspension today and then voluntarily resigned as required by the deal to settle part of his lawsuit against the bureau. 
 "The F.B.I. did the right thing," said Dr. Whitehurst's lawyer, Stephen Kohn. "It's a positive message to all employees."
In the 16-page settlement, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed to pay $1.166 million now to buy annuities that would pay the 50-year-old agent annual amounts equal to the salary and pension he would have earned had he kept working until the normal F.B.I. retirement age of 57.
Under terms of the settlement, the bureau will also pay $258,580 in legal fees to Dr. Whitehurst's lawyers, and the Justice Department will drop all consideration of disciplinary action against him.
In a brief statement acknowledging Dr. Whitehurst's return to work and his decision to resign as of Friday, the bureau said, "Dr. Whitehurst played a role in identifying specific areas to be examined, and some of the issues he noted resulted in both internal and external reviews."
The bureau made no admission of liability or fault in the settlement document, saying only that the payments were intended to compensate Dr. Whitehurst for any economic damage he might suffer as a result of leaving the bureau before he was eligible for retirement.
For 10 years as the laboratory supervisor and once the bureau's top bomb residue expert, Dr. Whitehurst complained mostly in vain about laboratory practices. But his efforts finally led last April to a scathing 500-page study of the laboratory by the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Bromwich.
Mr. Bromwich sharply criticized the laboratory for flawed scientific work and inaccurate, pro-prosecution testimony in major cases, including the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings. Mr. Bromwich recommended major changes and discipline for five agents, which is still being considered, as well as the transfer of Dr. Whitehurst to other duties.
But Mr. Bromwich also criticized Dr. Whitehurst for "overstated and incendiary" allegations of intentional misconduct that Mr. Bromwich's investigators did not find.
Dr. Whitehurst had been suspended with pay since January 1997 and was facing discipline for refusing to cooperate with an investigation of the appearance of some of his allegations in a magazine.
As part of the deal with the bureau, Dr. Whitehurst agreed to drop allegations in his lawsuit that the bureau retaliated against him for whistle-blowing.
But Dr. Whitehurst's accusations that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department violated his rights under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act continue. Those cases are in confidential mediation.
Mr. Kohn said he and Dr. Whitehurst hoped the F.B.I. cooperated "with the ongoing investigation into identifying the victims of the forensic misconduct."
The F.B.I. has asserted that no prosecutions will be lost because of the laboratory problems. Justice Department officials have said none have been lost so far.
