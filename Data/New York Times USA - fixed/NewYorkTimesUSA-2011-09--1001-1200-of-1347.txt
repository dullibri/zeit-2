HEADLINE: New Clinton Book to Offer His Plan to Fix the Economy

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton is offering up a plan to fix the economy and push the United States into the future in a new book to be published in November by Knopf. 
In the book, titled ''Back to Work,'' Mr. Clinton will make the case for why government matters, explaining his ideas on energy, job creation and financial responsibility, his publisher said Thursday.
''I wrote this book because I love my country and I'm concerned about our future,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement. ''As I often said when I first ran for president in 1992, America at its core is an idea -- the idea that no matter who you are or where you're from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you'll have the freedom and opportunity to pursue your own dreams and leave your kids a country where they can chase theirs.''
The book's timing will create an unusual tableau: Mr. Clinton on a national book tour this fall, espousing his economic remedies, at the same time that President Obama will be presenting his own plans to the public.
Mr. Clinton wrote the book over the past several months, a person familiar with the deal said.
In the book, according to a statement from Knopf, Mr. Clinton says that the United States has lost its commitment to fiscal responsibility, shared prosperity and balanced growth, and has failed to properly invest in technology and infrastructure.
Knopf, part of Random House, plans an initial print run of 300,000 copies. A spokesman declined to disclose the advance.
Mr. Clinton set a publishing record of sorts with ''My Life,'' his best-selling autobiography, when he received an advance of more than $10 million, then believed to be the largest amount ever paid for a nonfiction book. ''My Life,'' a sprawling 957 pages, was published in June 2004 and sold 2.4 million copies in hardcover.
Knopf paid an advance of about $5 million for Mr. Clinton's ''Giving,'' a book on activism and service that was published in September 2007. It sold 215,000 copies in hardcover, according to Nielsen BookScan, which typically tracks 75 percent of retail printed sales.

HEADLINE: Mayor Insists City Needs Measure for Hailing Livery Cabs

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
With Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo expressing doubt about legislation allowing street hails of livery cabs in much of New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg vociferously defended the measure on Thursday as crucial to the city's economic well-being.
Responding to a question about the financial markets, Mr. Bloomberg said that he expected New York City to lose tax revenue as Wall Street profits fell, and that the state should allow the city to find other sources of revenue. 
''That's one of the reasons I've been urging the governor and working with him, and I think we'll get this done - I hope so, anyways - to expand taxi service,'' he said. ''For a start, you've got four and a half boroughs in the city that have no taxi service, which is really an outrage, and the tax revenues from selling more medallions would be something like a billion dollars into the city's budget. That will pay for an awful lot of teachers and cops and firefighters.''
Mr. Bloomberg wants the governor to sign a measure that would allow up to 30,000 livery cabs to be refitted to pick up street hails in Manhattan north of Central Park and in the other four boroughs. The measure was approved by the Legislature, but has not been forwarded to the governor for his formal consideration. Some advocates for the bill have suggested that the measure might need to be amended to address criticism from opponents.
At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Cuomo expressed concerns about the measure, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Josh Vlasto, said the governor ''has not taken a position.''
''We'll review the bill when we get it,'' Mr. Vlasto said.
Mr. Bloomberg praised Carl E. Heastie, the sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, and Karim Camara, the leader of the Assembly's Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus, who has strongly supported the measure.
''These guys understand just how serious it is to have communities that just do not have taxi service,'' he said. ''This has gone on for decades; it can't go on anymore,'' he continued, adding: ''And just think about a billion dollars towards meeting the expenses of the city without costing the taxpayers one penny, not one penny. More service, no expense, sounds like a win-win for everybody. So I think that's why it's going to get done.''
The mayor made the comments about livery cabs during a wide-ranging question-and-answer session at the Seward Park Library on the Lower East Side, where he announced that the city's libraries would be giving children and teenagers an amnesty period, through Oct. 31, to return overdue books without paying fines.
Mr. Bloomberg waxed nostalgic about his childhood love for the novel ''Johnny Tremain,'' and said that his mother, Charlotte R. Bloomberg, who died in June, had long insisted on borrowing books from the library, rather than letting him buy them for her. ''And we have not found any books at home that she did not return,'' he said.
After that reminiscence, his mood turned testier when he was asked about a recent article in The Daily News that reported that Robert K. Steel, the deputy mayor for economic development, was at his house in Greenwich, Conn., on a recent Sunday. The mayor has an executive order in place stipulating that all top officials, except those granted a waiver, live in the city. Since taking the job last year, Mr. Steel has rented an apartment in Chelsea, where he has said he spends weekdays.
''He moved into the city right away and lives in the city five days a week - what is your problem again?'' the mayor responded to the questioner.
''Why do you try to assassinate somebody?'' he said. ''He lives in the city, he pays his taxes in the city, he's complied with every single thing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Worker Aid Agreement Passes Senate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The Senate handed President Obama a victory on Thursday by passing a program to help workers displaced by foreign competition, paving the way for action on three long-delayed trade deals. 
The Senate voted to approve a bill containing a revamped Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which Mr. Obama had demanded as his price for sending free-trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress.
''Today's vote is a major victory for American workers and a key step forward in our efforts to approve the job-creating free-trade agreements,'' Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and head of the finance committee, said in a statement.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, urged Mr. Obama to now show some ''trust'' in Republicans by submitting the agreements to Congress before the House has voted on the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill -- a view that was echoed later by the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio.
The retraining and income assistance program, which dates back to 1962, was expanded in the 2009 stimulus bill to cover more workers and provide more generous health insurance benefits.
However, the expanded provisions expired at the beginning of this year, and Republicans bent on reducing government spending balked at renewing them.
The bill passed by the Senate renews many of the 2009 provisions through 2013, like covering service industry workers in addition to those in manufacturing.
But it reduces the number of weeks of income support to 117 from 156 in the 2009 law, with up to 13 additional weeks available only under certain circumstances.
It also scales back a tax credit to help unemployed workers pay for health insurance, and makes it harder for people to receive income assistance if they are not in a retraining program.
The package costs about $900 million over three years, compared with about $2.1 billion for the 2009 bill.
During Senate action, Democrats defeated several Republican attempts to further reduce program costs or explicitly tie the program to approval of the pending trade deals.

HEADLINE: A Private School With an Innovative Mission Chooses an Unconventional Leader

BYLINE: By RACHEL OHM and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Sitting amid unpacked boxes in his office overlooking Central Park this month, Damian J. Fernandez, the new head at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, took a moment to reflect on Felix Adler, the educator and social reformer who founded Fieldston in 1878 as a tuition-free school for workingmen's children.
''My job is about delivering the promise of Adler in the 21st century,'' Dr. Fernandez said. ''I'm Adler with an iPhone, iPad and Latino accent.''
After an unsettling and prolonged period without a permanent leader, the school has made a somewhat unconventional choice. If Adler had an innovative approach to education in the late 19th century -- he believed that diversity enhanced education, that ethics should be taught alongside academics and that children learned by doing, not listening -- then Dr. Fernandez may be a logical successor. 
His pedigree is distinctly not East Coast elite. Dr. Fernandez, 54, was born in Cuba and raised in Puerto Rico. He has never run a secondary school, and he last taught high school students more than 30 years ago, at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. His most recent job was provost at Purchase College, part of the State University of New York system.
''I'm definitely not a traditional candidate,'' Dr. Fernandez said, his brown eyes dancing behind horn-rimmed glasses.
He has vowed to stay for 9 or 10 years, a promise that was well received by the school community, which has had five heads since 2007, including interims; two expensive head-of-school searches in the past few years; and a string of other high-level departures.
Karen Sutton, a parent and a Fieldston alumna, said, ''It's kind of disconcerting when you are not clear of the direction of the school and there's not a permanent person in charge.''
Tracy Chutorian Semler, a trustee and the vice chairwoman of the search committee, said the group had printed T-shirts that said ''Survivor: The Head of School Search Edition.''
''Nobody likes change and transition,'' Ms. Semler said, ''but given the situation you are in, you do the best you can.''
Students who met with Dr. Fernandez last year said they admired his enthusiasm as well as his apparent commitment. ''We obviously haven't had a committed head of school before, and he seemed into it and dedicated,'' said Arabella Uhry, who is in the 10th grade. ''That convinced us.''
He plans to spend a year getting to know the faculty, parents and students, facilitating discussions rather than imposing his ideas (''They'd shoot me,'' he joked, referring to the faculty). But he has clear plans and goals.
Academically, he hopes to strengthen the foreign-language program, to start students earlier and require fluency. He wants to strengthen the high school science and math programs, he said, ''in a way that enhances creativity and problem solving,'' and bring ethics -- a core Fieldston subject -- ''back to its right fullness.''
''I don't buy this whole notion of two cultures, of an artistic and scientific culture, and the two shall never meet,'' he said. ''I believe the creative spirit is critical for posing questions, for the leeway to explore, and I think that the creative spirit is necessary for today's world, for the creative economies of the 21st century.''
Fieldston wanted a leader who embraced its mission -- ethical leadership and inclusion, along with academic excellence and community service. Ms. Semler, of the search committee, said Dr. Fernandez's references reflected that.
''The constant of people who worked for him and for whom he had worked was that he had a strong moral compass, the backbone to adhere to his moral compass,'' she said.
Other candidates had more experience running private schools that served kindergarten through 12th grade, she conceded. But Dr. Fernandez had a better mix of administrative heft and a progressive heart, she said.
In an interview before the start of school, Dr. Fernandez was polished and warm, exuding curiosity and confidence. He greeted a group of visiting reporters with, ''Are you ready to meet the funniest headmaster of a school you've ever met?'' and then dived into topics ranging from pedagogy to Oscar, his Irish setter (''He's so beautiful!'').
Growing up, Dr. Fernandez did not envision a future as a head of school. ''I wanted to be so many things,'' he recalled. ''I wanted to be a veterinarian. There was a point of time when I wanted to be a writer. And then I went to Princeton and studied political science, and I discovered I wanted power.''
He aspired to run a college and said he thought he was on track for such a position at Purchase. Colleagues there said his legacy was of fast-paced change and energy. One professor, Michelle Stewart, said he was a dynamic visionary who ''knows how to make things happen in a corporate structure.''
Dr. Fernandez helped create the School of Film and Media Studies at Purchase; Dr. Stewart is chairwoman of the department. Another professor, who asked not to be named since he knew Dr. Fernandez personally and had not had a chance to talk to him directly, said not everyone was on board with Dr. Fernandez's vision. ''He pushes change pretty quickly,'' the professor said. ''Whether that is the right thing is the question.''
The opportunity to take the helm at Fieldston, with 1,700 students, 2 campuses and a $65 million endowment, proved impossible to pass up. ''I probably wouldn't have explored this if it had been anywhere but Fieldston,'' he said. ''Knowledge without heart, to me, is not good enough. And I found the heart in these kids.''
Dr. Fernandez said he was determined to make Adler's vision for progressive and inclusive education relevant in 2011.
The school has made strides toward racial diversity. Thirty-six percent of kindergarten students at the Ethical Culture campus on the Upper West Side are children of color, as are 50 percent of kindergartners at Fieldston Lower, in Riverdale, the Bronx. But in contrast to its tuition-free early days, Fieldston now costs $37,825, about the same as other Manhattan private schools.
About one-fifth of the students receive financial aid (Fieldston gives a total of more than $10 million in aid), making socioeconomic diversity a continuing challenge.
Dr. Fernandez said he believed his background as a university administrator would help him. ''I think the new head of school needs to be a cheerleader, and also have the mind of a businessman but the heart of a teacher,'' he said.
Dr. Fernandez was born in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, where his mother was a schoolteacher and his father owned a food warehouse. In 1963 the family moved to Miami, then went to Puerto Rico, where Dr. Fernandez attended Mennonite and Jesuit schools.
In the summer before his senior year of high school, he set up a tutoring program for children in the slums of San Juan. He brought his fellow students to teach under the guidance of his high school principal, the Rev. Charlie Beirne. ''I think he saw in me something I hadn't seen in myself,'' he said. ''A leadership capacity.''
He attended Princeton on a scholarship and received a master's degree from the University of Florida and a Ph.D. from the University of Miami. His academic focus was Cuban politics. After a year teaching at Phillips Academy, he moved on to higher education, and in 2008 he became the provost and vice president for academic affairs at Purchase.
One day, he said, he would like to take a Fieldston high school class on a trip to Cuba, given improvements in the political climate. And he would love to teach again. One idea is a class he designed and taught at the university level: ''Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll, and International Relations.''
It is unclear what Felix Adler would have made of that.

HEADLINE: Republicans Attack on Handling of Stimulus Money and Green Jobs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The battle over Solyndra, the California solar equipment manufacturer that took $528 million in government loan guarantees and then declared bankruptcy, moved on to a second House committee on Thursday as Republicans broadened their attack on the Obama administration's management of stimulus money and its pursuit of alternative energy as a way to spur employment.
''A green jobs fueled recovery is a theory, and is yet unproven,'' declared the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, Darrell Issa, Republican of California. ''There is a lot more green, in the way of cash, and a lot less energy and jobs than anticipated.'' 
The title of the hearing was, ''How Obama's Green Energy Agenda is Killing Jobs,'' a title that one Democratic member, Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, complained was a ''raw partisan assertion that presupposes the answer.''
But in between rounds of jousting, the hearing sometimes touched on some of the difficulties of defining and measuring green jobs. Keith Hall, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which got money last year to start counting green jobs, testified that companies that produce both ''green and nongreen outputs'' had problems counting the green jobs.
Republican members of the committee and the Democratic witnesses, including Hilda L. Solis, the Secretary of Labor, tangled on whether, for example, a worker who was trained to drive a hybrid bus qualified as holding a green job.
''What makes driving a hybrid bus a green job and driving another bus that's not a hybrid bus not a green job?'' asked Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. ''Driving a bus is driving a bus, right?''
Ms. Solis replied, ''the vehicles that are built there are green buses, they are fuel efficient.''
Mr. Mack replied, ''but this is the bus driver. If I'm sitting in a chair that was made out of green material, does that make my job green?''
But further discussion clarified that the driver of the ordinary bus also had a ''green job,'' because all mass-transit workers fit the definition of a green job as they provided ''services that benefit the environment.''
Ms. Solis reviewed the status of a $500 million program financed under the stimulus bill to train workers for green jobs. About 52,000 people have been trained and the total will reach 96,000, she said.
But Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, pointed out that most of those trained already had jobs (''incumbent workers,'' the government calls them) and that only about 6,200 had gotten jobs classified as green, at a cost of roughly $80,000 per job. And some of the jobs, he said, were in overhead line construction and automotive technologies. ''These don't sound quite as green,'' he said.
Ms. Solis said giving new skills to people who already had jobs would help them keep their jobs and earn more money. She said in testimony that the country must ''out-educate, out-innovate, and out-build our global competitors.''
Like the Obama administration, the committee cited a close link between carbon dioxide emissions and economic health, but in the opposite direction. While President Obama has warned about the long-term threat of global warming and the need to wean the nation from fossil fuels, the committee's report said, ''by sacrificing domestic carbon-based resources upon the altar of an ill-fated ''green energy'' experiment, the president has put U.S. economic security in jeopardy and wasted billions in taxpayer money at a time when our fiscal health is in peril.''
But Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said that there was ''not one scintilla of evidence'' that green policies had cost any jobs.
The Obama administration was on the defensive well before the hearing began. It posted a video on the Energy Department's Web site, energy.gov, of a newly hired worker in a Michigan battery factory, built in part with a government grant. The worker, a middle-aged woman in safety glasses and a hair net and dressed in industrial coveralls, gets teary as she says, ''it took a long time'' to get a new job. Also on the page is a map showing where stimulus money was spent in search of a green economy.
The committee's Democratic minority circulated an article from Bloomberg News that quoted from two letters Mr. Issa wrote to the energy secretary, urging support for an electric car manufacturer and a battery manufacturer in his district. He wrote that the battery plant would create a ''green collar'' work force.
After the hearing, Mr. Issa said, ''members of Congress will always ask for money from whatever pot to help their constituents.'' But he had not asked for any shortcuts in the competition to find the best place for federal dollars, he said. Solyndra, he and other Republicans maintain, was chosen for the loan for political reasons.
Mr. Issa complained that ''green jobs'' effort was ''a political rallying cry aimed to unite environmentalists and union leaders'' to promote an ideological agenda.
''This would be O.K. if it produced the jobs, but it didn't,'' he said.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is supposed to produce a report on that question in March.

HEADLINE: Only Palms Are Swaying

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
Munching on a buttered bagel at a bookstore, Helen Wagner and her partner, Clifford Turkel, said they knew exactly why President Obama looked to be stumbling and sliding his way toward the election. 
But they also know there are no easy answers. It's true, they said: Mr. Obama needs to be more astute on Israel, and Jews in general are wary of his stance. Israel is his friend, and in a region soaked with enemies, friends should not be squandered, and yet a truce also is necessary. And, yes: The economy is reeling, people are livid, progress seems ephemeral, and yet Mr. Obama began his term with an outsize load of turmoil.
So will Ms. Wagner, a dynamic 86-year-old, and Mr. Turkel, a 77-year-old born in the Bronx, both Reform Jews, vote for the president again?
''Of course, of course,'' Ms. Wagner said.
''Absolutely,'' chimed in Mr. Turkel. Then he offered a dollop of advice. ''He should be more aggressive on his handling of the Republicans,'' he said. ''He should give them a little hell, the way Truman did.''
Outside supermarkets and restaurants, inside bookstores and candy shops, Jewish voters in this affluent yet diverse Jewish community in north Miami said they planned to mostly stay the course. If they did vote for Mr. Obama in 2008, many of them -- Reform and Conservative alike -- said they planned to do so again, although not quite as enthusiastically.
Those who did not vote for the president the last time -- mostly Orthodox, with a smattering of Conservatives like Jay Weinberg -- were more convinced than ever that they had made the right choice. ''He has thrown Israel under the bus,'' said Mr. Weinberg, 64, a former educator. ''What is he going to give them -- the Golan Heights, too?''
Renata Bloom, 73, a Conservative and a real estate agent who plans to vote for Mr. Obama, like last time, said the Arab Spring had frightened Jews and turned some against Mr. Obama. ''People are questioning him now,'' she said.
Not Holly Royce Ginsberg, 69, who described her support for the president as ''unshakable.'' A former teacher, dental hygienist, Playboy bunny and ''super liberal,'' Ms. Ginsberg said Mr. Obama had been ''handed a rotten bunch of fruit.'' She said that on the question of Israel, people just had a ''knee-jerk reaction.''
But Ruth Fertig, 81, standing near a kosher candy shop, said that while Israel was key, her criticism of Mr. Obama went beyond that: It's the economy, his lack of leadership, the people who surround him in Washington.
A retired New York City teacher, Ms. Fertig said that she had voted for him once, and that once was enough. She will probably stay home on Election Day.
Could she change her mind?
''I don't believe in miracles,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Throwing a Digital-Age Curveball

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
The hungry heart of ''Moneyball,'' a movie about baseball in the digital age, is a beautiful hard case named Billy Beane. Coiled yet cool, Billy has the liquid physical grace and bright eyes of a predator. He was built to win. Even his name, with its short syllabic bursts, sounds ready for ESPN exultations. That he's played by Brad Pitt giving the quintessential Brad Pitt performance just seals the deal. It didn't turn out that way, and in 2001 this high school star turned major-league washout was no longer a player but the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, the little team that could but didn't. 
Well, sometimes it did. In 2001 the A's actually finished second in the American League West, but that October, in the game that opens the movie, they lost the Division Series to the New York Yankees. The score was 5-3, but as numbers that flash across the screen suggest -- $114,457,768 vs. $39,722,689 -- that loss, in the final game of a five-game series, was nowhere near a humiliation. Based on Michael Lewis's nimble, joyously entertaining nonfiction chronicle of the Athletics' sprint toward the top despite the odds and dollar signs, ''Moneyball'' is an exuberant fictionalized look at how Mr. Beane helped transform the team, one of the poorest in baseball, into serious competition for the wealthiest franchises, mostly by ignoring everything he'd been taught about the game.
The old baseball knowledge, as more than a few earlier movies have taught, was built on rich whiffs of romance and new sod, and highly subjective ideas about what it takes to win, including looking right for the part, having a certain stance on the mound, even a good face. Early in ''Moneyball'' there's a funny scene of Billy (who of course has a great face), sitting around with his council of elders: the old-timers, mostly, who scour the country for the next big hope. The old men are jawing about the pluses and minuses of draft prospects, ticking off assets and defects but also body parts. At times they sound as if they're looking for Saturday night dates, not athletes.
Billy knows there's something wrong about this received wisdom (one scout insists that an ugly girlfriend means that a player doesn't have confidence), but he doesn't have the tools to fix the problem. He gets them when he meets Peter Brand (a just-right Jonah Hill), a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale and a big man's waddle. (The character is based on Mr. Beane's slim former assistant, the Harvard-educated Paul DePodesta, now the vice president for player development and amateur scouting for the New York Mets.) With his glasses and middle-management jackets, Peter looks like he should be crunching numbers at an accounting firm. But there's a baseball clutched in his hand and a love of the game tucked deep in his being right alongside a radical way of understanding baseball statistics.
Directed by Bennett Miller, from a sharp, sleek script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (and a story by Stan Chervin) that smartly borrows lines from Mr. Lewis's book as well as its giddy irreverence, ''Moneyball'' is a story about how Billy, with Peter's help and his laptop crammed with numbers, trades old knowledge for new. It's a story of baseball and bean counters, the hunt and the kill, yet while there are on-field scenes, the movie is less about the game as a pastime or passion or even a cruel capitalist sport than as a great epistemological problem. What is the question? Billy asks his bewildered scouts right before hiring Peter, a guy with a poster of Plato hanging above his bed.
Like ''The Social Network,'' which is about the creation of Facebook and yet so much more (it was also written by Mr. Sorkin) ''Moneyball'' is about a fundamental cultural shift and the rise of the information elite. Instead of going by instinct, Peter knows what he knows because he's a disciple of Bill James, a once-marginal figure who, starting in 1977, began publishing an abstract that offered a new, rationalized way of looking at the game. In a nutshell, Mr. James looked at baseball statistics in a different light, less by breaking the numbers down in another way but by seeing that what appeared to be objective facts, like fielding statistics, were, as he wrote, ''a record of opinions.'' And these numbers didn't just describe baseball; they gave the game its language, its ''fiction and drama and poetry.''
Like a linguist Mr. James studied that language, looked at its form, context, meaning, and called his new approach sabermetrics. Among other things he could see value in underappreciated, often underpaid and ignored players whom conventional thinkers saw as destined for the minors. In the movie Peter preaches this new gospel to Billy, who embraces it with born-again fervor, partly because it clarifies the mystery of why he never became the player he was drafted to be: he had the tools, as the scouts like to say, but they just didn't work in the majors. (In reality it was a former general manager of the A's, Sandy Alderson, now with the Mets, who introduced Mr. Beane to Mr. James's work.)
Mr. Miller, largely shaking off the official art-house pretensions of his breakout feature, ''Capote,'' takes all this seemingly dry, dusty, inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high. He still has his serious, or rather too-serious, side: he bookends the story with ophthalmologically close shots of Billy's eyes shining in the dark, as if soliciting you to peep into the windows of a soul that, as much as any man's or woman's can be revealed, emerges through the script and Mr. Pitt's fully inhabited, appealingly barbed performance. There are some overhead shots of the A's emerald field too, including one of a large American flag being unfurled, that feel like the efforts of a director needlessly looking for big symbolic moments, perhaps particularly post-Sept. 11.
He needn't have bothered. The movie and its meaning are already there, in the details (the ugly rooms, the uglier clothing), the performances and especially in the emphasis on process and how teams and players are built and broken, saved and discarded. What works in ''Moneyball'' is showing not telling: the scenes of men doing and being and sometimes failing, as in the interwoven flashbacks to the young Billy, played by Reed Thompson. There's an unnecessary Sorkin-sounding lecture toward the finish that explains what you already know; for the most part, though, the screenplay obscures huge chunks of exposition through the radio chatter of announcers and listeners. And it gives Mr. Pitt, who hurtles through the movie, a chance to scat like a juiced-up Ella Fitzgerald, working his phones and seemingly every other general manager in the country, as he transforms a new baseball philosophy into action.
It's hard to imagine anyone but Mr. Pitt in the role. He's relaxed yet edgy and sometimes unsettling, as in his testy exchanges, bristling with tamped-down fury, with the A's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman, wearing a head of peach fuzz and a scowl). Though Mr. Miller holds onto the romance of baseball that Mr. James and others helped strip away (this is, after all, a tale of winners and losers), Billy doesn't really change: he just becomes his perfect self. When he first goes after Peter, he moves in like a shark. Initially Peter can't look Billy in the face, and when they talk, Peter keeps dropping his eyes, like the plain girl who can't believe the hottest guy at school is even talking to her. But he is.
''Moneyball'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Locker room chatter and cussing.

HEADLINE: For Restless Lawmakers, Accord Proves Elusive

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Again?
The reigning theory in this town has been that both Republicans and Democrats, worn down and exhausted by the summer debt ceiling standoff and the ensuing collapse of their poll numbers, had returned to the Capitol eager to play nice.
But this week's nasty showdown over a short-term spending bill demonstrates that the economy may be too weak, lawmakers too restless and the 2012 election too close for even a brief period of bipartisan comity. 
A small but determined group of conservative Republicans on Wednesday again defied their leaders and brought down a bill to keep the federal lights on after Sept. 30 because it did not meet their demands to make deeper spending cuts.
House Democrats fed up by the Republicans' past refusal to compromise and outraged over the handling of disaster aid (something some Republicans also did not like) responded with their own hard-line tactics, refusing to supply Republican leaders with the votes they needed to pass the must-pass measure, leaving the government on the brink of yet another shutdown.
At the same time, the new deficit reduction committee has begun its deliberations with a deepening sentiment inside and outside of Congress that it faces a formidable challenge in meeting its goal of finding $1.2 trillion or more in deficit reduction that could satisfy both parties and President Obama.
Republican leaders, both in Congress and on the presidential campaign, are engaging in the harshest criticism of the Federal Reserve in a generation, with some Republican leaders writing a letter to complain that the Fed's efforts were potentially harming the economy, and some Democrats in the House arguing, in turn, that the Fed is not doing enough to aid a fiscal reboot.
Further, Mr. Obama has adopted a newly combative tone that suggests that he too has grown weary of past efforts to compromise, an aggressive approach that his party on Capitol Hill seems eager to emulate.
The picture coming out of Washington cannot be building confidence in the minds of the country's voters, consumers and business operators even as the economy teeters.
''It's safe to conclude that few Americans, let alone people observing from abroad, have any confidence in the nation's government institutions to resolve the pressing issues at hand,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. ''If Congress and the president have trouble dealing with routine decisions, it is safe to assume that any exceptional challenge will turn into a political firestorm.''
On Thursday stocks fell in Europe and on Wall Street, where equities were down more than 3 percent at the markets' close, even after the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday of a plan to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
The new Congressional conflict over a relatively small sum of money and policy differences underscores that for all of the Democrats' acquiescences this summer to Republican demands -- and Republican desires to portray themselves as warmer and fuzzier before voters -- what divides the two parties on the Hill is far deeper than either's ability to inspire national confidence.
''What people can't deal with is this week-by-week jerking around,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington. ''It is absolutely impossible for businesses to do any planning when you don't know if you'll have the money to turn the lights on next week.''
House Speaker John A. Boehner on Thursday acknowledged the difficulty he has managing his own rank and file. ''At the end of the day, every member has an obligation to represent their constituents,'' he told reporters. ''I'm going to respect that right of our members to do that.''
Republicans for their part think that if they hold strong to the principles that they believe got them elected -- budget cutting and deficit reduction -- any hardball tactics will be rewarded.
''I know this is going to sound really partisan,'' said Representative Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona. ''But I think if people think about the possibility of the re-election of President Obama,'' they will ignore the rancor and pull the lever for Republicans again, he said.
But there seems little end to the use of routine bills as objects of controversy and procedural maneuvers as a means of obstruction. Either way, both sides admit, it is just plain embarrassing.
''I think the American people are just horrified at the ineptitude of Congress in doing the basic things that we have to do,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. ''Funding of the government is the No. 1 priority of Congress.''
Were there any signs of bipartisan simpatico? ''I am still looking,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''I haven't found it yet.''
The pique of both sides was evident late Thursday in actions likely to ring a bell for any parent who has refereed a fight between siblings. House Republicans opted to add a provision to cut $100 million from a loan program that had provided millions of dollars to Solyndra, a solar energy company praised by the Obama administration that later went bankrupt.
Senate Democrats responded with equal measure of emotion, deciding in an angry caucus meeting that they would defy the House any way they could -- rejecting even measures they had considered as inching toward reason just 24 hours prior.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Tries to Regroup on Spending Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Friday passed a new version of a stopgap spending bill about 30 hours after rejecting a nearly identical version of the legislation, intended to keep the government open and to provide assistance to victims of natural disasters.
The vote was 219 to 203.
House Republican leaders, trying to recover from a humiliating political defeat, made one change in the bill. The new version would offset more of the cost of disaster assistance by rescinding $100 million from an Energy Department program that guaranteed a loan for Solyndra, the solar equipment manufacturer that filed recently for bankruptcy protection.
The bill, to finance government operations for seven weeks after the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, faces problems in the Senate, where Democrats want to spend more, without cutting other programs to offset the cost.
''The House bill is not an honest effort at compromise,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''It fails to provide the relief that our fellow Americans need as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the wake of floods, wildfires and hurricanes, and it will be rejected by the Senate.'' 
Mr. Reid said he had hoped House Republicans would move toward the middle. ''Instead,'' he said, ''they moved even further toward the Tea Party.''
If the Senate balks, it is not clear how the two houses would overcome the resulting impasse and avert a government shutdown. Most federal agencies need money to continue operations beyond Oct. 1. The disaster relief fund of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is running short of money. And lawmakers were planning to leave town for a recess scheduled for next week.
House Republican leaders, who lost control of their caucus on Wednesday, worked furiously on Thursday to round up votes for the revised version of the stopgap bill.
They prevailed by halving the number of defections from their ranks. On Wednesday, 48 Republicans voted against the bill. On Friday, just 24 voted no.
Representative David Dreier, Republican of California and chairman of the Rules Committee, said it had been ''an ugly, messy, difficult process.'' The purpose of the change, he said, was to prevent ''another boondoggle like Solyndra.''
The new version of the House bill, like the original, would partially offset the cost of disaster assistance by cutting a separate Energy Department loan program that promotes development of energy-efficient cars. This cut infuriates Democrats in the House and the Senate, who say the program is creating thousands of jobs at automakers and auto parts suppliers.
''The bill was wrong yesterday, the bill is wrong today,'' Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said Thursday night on the House floor. ''Virtually nothing has changed.''
The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, said Republicans were offering ''the same old warmed-over stew that was rejected'' on Wednesday.
Speaker John A. Boehner had solicited the views of his colleagues at a meeting of the House Republican Conference, where lawmakers expressed frustration at the setback they suffered Wednesday on the bill to provide $3.65 billion in disaster relief.
In an effort to win over fiscal conservatives, Mr. Boehner told members of his caucus that the bill defeated Wednesday was the best deal they were going to get.
Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who voted for the original bill, said: ''If you are a conservative, it just gets worse from here. The Senate wants to spend a lot more.''
The Senate last week approved a bill that includes $6.9 billion of disaster assistance, nearly twice as much as the House bill.
Four dozen House Republicans defied party leaders and voted against the original bill. Many said they wanted deeper cuts in overall spending.
Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said he had to stay true to his constituents.
''We promised that we would make serious cuts,'' Mr. Gohmert said as he left the party caucus on Thursday. ''We have not made serious cuts. I have to see serious cuts so I can keep my commitment to the people who elected me.''
Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said it was imperative for the House to act swiftly, to address the pressing needs of disaster victims and to minimize the political risks to Republicans.
''Delay puts this on the Democrats' playing field,'' Mr. King said. ''If there is a threat of a government shutdown or if there is a threat of people not getting disaster assistance, we are on the defense.''
Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican if Missouri, said, ''Disaster assistance is absolutely critical for my district,'' which suffered extensive flood damage earlier this year.
Mr. Boehner defended his decision to let the House vote Wednesday.
''I've always believed in allowing the House to work its will,'' Mr. Borehner said Thursday. ''I understood what the risk was yesterday. But why not put the bill on the floor and let the members speak? And they did.''
Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, said Republicans were engaged in ''a cynical ploy to set disaster victims against unemployed auto workers'' who could benefit from the clean car program.
The fight over the stopgap spending bill came as a powerful House-Senate committee weighed options for sweeping changes in individual and corporate taxes.
Committee members from both parties said they wanted to lower business tax rates and eliminate or curtail some tax deductions and other tax breaks used by corporations.
''We don't collect as much revenue as we should, due in part to the complex, inefficient and loophole-ridden tax code we've got,'' said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. ''Most economists agree that fundamental corporate tax reform is going to produce more economic growth and therefore, as a consequence, more revenues.''
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said, ''I think we should lower our corporate rates very significantly.'' But he said such changes would cause ''big dislocations,'' as ''some industries would be hurt a lot'' while others would benefit.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and co-chairwoman of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, said, ''I think we all agree that our corporate tax code needs substantial reform.''
But she said ''it's important to coordinate reforms for individual and corporate taxes'' because many businesses operate as ''pass-through entities'' and their income shows up on individual income tax returns.
How lawmakers could agree on huge changes in the tax code -- when they could not agree on a bill to finance the government for just seven weeks -- remained a mystery.

HEADLINE: An Enthusiasm Cools Down

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
For Melissa Balaban, 46, talking about President Obama feels like criticizing a close friend. She knows he could do better, she said, she really wants him to do better, but she will stick with him even in difficult times. 
Ms. Balaban is the executive director of Ikar, an independent Jewish religious community in west Los Angeles. Dozens of its members knocked on doors and helped raise money for Mr. Obama in 2008.
Hillel Tigay, 42, the music director of the community, said the sense he had was not so much one of ''buyer's remorse,'' but more like a ''Sunday hangover.'' He has been disappointed in the way the president has spoken about Israel, but he cannot see voting for a Republican.
They are frustrated, demoralized even, that Mr. Obama has not been able to effect more change since taking office. Several said this was the first president they had voted for with excitement, hoping he would lead with a moral vision. Instead, they said, he has been forced to focus on tactical details, and not very effectively.
But those in the small group who gathered Thursday morning at the rabbi's office to chat about the president said they would vote for him again, regardless of their disappointment. ''Absolutely,'' said Rabbi Sharon Brous, their 37-year-old spiritual leader, her voice rising. ''Everything is at stake.''
These are not single-issue voters. They are looking for candidates who support gay marriage and, save for the one Republican in the group, liberal economic policies. They see themselves as Zionists, but are not necessarily enamored of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.
''There's a sense that if you are not with him, you are anti-Israel and not to be trusted,'' said Adam Wergeles, 46, a lawyer and Ms. Balaban's husband. ''That's absurd and dangerous.''
Everyone there favors a two-state solution. But while Mr. Tigay said he found Mr. Obama's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday reassuring because it emphasized America's commitment to Israel, Mr. Wergeles said he saw it as capitulating to American political pressure, and not focusing enough on practical solutions.
Most frustrating, Rabbi Brous said, is how Republican leaders have tried to capitalize on the debate over Israel for political gain. ''They're touching on all the vulnerabilities of the Jewish community by distortion,'' she said.
Yoni Fife, 31, a lawyer and the lone Republican and McCain voter in the group, finds himself unmoved by the current Republican candidates, who he said were ''way away'' from where most American Jews were on social policies.
But as Ms. Balaban put it, Jews were not just a solid voting bloc in 2008. They were a ''solid cheering section.''
''What concerns me most is that people are just not going to care enough to vote,'' Mr. Wergeles said. ''The loss of that kind of passion could really hurt Obama.''

HEADLINE: Perry and Romney Rain Attacks at Republican Debate

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- In their third debate in as many weeks, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas engaged in a sometimes heated back and forth over immigration, health care and entitlements, their rivalry dominating a stage that included seven other candidates struggling to catch up in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry arrived here with a strategic imperative to challenge the other's consistency and conservative credentials. The tensions only grew as the night wore on, to the point where Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, joked that Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry were at risk of bludgeoning each other to death.
Still, after two hours of dueling it was unclear whether Mr. Perry had achieved his goal of knocking Mr. Romney off his fairly unruffled stride. It was similarly not certain that Mr. Romney had made headway in knocking Mr. Perry down a few pegs in what has been a relatively strong opening to his young campaign. 
Mr. Romney sought to capitalize on the concern among many conservatives about Mr. Perry's position on illegal immigration, harshly criticizing the Texas policy that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities.
''That just doesn't make sense to me,'' Mr. Romney said, noting that illegal immigrants receive as much as $22,000 a year in tuition breaks that out-of-state citizens do not get.
Offering an impassioned defense of that policy -- and receiving boos from a segment of the audience -- Mr. Perry did not back down, saying, ''If you say that we should not educate children that have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought here by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.''
The debate, held at the Orange County Convention Center and sponsored by Fox News, Google and the Republican Party of Florida, featured robust audience participation and questions submitted via YouTube. The 5,000 people there responded loudly at times, including boos during a question from a gay solider about the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy regarding gay and lesbian service members.
And while the Fox News moderators sought to engage all of the candidates, the exchanges between Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry -- standing side by side -- overshadowed the others.
At one point, Mr. Romney cited a passage from Mr. Perry's book ''Fed Up!'' and said the Texas governor had suggested that state or local governments be allowed to run their own Social Security programs. He accused Mr. Perry of running away from his own words.
''There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business,'' Mr. Romney said. ''You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.''
Mr. Perry hit back by accusing Mr. Romney of editing his book ''No Apologies'' between printings to remove a passage saying that the health care plan he instituted in Massachusetts -- considered a model for President Obama's overhaul -- was good for the nation.
''You said that it was exactly what the American people needed to have -- that's Romneycare -- given to them as you had in Massachusetts,'' he said.
Mr. Romney responded by saying: ''I actually wrote my book, and in my book I said no such thing. And it's fine for you to retreat from your own words in your own book, but please don't try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book.''
As the exchanged continued, Mr. Perry, standing to Mr. Romney's right, joked, ''It's kind of badminton'' and swung his arm. But later he set any joking aside, saying of Mr. Romney, ''I think Americans don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with.''
Mr. Romney had managed to emerge relatively unharmed from the past few debates, and the pressure was on Mr. Perry to change that. If Mr. Perry's key line was meant to be a solid punch to the jaw, he seemed to rush it and stumble a bit.
''Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of -- against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment? Was it -- was before -- he was before the social programs from the standpoint of -- he was for standing up for Roe v. Wade before he was against first -- Roe v. Wade?'' he said. ''I mean we'll wait until tomorrow to see which Mitt Romney we're really talking to tonight.''
A late attempt at humor seemed to go astray as well, when Mr. Perry was asked which of the candidates on stage he would pick as his vice-presidential nominee. Speaking of Herman Cain, a former business executive, Mr. Perry said he would ''mate him up'' with the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to make a perfect political partner. Mock wincing, Mr. Romney remarked coolly that the night had produced ''a couple of images I'm going to have a hard time getting out of my mind.''
Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, appeared to express frustration that the night had been so much about Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry. He noted that four years ago the two supposed Republican front-runners were former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and former Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
''They seemed to disappear altogether,'' he said, ''I can't remember where they went.''
For his part, Mr. Huntsman helped point up significant differences in the candidate's views of American involvement abroad. ''After 10 years of fighting the war on terror, people are ready to bring our troops home from Afghanistan,'' Mr. Huntsman said. ''This country has given its all.''
Former Senator Rick Santorum sharply disagreed, saying: ''We should be fighting wars to win, not fighting wars for politics.'' Mr. Santorum chastised several of his rivals at different points in the evening and challenged their conservative credentials.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has struggled to break through at the debates, but she took a question from moderators that she might have wanted to avoid.
She was asked why, in attacking Mr. Perry for requiring that sixth-grade girls take a vaccine against a virus linked to cervical cancer, she wrongly asserted that the vaccine could cause mental retardation. Ms. Bachmann responded that she was merely relating a story a mother had told her, and she again noted that Mr. Perry's former chief of staff had been a lobbyist for the vaccine's maker, Merck.
That created another opening for Mr. Perry to paint himself as a compassionate conservative, saying, ''I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had Stage 4 cervical cancer.''
Mr. Gingrich chided the moderators for some of their questions and sought to turn the conversation to a serious of discussion of policy. He previewed his plan to outline a 21st-century ''Contract With America,'' the document that he used to win the House majority in the 1990s.
''It's going to be far bolder, far deeper, far more profound than what we did in 1994,'' he said.
Gary E. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor who has been excluded from the last three debates, delighted the crowd with a line criticizing Mr. Obama's economic plan: ''My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than the president.''

HEADLINE: Harsh Words From Turkey About Israel, and From Iran About United States

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- Evidently heedless of American attempts to engineer a thaw in Turkish-Israeli relations, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey used his appearance before the annual General Assembly on Thursday to enumerate a long list of grievances with Israel, a former regional ally.
Mr. Erdogan was the second major Middle Eastern leader addressing the General Assembly, with the widespread focus on the region's most intractable problem, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, due to culminate Friday with speeches by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority. 
Representatives of the so-called quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- were still trying late Thursday to reach an agreement on a statement about moving peace negotiations forward, intended to counterbalance the controversial proposal for United Nations membership that Mr. Abbas has vowed to present. The future of the Quartet could be at risk, some diplomats suggested, with the Americans and the Europeans, close to an agreement, ready to abandon the other two members and issue a statement by themselves. It could go down to the very moment after the Netanyahu and Abbas speeches, the diplomats said.
At the General Assembly, a couple of hours before Mr. Erdogan spoke, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, delivered one of his characteristic anti-Western broadsides, embroidered with tinges of religious mysticism. He blamed the United States, Israel and Europe for the global recession and a list of other ills.
He also suggested that the American military's killing of Osama bin Laden last May and the disposal of his body at sea were part of a dark conspiracy to conceal the real perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's remarks provoked what has become a ritual large-scale walkout of delegations, led by the United States.
Mr. Erdogan, describing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a ''bleeding wound'' that the international community can no longer accept, accused Israel of thwarting all attempts to solve the problem. From nuclear weapons to control of the occupied territories to humanitarian aid, Mr. Erdogan said, Israel has contradicted the wishes and norms of the rest of the world.
''If you want to send a box of tomatoes to Palestine, this is subject to approval from Israel, and I don't think that is humanitarian,'' Mr. Erdogan said, suggesting that the new spirit of change in the Middle East meant Israel could no longer continue to foster strife.
The Turkish leader repeated a drumbeat of accusations against the Israelis that he has leveled for months, and there was no immediate reaction from Israel.
The tension is rooted in differences over the Gaza Strip, particularly a May 2010 raid by the Israeli military on a Turkish-organized flotilla trying to run the Gaza blockade, which left eight Turks and a Turkish-American dead. Turkey rejected a United Nations report that found the blockade legal but said Israel had used excessive force.
Mr. Erdogan's veiled threats to take action against joint efforts by Israel and Cyprus over gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean did elicit a response from Demetris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, divided into hostile Turkish and Greek halves. He called Turkish naval maneuvers in the area ''provocative and a real danger for further complications in the region.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad, appearing before the General Assembly for the seventh year in a row, said poverty, homelessness and denial of basic rights were traceable to ''greed for materialism in the United States and Europe.''
Iran has been estranged from the United States since the Islamic Revolution more than 30 years ago, and Mr. Ahmadinejad's speech has become something of a signature event at the annual session. There were no surprises in either his criticisms or his singular interpretation of world events.
As he has done in previous speeches, Mr. Ahmadinejad raised questions about the Holocaust, blaming the West for using it as an excuse for unwavering support for Israel and for the oppression of the Palestinian people. ''They threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and Sept. 11 with sanctions and military action?'' he said.
By the time he got to that line in his 30-minute speech, the low-level American and European diplomats who had been there were no longer around.
The United States delegation was the first to leave when Mr. Ahmadinejad referred to the Sept. 11 attacks as ''mysterious'' and suggested that the decision to kill Bin Laden, instead of bringing him to trial, was intended to bury the truth of who sent the planes to attack New York and Washington. ''Is there any classified material secret that must remain a secret?'' he said.
After the Europeans walked out, the hall, not terribly full in the first place, was mostly empty. Oddly, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain, whose government has repeatedly blamed Iran rather than domestic ills for inflaming the Shiite population there, stuck around.
The United States quickly condemned the speech, as did many other Western governments and nongovernmental organizations. ''Mr. Ahmadinejad had a chance to address his own people's aspirations for freedom and dignity, but instead he again turned to abhorrent anti-Semitic slurs and despicable conspiracy theories,'' said Mark Kornblau, the spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations.
The Iranian leader, whose previous visits to New York have been contentious, generated less interest this year. Though he did inspire protests outside the United Nations and his Midtown Manhattan hotel, his power clashes at home with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have cast some doubt over the extent of his authority.
That doubt, in turn, has made him personally a less threatening figure, despite significant international concerns about important issues like the possibility that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans to Reopen Plant, and Town Smiles

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley reported from Spring Hill, Tenn., and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

 BODY:
SPRING HILL, Tenn. -- When General Motors stopped building cars here two years ago, as the auto industry hit rock bottom and tens of thousands of assembly-line jobs evaporated nationwide, Chad Poynor packed up and moved to Michigan to keep working at another plant.
Mr. Poynor said he made the nine-hour drive back to Tennessee to see his wife and three children 24 times in the first year alone. ''I'd go back tomorrow if I could,'' Mr. Poynor said Wednesday after finishing his overnight shift in Lansing, Mich.
He and hundreds of other autoworkers may get that chance.
In a glimmer of light in a mostly downbeat economy, G.M. and the United Automobile Workers union have agreed to give the plant here a second chance as part of a tentative new labor contract. It is highly unusual for an automaker to bring jobs back to a factory all but left for dead, and several G.M. plants, including Spring Hill, will be adding work that had been headed to Mexico. 
''I actually have a smile on my face today,'' Mike O'Rourke, the president of U.A.W. Local 1853 in Spring Hill, said after learning the details of the contract. ''It was very much gloom and doom. I lost all my hair and gained 50 pounds.''
The resurrection of Spring Hill would be another milestone in the fortunes of the domestic auto industry and, in particular, G.M.'s comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009. The promise in the new contract of 6,400 jobs over the next four years, including 1,700 here, is being seen as a vote of confidence that autoworkers in the United States, even unionized ones, can compete with lower-wage nations.
Some of the jobs here will go to current G.M. workers at full wages of $28 an hour, but many of the workers will be hired on G.M.'s second-tier pay scale, which would start around $15 an hour in the new contract.
''We're bringing back a lot of work that left this country,'' the U.A.W.'s president, Bob King, said of the contract, which is subject to ratification by G.M.'s 48,500 workers in the United States.
Perhaps nothing better symbolizes the ragged journey of Detroit's Big Three in recent decades than the Spring Hill plant, which was built in the 1980s as the launching pad for G.M.'s highly promoted Saturn division.
In the 1990s, thousands of Saturn owners traveled here for ''homecoming'' parties to celebrate their bond with the vehicles and the workers who made them. The plant became known to TV viewers after G.M. hired the advertising agency famous for creating President Ronald Reagan's upbeat ''Morning in America'' re-election ads. Commercials featured the plant and its workers with the slogan, ''A different kind of company, a different kind of car.''
But the Saturn brand never lived up to its promise and is now a casualty of G.M.'s bankruptcy. The only work being done at the plant here, 30 miles south of Nashville, is a much smaller operation making engines. James L. Bailey, the mayor of Maury County, which includes Spring Hill, described the past two years as ''a time of trauma.''
Unemployment in the county rose as high as 17 percent after the plant closed; the rate is now about 13 percent. In nearby Columbia, where many G.M. workers lived, downtown storefronts emptied and homes went into foreclosure. The Santa Fe Cattle Company, a steakhouse with a U.A.W. flag in its foyer, closed, and this year's graduating high school class lost 85 students after the plant shut down.
''They bought a lot of things, they did a lot of things,'' Mr. Bailey, who works out of a cramped, century-old courthouse in Columbia's town square, said of G.M. workers. ''When they went away, it affected a lot of businesses here.''
G.M. declined to publicly comment on the Spring Hill decision. The company has avoided discussing specific terms of the agreement until it is approved by members.
People with knowledge of the negotiations said that union leaders pressed hard in the final stages of the talks for Spring Hill to be reopened. Michael Robinet, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive, said the company saw an opportunity to make inroads with the U.A.W. while bringing back a facility at a relatively low cost.
''The Tier 2 workers definitely changed the economics of the plant,'' he said. ''It's definitely a win for the union. I can't recall the last time a plant of this size was brought back after it was closed.''
How quickly workers may be able to return to Spring Hill is not known, and for some the situation is complicated by relocation agreements they signed requiring them to spend a certain length of time at another plant. Union officials said that about 600 jobs would be created by the end of next year, followed by 1,100 more in 2013. G.M. said it planned to invest $419 million in the plant so that it could build two new midsize vehicles.
The sense of anticipation in Spring Hill, whose population increased twentyfold in the two decades after G.M. began making Saturns amid rolling farmland near a Civil War battleground, was palpable this week.
''I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now,'' said Todd Horton, a G.M. worker who stayed after being laid off in the hopes of getting called back. Mr. Horton, a married father of two, turned down a transfer offer two weeks ago, even though supplemental unemployment benefits from the company were about to run out and there had been no word that the plant would reopen.
''My hope is just that the economy can sustain it and they can follow through with the plans,'' said Mr. Horton, whose final responsibility in the plant's training department was helping his coworkers move elsewhere.
Many of them are in Lansing, Mich., having followed production of the last vehicle built in Spring Hill, the Chevrolet Traverse Crossover. Glenn Tucker, who is a little more than a year away from being able to retire from G.M. with full benefits, is waiting to learn how quickly he can come back. His wife, Danean, stayed in Tennessee to keep her job managing a restaurant and so that their son could graduate from high school.
''There was no hope for most of us that it would ever reopen,'' Mrs. Tucker said.
Said Mr. O'Rourke, the local union official, ''All you got to do is drive around any big city -- Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago -- and you can see a lot of empty factories that have never reopened.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Decline Day After Fed Set a Stimulus

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Matthew Saltmarsh and Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A day after the Federal Reserve announced another measure to bolster the economy, world financial markets tumbled Thursday on fears that governments around the globe collectively still were not doing enough to stimulate growth.
Several factors contributed to the heightened gloom, including new signs of political paralysis in Washington, Europe's continued failure to resolve its debt crisis and indications of economic stress in developing countries that had been strong.
While the Fed's measures to lower interest rates could increase growth a bit, some economists worry that the scale of the problems call for more stimulus efforts globally, but other countries are not cooperating.
With investors so nervous, the markets may rebound over the next few days, as volatility and big swings of 3 and 4 percent have become more common. On Thursday a downcast mood appeared across the board. Stocks plunged about 5 percent across Europe and in Hong Kong, and more than 3 percent in the United States. 
''Today, we really seem to be stuck in a negative spiral,'' said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank in Dusseldorf. ''Investors just want to keep their exposure low and watch from the sidelines.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index flirted with a bear market, generally a 20 percent decline from a recent peak, but recovered in the final hour and closed down 17 percent to 1129.56 from a late April high. The MSCI All-Country World Index, a grouping of 45 countries, however, fell more than 20 percent, pushing it into bear territory.
Financial markets beyond stocks also reflected growing anxiety. Commodities like oil fell, and even gold dropped sharply in price. As investors continued to seek havens, United States bond prices soared for a fifth consecutive trading session, pushing the 10-year benchmark yield to a new low of 1.72 percent.
The cost of insuring the government bonds of Western European nations against default rose to a record high. The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian government debt also rose, pointing to lingering worries about debt levels in the euro currency region. Despite steps taken last week by central banks to help banks in Europe borrow dollars, there were signs of rising borrowing costs for these institutions.
It is not only economies in the United States and Europe that are faltering. Financial markets in developing countries are showing levels of stress last seen during the financial crisis, a senior World Bank official said Thursday.
The official said that problems in the developed world increasingly were shaking the economies of developing nations, not because of a drop in trade flows or capital investment, but because a sense of gloom was spreading around the world, shaking the confidence of domestic investors.
''We are increasingly worried about the possibility of global contagion,'' said the official, who shared the World Bank's assessment of the global situation on condition of anonymity.
''At some point the global mood changes. Just like the realization that even big banks are vulnerable'' shook world markets in 2008, the official said, ''the idea that even the U.S. is vulnerable means that many investors have lost an anchor.''
The market downturn was set in motion on Wednesday after the Fed announced that a complete economic recovery was still years away, adding that the United States economy has ''significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.''
The Fed also announced it would buy long-term Treasury bonds and sell short-term bonds to help stimulate lending and growth.
Some analysts were disappointed the Fed did not act more forcefully and they had little faith that policy tools like lower interest rates were encouraging consumers and businesses to spend more or to start creating jobs.
''The initial and follow-up reaction from the equity market is likely the realization that the Fed has little left to offer, that Washington is a mess, and their only hope is to 'ride it out' over a long period of time,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
The policy conundrum is illustrated by the fact that despite lower rates people are not taking up new mortgages or refinancing existing ones. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages dropped after the Fed's announcement, falling to 4.05 percent from 4.21 percent on Wednesday, according to HSH.com, which publishes mortgage and consumer loan information.
But the number of new mortgage applications is running at the lowest level since August 1995, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance, which monitors mortgage activity, said the volume of new mortgages this year would probably be about $1 trillion, down from $1.5 trillion in 2010, which was already anemic.
Companies, too, are holding back on spending even though they have built cash reserves to 6 percent of their total assets, the highest level since at least 1952, according to Credit Suisse.
The proportion of United States companies' cash flow being spent on new equipment and other investments has not rebounded since the financial crisis and is stuck at the lowest level since the late 1950s, said Doug Cliggott, an analyst at Credit Suisse. A survey by the bank of 60 large American companies published Thursday found that two-fifths actually planned to cut spending in the next six months.
In what may be a bellwether trend, FedEx, the logistics company, on Thursday cut its expectations for earnings for the entire fiscal year, citing a slowdown in global growth and sending its stock down 8 percent.
The markets on Thursday homed in on a darkening economic outlook in the euro zone and concerns that China's growth rate would start to slow. A closely watched gauge of private sector activity from the euro zone -- the composite purchasing managers' index -- fell to 49.2 points in September from 50.7 in August, according to Markit, a financial data provider.
Analysts said the fall in the euro area index reflected a combination of slowing global growth, significant belt-tightening in the euro area and growing concern about the escalating sovereign debt crisis.
A review on Thursday by Standard & Poor's showed that the market capitalization of publicly traded equities worldwide had fallen by more than 17 percent, or $9.2 trillion, since July 1.
In the United States, without greater stimulus, the dollar headed sharply higher on Thursday, catching investors off guard and causing rapid selling of investment positions, like gold, that had relied on a cheaper currency.
''I think that the market had performed so bullishly across all the precious metals that a correction was probably in the offing,'' said James Steel, an analyst at HSBC. ''And it may have been used as a convenient place for some profit-taking.''
When the price of gold moved so quickly below $1,800, he added, it encouraged further selling. With sustained losses in stocks, investors could be using gold as it was meant to be used -- to raise cash.
''This might sound perverse but gold is actually fulfilling its traditional role allowing you to raise cash in uncertain times,'' Mr. Steel said.

HEADLINE: Spain's Banking Mess

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
It's not just sovereign debt.
Just when markets were focused on the risks of a Greek default and the possibility of contagion to other countries, Spain's central bank reported this week that things were getting worse for that country's banks -- but not because they held a lot of Greek debt or bonds issued by other troubled European economies.
The problem, instead, is the same old one. With Spain's economy weak and home prices falling, bad loans are growing. And the central bank thinks things are getting worse.
In a surprisingly frank presentation to investors in London on Tuesday, Jose Maria Roldan, the Bank of Spain's director general of banking regulation, said that Spanish land prices had fallen about 30 percent from the 2007 peak, adjusted for inflation, and that home prices were off about 22 percent. ''In both cases, we expect further corrections in the years to come,'' he said. For land prices, he said, the bank's ''baseline scenario'' was that prices would fall to little more than half of the peak level. The ''adverse scenario'' indicated that the decline could be significantly worse. 
That was a significant change from a presentation he made in February. Then, with home prices down about 18 percent from the peak, he argued that the decline was similar to past cyclical downturns and that prices were likely to begin rising soon.
Remarkably enough, collapsing home prices have not left Spanish banks holding large amounts of bad mortgage loans, thanks largely to the fact the Spanish mortgage market operated during the boom in far different ways than the American market.
But if lending to home buyers was conducted in a far more prudent manner than it was in the United States, lending to real estate developers and construction companies was, if anything, more irresponsible. The higher land prices went, the more eager the banks were to push out loans.
The story of how Spain's banks got into the mess -- and the way its mess differs from that of American banks -- show that it is impossible for banks to walk away from a collapsing bubble in real estate. It also shows that the structure of mortgage markets can make a major difference in how a collapse plays out.
The figures released by the central bank this week showed that by the middle of this year, 17 percent of Spanish bank loans to construction companies and real estate developers were troubled -- or ''doubtful,'' the term favored by the central bank. That figure has been rising rapidly, reflecting the deterioration in real estate values.
When the financial crisis first broke out, in 2008 and 2009, it appeared that Spanish banks were in a better position than most, in part because of regulation that had kept the big banks from making some of the mistakes others made.
But it turned out that smaller Spanish savings banks were heavily exposed to a real estate market that had outpaced even the United States' market for a time during the first decade of this century. That market continued to rise after the American housing market stopped climbing.
The Bank of Spain has created a program to force mergers of the smaller banks and to bring in better management. It has put about 11 billion euros into the banks to recapitalize them, and is putting in another 15 billion euros in a process that is supposed to be completed by the end of this month, said Antonio Garcia Pascual, the chief Southern European economist for Barclays Capital. But, he added, ''our estimate is that the overall number needed is closer to 50 billion euros.''
The banks are bleeding from loans secured by raw real estate, and from loans for construction. The pain is made worse because such lending soared during the property boom. It is those loans that are now devastating bank balance sheets, as developers who borrowed to build offices, stores and neighborhoods saw demand dry up and now cannot pay the banks back.
Other corporate loans are also showing weakness, as would be expected when unemployment is above 20 percent and not expected to improve for at least two years, but less than 5 percent of those loans are said to be doubtful. There are also signs of trouble in car loans and other loans to individuals.
And then there is the mortgage market. Perhaps the most remarkable statistic in the reports released by the Bank of Spain this week was the low percentage of mortgage loans that appeared to be in trouble. It is just 2.5 percent, half a percentage point less than in mid-2009. If American mortgages were doing as well, there would be far less angst here.
How can that be?
The most important fact may be that refinancing is very unusual in Spain. They are generally unnecessary; since mortgage loans are made at variable rates, there is no need to take out a new loan if rates are declining. The absence of refinancing, along with the absence of home equity lines of credit, meant homeowners could not take out cash to spend on other things.
As a result, if you bought a house in Spain a few years before the peak, you still have equity in the home, even with prices down. If you lose your job and can no longer afford the payments, you can sell the home and emerge with something.
That would also be true in the United States if mortgages were for only house purchases. But in the housing cycle that led to the recent bubble -- unlike previous cycles -- it was far easier for homeowners to cash in their equity and use the money for whatever they wanted. So some people who have been in the same home for decades are desperately under water.
There were other differences as well. There were no ''originate-to-distribute'' strategies in the mortgage markets, so the loans were not bundled into securities to be sold to foolish investors.
Banks that made the loans expected to profit if -- and only if -- they were repaid. There were few loans to investors who planned to rent or flip homes. Moreover, mortgage loans in Spain are recourse. Buyers cannot walk away if they have other assets, as they can in some American states.
The Bank of Spain has said it is emphasizing transparency in seeking to fix the banking system, and that it is willing to be flexible as conditions change. Its openness may be winning over investors. No one likes to hear bad news, but it is reassuring to believe that the news is accurate, rather than sugar-coated.
I have not seen other banking regulators distributing charts forecasting that the biggest problem facing their banks was likely to get significantly worse, as the Bank of Spain did this week. It has been more common for regulators to seek to weaken accounting rules, on the theory that it will help confidence if banks seem to be strong, regardless of the facts. That is an attitude that has backfired, particularly after the European stress tests chose to assume that all sovereign debt was safe.
Rather than denigrate markets as being foolishly negative -- as some other European officials have done recently -- Mr. Roldan cited market trends, including the rising cost of credit-default swaps on the banks, as evidence of the problems confronting them.
It is a refreshing attitude in a regulator. When, and if, Mr. Roldan ever starts to say the worst is over, it will be a lot easier to believe him.

HEADLINE: A Gold Rush Wanes As Hedge Funds Sell

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Is the smart money fleeing gold?
For the better part of the last two years, some of the world's biggest hedge funds have been piling into gold, betting the precious metal would provide an effective hedge against inflation or be a safer place to park cash as equity markets around the world stumbled.
But to the surprise of many investors, when equity markets across the globe tumbled once again on Thursday, gold moved sharply lower as well. 
Gold futures for September delivery fell $66.30, or 3.7 percent, to $1,739.20 an ounce in New York. It was quite a turnabout for the metal, which has been soaring in recent months amid the turbulent stock markets.
Hedge funds, which have been ratcheting down their positions in gold futures since early August, were quickly named as the culprits in the latest sell-off.
Some traders said that hedge funds were beginning to unwind, or close out, what has been a very popular and profitable trade for the last 18 months as they bet the dollar would fall and that gold would rise. In the last month alone, the euro has fallen nearly 4 percent against the dollar amid worries about the European debt crisis.
The sell-off in gold was part of a broader move in the markets that had investors shifting away from perceived riskier assets, like commodities, and into the dollar in reaction to the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday of its new stimulus program.
In addition, the Fed said that there were ''significant downside risks'' to the United States economy, which sent several commodities, including crude oil and copper, tumbling on Thursday on fears of a global slowdown in demand.
Other market participants said hedge funds were selling their positions in gold to raise cash to meet increased capital demands for their borrowings from Wall Street banks as the assets they have put up as collateral, like other commodities or stocks, have declined sharply in value.
''On the one hand you have a lot of strength in the U.S. dollar, historically gold and the dollar do trade inversely,'' said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''The hedge funds are long gold and they need to raise cash and it looks like they are definitely selling some gold.''
Others say some hedge funds may be selling to meet redemption requests from investors who have been spooked by the recent market volatility and fear a repeat of the problems of late 2008.
''A lot of investors are waking up to the realization that something is off. We've seen Goldman Sachs close its flagship fund, legendary hedge funds are down sharply, and I suspect we're going to see significant withdrawals from some hedge funds this year,'' said Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist of the investment advisory firm Pension Partners.
''The tendency for individual hedge funds or anybody is to sell winners before they sell losers. What's been one of the few winners this year? It's been gold,'' Mr. Gayed added.
Still, some are not yet ready to call the end of the gold rush. Even with the pullback, gold remains one of the most profitable investments this year with a gain of 22 percent.
Some strategists have even predicted that gold will reach a record of above $2,300, which it hit during the early 1980s when adjusted for inflation and translated into current dollars. Likewise, the world's largest exchange-traded gold fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, fell 2.6 percent on Thursday, but remains up 22 percent for the year.
Gold, whether through futures contracts or via exchange-traded funds, has been a popular investment among some of the world's largest hedge funds. One of the best known ''gold bugs'' is John A. Paulson, whose firm, Paulson & Company, is the biggest shareholder in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. But many other hedge funds have embraced the metal as well.
After peaking in early August, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure in the gold futures market, according to Mary Ann Bartels, the head of United States technical analysis for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
''A lot of speculators were very long in July,'' Ms. Bartels said. ''But they've been taking it down ever since.''

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Spies Are Tied To Raid On U.S. Embassy

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and JANE PERLEZ; Elisabeth Bumiller reported from Washington, and Jane Perlez from Islamabad, Pakistan. Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nation's top military official said Thursday that Pakistan's spy agency played a direct role in supporting the insurgents who carried out the deadly attack on the American Embassy in Kabul last week. It was the most serious charge that the United States has leveled against Pakistan in the decade that America has been at war in Afghanistan.
In comments that were the first to directly link the spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, with an assault on the United States, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went further than any other American official in blaming the ISI for undermining the American effort in Afghanistan. His remarks were certain to further fray America's shaky relationship with Pakistan, a nominal ally.
The United States has long said that Pakistan's intelligence agency supports the Haqqani network, based in Pakistan's tribal areas, as a way to extend Pakistani influence in Afghanistan. But Admiral Mullen made clear that he believed that the support extended to increasingly high-profile attacks in Afghanistan aimed directly at the United States. 
These included a truck bombing at a NATO outpost south of Kabul on Sept. 10, which killed at least five people and wounded 77 coalition soldiers -- one of the worst tolls for foreign troops in a single attack in the war -- as well as the embassy assault that killed 16 Afghan police officers and civilians.
''With ISI support, Haqqani operatives planned and conducted that truck bomb attack, as well as the assault on our embassy,'' Admiral Mullen said in a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''We also have credible evidence that they were behind the June 28th attack against the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a host of other smaller but effective operations.'' In short, he said, ''the Haqqani network acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.'' His remarks were part of a deliberate effort by American officials to ratchet up pressure on Pakistan and perhaps pave the way for more American drone strikes or even cross-border raids into Pakistan to root out insurgents from their havens. American military officials refused to discuss what steps they were prepared to take, although Admiral Mullen's statement made clear that taking on the Haqqanis had become an urgent priority.
On Thursday, Rehman Malik, Pakistan's interior minister, rejected accusations by the United States of ISI involvement in the attacks in Afghanistan. ''If you say that it is ISI involved in that attack, I categorically deny it,'' he said in an interview with Reuters. ''We have no such policy to attack or aid attack through Pakistani forces or through any Pakistani assistance.'' He also said his government would ''not allow'' an American operation aimed at the Haqqani network in North Waziristan, a remote part of Pakistan's lawless tribal region.
Mr. Malik seemed to indicate that American officials had threatened on Tuesday in meetings in Washington with the head of the ISI, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, that American troops were prepared to cross the border from Afghanistan to attack Haqqani militants. An American official would say only that David H. Petraeus, the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told General Pasha that the C.I.A. would continue its campaign of drone strikes against the Haqqanis in Pakistan and pursue them in Afghanistan.
''The Pakistan nation will not allow the boots on our ground, never,'' Mr. Malik said in an interview with Reuters. ''Our government is already cooperating with the U.S. -- but they also must respect our sovereignty.''
A senior American official said Thursday that no decisions had been made on actions that the Obama administration might take against the Haqqanis.
American covert raids into Pakistan are rare -- only two, including the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, have become public -- but some American intelligence officials argue that more aggressive ground raids in Pakistan are necessary.
The United States gives Pakistan more than $2 billion in security assistance annually, although this summer the Obama administration decided to suspend or in some cases cancel about a third of that aid this year. Altogether, about $800 million in military aid and equipment could be affected.
The suspension was intended to chasten Pakistan for expelling American military trainers this year and to press its army to fight militants more effectively. The decision was made after the Bin Laden raid in Pakistan, where the leader of Al Qaeda had been living comfortably near a top military academy.
Admiral Mullen is to retire at the end of this month, and coming from him the statements carried exceptional weight. For years he has been the American military official leading the effort to improve cooperation with the Pakistanis. But relations have reached a nadir since the Bin Laden raid. Pakistani officials were angered that they had not been told of the raid in advance, and questions remain about whether Pakistani intelligence was sheltering Bin Laden.
Although American military officials believe that the ISI is in many cases directing the Haqqani network to attack United States forces in Afghanistan, they did not go so far as to say on Thursday that the ISI specifically directed the assault on the American Embassy. American military officials did not describe the kind of support they believe the ISI gave the Haqqani network for the embassy attack, and also offered no evidence for their claim. In July 2008, the United States was able to determine that the ISI was behind the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul based on intercepted communications of ISI officers.
Admiral Mullen testified alongside Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, who told the committee that the attack on the embassy and the assassination this week of Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader of Afghanistan's High Peace Council and a former Afghan president, were ''a sign of weakness in the insurgency.'' He cast the attacks as signs that the Taliban had shifted to high-profile targets in an effort to disrupt the progress that the American military had made.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on Mr. Rabbani, which has dealt a potentially devastating blow to efforts to negotiate a peace with the Taliban.
In his remarks to the committee, Admiral Mullen voiced a stern warning to Pakistani officials, who he said were undermining their own interests as well as American interests in the region.
''They may believe that by using these proxies, they are hedging their bets or redressing what they feel is an imbalance in regional power,'' he said. ''But in reality, they have already lost that bet. By exporting violence, they've eroded their internal security and their position in the region. They have undermined their international credibility and threatened their economic well-being.''
He also said he did not think he had wasted his time by putting so much effort into improving ties with Pakistan's government.
''I've done this because I believe that a flawed and difficult relationship is better than no relationship at all,'' he said. ''Some may argue I've wasted my time, that Pakistan is no closer to us than before, and may now have drifted even further away. I disagree. Military cooperation again is warming.''
Online Correction: September 22, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article included a photo caption that mistakenly referred to Leon E. Panetta as the C.I.A. director. He is the secretary of defense. Additionally, the incorrect rank was given for Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha. He is not a major general.

HEADLINE: The Social Contract

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
This week President Obama said the obvious: that wealthy Americans, many of whom pay remarkably little in taxes, should bear part of the cost of reducing the long-run budget deficit. And Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan responded with shrieks of ''class warfare.''
It was, of course, nothing of the sort. On the contrary, it's people like Mr. Ryan, who want to exempt the very rich from bearing any of the burden of making our finances sustainable, who are waging class war. 
As background, it helps to know what has been happening to incomes over the past three decades. Detailed estimates from the Congressional Budget Office -- which only go up to 2005, but the basic picture surely hasn't changed -- show that between 1979 and 2005 the inflation-adjusted income of families in the middle of the income distribution rose 21 percent. That's growth, but it's slow, especially compared with the 100 percent rise in median income over a generation after World War II.
Meanwhile, over the same period, the income of the very rich, the top 100th of 1 percent of the income distribution, rose by 480 percent. No, that isn't a misprint. In 2005 dollars, the average annual income of that group rose from $4.2 million to $24.3 million.
So do the wealthy look to you like the victims of class warfare?
To be fair, there is argument about the extent to which government policy was responsible for the spectacular disparity in income growth. What we know for sure, however, is that policy has consistently tilted to the advantage of the wealthy as opposed to the middle class.
Some of the most important aspects of that tilt involved such things as the sustained attack on organized labor and financial deregulation, which created huge fortunes even as it paved the way for economic disaster. For today, however, let's focus just on taxes.
The budget office's numbers show that the federal tax burden has fallen for all income classes, which itself runs counter to the rhetoric you hear from the usual suspects. But that burden has fallen much more, as a percentage of income, for the wealthy. Partly this reflects big cuts in top income tax rates, but, beyond that, there has been a major shift of taxation away from wealth and toward work: tax rates on corporate profits, capital gains and dividends have all fallen, while the payroll tax -- the main tax paid by most workers -- has gone up.
And one consequence of the shift of taxation away from wealth and toward work is the creation of many situations in which -- just as Warren Buffett and Mr. Obama say -- people with multimillion-dollar incomes, who typically derive much of that income from capital gains and other sources that face low taxes, end up paying a lower overall tax rate than middle-class workers. And we're not talking about a few exceptional cases.
According to new estimates by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one-fourth of those with incomes of more than $1 million a year pay income and payroll tax of 12.6 percent of their income or less, putting their tax burden below that of many in the middle class.
Now, I know how the right will respond to these facts: with misleading statistics and dubious moral claims.
On one side, we have the claim that the rising share of taxes paid by the rich shows that their burden is rising, not falling. To point out the obvious, the rich are paying more taxes because they're much richer than they used to be. When middle-class incomes barely grow while the incomes of the wealthiest rise by a factor of six, how could the tax share of the rich not go up, even if their tax rate is falling?
On the other side, we have the claim that the rich have the right to keep their money -- which misses the point that all of us live in and benefit from being part of a larger society.
Elizabeth Warren, the financial reformer who is now running for the United States Senate in Massachusetts, recently made some eloquent remarks to this effect that are, rightly, getting a lot of attention. ''There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody,'' she declared, pointing out that the rich can only get rich thanks to the ''social contract'' that provides a decent, functioning society in which they can prosper.
Which brings us back to those cries of ''class warfare.''
Republicans claim to be deeply worried by budget deficits. Indeed, Mr. Ryan has called the deficit an ''existential threat'' to America. Yet they are insisting that the wealthy -- who presumably have as much of a stake as everyone else in the nation's future -- should not be called upon to play any role in warding off that existential threat.
Well, that amounts to a demand that a small number of very lucky people be exempted from the social contract that applies to everyone else. And that, in case you're wondering, is what real class warfare looks like.

HEADLINE: The Fed Defies the G.O.P.: Left to Republican leaders, the economy would be far worse off than it is even now

 BODY:
Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, showed courage facing down powerful Republicans on Wednesday and pressing forward with his efforts to spur economic growth by pushing down long-term interest rates to lower the borrowing costs of businesses and families. 
Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail are now steadfastly opposing every government effort to pull the economy from the mire. There is no economic sense or logic to their position, which makes it look as if they want to stall the economy for the 2012 election.
The modest economic recovery that started last year is petering out. Job growth has stalled; consumer and business confidence have plummeted; the housing market is moribund. If anything, the Fed's plan is timid. It will sell $400 billion in short-term Treasury securities to buy an equal amount of long term bonds, hoping to reduce long-term interest rates and give businesses the incentive to borrow and invest. And it will keep buying mortgages.
But interest rates can't go much lower. Before the Fed's announcement, the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds was below 2 percent. Businesses are not investing because they don't have customers; and the housing market is hamstrung by tight lending standards.
Fed policy should be more aggressive -- buying bonds on a larger scale. It can print money at will to do so, pouring cash into the economy to encourage businesses to invest. The Fed's efforts may not be the best way to help the weak economy. More stimulus spending by the Obama administration would be much more effective. But the country would be worse off without the Fed's actions. Republicans should pass Mr. Obama's jobs program and should be encouraging Fed intervention.
Instead, on Monday, the top four Republicans in Congress sent a letter urging Mr. Bernanke to refrain from further bond purchases. It claimed that prior Fed efforts had neither created jobs nor assisted the economic recovery, and then it contradicted itself by saying that Fed actions would weaken the dollar and promote consumer borrowing, both of which tend to boost growth.
The Republican presidential candidates have nothing constructive to add. On Monday, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas attacked Mr. Obama's plan to raise $1.5 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade because it ''penalizes investment when it is needed most.'' A few weeks earlier, he branded Mr. Bernanke a traitor for trying to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate investment.
The weak economy calls for urgent action. The most effective answer is more robust stimulus -- bigger payroll tax breaks, more infrastructure investment, bigger transfers to states and cash-strapped families -- and more help for debt-choked homeowners. The only things standing in the way are Republicans with narrow political aims.

HEADLINE: Populist Candidate Wins Zambian Presidency

BYLINE: SARAH MASLIN NIR


HIGHLIGHT: The opposition leader in Zambia, Michael Sata, who is known as King Cobra for his aggressive tactics and silver-tonged rhetoric, was elected president, defeating the incumbent candidate whose party had been in power for two decades. 

 BODY:
The opposition leader in Zambia, Michael Sata, who is known as King Cobra for his aggressive tactics and silver-tonged rhetoric, was elected president, defeating the incumbent candidate whose party had been in power for two decades, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Sata, the leader of the Patriotic Front party, won 43 percent of the votes counted so far, or about 1.2 million votes, according to the chairwoman of the Electoral Commission, Ireen Mambilima, who spoke to reporters in Lusaka, the country's capital. The incumbent, Rupiah Banda, who has been president since Levy Mwanawasa died in office three years ago, garnered 36 percent of the vote. Eight other candidates were also defeated. Mr. Sata had run for president three times previously.
The election was held on Sept. 20, and delays in counting the vote and announcing the winner led to outbursts of violence in the northern Copperbelt mining regions, where least two people are confirmed to have been killed, according to the BBC. Some in Lusaka fled for fear of violence, the site Zambian Watchdog reports. As of publication, votes from several counties had still not yet been tabulated, but Mr. Sata's lead is a sufficiently large chunk of the total votes to guarantee his win, officials said. The results of a concurrent parliamentary election have not yet been released.
A video on YouTube from the user hlihli said to be from the Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka, showed people celebrating Mr. Sata's victory in the street with the chant, "Sata! Let's go!"
Zambia is among the poorest of the world's countries, and while Mr. Banda and Mr. Mwanawasa's party is credited in part for instrumental gains in economic growth -- 6 percent a year since Mr. Banda took office, according to Bloomberg -- much of those gains ended up in the pockets of an already wealthy class as well as foreign investors from countries like China, Lebanon and India. Mr. Sata's populist rhetoric over the years had called for routing these foreign investors and specifically suggested expelling the Chinese, who not only make up a sizable portion of business owners in Lusaka, but also own much of the copper mining industry, which is among Zambia's most lucrative natural resources.
A report by Bloomberg noted the impact Mr. Sata's election is already having on investors in the copper industry, where shares in mining companies with stakes in Zambian copper faltered as the election results rolled in.
"An upset by Sata will likely see a more resource nationalist policy for the mining sector, with potential tax hikes and greater government equity shares," Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, managing director of the New York-based DaMina Advisors, a frontier-market risk adviser, wrote in a report to clients before the election results were known.
"While Banda's more genteel personality sits quite well with the growing upper-middle class, Sata's more pugnacious campaign style appeals strongly to the disillusioned bulk of unemployed youth and lower middle class salaried government workers," he said.

HEADLINE: Hey, Where'd Everybody Go?

BYLINE: BRUCE BUSCHEL


HIGHLIGHT: Yes, summer's really over for a restaurant in the Hamptons. 

 BODY:
It is ebb tide in the Hamptons. Families are returning to the city or suburb whence they came, and their children are busy with play dates and soccer games and piano practice. The locals are glad to reclaim the roads and beaches, enjoying a solitude warmer than the autumn ocean. September and October may be the most beautiful months in the Hamptons -- or the world -- with pastel skies, open tennis courts, and still, starry nights. As a resident, this precious season makes for smooth sailing; as a restaurant owner, one needs a fancy flutter kick to keep afloat. 
We toyed with the idea of introducing Sunday Brunch and Vegetarian Monday and Lobster Wednesday. Each one would require prices lower than our weekend $68 prix fixe, but money was not the trigger -- we wanted to keep the restaurant humming, the staff employed and the word-of-mouth awatering. When we put all of the notions down on paper, it appeared more like a maze than a menu. Our collective heads were spinning. Even in an area accustomed to different nights dedicated to different deals, we were just trying too hard.
So we settled on Sunday Lobster Dinner, from 4 to 8 p.m., to attract families and folks on their way back to the city as well as all the regulars who love to dine at 7 and 7:30. The prix fixe would drop to $55, with a choice of appetizer, oneof three lobster entrees, and dessert. Again, money was not the trigger: because of the prep time and pricing, which gets steeper in the off-season, lobster is about the least economical dish we serve, along with Long Island duck.
Before christening the idea, we had to do some research. Were lobsters available, were they good, were they affordable, were they sustainable? First stop, Blue Ocean Institute. Headquartered in Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, the institute is the leading expert on all things marine on the East Coast. Whole Foods follows and distributes its guide to sustainable fish in each store.
According to the guide, American Lobster (Homarus americanus) has a light green light, indicating something just shy of perfect sustainability:
This Species is Wild Caught and sometimes known as Canadian Lobster, Maine Lobster, Atlantic Lobster.
American Lobsters, found from Newfoundland to North Carolina, are a long-lived species and an important commercial fishery. Landings of American Lobsters have increased greatly during the last decade and most populations have stable abundance. The American Lobster fishery is well managed in both U.S and Canadian waters 
Not quite satisfied, cognizant of the ever shifting exigencies of ocean life, Chef Isidori did more reading, talked to fishermen and purveyors, and then got in touch with Carl Safina, co-founder of Blue Ocean and a respected marine biologist who has authored a series of excellent books. Mr. Safina responded the same day by e-mail:
"The trapping, local or otherwise, is not in my opinion hurting lobsters. Warming waters seem to be hurting them and killed them wholesale in L.I. Sound in the late 1990s. I don't think you need to worry, local or otherwise, about American Lobsters from a buyer's or chef's standpoint ..."
Mr. Safina was referring to three days in 1999 when 90 percent of the lobsters of Long Island Sound were wiped out. Some suspect it was global warming that raised the deep water temperature two degrees; others say it was pesticides flushed by Hurricane Floyd into the Sound. In any case, lobstering here has never been the same. A fisherman who landed 400 pounds a day in the mid-'90s is lucky to haul in a quarter of that today. Many have stopped trying. A few claim to be witnessing a mild comeback.
We sent an e-mail to 500 addresses we have collected:
It is true that more lobsters are caught in the summer than winter, but that is only because the demand is higher and the fishing easier. During the winter months, lobsters move further offshore, requiring boats to travel greater distances, and deal with harsher conditions. But lobsters are trapped throughout the year, and many fishermen and chefs think the colder the water, the better the meat.
Southfork Kitchen starts Sunday Lobsters this week. It is a $55 three-course prix fixe that features three kinds of lobsters:
Spicy Lobster "Arrabiatta" with Green Thumb Chilies over Pappardelle Pasta

Thank you and take care.
A few folks wrote back to have their names removed from the list. Another few asked if the lobsters were local.
We also advertised lobster night in Dan's Paper and The Southampton Press. One sixth of a page in each. We wanted to surprise no one with our prix fixe or our treatment of lobster -- nothing broiled and buttered -- so the ad was the menu verbatim. We did the same on Facebook and added the details to our Web site.
Last Friday night, we entertained 75 guests. Saturday night, 95 guests. For Sunday Lobster Dinner, eight people showed up. That's eight. An ironic homophone with ate. Four of them complained about the limited menu and the other four were Chef Isidori's relatives.
Still, we are not quite ready to cry uncle.

HEADLINE: Making the Case for Detroit's Future

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Dave Bing, on a trip to New York, sketches his city's progress and challenges for a group whose members assess the likelihood that state and local governments can pay their debts. 

 BODY:
It's far too early to say Detroit is on the way back; its property values are still falling and its debt is still rated as speculative. But as he approaches the midpoint of a four-year term, Mayor Dave Bing is pointing to signs that the city's breathtaking decline may have bottomed out.
A few big companies, like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, General Motors and Quicken Loans, have agreed to move several thousand employees downtown, and more are expected to follow. Whole Foods and two new supermarket chains are setting up shop, so the new workers can get food nearby. There is not enough housing for them yet in Detroit's ravaged inner neighborhoods, but building-permit issuing is up.
City income-tax revenue also appears to be creeping up this year, after several years of decline. And while property tax revenue is still sinking, along with property values, the decline has slowed, according to data released by Mayor Bing on Thursday.
He was in New York City to address the Municipal Analysts Group of New York, an organization whose members assess the likelihood that states and local governments can pay their debts. The mayor attracted a capacity crowd because Detroit's problems are extreme, and previous administrations had a history of delaying and withholding data that analysts required, prompting them to downgrade its credit.
Currently, Detroit is the only major American city whose credit is below investment grade. It also has several derivatives contracts that call for it to make cash payments to counterparties if its rating falls further. The payments would range into the hundreds of millions of dollars and Detroit does not have that much available cash.
Mr. Bing said he had not come to New York to push for a higher credit rating. And if he wanted to dazzle the analysts with lists of achievements, he did not show it.

For seemingly every silver lining he cited, he could also name a cloud. Crime statistics had fallen under his administration - all except for homicide, which rose this year. Labor talks have started this month, with the prospect of savings - but there are 48 unions to deal with. There are those thousands of new workers for downtown Detroit, but the challenge of housing them.
"We don't want to fool ourselves into thinking we have crossed any threshold," Mayor Bing said. Detroit's problems are so large that it will take longer than four years to fix them, he said, adding, "People are asking me already, are you going to run again? And I want to make clear, right here, yes, I am."
Mr. Bing, a former basketball star with the Detroit Pistons who later built an auto-parts manufacturing business, became mayor by winning a special election in May 2009, to complete the term of the previous mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick. Mr. Kilpatrick was forced to leave office during a scandal over his romantic relationship with his chief of staff, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four months in the Wayne County jail.
"I inherited a $330 million accumulated deficit," Mr. Bing told the analysts. "Needless to say, we were bankrupt."
Residents disheartened by Mr. Kilpatrick's failings seemed to see Mr. Bing as an outsider who might bring change, and re-elected him in a regular election that November.
Not long after he began a full term, data from the Census Bureau showed the city was living through a collapse of historic proportions: It had lost 25 percent of its population over the previous decade, more than any other American city above 100,000 people, aside from New Orleans, which lost 29 percent after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Those who left were generally those with the means to move, the mayor said. Those who remained were generally the poorest, and the least able to pay all the bills left over from better times.
The biggest bill is for the retirement benefits Detroit promised city workers back when the bargaining successes of the United Auto Workers set the scale for other local workers. Those promises must be kept, but the tax base that was supposed to support them has been decimated. The city work force is shrinking too. Currently, for every dollar Detroit spends on its payroll, it spends an additional $1.08 on pensions and health care, Mr. Bing said.
Mr. Bing said he thought public employees' unions might be willing to make concessions because they saw the U.A.W. do so during the recent federally-led reorganizations in Chapter 11 of General Motors and Chrysler.
Michigan does not generally permit its cities to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9. But it does allow for the appointment of an emergency financial manager, whose powers to renegotiate labor contracts were expanded this year.
"I don't want an emergency financial manager to be called in," Mr. Bing said. "However, it is an option."

HEADLINE: A Glimpse Into the Lesser Known

BYLINE: ERIC WILSON


HIGHLIGHT: While New York and London have built reputations for discovering new talent, Milan's fashion calendar is dominated by what you could describe as a council of village elders, leaving little room for upstarts to be noticed. 

 BODY:
The fashionable Italians pressing against the entrance of a building on the Via Sant'Andrea in Milan's designer shopping district Thursday night were not pushing and shoving their way in to see a Versace show, nor that of Armani or Dolce & Gabbana. They wanted to see Angelos Bratis and Stella Jean, and nearly a dozen designers whose names are largely unrecognizable.
While New York and London have built reputations for discovering new talent, making their Fashion Weeks more exciting, Milan's fashion calendar is dominated by what you could describe as a council of village elders, leaving little room for upstarts to be noticed. That's starting to change, season by season, with events like Who Is On Next?, a talent scouting contest sponsored by the trade group Altaroma and Italian Vogue. Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, Gabriele Colangelo and Albino D'Amato are a few of the designers who have gone on to greater roles in the industry since the event was started in 2005.
That is the same year that this season's winner, Mr. Bratis, started his business in his native Greece. He makes minimalist evening gowns, mostly in silk, with details that are based on the folded peplums of Greek antiquity. "But he does it in a very modern way," said Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue.
Mr. Bratis was standing next to a rack of his gowns, including a gray one with a draped neck and large blue stars sewn on its sides for luck.
"I started in Greece, but I decided to move to Rome last year because of the economic crisis," he said.
Things in Italy haven't been looking so good, either.
"I think it's following me," he said.
Ms. Sozzani arrived with Anna Wintour, her Vogue counterpart in America, and the two made their way through the collections, trailed by several video cameras both professional and cell. Executives from Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue were browsing the collections as well, while you could hear eager designers saying things like: "I took all the colors of my collection from Facebook and Twitter," and "We were inspired by alchemy, turning poor materials into rich ones."
This was curious, since quite a few of the collections looked a lot alike. Minimalism clearly holds an appeal to the younger set, even with the team of Francesco Ferrari and Tomaso Anfossi, who met while working at the very maximal collection Dsquared. Their simple sportswear had a nice light touch, like a pale blue blouse cropped and gathered with a bit of elastic at the waist.
The wild pairings of Haitian prints with men's dress shirt fabrics in the dresses of Stella Jean, the runner up, stood out. Ms. Jean, who was born in Rome to an Italian father and Haitian mother, showed a long mermaid skirt made of Haitian textiles, worn with a red pinstripe wrap shirt.
As Terron Schaefer, the chief creative officer of Saks who was on the jury for the contest, passed by Ms. Jean's booth, she seized the opportunity.
"Did you see my new things?" she said. "I have bathing suits, too."
"So chic," he said.

HEADLINE: City's Top Lawyer Details Payouts of $561 Million in Lawsuits

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: Michael A. Cardozo, said the laws on tort claims should be changed to protect the government; the Manhattan district attorney discusses drug prosecutions; and a partnership with lawyers in Panama. 

 BODY:
The city's top lawyer has called for changes to laws in civil cases that he said often allow plaintiffs to be compensated too generously for claims that they bring against the city.
Speaking to the Citizens Budget Commission on Thursday morning, Michael A. Cardozo, New York City's corporation counsel, called for state tort-law reform, saying that the city paid out more than half a billion dollars in lawsuits in the past fiscal year.
"In a time of financial crisis and budgetary cuts, $561 million is not just a huge number," he said. "It represents an unacceptable trade-off in favor of individual plaintiffs at the expense of providing needed services to New Yorkers."
The problematic tort laws, Mr. Cardozo said, include a requirement that the city pay damages even when the plaintiff was primarily at fault for the accident. He highlighted other provisions like the lack of a cap on awards for pain and suffering and an allowance of 9 percent interest on judgments.
Although the city has had to pay out plenty of money in lawsuits, Mr. Cardozo also pointed to the city's own use of lawsuits to generate revenue, as well as defenses that have helped the city to protect its finances.
The city, for example, won a $104 million verdict against Exxon Mobil for allowing a gasoline additive to infect groundwater in Queens, Mr. Cardozo said. It also won $9.5 million from Amtrak for failing to reimburse the city for the cost of fixing two bridges, he said, and $8 million from the state for improperly charging the city for Medicaid expenditures. His office also successfully defended the city against claims from plaintiffs seeking $300 million in tax refunds, Mr. Cardozo said.
Washington Heights Drug Forum
The battle against illegal drugs on city streets should not end with the arrest and prosecution of the peddlers and traffickers, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said on Thursday. It should continue by providing cultural and educational opportunities for young people living in troubled neighborhoods, he said.
"After dismantling gangs and drug-trafficking operations, we must remain engaged and work with the community to make sure that young people stay on the right path," the district attorney said.
Mr. Vance's remarks came at a forum he hosted in Washington Heights alongside Gil Kerlikowske, the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Mr. Vance praised law enforcement for the sharp decrease in drug crimes in Washington Heights over the past decade.
The police precincts that oversee the neighborhood have seen major declines in drug-related arrests since 2000, Mr. Vance said. In the 33rd Precinct there was a 60 percent decrease; in the 34th Precinct the drop was 52 percent.
"We must use that success not as a cause to rest," Mr. Vance said, "but as a road map to push forward."
New York-Panama Legal Partnership
The New York State Bar Association and the Panama Bar Association (El Colegio Nacional de Abogados de Panama) have agreed to partner in training and other efforts to promote the profession.
The two associations on Friday released a memorandum of understanding that outlines several areas in which the two organizations will work together and allow members of one group to join in the other's activities.
The contract calls for numerous partnerships in addition to legal training, like professional ethics discussions and identifying trends in the profession and their respective court systems.

HEADLINE: Big Deal | Reading, Writing and Real Estate

BYLINE: SARAH KERSHAW


HIGHLIGHT: All but 9 of the 74 units at PS90, a mixed-income condominium, have sold. 

 BODY:
It was unusual in the post-housing-crash world that Michael L. Breaux fell for an apartment at PS90, a once-decrepit public school in central Harlem converted to a mixed-income condominium in 2009, before seeing a finished unit.
Buyers who a few years ago might have snapped up apartments in new developments after merely viewing floor plans have been reluctant to do so, and new projects, including many in Harlem, have suffered mightily along with the economy.
Mr. Breaux, a bassoonist and former high school band director, and his partner, Reggie Grayson, had seen only online renderings of the 75 units at the condo and its restored collegiate Gothic-style architecture before arriving on a snowy February morning last year in search of someone to show them an apartment. 
On that wintry day, the two couldn't find a broker in the building - an advertised open house might have been canceled because of the weather, they thought - but they made their way past scaffolding and into an apartment. Workers were restoring the limestone, terra cotta and brick facade of the six-story building, dating to 1906 and designed by Charles B. J. Snyder. In the apartment they found the concrete floors unfinished. The 12-foot-high ceilings immediately made an impression, but there were no lights or appliances.
They were convinced, though, that this was the home they wanted to buy, in part because Mr. Breaux, 53, whose mother was a school librarian and whose father was an industrial-arts teacher, loved the way the building evoked family history and his occupation: he is pursuing a doctorate in music education. Seeing the herringbone oak floors in the renderings, he remembered that his grammar school in Lafayette, La., had oiled wood floors, and now he meticulously polishes his wood floors at PS90 with tung oil.
"It felt very meaningful to be in a school," he said.
Since they moved into their finished one-bedroom last October, sales have picked up at PS90, at 220 West 148th Street between Frederick Douglass andAdam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, and at other new developments in the area. The project was developed by L+M Development Partners and is being marketed by Sidney S. Whelan, an agent at Halstead Property.
All but 9 of the 74 condos at PS90 have sold (one is for the super), and a number of musicians, artists and photographers have moved in, according to brokers. Also, the National Dance Institute is soon opening a new headquarters in the building. All this is making for what Mr. Breaux described as a tightly knit creative community.
He declined to say how much he had paid. Twenty units were classified as moderate-income, with much lower asking prices than the market-rate units, which have been listed for a range of $450,000 to $899,000. They include studios, one- and two-bedrooms, and a single three-bedroom, for $849,000.
Most of the units sold so far have gone for slightly below asking price.
The sales at PS90 and nearby developments are good news for the central Harlem housing market. Since March, this submarket - Harlem and Hamilton Heights - has been performing below the overall Manhattan market, according to Noah Rosenblatt, the founder of the real estate data site Urban Digs. His numbers showed the pace of sales in that market was down 28.6 percent, compared with a decline of 16.7 percent in Manhattan over all.
But, in a more positive sign, housing inventory also fell. The supply was down 26.4 percent, versus 7.2 percent in the overall Manhattan market, so buyers faced less choice and the potential for higher prices.

HEADLINE: Designing Sustainable Structures From the Land Up

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The value of considering landscapes when designing buildings that work for the long haul. 

 BODY:
The Solar Decathlon, an Energy Department competition in which college teams design and build energy-thrifty solar-powered structures, kicked off today on the National Mall. (The video above is the entry from the University of Maryland; background below.)
Some of the is from The Dirt, the blog of the American Society of Landscape Architects. That might seem odd in some ways. What do solar panels have to do with gardens and lawns?
But the importance of considering landscapes when designing homes or businesses that function for the long haul has been appreciated for decades, particularly among disciples of Ian McHarg, a landscape architect and the author of the seminal book "Design With Nature." My appreciation of his approach to planning and design grew when I was assigned his obituary in 2001. I had already been attuned to this philosophy through the work of Rene Dubos and -- on a broader scale -- the "land ethic" of Aldo Leopold.
The Dirt post on the Solar Decathlon focuses on student designs stressing the role of landscapes in accomplishing design goals, including the University of Maryland's WaterShed and Self-Reliance, the house designed by students from Middlebury College, which can be toured in this YouTube video:
Here's a link to all of the competing teams, which come from around North America and as far away as New Zealand. Earlier this week, I was in touch with Jared Green, the editor of The Dirt and the Web manager for the organization behind it, and invited him to contribute a "Your Dot" post describing the role of landscape architects in making sure that buildings are, in essence, . Here goes: 
As the world becomes more and more focused on environmental issues that cross national boundaries, such as climate change, reduced availability of clean water, increased water and air pollution, and the growth of urban heat islands, landscape architects are taking the lead in finding practical, innovative solutions that leverage natural systems.
As designers of sustainable landscapes, landscape architects are concerned about the further degradation of nature, but also about people. Unequal access to green space in many communities, particularly those in urban areas, means residents aren't able to benefit from the restorative effects of nature. In cities, in particular, abandoned brownfields -- the legacy of inefficient development practices -- act as major economic drains.
Decades of rich discussion among landscape architects, ecologists, biologists, architects, and planners has yielded a major shift in thinking. The approach to landscapes has moved beyond simply saying do no harm, or conserve or use less resources, and towards productivity and regeneration.
The idea is that landscapes, whether in their natural state or as restored contaminated brownfields, can give back by enhancing and regenerating natural resources, offering a range of ecosystem services. If well-designed, landscapes can provide many of these services all together in a kind of ecological infrastructure.
Now, the goal is to maximize the services landscapes can provide, while creating healthy, beautiful places.
Landscape architects, who serve a key interdisciplinary role as "synthesizers," are now partnering with public health professionals and medical practitioners to discover what types of landscapes offer the most bang for the buck in terms of health. [Green noted in a separate e-mail that this idea was first articulated by Frederick Law Olmsted.] Exciting new research points to the positive effects of being surrounded by nature on cognitive ability, mood, and even the time spent in a hospital recovering from surgery.
Some articles that illustrate these ideas:
Research Shows Nature Helps with Stress
Interview with Nina-Marie Lister on Ecological Urbanism
Reinventing Public Place in NYC: Brooklyn Bridge Park
Interview with Peter Calthorpe, Author of Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change
Also, the ASLA Web site has compiled many sustainable landscape case studies.

HEADLINE: 'Worst' No Longer Describes New York Commuting Time

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: This is one instance in which New Yorkers will not mind playing second fiddle. 

 BODY:
 Consider it the statistical equivalent of a fender-bender: New York State has finally been bumped from first place for the longest commute.
 But just barely.
 Maryland moved into first place last year with an average of 31.82 minutes, compared with New York's 31.27 - meaning that it took Marylanders about 33 seconds longer to get to work than New Yorkers. 
 That is a tiny though noteworthy difference, since in 2009 New York's average commute was 31.43 minutes, 13 seconds longer than last year. 
 New Jersey had the third longest commuted at 30.30 minutes. 
 Before you reset your alarm clocks, though, consider that the suburbs surrounding New York City, including Long Island, Westchester, northern New Jersey, Connecticut and other northern and western suburbs, still had the longest commute in the country, according to the Census Bureau's 2010 American Community Survey released Thursday. 
It took the average New York metropolitan area worker 33.54 minutes to get to work last year, compared with 33.47 the year before. At 32.64 minutes, metropolitan Washington was second in 2010.
 Not surprisingly, most New Yorkers relied on mass transit to get to work. Of the 3.6 million workers who live in New York City, according to the survey, more than two million took public transportation, 820,000 drove alone, 180,000 car-pooled, 364,000 walked to work and 87,000 went by taxi, motorcycle or bicycle. Nearly 150,000 said they worked at home. 
What's behind the decline in New York State? The cloud surrounding the silver lining is that higher unemployment rates may figure in the decline. And the decline is so tiny that experts were reluctant to attribute a particular cause. 
"There are times when it is better not to be No. 1, and this is one of them," said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the region's Metropolitan Transportation Council. 
"While we don't know why Maryland's average is changing,'' she added, "we do know what is happening in New York State: extensive and widely used transit service in the New York City metro area, and programs in place throughout the city and state to encourage transit use, bicycling, ride-sharing and driving less." 
 Maryland, where most workers commute either to Washington or Baltimore and traffic flows from four neighboring states, managed to find a silver lining in its dubiously distinct exhaust cloud.
 "The transportation congestion is one of the benefits of a vibrant economy," said Jack Cahalan, a spokesman for Maryland's transportation department. "Maryland's economy has continued to chug along because of the federal job base." 
 Life is full of tradeoffs. The Census Bureau said this week that the shortest commuting time to work last year - 14.2 minutes - was in greater Grand Forks, N.D., population 100,000.

HEADLINE: Banks Increase Holdings in Derivatives

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Even as federal regulators ratchet up scrutiny of the derivatives market, Wall Street is diving deeper into the $600 trillion industry, a new government report found. 

 BODY:
Even as federal regulators ratchet up scrutiny of the derivatives market, Wall Street is diving deeper into the $600 trillion industry, a new government report found. 
The banking industry in the second quarter raised its stake in derivatives more than 11 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the report by the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal agency that regulates national banks. Banks now hold nearly $250 trillion of the contracts, primarily futures and swaps, which derive their value from an underlying asset like an interest rate or a bundle of mortgages. 
The nation's four biggest banks - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs - are the biggest players, holding roughly 95 percent of the industry's total exposure to derivatives. JPMorgan, which holds the most among commercial banks, carries some $78 trillion worth of derivatives on its books, according to the report. Citi is next on the list, with $56 trillion, up from $54 trillion in the first quarter. 
"Derivatives activity in the U.S. banking system continues to be dominated by a small group of large financial institutions," the report noted. While the number of banks holding derivatives increased modestly to 1,070, 99 percent are held by only 25 banks.
The derivatives industry -- which allows banks, hedge funds and corporations to both hedge risk and speculate on market fluctuations - was at the center of the financial crisis. The American International Group became a symbol of the industry's pitfalls, having sold billions of dollars in credit default swaps as insurance on risky mortgage-backed securities. When the mortgage market crumbled during the crisis, the insurance giant lacked the capital to honor their agreements.
Credit default swaps make up 97 percent of total credit derivatives at banks, though they are a small piece of the overall derivatives pie. Commercial banks primarily use interest rate products, which comprise 82 percent of the total value of derivatives.
The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law overhauled the industry, forcing many derivatives contracts onto regulated exchanges. Many deals must also go through clearinghouses, which act as a backstop in case one party defaults. Regulators are writing more than 50 new derivatives rules, moving the once murky market onto Washington's radar screen.

HEADLINE: Giving the Fed a Good Grade

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A report from the Cleveland Fed cites tangible results from the Federal Reserve's announcement in August that short-term interest rates would remain low for two years. 

 BODY:
It's been a rough week for the Federal Reserve, as its latest plan to stimulate growth was greeted by the sound of falling stock prices.
But here's a bit of good news for the Fed: A new study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that the central bank's previous effort to push growth, announced in August, has had a positive impact.
The Fed announced after the August meeting of its policy-making committee that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero until the middle of 2013. The statement was its latest effort to reduce the cost of borrowing, in this case by giving lenders the confidence that money would remain cheap for another two years.
"The Committee was attempting to alter the expectations of market participants," the Cleveland Fed said in its report. "It worked. Since the announcement, forecasts for a variety of interest rates have fallen, at least in part due to the lower expectations for future interest rates."
Central banks generally avoid specific statements about long-term plans, to preserve flexibility and to avoid the need for apologies. But the Fed's August statement culminated a gradual move in the direction of talking about the future. Beginning in 2009, the Fed said that it would maintain rates near zero for "an extended period," language it repeated until August. Earlier this year, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, defined an "extended period" as meaning at least two meetings of the policy-making committee.

Fed officials decided to go even further after concluding that the risk of backtracking was low because there was little prospect the economy would recover sufficiently in the next two years to put significant upward pressure on wages and prices.
The decision was controversial. Three of the 10 committee members dissented, the largest bloc of dissent in almost two decades. They expressed concern that the majority was underestimating the danger of inflation, overestimating the benefits of low interest rates -- and that the announcement might persuade some consumers and business to wait before borrowing, in the confidence that rates would remain low and the hope that the economy would improve.
The Cleveland Fed study does not resolve those concerns, but it does point to clear evidence that the announcement has succeeded in reducing interest rates.
Specifically, by convincing investors that short-term rates would remain low, the Fed succeeded in lowering rates on longer-term debt -- which are based in large part on expectations about the level of short-term rates throughout the longer period. Rates on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for example, declined by about 0.20 percentage points.
Moreover, the study found that the announcement also reduced market expectations about future interest rates for mortgage borrowers and corporations, suggesting that the Fed may succeed in reducing the cost of borrowing across a wide swath of the economy.
Markets now anticipate, for example, that corporations with good credit will be able to borrow at 4.80 percent at the end of 2012, down from an expectation of 5.60 percent before the Fed's announcement.
Of course, one great caveat looms over all of the Fed's efforts: Reducing the cost of borrowing does not make loans any easier to get. Federal regulators reported Thursday that mortgage loan originations fell by 12 percent last year, despite the historically low level of interest rates.

HEADLINE: Fact Checking the G.O.P. Debate in Orlando

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Examining statements on Social Security, education, foreign policy and more. 

 BODY:
Examining Perry's Explanation on HPV Vaccine
Coming under fire once again from his Republican rivals for his controversial executive order mandating that sixth-grade girls receive a vaccine against HPV, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas took a different tack on Thursday's debate than in recent encounters. While some critics have suggested he was swayed by a former aide working as a lobbyist for the drug's manufacturer, Mr. Perry suggested he had issued the order after urging by Texans.
"I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage four cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office. She talked to me about this program," Mr. Perry said, adding, "I erred on the side of life, and I will always err on the side of life, as a governor and as the president of the United States."
The woman in question, Heather Burcham, did meet with Mr. Perry before she passed away from the disease and urged him to support the vaccinations. But after the debate, the Perry campaign confirmed that they did not meet until after Mr. Perry issued the order in February 2007, as previously reported by ABC News and others.
As the governor's decision came under fire from some parents and conservative groups, Ms. Burcham lobbied the legislature to uphold his order. Mr. Perry later spoke at her funeral.

Bachmann on Obama's Approval Rating
President Obama is not particularly popular these days: According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, Mr. Obama has a job approval rating of just 43 percent.
But that's not low enough for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who said that Mr. Obama "has the lowest public approval ratings of any president in modern time."
Mr. Obama, however, still has a ways to go before he reaches the presidential basement. For example, former president Jimmy Carter had a much lower approval rating, 31 percent, in a Times poll conducted at a similar time during his presidency.
According to Gallup, which provides a list of the lowest all-time approval ratings for every president since Nixon, Mr. Obama's current job approval rating for is 38 percent. His predecessor, George W. Bush, bottomed out at 25 percent, while Mr. Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, hit a low of 29 percent. Bill Clinton bottomed out at 37 percent, and Ronald Reagan at 35 percent.
And of course there's Richard M. Nixon, who got to a Gallup job approval low of 24 percent before resigning the presidency.
The lowest approval rating registered for a president by the Gallup poll? Harry S. Truman, who reached a low 22 percent approval rating during his presidency.
- 

Obama's Foreign Policy
Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts repeated the familiar Republican charge that President Obama has apologized for the United States around the world. It is true that early in his term, Mr. Obama promised to abandon policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush.
But it is hard to find evidence that Mr. Obama ever said he was "sorry" on behalf of the United States. And in some speeches, notably after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Obama offered a robust defense of American policies, including the war in Afghanistan.
Asked about Israel, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of publicly airing disputes with the Israeli government and said, "You don't allow an inch of space to exist between you and your friends and allies." The president has clashed with Israel over its demand that the Israeli government freeze construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
But the administration has also deepened military cooperation between the United States and Israel. At the United Nations on Wednesday, Mr. Obama delivered perhaps the strongest statement of support for Israel of his presidency and repeated that the United States will oppose the Palestinian drive for recognition of a state at the United Nations.
The troubled American relationship with Pakistan prompted head-scratching responses by some of the candidates. Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said he would respond to the threat of Pakistan's nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands by cultivating closer relations with its former president, Pervez Musharraf. He left office in 2008, deeply discredited with Pakistanis and at odds with the Bush administration. He now lives in self-exile in London.
- 
Johnson on Education
Gary E. Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico, joining a chorus of candidates who criticized Washington's role in education, claimed the federal Department of Education "gives each state 11 cents out of every dollar that every state spends, but it comes with 16 cents worth of strings attached.''
"So what America does not understand is that it's a negative to take federal money,'' he said.
In fact, there are no unfunded federal "mandates,'' according to the Education Department. Federal education laws are voluntary -- states that don't want to follow the regulations need only agree not to accept federal money for schools.
The requirements of federal education law -- such as meeting student achievement standards under the current No Child Left Behind law -- do not kick in until states cash the check. Almost all do, because they welcome the support, though some states have chosen not to make the trade off.
- 
Johnson on Balanced Budget
Mr. Johnson pledged to submit a balanced budget to Congress. One of the main ways he said he would achieve a balanced budget, he implied, was cutting foreign aid.
What share of federal spending does foreign aid account for? About 1 percent.
- 
Romney on 'Race to the Top' Grants
In a lightening-round question for all the candidates about the role of the federal government in education, Mr. Perry accused Mr. Romney of supporting President Obama's Race to the Top grant contest, the administration's chief education initiative, which offered states $4.3 billion to implement programs to lift student achievement.
"There is one person on this stage'' who supports Race to the Top, Mr. Perry said, meaning Mr. Romney. "Being in favor of the Obama Race to the Top, that is not conservative.''
Mr. Romney at first dodged the question, then said, "I don't support any program he's describing.''
At a town hall-style meeting in Miami Wednesday, Mr. Romney praised Mr. Obama's education secretary, Arne Duncan, the prime architect of Race to the Top. "I think Secretary Duncan has done some good things," he said. "I hope that's not heresy in this room. He for instance has a program called Race to the Top, which encourages schools to have more choice, more testing of kids, more evaluation of teachers. Those are things I think make sense.''
The Race to the Top contest, in which Mr. Perry refused to participate, encourages states to lift caps on charter schools -- that is, to offer "choice," a goal Mr. Perry said during his answer to the question that he supported.
- 
Santorum on Public Employee Pay
ORLANDO -- Mr. Santorum lit into public employee unions, saying that they were imposing fiscal hardships on states and that "30 to 40 percent of union employees make above their private sector equivalents," referring to federal workers.
There have been a flurry of studies from liberal and conservative think-tanks purporting to find that federal employees or public employees as a whole are either overpaid or underpaid relative to their private sector counterparts. And one widely-cited report by USA Today found that federal employees "earn higher average salaries than private-sector workers in more than eight out of 10 occupations."
But some independent analyses, like this one by Factcheck.org, have questioned the methodology of many of the findings, noting that relatively few of them fully account for variations by region, educational attainment, the average age of workers, and other factors. Federal workers, for example, tend to be older, and work in the same job for longer, than private sector workers.
USA Today also noted that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, dozens of federal job descriptions, covering some 750,000 employees -- such as air-traffic controllers and tax collectors -- did not have direct equivalents in the private sector.
While there is some evidence that some federal workers make more than private sector employees in similar fields, direct comparisons can be hard to make.
- 
Perry's Social Security Comments
Mr. Perry got into quite a scuffle with Mr. Romney over Mr. Perry's past comments on Social Security, on which Mr. Romney has been slamming Mr. Perry for weeks. Mr. Perry said tonight that he "never said" Social Security should be returned to the states, but that's not exactly true. On TV talk shows and in his 2010 book "Fed Up," Mr. Perry said Social Security was an unconstitutional Ponzi scheme that should be managed by the states. Tonight, Mr. Perry backtracked and said he offered the notion of returning Social Security to the states as an "option" -- but that it was only one such option.
- 
Unemployment and Retraining
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested that people receiving unemployment benefits should be required to be enrolled in retraining programs. Providing more training for displaced workers sounds like an attractive idea, especially since more highly-educated workers tend to have lower unemployment rates. Workers who have lost jobs in industries or careers that are in structural decline -- like manufacturing -- could certainly benefit from such programs since they need to acquire new skills to find work.
However, it's not clear that all unemployed workers need to be retrained for new careers or industries. Most economists argue that the primary reason for today's jobs crisis is a lack of demand for workers of all kinds, as opposed to an underskilled workforce.
Another point worth noting is that Mr. Gingrich seems to be somewhat on the same wavelength as the Obama administration, which has shown interest in a Georgia program that ties unemployment benefits to training (in this case, on-the-job training).
- 
The 'Texas Miracle'
Mr. Perry, asked about how to create incentives to get businesses to hire, responded by talking about job growth in Texas during his tenure as governor, attributing it to policies lowering taxes and reducing regulations.
The Times has written plenty about the so-called "Texas Miracle," and other reasons why Texas has added so many jobs (higher energy prices, in particular).
It is also not clear that reducing taxes and regulations nationwide would encourage businesses to hire. The National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business industry group, has found that small businesses have consistently named "poor sales" as their "most important problem," not taxes or "government requirements and red tape."

HEADLINE: Meg Whitman's Other Problem: The Economy

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview, Meg Whitman, the new chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, warns that the economy in Europe and in the United States could present new problems for the company. 

 BODY:
As much as any damage caused by Leo Apotheker's inability to successfully communicate or execute his decisions during his 11-month tenure atop Hewlett-Packard, new chief executive Meg Whitman is concerned about what has happened to H.P.'s competitive environment.
"The pace of change has accelerated" around H.P., Ms. Whitman said in an interview Thursday evening. "We have to anticipate, and anticipate and anticipate the trends." These include the shift from PCs to tablets like the AppleiPad and the rise of low-cost corporate computing through Internet-based rentals of computing power like Amazon Web Services, she said.
"We have to look at our whole go-to-market approach," she said, referring to the way products are marketed. Whatever she chooses to do, she indicated it will be led by hardware sales and not Mr. Apotheker's software-led philosophy.
During a call with Wall Street analysts, Ms. Whitman talked about the need for H.P. to temporarily slow its investments and share repurchases, to rebuild the company's damaged balance sheet. 
She may need the money for more than that however. In a later conversation with The New York Times, the newly reminted chief executive identified weaknesses in the sales of its usually lucrative printer cartridges. "Printing is a 50 percent consumer business," she said. "The consumer is pulling back, mostly in Europe, but to be honest here too."
While economic weakness in the United States isn't news, H.P. identified weakness in Europe in the analysts' call. While this will affect revenue in the quarter, according to the company's chief financial officer, the company expects to deliver its projected earnings per share this quarter. The outlook from there is uncertain, indicating H.P. will deliver the earnings through cuts, more than a revival of demand elsewhere.
Where will those come from? "I've got 43 days until the end of the quarter," she said. "I've got to do some homework."

HEADLINE: Podcast: On the Fed, Christine Lagarde and China

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve started Operation Twist, but the stock market was unimpressed.
Although the markets stabilized on Friday, global stock prices fell sharply after the Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would shift its bond portfolio toward longer-term maturities, in a reprise of a 1960s maneuver known as Operation Twist. In a conversation on the new Weekend Business podcast, Floyd Norris says that the Fed's initiative was overshadowed by concern over the Greek debt crisis and its threat to banks in Europe and elsewhere around the world.
The International Monetary Fund has been playing a prominent role in the crisis, with Christine Lagarde, the agency's new director, openly urging European governments to be much bolder. David Gillen talks to Liz Alderman in Paris about the former French finance minister's surprisingly independent stand in her first weeks as I.M.F. chief.
The rapid growth of China's economy has been one of the major developments of the last few decades. David Barboza, a reporter based in Shanghai, says that while China is likely to continue growing at a rate that many other countries would envy, the chances of a major setback appear to be growing as well.
And in a separate conversation in the podcast, Christina Romer, the Berkeley economist and former Obama economic adviser, says that the president's current jobs plan is sound, though she says it should, perhaps, be even more ambitious.

You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Floyd Norris on the Fed (36:43); news summary (28:22); Liz Alderman on Christine Lagarde (24:56); David Barboza on China (17:41); Christina Romer on the jobs plan (9:11); the week ahead (1:42).

HEADLINE: Late to Work? The Old Excuse of a Horrid Commute Just Got a Bit Weaker

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Consider it the statistical equivalent of a fender-bender: New York State has finally been bumped from first place for the longest commute.
But just barely.
Maryland moved into first place last year with an average of 31.82 minutes, compared with New York's 31.27 - meaning that it took Marylanders about 33 seconds longer to get to work than New Yorkers.
That is a tiny though noteworthy difference, since in 2009 New York's average commute was 31.43 minutes, 13 seconds longer than last year. 
New Jersey had the third-longest commute, 30.3 minutes.
Before you reset your alarm clocks, though, consider that the areas surrounding New York City, including Long Island, Westchester County, northern New Jersey, Connecticut and other northern and western suburbs, still had the longest commute in the country, according to the Census Bureau's 2010 American Community Survey released Thursday.
It took the average New York metropolitan area worker 33.54 minutes to get to work last year, compared with 33.47 in 2009. At 32.64 minutes, metropolitan Washington was second in 2010.
Not surprisingly, most commuters in New York City relied on mass transit to get to work. Of the 3.6 million workers who live in New York City, according to the survey, more than two million took public transportation, 820,000 drove alone, 180,000 car-pooled, 364,000 walked to work and 87,000 went by taxi, motorcycle or bicycle. Nearly 150,000 said they worked at home.
What is behind the decline in New York State? The cloud surrounding the silver lining is that higher unemployment rates may figure in, although the decline was so tiny that experts were reluctant to attribute it to a particular cause.
''There are times when it is better not to be No. 1, and this is one of them,'' said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the state's Metropolitan Transportation Council.
''While we don't know why Maryland's average is changing,'' Ms. Daglian added, ''we do know what is happening in New York State: extensive and widely used transit service in the New York City metro area, and programs in place throughout the city and state to encourage transit use, bicycling, ride-sharing and driving less.''
Maryland, where most workers commute to either Washington or Baltimore and traffic flows from four neighboring states, managed to find some good news in its dubiously distinct exhaust trail.
''The transportation congestion is one of the benefits of a vibrant economy,'' said Jack Cahalan, a spokesman for Maryland's Transportation Department. ''Maryland's economy has continued to chug along because of the federal job base.''
Life is full of trade-offs. The Census Bureau said this week that the shortest commuting time to work last year - 14.2 minutes - was in greater Grand Forks, N.D., population 100,000.

HEADLINE: China, Pacesetter in Global Economy, Shows Signs of Slowing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Is China's economy in trouble, too?
As the American economy appears to teeter on the edge of another recession, Europe struggles with a financial crisis and emerging markets like Brazil and India show new weaknesses, China may appear to be in better shape than most countries, economists say. But ''better'' is relative.
On the surface, economists at the International Monetary Fund and most banks are still estimating China's growth rate to be over 9 percent this year. China continues to run very large trade surpluses. New construction starts have soared with a government campaign to provide more affordable housing.
And yet, the country's huge manufacturing sector is starting to slow and orders are weakening, especially for exports. The real estate bubble is starting to spring leaks, even as inflation remains stubbornly high for consumers -- despite a series of interest rate increases and ever-tighter limits on bank lending. 
Because China's mighty growth engine has been one of the few drivers of the global economy since the financial crisis of 2008, signs of deceleration could add to worries about the global outlook.
A survey of Chinese purchasing managers, just completed by HSBC and Markit Economics, shows a third consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector. The release of the survey results on Thursday contributed to a global slide in stock markets that day.
Meanwhile, huge loans that Chinese banks have made to state-owned enterprises and local governments over the last three years could cause trouble if the economy does slow.
What's more, there are further signs of trade hostilities from Washington, where the impulse is to blame China's cheap exports, at least partly, for America's continued high unemployment.
On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced that they would pursue legislation requiring the Obama administration to confront China more directly on currency policy. They want the White House to push harder for China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate.
If China does allow its currency to rise more quickly and if its trade surplus narrows, that could help economies elsewhere. But too much of a slowdown in China could simply add to the world's financial gloom.
Chinese exporters are particularly worried.
Nicole Huang, the sales manager at the Dongguan Lianyi Sport Goods Company, a maker of beer coolers, diving suits and other products in the industrial hub city of Dongguan, said the number of orders had dropped 5 percent so far this year, and the average size of each order had also begun to shrink.
And instead of the labor shortages that plagued many manufacturers last year as workers sought better jobs elsewhere, more people now seem willing to accept assembly-line tedium. Short term, that could help exporters. But it could be an early sign of looming unemployment problems.
''At least it is easier now for us to hire workers who come into our factory looking for work, after seeing our job notices posted outside,'' Mr. Huang said. ''Before, no one would respond to these notices.''
The sentiments of investors and economists inside and outside China have taken a bearish turn in recent weeks. As global stock markets have tumbled, the Shanghai A-share stock market has fallen 14.7 percent since July 15. That includes a further decline of 0.4 percent on Friday.
The most worried economists are those who follow China's manic monetary policy. The central bank oversaw a huge stimulus effort in 2009 and 2010 in response to the global economic slowdown, rapidly expanding its issuance of money and then encouraging banks to lend and relend it. Broadly measured, the money supply surged 53 percent in two years.
The extra cash has sent inflation at the consumer level surging to more than 6 percent even by official measures, which tend to understate true inflation for methodological reasons.
With inflation now running at more than twice the regulated interest rate paid by banks for deposits, millions of Chinese have been betting their savings on real estate. That frenzy had been sending property prices through the roof, at least until the last couple of months.
But this year, to fight inflation, the Chinese financial authorities have veered in the other direction, setting strict administrative quotas on new loans. And they have ordered the mostly state-owned banks to park more than a fifth of their assets at the central bank, which further limits the banks' ability to lend -- and businesses' ability to borrow.
Orchid Chen, the sales director of the Fujian Yuandong Electric Motor Group, which makes motors in Fu'an in southeastern China's Fujian Province, said that banks were strictly following Beijing's instructions.
''The smaller enterprises have found it difficult to secure any type of lending from banks,'' she said.
''We are a good-sized company and still have support from the banks, though our loan rates have been adjusted upward two to three times this year already.''
Diana Choyleva, a Hong Kong-based economist for Lombard Street Research, predicted that the combination of tighter monetary policy with a likely slowdown in foreign demand for China's exports would result in the Chinese economy's growing at an annualized rate of only 5 percent in the second half of this year and the first half of next year.
''Just as the authorities are managing to hammer down demand growth, the rest of the world is not looking healthy, so there's going to be an export shock,'' she said.
Despite the gloomy purchasing managers survey issued Thursday by HSBC and Markit, Donna Kwok, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of HSBC, noted that the survey also showed shrinkage in companies' inventories of finished goods. So at least short term, companies may need to maintain production to fill orders, instead of meeting them from existing stockpiles.
China has been highly successful in creating jobs and shifting unemployment to other countries through its intervention in currency markets.
This has kept the renminbi weak and made Chinese exports very competitive in foreign markets, even as it has kept imports expensive for Chinese consumers.
That policy, though, could be increasingly hard to continue as high unemployment persists in the West, and Washington lawmakers demand a White House response.
Hong Lei, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a news briefing on Friday in Beijing that appreciation of the renminbi was not the answer to American trade deficits with China.
Many large American companies rely heavily on imports from China and are lobbying against the legislative push.
Within China, domestic demand is starting to weaken slightly. China's auto market, the world's largest by number of vehicles sold, looks fairly strong at first glance, with family vehicle sales up 6 percent in August from a year earlier. But that is a significant slowdown, coming after a decade of almost continuous double-digit growth.
More worrisome, the growth in August occurred mainly among Japanese manufacturers in China that were finally filling orders as they recovered from the parts shortages created by the earthquake and tsunami last March. Price discounts have begun to spread, even among multinational brands.
And many Chinese automakers, which have tended to sell the least expensive and often lowest-quality cars, had sharply lower sales in August -- particularly of small minivans and pickup trucks, for which government incentives expired at the end of last year.
Then there are real estate prices, which have been soaring in China for more than a decade.
A government survey released on Sunday showed that prices had fallen in August compared to July in 16 cities, notably Chongqing in western China. And prices stayed flat in 30 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, although they did continue rising in 24 other cities.
The hardest question to answer in China is whether slower economic growth and continued inflation could lead to more social tensions, which in turn could damage the economy through weaker investment and more cautious spending.
Though blue-collar wages have surged over the last decade, tripling in some coastal provinces, the salaries for many white-collar workers, particularly recent college graduates, have been trailing inflation.
The central government banned local taxes and fees in rural areas six years ago. And it has been talking for years about whether to start assessing property taxes instead; so far it has experimented with that approach in only a few cities, notably Chongqing and Shanghai. Without a broad base of property taxes, local governments across China raise much of their money by seizing land from peasants with minimal compensation based on the value of recent harvests, rezoning it for industrial or commercial use and then selling the land for far more to developers.
Roy Prosterman, the founder and chairman emeritus of Landesa, a rural development policy group based in Seattle, said in a speech in Hong Kong on Thursday that the group's surveys in China had found that peasants typically receive only one-fifteenth of what developers pay for land in these deals.
The news media have reported a spate of protests in recent months in rural areas, including riots this week in the southern province of Guangdong. But protests have erupted periodically for years and there are no reliable national statistics on whether the overall number of protests is rising or falling.

HEADLINE: Readers' Questions About Autism

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
The New York Times has received hundreds of letters in response to ''Autistic and Seeking a Place in Adulthood,'' Amy Harmon's article last Sunday about a 22-year-old New Jersey man, Justin Canha, who has autism and is struggling to be independent.
Here are her answers to some of the questions asked about the people in the article, the reporting process and the broader social and economic issues that were raised. The reporter has paraphrased and combined similar questions from different readers.
Q: How can the intense, one-on-one supervision that Justin received through a special transition-to-adulthood program at Montclair High School be replicated in all of the underfunded schools we have? It is, by the way, taking more to educate this one young man than many people earn. How do we maintain that? 
A: It's true that the kind of transition-to-adulthood program Justin entered at Montclair, with one-on-one aides supervising students as they practiced the daily routines of life in their community, is more expensive than educating a group of students like him in a classroom with a single teacher.
But advocates of such community-based instruction make the case that there is a big, long-term payoff. The average cost to taxpayers and families of caring for an adult with autism exceeds $1 million, according to one estimate. If adults with autism can work -- even if they need on-the-job support, as many will -- studies have shown that taxpayers stand to save a lot of money over decades.
It's also true that it's largely up to states and local school districts to make the up-front investment, or not. Less than 20 percent of the extra money that states spend on special education students is paid by the federal government.
Montclair says it spends about $14,000 a year to educate a typical student; the extra cost of Justin's transition program each year was around $25,000. To put it in perspective, though, it's worth noting that public schools -- obligated by civil rights law to provide equal access to education for students with disabilities -- sometimes spend a lot more to educate students with autism, by paying for them to attend specialized private schools. Often those schools are not in the community where the students will live when they graduate. Montclair says it pays an average of $66,000 a year for such students. Since implementing the transition program described in my story, the district has saved money by bringing back students for their transition years, so they can get job training in their own community -- and learn to navigate within it.
Q: Justin was fortunate enough to be able to harness a gift and make his way into a workforce, however haltingly. But what about a nonverbal autistic adult with no special gift? What will happen to him or her?
A: I don't know of research showing specifically what types of employment will or won't work for nonverbal individuals, who represent about one-third of the autistic population. As I describe in the story, there was much debate within Montclair High School about whether Justin, as well as students who are more severely affected by autism than he is, should join the community-based program. Many have remained in a school classroom, because parents, teachers and school officials have decided that is best.
But Kate Stanton-Paule and Leslie Wallace, the transition program's co-directors, say that they would welcome the chance to work with those students as well. Ms. Stanton-Paule said she placed one nonverbal young woman with autism in a job when she worked in a similar program in Madison, Wis. Another program that I know of, Project Search, has had success in collaborating with high schools to find jobs for young adults with more significant disabilities, including limited language and difficulty with controlling their behavior.
Q: I don't think a lot of people realize how lucky Justin really is. Just having a one-on-one aide is a fantastic resource that many deserving kids with disabilities will never get from their districts, or parents and teachers with the audacity to stand up to their districts and demand these programs.
A: I completely agree, Justin's situation is a best-case scenario. Even under the best conditions, finding just a foothold for Justin in the adult world was a huge challenge. But it happened. To me, Justin's story suggests that the outcome for autistic students depends in some significant part on resources and how they are spent, rather than the intrinsic nature of a student's condition.
Q: I had a concern with the lack of follow-up in the system to determine the effectiveness of various interventions in the special education program. Apparently federal funding does not require this. But that is not an excuse for ignoring the need to measure impacts, in a program that uses scarce resources to help young people deal with their challenges. There is a saying in the business world: ''You get what you measure.'' Since there seems to be no attempt to measure, what is society getting? Or what are the challenged young adults getting from the choices that are being made for them without a systematic effort to determine results?
A: I think that's a very valid question, one I tried to raise in the story without being too heavy-handed about it. This year, the Department of Education required states for the first time to report how many of their special education students had either worked or attended post-secondary school for at least 90 days in the year after they graduated. But there is no federal-level effort to track the relative success of the type of transition program I profiled, and few, if any, states do it either. Gathering such data is complicated, especially because of the wide range of students with disabilities served by public schools. But it seems crucial to know. Paul Wehman, director of the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center at Virginia Commonwealth University, is in the middle of conducting what I believe is the first controlled study of a community-based transition program, comparing it to the standard transition program in a local high school.
Q: As a former kid who had to deal with countless reprimands and clumsy professional sessions trying to get me to make eye contact, I think the comic strip ''Jickey Goes to Behavior Therapy'' is the Best. Thing. Ever.
Q: I will not soon forget ''Jickey Goes to Behavior Therapy.'' (Justin: have you thought about writing a novel with this title?)
Q: Are there more Jickey and Fanky's?
A: First of all, if you missed the glimpse of Justin's ''Jickey and Fanky'' comic strip, please click here, then scroll down and click on the shaded words that say ''eye contact.'' And while you're at it, check out all of the special links to video conversations with Justin and images of his artwork in the story. They are marked in the text with a shaded background and cute little camera icons. But to address the outpouring of interest in ''Jickey,'' I think it's best to quote from an e-mail exchange I had with Justin on this subject this past spring:
Me: Hi, Justin,
When did you invent Jickey and Fanky? I heard you killed them off, is that true?
Justin: Dear Amy,
I created Jickey and Fanky in the early 2000s and I killed them off in 2009.
Me: How did they die?
Justin: I put them in the dip.
Me: What's the dip?
Justin: I killed Jickey and Fanky off by The Dip, a cartoon-killing liquid from the 1988 film ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
Me: Wow, Justin, that's interesting. How many Jickey and Fanky cartoons did you make before you killed them off?
Justin: I don't know, maybe a lot. It's a reason I killed them off, because I can't take it anymore of people's questions.

HEADLINE: Lean Toward the Sunny Side, but Don't Overdo It

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
I HAVE trouble with optimism. I would like to be a more optimistic person, and sometimes I can be. But there's a long tradition of pessimism in my family; our attitude is that looking on the bright side, or expecting the best, is naive at best and folly at worst.
But society seems to value optimism. Who would you rather hang out with -- Winnie-the-Pooh (''Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.'') or Eeyore (''Good afternoon, if it is a good afternoon, which I doubt.'')?
We're living in a time, however, that makes it difficult to cling to our Pooh side. A Thomson Reuters-University of Michigan survey found that Americans' expectations about the economy were the lowest in three decades and that only 17 percent of those surveyed expected their finances to improve. 
But putting aside the reality of the economy, is it good to see through rose-tinted glasses? As economists, neuroscientists and psychologists look at what we mean by optimism and how it affects everything from our jobs and our investments to our marriages, they are finding that there is such a thing as too much.
First, many of us may have the wrong idea about optimism. It isn't solely -- or largely -- about repeating ''boosterish phrases to ourselves like, 'Every day in every way, I'm getting better and better,' '' Martin Seligman, director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book ''The Optimistic Child'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1995). Rather, ''the basis of optimism does not lie in positive phrases or images of victory but in the way you think about causes.''
So a pessimist tends to believe bad things are permanent, while an optimist will view the same problem as temporary, he notes.
It's as simple, but as vast, as the difference between these two world views: ''Tony hates me and will never hang out with me again,'' and ''Tony is mad at me today and won't hang out with me.'' The optimist sees the rift with Tony as transient, while the pessimist is sure it will never end, wrote Professor Seligman, who has long studied the issue.
And if something is seen as permanent, then there is no hope for change.
But when good things happen, pessimists and optimists flip. ''When children who believe their successes have permanent causes do well, they will try even harder next time,'' Professor Seligman wrote. ''Children who see temporary reasons for good events may give up even when they succeed, believing their success was a fluke.''
As with most traits, the way we see our lives -- optimistically or pessimistically or somewhere in between -- is a combination of the temperament we're born with and the environment we grow up in. How much we can change that is always a subject of debate, but, Professor Seligman wrote, he believes optimism can be taught.
We may not want to go overboard, though. Manju Puri, professor of finance, and David T. Robinson, professor of business administration, both at the Duke University Fuqua School of Business, have determined that while moderate optimism is good, extreme optimism is not.
In their paper, ''Optimism and Economic Choice,'' which appeared in The Journal of Financial Economics in 2007, Professors Puri and Robinson used statistics from the Federal Reserve Board Survey of Consumer Finances, a triennial assessment of thousands of American families' financial and demographic information. Although the survey does not directly ask about optimism, it does ask respondents how long they expect to live.
The professors then used health-related information and demographics to determine what the respondents' actual life expectancy would be.
Those who predicted they would live 20 years longer than statistically expected were classified as ''extreme optimists,'' in the top 5 percent of optimists.
And those who predicted they would have longer life spans than statistically probable also answered more positively to questions like whether the economy was going to improve.
''Extreme optimists don't think savings are good, don't pay off their credit cards and don't do long-term planning,'' Professor Puri said. ''They think the economy will always do better.''
They are also more likely to remarry if divorced.
Moderate optimists, on the other hand, work longer hours, save more money, are more likely to pay off their credit card balances and believe their income will grow over the next five years.
The study was published before the recession, Professor Robinson said, so some of those optimists may be less sanguine about the future now.
Extreme optimists and extreme pessimists may operate in the same way, though for different reasons, he said. The extreme optimists may have too much faith that the future will work out so they don't need to worry about a safety net, while the pessimists may believe everything is going downhill anyhow, so why prepare for the future?
Studies show that good lawyers tend toward the pessimistic side of things, Professor Robinson said, perhaps because they have to always be thinking about what could go wrong.
But optimism serves those with business degrees better, he said. He co-wrote another study of graduate business students at Duke that found that those who were more optimistic -- although they didn't necessarily get better grades -- tended to have an easier time in the job search, land jobs earlier and were more likely to be promoted two years after starting their jobs.
''In corporate America, it pays well to play well with others,'' Professor Robinson said.
The differences between optimists and pessimists may appear the most obvious when waiting to find out something important -- the results of a test, a medical exam or a job interview.
Contrary to what you may expect, it may not be good idea to be too optimistic right before you get the results. Kate Sweeny, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, co-wrote a study that looked at 77 students who were about to find out the grades on their first midterm exam of the year
Those who anticipated an A were more disappointed by getting a B than those who expected a C and got one, Professor Sweeny said. Her work helps in trying to figure out how people should try to manage their emotions during waiting periods, she said.
''If the waiting period is long, like one year or six months, optimism may not be such a bad idea,'' she said. ''But as one gets closer, and there's rising anxiety, it might not be a bad idea to move expectations down.''
And although it is not clear why, research has shown that most people have an optimistic bias, said Elizabeth Phelps, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at New York University.
Ask a group of students how many think they will get married, for example, and a vast majority will raise their hands, she said. Ask how many think they will get divorced and far less than 50 percent will respond affirmatively -- this despite the fact that about half of all marriages end in divorce.
In contrast, depression is linked to a more pessimistic outlook, which, Professor Phelps said, ''is sometimes a more accurate assessment of the probability of future events.''
The experts are trying to discover if there are biological ways to increase or decrease optimism. In the meantime, we pessimists will have to learn to lighten up (but not too much) and rely on the old-fashioned ways to feel better about life -- rich chocolate and good wine.

HEADLINE: Shares Post Modest Gains After a Punishing Week

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Matthew Saltmarsh and Kevin Drew contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States and Europe edged higher on Friday but still finished the five-day trading period sharply lower after some of the steepest declines in weeks.
The Dow shed 737 points in its biggest weekly drop since October 2008.
Investors have been weathering a period of persistent uncertainty over the pace of economic growth and the problems in the euro zone. This has sent stocks down and bonds up. Gold, traditionally a safe haven asset, fell $101.70 to $1,637.50 on Friday, which some analysts partly attributed to selling by hedge funds or investors trying to raise cash. 
Analysts said recent losses in the financial markets were related to concerns about whether the governments of developed economies were doing enough to support growth. The declines also reflected broad pessimism about the debt crisis in the euro zone and intensifying fears about the economic outlook, despite the release of a statement late Thursday in Washington by the world's major economies that reiterated their commitment to the stability of banks and financial markets.
The statement by the Group of 20 nations did not, however, include commitments to new action or any talk of additional support for Europe.
''All in all, there appeared to be nothing in the way of concrete new action, and markets were generally underwhelmed,'' said Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
The Dow wavered in a narrow range on Friday, closing up 37.65 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,771.48, after a decline of 3.5 percent on Thursday, its largest drop since Aug. 18, and a day after the Federal Reserve announced new stimulus measures. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 6.87 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,136.43. The two indexes each fell more than 6 percent this week.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 27.56 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,483.23 on Friday to finish the week 5.3 percent lower.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 1 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt added 0.6 percent.
The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 1.83 percent after hitting a new low of 1.72 percent late Thursday. The price fell 1 1/32 to 102 21/32.
Yields have declined since the Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that a complete economic recovery was still years away and that there were ''significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.''
The Fed also said that it would buy long-term Treasury bonds and sell short-term bonds to help stimulate lending and growth.
Some analysts attributed the market declines to disappointment that the Fed did not act more forcefully and to little faith that policy tools like lower interest rates could encourage consumers to spend more when they were already worried about jobs.
''The Fed just moved the deck chairs,'' said Steve Blitz, the senior economist for ITG Investment Research. ''When you see a 10-year Treasury trading at 1.7 percent, the market is telling you that real growth over the next 10 years is going to be zero.
''So it is not so much deflation, but that no one sees the growth that is going to generate demand to borrow,'' Mr. Blitz added. ''You need confidence to borrow. If people had confidence, they would be falling all over themselves to borrow.''
As gold fell, the dollar rose, and the price for benchmark light, sweet crude oil futures contracts was flat at $80.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The weakness in commodities prices suggested to some analysts that investors were starting to bet that the likelihood of a recession in major economies was increasing.
Andreas Hurkamp, chief equity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said declines in commodity prices and fears about a possible default by Greece offset an initial rally on Friday.
''Until recently, commodity prices had been stable despite the weakness in equities,'' Mr. Hurkamp said. ''Now that seems to be changing.''
Energy and materials stocks, particularly susceptible to demand related to the economic outlook, were down. Financials were more than 1 percent higher.
Brian M. Youngberg, energy analyst for Edward Jones, said concerns over the global economy had thrown future oil demand into question.
''It is kind of the calm after the storm today,'' he said. ''There was significant panic yesterday with some data out of China maybe signaling that the Chinese economy may be slowing its growth rate, and then on top of that concerns of a double-dip recession in the United States and ongoing concerns about Europe.''
''All those factors caused investors to take risk off the table and avoid sectors that are viewed to be tied to the economy,'' Mr. Youngberg said.
Markets in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines and New Zealand also were lower on Friday but registered smaller losses than on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Arrests Shed Light on a Black Market in Pesticides

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Dominican immigrants in Washington Heights have long had a ready weapon against vermin: Tres Pasitos, or Three Little Steps, a granular product so named because after rats eat it, they walk three steps and die.
But for all its effectiveness, Tres Pasitos is also illegal. Manufactured in the Dominican Republic, it is imported and sold on the black market in unlabeled containers or small plastic bags like those used by drug dealers.
''It's not registered, not controlled, there's no antidote,'' warned Andy Linares, president of Bug Off Pest Control Center in Washington Heights. ''It's really pretty scary.'' 
The recent arrests of vendors in Chinatown accused of selling an illegal, highly potent pesticide apparently smuggled from China opened a window on the underground trade in chemicals used to combat roaches, rats and other vermin in the city's immigrant neighborhoods.
The product at the center of that investigation, which government officials disclosed this week, was sold in a box printed with Chinese characters and an awkward English translation: ''The Cat Be Unemployed.'' Officials said the substance contained a toxic chemical in a concentration almost 61 times higher than federal regulations allowed.
Though several professional exterminators said they had never encountered the product, they said it was just the latest in a stream of goods that for years had flowed from overseas factories into the supply closets of households and businesses in New York.
City health officials said that since 2005 they had received about 100 reports of poisoning from Tres Pasitos and two other anti-pest products favored by immigrants, Tempo and Chinese Chalk. While there were no deaths, about 40 percent of the victims had to be treated in medical centers, officials said.
Lower prices and language barriers can steer immigrants toward the underground market, immigrant advocates say. So can cultural biases: immigrants become familiar with products in their homeland and import their preferences, and sometimes the substance itself, when they move to the United States. They pass along their knowledge and techniques to neighbors and friends.
''It's word of mouth: get this and do that,'' said Gil Bloom, owner of Standard Pest Management, a company founded in 1929 and based in Long Island City, Queens.
Government officials have tried for years to clamp down on the trade in Tres Pasitos, which is often used against rodents and which contains aldicarb, an insecticide that is highly toxic to humans and pets. Yet demand remains high.
''The people will do what they want to do,'' said Omar Campos, co-owner of Exterminadora Latina, a company in Rego Park, Queens. ''They don't care if it murders a kid.''
Yaneyri Caney, a Dominican immigrant who works at a cafe on Broadway in Washington Heights, said that while she did not use Tres Pasitos because she did not have a rodent problem, she was a devoted user of Tempo.
Sold as a powder, Tempo is legally available in New York only to licensed applicators. But for years it has been traded briskly on the black market in small quantities. It is supposed to be mixed with water at ratios provided by the manufacturer, but untrained users often sprinkle it undiluted around their homes at hundreds of times its recommended concentration.
Ms. Caney said she bought it in packets from street vendors and, every couple of weeks, poured the powder in a line around the base of her bed and spread it on her kitchen cabinets and walls to deal with cockroaches. ''It's far more effective'' than products like Raid and Combat, she said.
Ms. Caney said she was aware of the danger. ''If there are children around,'' she cautioned, ''you have to watch out.''
Residents and shop owners in neighborhoods like Washington Heights and the South Bronx said that in the 1990s, vendors would openly hawk Tempo from folding tables on the sidewalks. ''They were going: 'Tempo! Get your Tempo!' '' recalled Mr. Linares, the exterminator in Washington Heights. ''It was out of control.''
Since then, a clampdown by the authorities has driven the market further underground. In bodegas throughout Washington Heights, store owners who were asked this week for Tres Pasitos and Tempo reacted as if the request were for crack cocaine. ''No way,'' one bodega owner said, his eyes widening in alarm. ''That's illegal. You'll have to get it on the street.''
Exterminators said the liveliest sector of the underground pesticide market was the trade in Chinese products, with new substances regularly entering the stream of shadowy commerce.
For years, one of the most popular black market products from China was a stick of chalk loaded with insecticides, including the chemical deltamethrin. Known as Chinese Chalk or Miraculous Chalk, it was used to draw a line along a wall or around a piece of furniture, like a bed or a kitchen table. Insects would die when they touched the line.
The arrests of several vendors in the city, and a public education campaign warning of the chalk's dangers, apparently chilled the market. Professional exterminators say customers no longer request the product as often as they used to.
Still, exterminators tell horror stories of do-it-yourself efforts gone awry.
One practice -- used by some immigrants, experts said -- involves dousing furniture in kerosene or gasoline to combat bedbugs and other pests. In their homeland, the immigrants would have hauled furniture to the yard.
But in New York, with no yard available, some families have left their furniture where it stood and sprayed the flammable liquids inside. In some cases, firefighters have been forced to respond.

HEADLINE: How Do You Say 'Economic Security'?

BYLINE: By THEODORE R. MARMOR and JERRY L. MASHAW. 
Theodore R. Marmor is a professor emeritus of public policy, and Jerry L. Mashaw is a professor of law, both at Yale. They are co-authors of ''America's Misunderstood Welfare State: Persistent Myths, Enduring Realities.''

 BODY:
IN the face of nothing but bad economic news, Americans often take heart in remembering that we have been here before -- during the Great Depression, when conditions were far worse than they are today -- and we survived.
But there is a crucial difference between then and now: the words that our political leaders use to talk about our problems have changed. Where politicians once drew on a morally resonant language of people, family and shared social concern, they now deploy the cold technical idiom of budgetary accounting. 
This is more than a superficial difference in rhetoric. It threatens to deprive us of the intellectual resources needed to address today's problems.
Turn back the clock to June 1934. Millions of Americans are out of work, losing their homes and facing more of the same. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responds by creating the Committee on Economic Security. To Congress, he stresses that he places ''the security of the men, women and children of the nation first.'' All Americans, he emphasizes, ''want decent homes to live in; they want to locate them where they can engage in productive work; and they want some safeguard against misfortunes which cannot be wholly eliminated in this man-made world of ours.''
Roosevelt asks the committee to propose ''sound means'' to secure against ''several of the great disturbing factors in life -- especially those which relate to unemployment and old age.'' Those ''sound means'' eventually emerge as the programs of Social Security pensions, old-age assistance and unemployment insurance.
Fast forward to February 2010. With millions of Americans out of work, home foreclosures at historic highs and little prospect of relief for those in need, President Obama acts, establishing a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The commission's task is to ''improve the fiscal situation,'' to ''achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run'' and to address ''the growth of entitlement spending.'' The commission recommends, true to its charge, cuts in entitlement spending -- that is, the programs established in 1935 and later years to aid the unemployed, aged, disabled and sick.
In August 2011, Congress acts, not to aid those in distress but to cut federal spending. The stated goal of its new ''super committee'' is to create fiscal balance by recommending measures ''to reduce the deficit'' by at least $1.5 trillion over the next decade.
Thus is the desperate situation of many Americans reduced to the clinical language of budgetary accounting. Social insurance programs that protect Americans against the common hazards of a market economy are ''entitlements'' that need to be revamped (read: cut) in the name of fiscal balance and deficit reduction.
As an economic policy matter, we view cutting entitlement programs as a very bad idea. But we wish to make a more fundamental observation about language and the collective imagination that language reflects.
In 1934, the focus was on people, family security and the risks to family economic well-being that we all share. Today, the people have disappeared. The conversation is now about the federal budget, not about the real economy in which real people live. If a moral concept plays a role in today's debates, it is only the stern proselytizing of forcing the government to live within its means. If the effect of government policy on average people is discussed, it is only as providing incentives for the sick to economize on medical costs and for the already strapped worker to save for retirement.
From the 1930s to the 1960s, as the Princeton historian Daniel T. Rodgers demonstrates in his recent book, ''The Age of Fracture,'' American public discourse was filled with references to the social circumstances of average citizens, our common institutions and our common history. Over the last five decades, that discourse has changed in ways that emphasize individual choice, agency and preferences. The language of sociology and common culture has been replaced by the language of economics and individualism.
In 1934, the government was us. We had shared circumstances, shared risks and shared obligations. Today the government is the other -- not an institution for the achievement of our common goals, but an alien presence that stands between us and the realization of individual ambitions. Programs of social insurance have become ''entitlements,'' a word apparently meant to signify not a collectively provided and cherished basis for family-income security, but a sinister threat to our national well-being.
Over the last 50 years we seem to have lost the words -- and with them the ideas -- to frame our situation appropriately.
Can we talk about this? Maybe not.

HEADLINE: The Phony Solyndra Scandal

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
If Brian Harrison and W. G. Stover, the two Solyndra executives who took the Fifth Amendment at a Congressional hearing on Friday, ever spend a day in jail, I'll stand on my head in Times Square.
It's not going to happen, for one simple reason: neither they, nor anyone else connected with Solyndra, have done anything remotely criminal. The company's recent bankruptcy -- which the Republicans are now rabidly ''investigating'' because Solyndra had the misfortune to receive a $535 million federally guaranteed loan from the Obama administration -- was largely brought on by a stunning collapse in the price of solar panels over the past year or so.
The company's innovative solar panels, high-priced to begin with, became increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace. Solyndra didn't have enough big commercial customers to create the necessary economies of scale. And although Harrison and Stover remained optimistic up to the bitter end -- insisting six weeks before the late-August bankruptcy filing that the company was going to be fine -- they ultimately failed to raise additional capital that would have allowed Solyndra to stay in business. 
The Republicans are trying to make that optimism appear sinister, but if we've learned anything from the financial crisis, it is that wishful thinking in the face of a collapsing market is not a crime. Otherwise, Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, would be wearing prison garb.
Harrison and Stover are on the hot seat. Anything they say in their defense -- even an off-hand remark -- can and will be used against them. Their lawyers would be fools if they didn't insist that their clients take the Fifth Amendment.
Do the Republicans know this? Of course. Do they care? Of course not. For an hour and a half on Friday morning, they peppered the two men with questions about this ''taxpayer ripoff,'' as Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, described it, knowing full well that Harrison and Stover would invoke their constitutional right to remain silent. Joe McCarthy would have been proud.
The purpose of the hearing -- indeed, the point of manufacturing a Solyndra investigation in the first place -- is to embarrass the president. That's how Washington works in the modern age: the party out of power gins up phony scandals aimed at hurting the party in power.
Undoubtedly, the Solyndra ''scandal'' will draw a little blood: there are some embarrassing e-mails showing the White House pushing to get the deal done quickly so it could tout Solyndra's green jobs as part of the stimulus package.
But if we could just stop playing gotcha for a second, we might realize that federal loan programs -- especially loans for innovative energy technologies -- virtually require the government to take risks the private sector won't take. Indeed, risk-taking is what these programs are all about. Sometimes, the risks pay off. Other times, they don't. It's not a taxpayer ripoff if you don't bat 1.000; on the contrary, a zero failure rate likely means that the program is too risk-averse. Thus, the real question the Solyndra case poses is this: Are the potential successes significant enough to negate the inevitable failures?
I have a hard time answering ''no.'' Most electricity today is generated by coal-fired power plants, operated by monopoly, state-regulated utilities. Because they've been around so long, and because coal is cheap, these plants have built-in cost advantages that no new technology can overcome without help. The federal guarantees help lower the cost of capital for technologies like solar; they help spur innovation; and they help encourage private investment. These are all worthy goals.
To say ''no'' is also to cede the solar panel industry to China, which last year alone provided some $30 billon in subsidies for its solar industry. Over all, the American solar industry is a big success story; it now employs more people than either steel or coal, and it's a net exporter.
But solar panel manufacturing -- a potential source of middle-class jobs, and an important reason the White House was so high on Solyndra, which made its panels in Fremont, Calif. -- is another story. Not so long ago, China made 6 percent of the world's solar panels. Now it makes 54 percent, and leads the world in solar panel manufacturing. Needless to say, the U.S. share of the market has shrunk. The only way America can manufacture competitive solar panels is to come up with innovative technologies that the Chinese can't replicate. Like, for instance, Solyndra's.
At the hearing on Friday, several of the Republican congressmen boasted that, in passing the continuing resolution to keep the government running the day before, they had succeeded in slashing the program that had made the loan to Solyndra. It's true: of the $4 billion that remained in the program, $1.5 billion was cut.
But the real winner isn't the American taxpayer or even the House Republicans. It's the Chinese solar industry.

HEADLINE: Yemen's Leader Abruptly Returns, Bringing Uncertainty

BYLINE: By LAURA KASINOF and ROBERT F. WORTH; Laura Kasinof reported from Sana, and Robert F. Worth from Washington. J. David Goodman contributed reporting from New York, and Steven Lee Myers from the United Nations.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh made a sudden return to Yemen on Friday after almost four months in a Saudi hospital, stunning his partisans and opponents alike, leaving many wondering whether his presence here in the capital would calm or worsen the political crisis that has gripped Yemen for six months.
While United States officials, apparently caught off guard by Mr. Saleh's return, said he should relinquish power, the besieged president called for a cease-fire after five days of bloody clashes on the streets of the capital. About 70 people have been killed since Sunday in gun battles between government troops and soldiers allied with the opposition.
''The solution is not in the barrels of guns and cannon, but in dialogue,'' Mr. Saleh said in a statement released by the state news agency. The report also said he planned to deliver a speech on Sunday. 
As word spread of Mr. Saleh's return earlier in the day, gunfire broke out across the capital -- much of it celebratory -- and mixed with the thundering of artillery as clashes continued in the city center. Protesters in cities across Yemen reacted with rage and defiance, though their voices have largely been drowned out in a conflict now dominated by armed tribesmen and soldiers.
Late in the day, fighting spread to the northern neighborhood of Hasaba, where government troops fought a bloody two-week battle with opposition tribal fighters in May. Around midnight, shells and sniper fire rained down on an antigovernment sit-in along a two-mile stretch of the Ring Road.
''They are firing at us by bomb and everything,'' said Nader al-Qershi, a youth protest leader, who said that he and a small group of friends fled inside the gates of Sana's Old University to escape the fighting.
Mr. Saleh has not been in Yemen since June, when he left to seek medical treatment in Saudi Arabia after a bomb blast at his palace mosque left him seriously burned and killed several guards and a member of the governing party. A government investigation of the blast, with forensic assistance from the F.B.I., is expected to release its conclusions soon, and that could also have unpredictable effects on Yemen's tense political scene. Yemeni officials have hinted that the report may point to Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsin al-Ahmar, a top-ranking general who defected to the opposition in May, as the culprit.
Mr. Saleh's return was shrouded in mystery, with many diplomats saying they were not aware of it until it was broadcast by state television. Saudi and American diplomats had urged Mr. Saleh to stay in Riyadh, fearing that his return would provoke more violence. But neither country felt it had the right to dictate terms to him, according to one Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, under standard diplomatic protocol.
Obama administration officials appeared surprised by Mr. Saleh's return, though they acknowledged the possibility had existed for weeks following his recovery. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met in New York with ministers from the Persian Gulf states that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council only hours after his arrival in Yemen.
The council has brokered a plan for a political transition that would lead to Mr. Saleh's departure from power after 33 years of autocratic rule, and Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, reiterated American support for that plan and for a peaceful political transition.
''Whether President Saleh is in or out of the country, he can make that happen by signing this accord, stepping down from power and allowing his country to move forward,'' Ms. Nuland said.
Mr. Saleh, who has long seen himself as the lone guarantor of his country's unity, hopes to re-establish his frayed authority by calming the recent round of violence, according to Yemeni officials and analysts on both sides of the political divide.
The latest fighting appears to be rooted in an old rivalry between Mr. Saleh's son Ahmed Ali Saleh, the commander of the elite Republican Guards, and his former ally, General Ahmar, the renegade commander of the First Armored Division who has positioned himself as a sort of guardian of the protesters.
''He knows that his son and nephews aren't ready to solve'' the conflict, said one opposition leader, Muhammad al-Mutawakkil. ''I hope that Ali Abdullah Saleh can act now'' on a transfer of power.
Talks aimed at a transition seemed to be progressing last week, after Mr. Saleh authorized his deputy, Acting President Abed Rabbo Mansour al-Hadi, to conclude an agreement in his absence. Foreign diplomats issued statements suggesting that a final deal to transfer power was just days away. Then the violence broke out, scuttling the talks and leading the chief mediator, Abdul Latif bin Rashid al-Zayani, the head of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to leave Yemen.
Many Yemenis concluded that the fighting was a deliberate effort to derail the talks by factional leaders who are still angling for a greater share of power.
Patching up the feuds will require all of Mr. Saleh's legendary skills as a power broker. His son and General Ahmar have a long history of mutual dislike, and one of the president's goals is to ensure the continuing power of his own family in any transition, or to at least their immunity from prosecution or retaliation.
Even that transition remains uncertain, despite months of rebellions and Mr. Saleh's promises to step down. He has repeatedly backed away from a proposal to transfer power to a coalition government, angering American and Arab mediators who helped craft the deal and worsening an atmosphere of mistrust. Mr. Saleh's aides now speak of a modified transition in which he would preside over a new round of elections in the coming months.
Opposition leaders dismiss those proposals, saying they want a new government swept clean of Mr. Saleh and his family -- much like the rebels in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya demanded of their governments.
The turmoil has created layers of hardship for Yemen. The nation, already the Arab world's poorest before the crisis, faces a worsening economic crisis and a spreading vacuum of authority in its northern and southern reaches, where militants allied with Al Qaeda have operated with increasing impunity in recent months, despite a campaign of American drone strikes.
On Friday, the president's jubilant supporters rode atop honking minibuses in government-controlled areas of the capital and shouted, ''The people want Ali Abdullah Saleh!'' as thousands more gathered at a rally nearby, waving photographs of the president and the flags of his ruling party.
Two miles away, protesters at the antigovernment sit-in seemed shocked, and said they were sure Mr. Saleh's return would touch off new violence. Thousands pumped their fists and chanted ''The people want to prosecute the killer!''
Not far away, another part of central Sana remained a war zone, with bullets echoing through empty streets. Opposition-allied soldiers crouched behind bunkers, guns at the ready, as snipers fired down from rooftops.
Protesters seemed unanimous in their feeling that Mr. Saleh came back for war and that he would never cooperate with a political solution that requires him to step down.
''This is partly good and partly bad,'' said Ezzadine Nuweri, 20, who was shot in the abdomen in a major attack on the protest in March. ''It will increase support for our revolution now that Ali Abdullah Saleh is back. But it also means the situation here might explode into war.''

HEADLINE: Global Arms Sales Dropped Sharply in 2010, Congressional Study Finds

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The global economic crisis may set off upheaval and even unrest, but the ability of the world's governments to buy new military hardware was sharply curtailed last year by strains on their national treasuries, according to a new Congressional study. 
Worldwide arms sales in 2010 totaled $40.4 billion, a drop of 38 percent from the $65.2 billion in arms deals signed in 2009 and the lowest total since 2003, the study found.
Even in this tight market, the United States maintained its dominating position in the global arms bazaar, signing $21.3 billion in worldwide arms sales, or 52.7 percent of all weapons deals, a drop from $22.6 billion in 2009.
Russia was second with $7.8 billion in arms sales in 2010, or 19.3 percent of the market, compared with $12.8 billion in 2009. Following the United States and Russia in sales were France, Britain, China, Germany and Italy.
Developing nations continued to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales, according to the report, by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. The annual study is considered the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the public.
The report found that the total value of arms transfer deals with developing nations last year was $30.7 billion, or 76.2 percent of worldwide deals. That was a drop from $49.8 billion in 2009.
India, which signed $5.8 billion in weapons transfer deals, was the top purchaser in the developing world last year, followed by Taiwan with $2.7 billion in agreements and Saudi Arabia with $2.2 billion in deals. Other major purchasers were Egypt, Israel, Algeria, Syria, South Korea, Singapore and Jordan.
The United States was not only the largest weapons supplier last year, but also the main source of weapons to the developing world, accounting for about $14.9 billion of these deals -- or 48.6 percent. That was a striking rise from 2009, when its sales of $15.1 billion to developing nations accounted for 30.3 percent of the market.
Russia was second in arms deals with developing nations last year, signing $7.6 billion in agreements, or about 24.7 percent.
''Worldwide weapons sales declined generally in 2010 in response to the constraints created by the tenuous state of the global economy,'' wrote Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in international security at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.
''In view of budget difficulties faced by many purchasing nations, they chose to defer or limit the purchase of new major weapons systems,'' he wrote. ''Some nations chose to limit their buying to upgrades of existing systems or to training and support services.''
To compare weapons sales over various years, the study used figures in 2010 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to give a constant financial measurement.

HEADLINE: In Time of Scrimping, Fun Stuff Is Still Selling

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
With a flat job market and an economy that will not improve, Americans are once again buckling down and cutting back.
At least on the things that they can resist.
Consumers at all income levels have been splurging on indulgences while paring many humdrum household expenses, according to industry data for the last year. Many retailers also report that while fripperies like purses and perfumes are best sellers, they cannot get shoppers interested in basics like diapers, socks and vacuum bags.
''My birthday is coming up, so I'm treating myself,'' said Ragan Belton, a social worker leaving the Macy's in Manhattan with newly styled hair and a pair of shoes. 
Consumer psychologists say that in this uncertain economy -- coming after one of the worst recessions in generations -- it is just too hard being good all the time.
''People have a limited supply of energy to put toward controlling their urges,'' Kathleen D. Vohs, a professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota, said in an e-mail. Ms. Vohs studies spending behavior at the university's Carlson School of Management.
Many of the products selling briskly are not high-priced, but they could be on a party supply list: premixed cocktails and coolers, cheesecake, cosmetics and wine. Meanwhile, sales of staples like batteries, bleach and fertilizer have declined sharply.
The pattern has shifted since the recession, when shoppers stocked up on basics but consumer spending and overall retail sales plummeted. Now, despite persistent consumer pessimism, spending is holding up, retailers have posted consistent profits and some companies that make the fun stuff are reporting especially strong results.
The cosmetics maker Estee Lauder, for example, announced last month that it had recorded its strongest fiscal year in North America in a decade, and a competitor, L'Oreal, said its first-half net profit was up 12 percent from a year ago. Last week, a crush of shoppers hoping to buy a cheaper line of Missoni fashions at Target brought down the retailer's Web site for the better part of a day.
''When the crisis hit and people really started to feel a pinch in their pocketbooks, they started to spend less across the board, especially in discretionary kinds of things,'' said Vicki G. Morwitz, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''But it's difficult, I think, for people to do that for a long time, even when they need to.''
Economists say the spending does not translate into a broader shift in consumer confidence, nor does it point to an economic revival. In the long run, basics are the bread and butter of retailing, and when they slump, the industry as a whole eventually feels the pinch. Also, some analysts say, many shoppers remain price-conscious, even about their indulgences. That means they tend to gravitate toward cheaper imports, which might help on the retail employment front but does not create manufacturing jobs domestically.
''The toughest businesses, frankly, have been in the middle of the basics assortments,'' Myron E. Ullman III, chairman and chief executive of J. C. Penney, told investors last month, referring to clothing staples. In the company's second quarter, shoes, handbags and jewelry were top sellers.
At Kohl's, similar categories -- watches, handbags and women's shoes -- were among the strong sellers in the second quarter.
''The psychology of the customer is you can -- I hate to sound too esoteric here -- but you can improve your outfit or dress up your outfit without buying a new outfit by buying a new handbag,'' said Kevin Mansell, chief executive of Kohl's. ''It makes people feel better.''
Unit sales of premade cocktails and coolers, which declined in the first two years of the recession, have jumped 24 percent in the last year. A similar pattern holds with many other indulgent items, which dropped in sales when the recession hit. In the last year, though, sales of body scrubbers jumped 21 percent, cosmetic accessories rose 22 percent and nail polish rose 10 percent. Refrigerated baked goods were up 16 percent, and wine 6 percent. The figures come from SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm in Chicago, that tracked sales at most major stores, excluding Wal-Mart, for the 52 weeks ending July 10.
''In a poor economy, at any given moment people are more likely to have problems with self-control than otherwise -- because there's only so far their self-control energy can be stretched,'' said Ms. Vohs, the professor of marketing.
Some of the products that declined are associated with household chores. Fertilizer and weed killer dropped 19 percent, as did vacuum bags. Thermometers declined by 20 percent, and flashlights and batteries by 10 percent. Diapers, bleach, shoe polish, car wax and socks are also on a downward trajectory, the data shows. Of course, not all products fit neatly into these trends. Experts are still pondering the run on meat pies, the sales of which jumped 15 percent.
People interviewed about their shopping practices sounded as if they had grown tired of budgeting. Ms. Belton, the shopper at Macy's, said that she had curtailed spending as her hours and pay decreased, but that she needed a break from the austerity. ''This was one of the first times shopping in six months,'' she said.
Outside a Sephora store in Times Square, Angela Spencer, 50, said, ''I may not buy as much, but I accessorize more.'' She splurges, she said, ''only if I really got to have it.''
One thriving category in the treat-yourself economy has been cheesecake, with sales rising 22 percent in the last year, according to the SymphonyIRI data.
At Junior's Cheesecake, a Brooklyn-based restaurant and cheesecake store, a co-founder, Alan Rosen, said sales at the 61-year-old company were increasing again after dropping for the first time ever during the recession.
''People want to get back to living -- it's become a more adjusted normal,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stance on Immigration May Hurt Perry Early On

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
With a single phrase implying his opponents are heartless, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas plumbed a profound divide between his views on illegal immigration and those of many grass-roots conservatives, who up to now have been the core of his support for the Republican nomination.
Mr. Perry summoned the phrase in a debate on Thursday night to justify a Texas law that lets some children of illegal immigrants pay in-state tuition at public colleges. If you oppose it, he said, ''I don't think you have a heart.'' 
His remarks were instantly seized upon by rivals, none more so than Mitt Romney, who vetoed a similar bill as Massachusetts governor.
''I think if you're opposed to illegal immigration, it doesn't mean that you don't have a heart,'' he said Friday to a group of conservative activists. ''It means that you have a heart and a brain.''
And so the deeply visceral issue of illegal immigration has shown that geography sometimes trumps ideology in politics: as governor of a border state with a large Hispanic population and entwined cultural identities, Mr. Perry has a more moderate, nuanced position than his rivals.
The governor shepherded, with bipartisan support, the 2001 legislation in Texas letting the undocumented children of illegal immigrants pay in-state tuition for higher education, and he has been opposed to a fence the length of the Texas-Mexico border.
But these issues are potentially treacherous for Mr. Perry in early-nominating states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- where the populations are largely non-Hispanic but keenly aware of a growing number of immigrants.
''We just looked so much like each other for so long, some people see new faces and it scares them,'' said Eric Woolson, the communications director in Iowa for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who called for a fence ''on every mile, on every yard, on every foot'' of the border during Thursday night's debate.
Illegal immigration scarcely registers as a top concern in polls of Republican voters, and candidates rarely bring it up in their stump speeches. But at nearly every campaign rally an audience member or two, grumbling about ''anchor babies,'' asks what a candidate plans to do. What many are looking for is to be thrown a side of beef: fence the border, check workers' identifications, deport the law-breakers.
In this context, Mr. Perry, who on almost all other issues has strong Tea Party credentials, is a Lone Star anomaly.
He has called building a 1,200-mile fence the length of the border ''idiocy'' and opposes requiring businesses to use the federal E-Verify program to check an employee's immigration status.
The legislation making Texas the first state to allow high school graduates who are not here legally to attend public colleges on in-state tuition was passed with the endorsement of business groups.
''The future of the business community is having a well-educated work force,'' said Charles C. Foster, chairman of immigration issues for the Greater Houston Partnership, a business coalition that supports the law. ''We realize the trajectory of Texas is no longer going to be an industrial, steel-age state. It's going to be based on brain power.''
The law inspired other states to imitate it, including California and New York. In Texas about 22,700 students benefited from the tuition discount through 2010, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
''Any governor of a border state always sees things differently,'' said Lionel Sosa, who was a consultant on Hispanic media to the campaigns of two earlier Republican presidential candidates, George W. Bush and John McCain, each border-state moderates on these issues.
''Somebody like Perry already has a record with immigration, and it's hurting him now,'' he said. ''If he happens to make it all the way to the end, it'll help him with the Latino vote'' in the general election.
In the meantime, though, he is being flayed by rivals. Mr. Romney calls the tuition discount a ''subsidy'' worth as much as $100,000 to a four-year student and a ''magnet'' to illegal residents.
Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, called Mr. Perry ''soft on illegal immigration'' during the debate, in Orlando, Fla., and framed the issue as a burden to taxpayers. ''Why should they be given preferential treatment as an illegal in this country?'' he said to cheers from the audience.
The issue is clearly hurting Mr. Perry, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ''He was sold as the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. Now Romney has gotten an immigration baton to use on Perry's head. It's manna from heaven for Romney. He's hitting him from the right.''
Political analysts in Texas noted that in the last couple of years, as the Republican Party nationally has marched rightward on immigration, Mr. Perry has also. This year he tried to have the Legislature prohibit ''sanctuary cities'' that restrain the police from asking detainees about immigration status, but the measure failed after Republican business leaders opposed it.
Although Mr. Perry's opponents are vying to define themselves as hard-liners on illegal immigration, there is danger for an eventual nominee who has alienated Hispanic voters in the process.
They are a crucial voting bloc in an increasing number of swing states, from Florida to Colorado to New Mexico. If Republicans cannot attract around 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, they will be in trouble, Mr. Sabato said.
''Like most Americans, the No. 1 issue to Latinos is jobs and the economy,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles in Washington.
''If you say something that antagonizes Latino voters during the primary and become the nominee, you're going to have a hard time. Latinos are not going to forget.''

HEADLINE: Perry's Bad Night

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Gloom pervades the land. Some people believe it's the economy. Others blame the weather. I think it's because the country is gradually coming to grips with the fact that Mitt Romney is going to be the Republican nominee for president.
It is a scientific fact. Every minute, somewhere in America, another citizen realizes that Mitt is going to be in our face for the next 14 months. Conceivably for the next nine years. Children now in third grade might graduate from high school without ever experiencing a totally Romney-free day. 
This is not something I'm happy pointing out. For one thing, I don't want to believe I live in a country that would seriously consider bestowing the nation's highest office on a man who once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car. Plus, we have barely gotten started on Rick Perry, the last great Mitt alternative. Have you noticed how huge his chest and shoulders are? Looming over his lectern at Thursday's debate, he looked like a float.
But it was impossible to watch that debate without realizing that Perry is not presidential timber, or even presidential polyurethane.
Here was Perry's answer to the inevitable question about what he'd do if the White House phone rang at 3 a.m. In this case, the hypothetical call informed the hypothetical President Perry that the Taliban had gotten control of Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
''Well, obviously, before you ever get to that point, you have to build a relationship in that region. And that's one of the things that this administration has not done. Just yesterday we found out through Admiral Mullen that Haqqani has been involved with -- and that's the terrorist group directly associated with the Pakistani country -- so to have a relationship with India, to make sure that India knows that they are an ally of the United States.''
He went on to tell a story about how the Obama administration wouldn't sell upgraded F-16 fighters to India. Which never happened.
Romney, meanwhile, was very much on his game, glib and grinning madly. He lashed into Perry for the Texas version of the Dream Act. (''If you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount!'') One of the very few silver linings in this story is that over the next year we'll all have a number of opportunities to revisit the saga of the undocumented immigrants who used to mow the Romney lawn.
The debate stage was crowded with other would-be candidates, most of them pretty well worn. The only newbie, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, made a big splash with a joke about how his neighbor's two dogs produced more shovel-ready projects than Barack Obama did. Johnson cracked the place up! Line of the night! Then on Friday everyone discovered that Rush Limbaugh had told the joke the day before.
The dog-owning neighbor joins the ever-growing throng of Republican Imaginary People, along with the woman who told Michele Bachmann the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer made her daughter mentally retarded.
Perry appeared very cheerful during most of the debate -- he has a way of cocking his head and grinning as if he saw a waiter entering the room with a large dessert. Perhaps he was anticipating the triumphant moment when he would be able to nail Romney for being a flip-flopper. This appeared to be something he had prepared for. When the opportunity presented itself, this is what Perry said:
''I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with. Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of -- against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment? Was it -- was before -- he was before the social programs from the standpoint of -- he was for standing up for Roe versus Wade before he was against first -- Roe versus Wade? Him -- he was for Race to the Top. He's for Obamacare and now he's against it. I mean, we'll wait until tomorrow and -- and -- and see which Mitt Romney we're really talking to tonight.''
So there you are.
It is true that the nation has elected incoherent Texans to the White House before. But the first one had been vice president. And when George W. Bush was marching through the primaries, saying things that made no sense whatsoever, Republican voters told one another that if he got into trouble, he could always ask his parents for advice. I swear to you, that came up a lot. But I always thought it was an excuse, to cover the fact that they were really just trying to avoid John McCain.
And then in 2008, they nominated McCain just to avoid Mitt Romney. No wonder they're miserable.
Next week, give a Republican a cookie, just to show you understand.

HEADLINE: A Tryout Program for the Unemployed

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Desperate to find a way to get the nation's long-term unemployed back to work, President Obama and Republican leaders are supporting the expansion of a novel jobs program in Georgia to any other state that wants it.
Whether the program can be replicated on a scale big enough to make a dent in the unemployment rate, though, is far from clear.
Since the recession began, the Georgia program has been held up as a national example, and a close look shows that it has pleased employers and produced steady paychecks for workers. But economists say there is little evidence that participants find work faster. And a lack of promotion, limited oversight and budget constraints have limited the program, Georgia Works, to a tiny portion of the state's nearly half a million unemployed workers. Only about 120 people have been hired because of it this year.
That such a blip of success has been hailed as a central plank of the president's jobs plan, and one of the few with consistent bipartisan support, shows just how few viable solutions have emerged for perhaps the nation's most intractable problem -- how to get 14 million unemployed people working again. 
Already replicated by several other states, the Georgia initiative does not create jobs but allows workers to try out an existing position, unpaid, while continuing to receive unemployment benefits. At the end of eight weeks, the employer may take the worker on permanently. The program is voluntary, and participants may not work more than 24 hours a week.
Since the program began in 2003, only 18 percent of those who completed the training have been hired by the employer that trained them, according to data released this week by the state labor department. More recently, job placement has declined to about 10 percent. New Hampshire, North Carolina and Missouri report far better results from their programs, though they are still quite small. The Obama administration estimates that if every state opted in, the program would cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
Supporters of the effort say that hirings are not the only measure of success. The program keeps the unemployed tethered to a workplace environment. It can provide training -- under federal labor laws that forbid unpaid labor, it is required to, though the state labor department's literature refers to it as a ''free trial'' for employers.
Still, the program has given Lis Cap, 26, who lost her job as a graphic designer in August, the chance to acquire a valuable skill: writing code for smartphone apps. On a recent morning, she sat at a laptop in the dining room that serves as headquarters for a small technology company called AppedOn. From an iPad screen, an AppedOn programmer based in Asheville, N.C., coached her.
''It's a great opportunity for me to learn all I can about this area that I was interested in but had no solid experience in,'' said Ms. Cap, who taught herself to build Web sites but needed help when it came to apps. ''Without this, this would not be a job that I could apply for.''
It also might not be a job that AppedOn could fill, said Sosh Howell, the chief executive. App writers are in short supply, even at salaries of $40,000 to $50,000 a year. ''It's so hard to find people,'' he said, ''that our options come down to training someone, which is something we can't afford as a small business, or outsourcing to another country, which is not our preferred method.''
At the end of eight weeks, Mr. Howell will either hire Ms. Cap, or she will walk away with what she considers valuable training that she could not have gained any other way.
At Georgia State University, however, the story is different. Georgia State has hired 37 workers through the program, out of 54 who have begun trial periods. But the overseers of the program there acknowledged that for many, the program was more valuable as a foot in the door than as a learning experience. One auditioner was so proficient at Microsoft Access that she showed her prospective bosses how to improve their system. She was hired.
Another employee, Belinda Robinson, said she had repeatedly sent her resume to Georgia State but heard nothing until she volunteered for Georgia Works, thinking, ''I just need to meet someone who's in a position of power so I can sell myself.''
Unions and labor advocates like the National Employment Law Project have criticized the program as free labor for employers rather than training. The White House has tried to neutralize that complaint by ensuring that under its proposal, called Bridge to Work, the worker would receive the equivalent of minimum wage. States may apply for money to bolster unemployment benefits and to provide stipends for travel and child care, which would come out of a $4 billion federal fund meant to cover that and other re-employment programs in the jobs bill.
But Ross Eisenbrey, the vice president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, faulted the program for not requiring any investment from employers. ''It doesn't take much to create a situation where employers' expectations about what they have to pay really diminish and employee expectations about what their employers should give them just go into the toilet,'' Mr. Eisenbrey said.
The White House proposal tweaks the program to focus on the long-term unemployed by restricting it to those who have been receiving benefits for more than 26 weeks, and seeks to curtail abuse by barring employers who use it repeatedly without making hires.
Timothy J. Bartik, the senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, said that he saw no problem with trying out programs like Georgia Works, but that wage subsidies would have a greater impact, even if they were more expensive. ''As far as I can see, there's nothing in this that creates jobs,'' he said. ''It's mainly reshuffling jobs among the folks that are unemployed.''
The Georgia Works program began in 2003 as part of a multipronged attempt to modernize an unemployment system that was still heavily geared toward jobs in manufacturing, said Michael L. Thurmond, the Democrat who was the state's labor commissioner at the time. It was meant to allow workers with outdated skills to try new fields without jeopardizing their unemployment check.
When the recession hit, the program's goals shifted. ''At first it was helping job seekers who had multiple barriers to employment,'' Mr. Thurmond said. ''Now the focus has shifted to incentivizing hiring by employers in the private sector.''
In 2009, Republican leaders including John A. Boehner and Eric Cantor put the program in a ''no-cost jobs plan'' they submitted to President Obama.
But the program was not cost-free. Mr. Thurmond gradually expanded eligibility until, last year, it opened up to unemployed people no longer receiving benefits. At the same time, he increased the stipend from $300 over eight weeks to $600 over six weeks. The program swelled, and stipend costs rose from $500,000 a month to more than $2 million. Still, Mr. Thurmond said, the costs were offset by savings to the unemployment trust fund and to employers, whose savings he estimates at $4,600 for each trainee hired.
Mr. Thurmond ran unsuccessfully for a United States Senate seat. His successor, Mark Butler, a Republican, said the program was unaffordable and rolled back eligibility and the stipend. Enrollment fell to fewer than two dozen new participants a month.

HEADLINE: A Tax Plan That Might Not Be So Painful

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If you're among the households with earnings of $200,000 to $350,000 or so, you can be forgiven at this point for thinking that you have a giant target on your back.
This week, President Obama once again took aim at what he calls ''tax preferences'' for these high-income households, proposing two changes that would affect the low six-figure set starting in 2013.
First, he would let former President George W. Bush's tax cuts expire for higher-income households. Second, he would limit the rate at which high-income taxpayers -- married people with over $250,000 in household income filing a joint return and singles with more than $200,000 -- can reduce their tax liability to a maximum of 28 percent. This limit would apply to all itemized deductions, among other things, if President Obama gets his way, which would have the effect of causing many people to pay more in taxes.
Forget for a moment that President Obama will almost certainly not get his way, given that even bills to help American victims of natural disasters don't get a rubber stamp in Congress anymore. And let's save for another day the debate over whether people with incomes like this deserve any sympathy. 
What gets lost in all of the hand-wringing over the proposed tax increases is that many of the people this is aimed at wouldn't pay a whole lot more. And families who work at it just a bit, using employer-sponsored flexible spending and other accounts to pay for things like day camp and the commuter train and visits to the therapist, could offset that 2013 tax increase and then some.
How could it be that this supposed tax increase won't amount to much for many people? Thank the alternative minimum tax. Hey, at least it's good for something.
Consider this hypothetical family and the numbers that would end up on their tax worksheets, as calculated by Joan Trimble, a tax partner at Berdon L.L.P., an accounting and advisory firm in New York City.
The family includes a married, heterosexual couple earning $350,000 combined annually that received no raises from 2011 to 2013, lives in the suburbs of New York City and has two children. They pay $20,000 in real estate taxes each year and $24,000 in annual interest toward their mortgage, make a total of $30,000 in 401(k) contributions and give away $9,000 in charitable contributions in all three years.
Let's assume that the annual A.M.T. patch continues to occur each year -- the patch adjusts the calculation that accounts for inflation to avoid ensnaring even larger numbers of taxpayers. (That assumption is a pretty safe one, though who would have predicted that you could elect to pay no estate taxes in 2010?) With the patch, this couple will pay tax at the A.M.T. rate in 2011 and 2012. Their total federal taxes in each of those years will be $65,604.
If the Bush tax cuts expire in 2013, they'll no longer be paying the A.M.T. rate. But their income taxes will be only $66,981, just $1,377 more than 2012.
That number does not take into account the president's proposed 28 percent deduction limit. Ms. Trimble said that there was a lot of debate in tax circles about precisely how it would work in practice.
But if the proposal simply means that you calculate taxable income for 2013 and then pay 28 percent of it, you get $69,633, or just $4,029 more than the family would have paid in 2011 and 2012. (Also, $900 of that increase in 2013 isn't even attributable to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts or the 28 percent cap; it comes from the recent increase in taxes on higher-net-worth households to pay for Medicare, which goes into effect in 2013.)
So the hit isn't all that bad. And you can make it go away entirely and then some by finally signing up for (and maxing out your set-asides in) those flexible spending and other accounts for health and dependent care plus public transportation or parking. With these accounts, your employer makes it possible to put aside money before it takes out income taxes (or to make a deposit in a way that qualifies you for a deduction).
Let's say our hypothetical family was like, oh, a lot of you. This family couldn't be bothered chasing what seemed like pocket change each month, filling out flexible spending account forms, carrying around debit cards, putting in for reimbursement or worrying about money in the health care account expiring at the end of each year.
In the world of health care flexible spending accounts, for instance, just 23 percent of people who have access to the accounts at employers with more than 500 workers actually sign up, according to Mercer's 2010 national survey of employer-sponsored health plans.
But come 2013 and the tax increases, the family maximizes all available employee benefits. So they put a total of $5,000, the maximum, in a dependent care account to pay for day camp for the two children. They also set aside a total of $2,500 from their paychecks for the health care costs that insurance doesn't cover. Since they both use public transportation to get to jobs in the city, they each ask their employers to remove $230 per month (which is the current monthly limit) and load it onto a debit card that they can use to pay for train tickets. Also, one of them has a health insurance plan at work with a high enough deductible that the family is eligible for a health savings account and the deduction that comes with it, so they put in the maximum household amount for 2011, $6,150.
The result of all this maneuvering would be $5,800 less in taxes owed for 2013 than what they would have otherwise paid. That more than makes up for what would have been a $4,029 increase from 2011 to 2013 had they never gotten around to signing up for all of these tax benefits.
There are a few caveats to keep in mind here. Your employer needs to offer the plans in the first place for you to take advantage of them. Big companies tend to offer most of them, but smaller ones may not offer any.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that among individual civilian workers who took home more than $81,806 in 2010 (which would put them in the 90th percentile of earnings), 22 percent had access to a health savings account, 64 percent had access to a health care flexible spending account and 61 percent could participate in a dependent care account. If your employer doesn't offer all of these benefits, get your fellow workers together and lobby hard for adding the plans.
Then there is the possibility that the rules for these tax deals might themselves change. The contribution limit for flexible spending accounts will be $2,500 in 2013, lower than it has been in the past. If you think more pain is coming in this area, then start maxing out these accounts in 2012 and not 2013.
Also retirees with high incomes who lack these employer accounts probably wouldn't be able to offset the tax increase in 2013 and could be hurt further by the president's proposed tax changes, depending on what sort of investment income they have and how it ends up being taxed.
In the meantime, try to look at the bright side. The president's plan could still let you deduct the mortgage interest on your lakeside second home, within reason. Your contribution to Harvard's $32 billion endowment will still be tax-deductible. Same thing for, say, a fancy church or synagogue in all of the bucolic suburban hamlets in the land. While you're at it, don't forget to thank the tax gods for 20 years of tax-free earnings in 529 college savings accounts, no matter how rich you already are.
And if all you'd have to do to reduce your 2013 tax bill is set up accounts to reimburse yourself for things that you're spending money on anyway? Well, anyone who even remotely resembles our hypothetical couple and complains about these few extra steps doesn't know what real tax pain actually feels like.

HEADLINE: U.S., Anxious On Debt Crisis, Presses Europe

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, increasingly alarmed by the spillover effects of Europe's financial crisis, has begun an intensive lobbying campaign to persuade Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders to ramp up efforts to stem any contagion from the debt crisis in Greece.
In phone calls and meetings over the last week, President Obama urged Mrs. Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France to take coordinated measures -- including spending billions in additional funds to bail out Greece and bolster European financial institutions -- to prevent Greece's debt woes from spreading to its neighbors.
The American pressure was on display again Friday and will be this weekend at a gathering of the world's finance ministers in Washington.
Yet administration officials played down the likelihood of concerted action emerging from these meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At best, they said, the ministers might lay the groundwork for a bolder response in November, when leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized nations meet in Cannes, France. 
Recognition is growing that Europe's debt crisis is now perhaps the largest shadow hanging over the global economy. Although trade with Europe represents only a small share of the American economy, Europe's problems have repeatedly rattled Wall Street over the last year and a half, eroding confidence and deepening fears of businesses and consumers.
''The biggest single risk to the United States today is that the European situation will spiral out of control,'' said Edwin M. Truman, a former Treasury official who is now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ''Europe is not going to save the U.S. economy, but it could be the straw that breaks it.''
Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has written about the history of financial crises, puts Europe's effect on the United States in blunt political terms. ''The downside scenario is awful,'' he said, ''and if it happens before the U.S. election, it would turn a toss-up election into one in which the president is a huge underdog.
''The administration's hope is that the Europeans will kick the can down the road far enough that it gets past the election,'' said Mr. Rogoff, who has advised Mr. Obama and Republicans.
The administration has trained much of its attention on the figure who may have the greatest ability to influence the outcome in Europe: Mrs. Merkel, the German chancellor. Since he took office, Mr. Obama has met or spoken with Mrs. Merkel 28 times -- a pace befitting someone who may have as much influence on his fortunes as his rivals in Washington.
In their most recent call, on Monday, Mr. Obama encouraged Mrs. Merkel to throw more financial firepower at the crisis. The conversation delved into technical details, as well as the risk of financial contagion, said a senior administration official who was not authorized to discuss the call and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mrs. Merkel faces daunting political obstacles -- which Mr. Obama fully recognizes, this official said -- in persuading the German public to spend hundreds of billions of euros to bail out Greece and potentially other Mediterranean countries.
While the United States is offering lessons drawn from its own crisis in 2008, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and other officials are treading carefully to avoid antagonizing Europeans who complain the United States has no business lecturing them. When Mr. Geithner attended a meeting of European finance ministers last week in Wroclaw, Poland, a handful of officials from smaller countries criticized him afterward, but American officials said the meeting was more productive behind closed doors.
The administration's lobbying effort takes two main forms. One is to press the argument, supported by many economists, that Germany benefits enormously from preserving the euro in its current form rather than abandoning it or standing by as it collapses.
By combining its Deutschmark with the currencies of poorer countries, like Greece, Germany has been able to have a cheaper currency than it would on its own and to export far more than it otherwise might. And exports, which account for a larger share of the German economy than the American economy, have been the main engine of Germany's recovery.
''There's a growing narrative that this is a morality play, that this is all about fiscal profligacy in Southern Europe,'' said Austan Goolsbee, a former top economic adviser to Mr. Obama, speaking on a panel discussion Thursday at the I.M.F. offices. ''But if the Germans are saying, 'We don't like the spending by Southern Europe,' they must also recognize that they've been the great beneficiaries.''
The second part of the American effort involves pushing European leaders to strengthen the institutions at the center of their response to the crisis: the European Financial Stability Facility, which is the Continent's main bailout fund, and the European Central Bank.
There is widespread agreement among outside observers, including Americans like Mr. Goolsbee, that the current bailout fund of 440 billion euros ($600 billion) is not large enough. But there is also doubt about the political and financial ability of some countries to increase their contributions. Officials are focusing instead on ways to leverage its power.
In a communique issued by the Group of 20 in Washington on Thursday, finance ministers noted that European governments were taking actions to make the fund more flexible and ''maximize its impact in order to address contagion.''
''We need the right firewall to prevent contagion,'' Francois Baron, the French finance minister, said on Thursday. ''We can discuss how to give it the necessary strength.''
One option for making the fund more flexible, suggested by American officials, is a program in which governments use their pooled resources to guarantee loans for investors who buy the debt of troubled countries. The loans would be made by the European Central Bank, but the finance facility would absorb any losses, leveraging its resources because it could guarantee bonds with an aggregate value many times larger than its available funds.
Such a program would be a variant on an American effort, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, that was operated with mixed results by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the wake of the 2008 crisis.
American officials have also emphasized the Fed's outsize role in responding to the financial crisis here and urged Europe to view the Fed as a model. It made trillions of dollars in loans so that investors remained able to buy and sell a wide range of financial products.
The Fed also has pressed down repeatedly on interest rates to reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. The European Central Bank has been more cautious, actually raising interest rates earlier this year.
''The set of solutions and methods to address the situation is quite well known,'' said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., at the start of the meetings. The challenge, she added, was ''pushing the leaders into the direction where they have to take much-needed, more action than what has already been done.''

HEADLINE: For Mayor, Waste Mars Another Digital Project

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Soon after becoming mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg announced a plan to modernize the computer system that handles personnel information for New York City's vast work force. The $66 million project was to be one of the signature technological innovations of his tenure.
Nine years later, his administration has already spent $363 million -- and the work is far from done.
The administration has pressed ahead despite repeated warnings that the project is deeply troubled, according to a review of thousands of pages of city records, as well as dozens of interviews with officials and private contractors.
The administration's own internal monitors regularly filed reports detailing chronic mismanagement, cost overruns and rampant waste. 
''It was a runaway project,'' said Raj Agarwal, a city official who managed the early stages of the new system before resigning in frustration over what he saw as the administration's incompetence.
The administration has already weathered a scandal surrounding another sprawling project, CityTime, which was supposed to revamp the city's payroll operations. The little-known tale of the personnel system offers fresh evidence that Mr. Bloomberg, who made his fortune revolutionizing information technology for Wall Street, has had difficulty carrying out a pledge to do the same with city government.
In both projects, the administration, bent on proving that outside consultants could improve the workings of government, ignored clear signs that the projects were foundering, the interviews and records show.
''No sense of economy, efficiency or value is evident in any area of the project,'' the administration's contract monitors wrote about the personnel system in March 2003, according to an internal report obtained under the Freedom of Information Law.
By this year, not much had changed. In February, the monitors said important parts of the personnel system were ''not properly structured and organized,'' adding that the project was ''lacking executive leadership.''
This leadership vacuum contributed significantly to rising costs and delays, the interviews and records indicate. The administration delegated the project to officials who did not have the authority to make important decisions and who squandered opportunities to reduce costs. Its expensive private consultants often seemed not up to the task.
Yet throughout this time, aides to Mr. Bloomberg publicly portrayed the project as advancing smoothly. After a rudimentary version of the system went live, the administration even cited the project as one of the city's best in 2007, giving it an ''excellence in technology'' prize and praising its ''innovation and teamwork.''
Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for the administration, said the project had been an ''enormous undertaking'' and a success. She said the personnel system was already ''making our human resources operation more efficient and cost effective.''
She brushed aside comparisons to CityTime. The two projects have ''very little in common,'' she said, ''save for the fact that they are now both fully functional systems used daily by thousands of city employees.''
Several people have been indicted on federal fraud charges in the CityTime case. No accusation of criminality has emerged in the personnel project.
From the very start of his mayoralty, Mr. Bloomberg sought to use technology to overhaul the workings of city government. He increased technology spending by hundreds of millions of dollars, rolling out big initiatives like the 311 information hot line.
City Council members questioned the costs, but Mr. Bloomberg saw high-tech innovation as his mandate. ''The people that thought I had the skills to be the mayor at this period would say, 'Yes, that is one of the reasons we wanted Bloomberg,' '' he said in 2002. '' 'He modernizes things and brings people together with technology.' ''
The city's management of personnel information had been in the cross hairs of efficiency experts for years. No fewer than eight citywide systems, 200 agency systems and endless paperwork were required to administer employment benefits, to follow civil service rules and to move people in and out of jobs.
In June 2002, Mr. Bloomberg announced the first phase of the New York City Automated Personnel System, or Nycaps. It was a Web site where people could apply to take civil service exams.
Twelve days later, a user stumbled upon a devastating security flaw that let him see other users' personal information.
The new site -- and the entire project -- were quickly and quietly shut down. The city dismissed two consulting companies and the city official managing the project.
The Bloomberg administration vowed to fix Nycaps, but officials did not seem to learn from their own mistakes, interviews show.
Rather than asserting more control over the project, the administration delegated a far bigger role to Accenture, the prominent consulting firm, which was charging the city as much as $383 an hour. Accenture had originally been hired to put the system together. Now, the administration told the company also to define exactly what the system had to do.
When companies install such major software systems for their own use, they dislike giving both roles to the same contractor because it can lead to rising costs.
That is just what happened, according to records and interviews. After earning $8 million in 2004, Accenture was paid $26 million in 2005, $29 million in 2006 and $53 million in 2007.
The administration also brought in a new project manager, Mr. Agarwal, who had many years of experience setting up such systems in industry. But Mr. Agarwal, who worked for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, said in an interview that he was bewildered by the administration's oversight of the project.
Mr. Agarwal said he fought repeatedly with Accenture because the company was billing for too many workers on the project. But he said the administration seemed unconcerned.
He said he never met with a deputy mayor, despite the project's importance. ''I did not get the sense that the mayor's office was paying attention,'' he said.
Mr. Agarwal and other current and former city workers recalled that progress was repeatedly held up as city agencies squabbled over the system's design. (Some workers spoke on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared jeopardizing employment opportunities.)
One city agency would demand changes, only to have another require them to be redone.
The meddling started getting almost absurd, some workers recalled.
''Several agencies wanted the employee's emergency contact list to have an identifier that said, 'In this situation, call my wife; in another, call my girlfriend,' '' one programmer said.
The workers recalled that Accenture viewed the project as offering a convenient way to train interns and recent college graduates -- while billing as if they were experienced.
A quality-control expert said novice Accenture trainees would be taught programming languages and other skills while they were on Nycaps, then abruptly ''taken out of this project and used somewhere else.''
Officials at the city's Financial Information Services Agency, who were put in charge of the project by the administration in 2004, acknowledged problems with Accenture.
''Their profit model is to bring in as many junior-level staffers as they can,'' said Rose-Ellen Myers, the agency's deputy executive director.
The officials also acknowledged that lack of leadership resulted in costly, time-consuming ''management by committee.''
''Anybody on the outside would've wanted that more clear: 'I've got a vision, I want to do this, and everybody around me is going to go make that happen,' '' said Robert Townsend, the agency's executive director. ''That would've been a lot easier for us. But that's not our reality.''
An Accenture spokesman, Jim McAvoy, blamed the Bloomberg administration for the project's tortuous history.
''The increases in the cost and length of the project were driven by increases in scope directed by the city,'' Mr. McAvoy said by e-mail. ''The number of employees included in the system greatly increased and additional functions were added, such as training administration and performance management.''
Asked whether Accenture assigned recent college graduates and interns to the project, he said, ''The city reviewed and approved every time sheet.''
Mr. Agarwal, the project manager, said his track record on big software projects was stellar before he went to work for the city. But he said that after he realized that the administration had no idea what it was doing, he decided to resign in 2004, after barely a year.
The Bloomberg administration says a full-scale version of Nycaps was put into use in March. But it is far from the project envisioned in 2002.
Hundreds of thousands of retirees do not have access to the site. Of the current work force, tens of thousands of support-staff members and paraprofessionals in the schools are still not included.
Most glaring of all, the administration long ago abandoned its goal of modernizing the technology used to run the civil-service system, which was one of the primary reasons for creating such an ambitious plan in the first place.
The ancient computers that have operated the civil-service system since the 1980s will not hit the junk pile anytime soon.
Even when early phases of the system have been rolled out, problems have cropped up. In 2005, managers suddenly realized that they had never put together instructions for the Nycaps Web site. Other workers, with no prior training, were abruptly herded into a conference room to field reports of bugs and questions from users that they were ill equipped to answer.
Yet the flaws, missing pieces, delays and rising costs have come with scarcely any consequences for anyone in city government.
The Bloomberg administration has not fired or disciplined any city officials connected to Nycaps besides the project manager dismissed over the 2002 security breach, a spokeswoman said.
Officials at the Financial Information Services Agency expressed scorn for the deal they inherited, saying it was too generous to Accenture. But the agency never renegotiated it.
Still, the agency argued that it made the best of a bad situation. By 2007, it had largely shifted to paying Accenture a fixed price for each task, rather than an hourly fee.
The financial agency says Nycaps now gives city employees what many private-sector workers got long ago: the ability to access payroll and benefits information online. Transferring workers between agencies, administration officials said, now takes minutes instead of months.
The agency's managers said they could imagine many new features that could be added to the system. But they acknowledged that each of those would cost more money.
And someone will have to make those decisions.
For years, the administration had ignored calls from project monitors that it appoint a senior official to formulate personnel policy. Last December, Mr. Bloomberg named one -- Wayne A. Rustin, a senior executive at I.B.M.
In April, Mr. Rustin abruptly resigned to return to industry.
The mayor has not yet named a replacement.

HEADLINE: For Romney and Perry, a Day on the Island

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER AND JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry and Mitt Romney came to Mackinac - a scenic island on Lake Huron, where horse-drawn carriages are the only transportation and fudge reigns supreme - for the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference. 

 BODY:
MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. - Mitt Romney returned to the summer playground of his boyhood on Saturday morning, shortly before Gov. Rick Perry of Texas addressed hundreds of Republican activists and donors there.
Both men, who are considered the leading candidates for their party's presidential nomination, came to Mackinac - a scenic island on Lake Huron, where horse-drawn carriages are the only transportation and fudge reigns supreme - for the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference. 
The Michigan primary, which is scheduled to follow the first round of voting in Iowa and New Hampshire, will play a critical role in the Republican nominating process. Mr. Romney won the Michigan primary in 2008, but Republicans say that the rise of the Tea Party, which was reflected in state elections last year, has added a wrinkle to the political dynamic.
The National Republican Party chairman, Reince Priebus, urged party activists to rally behind the nominee - whoever it is. "There is no such thing as an absolutely perfect candidate. Only one perfect person has walked the earth," Mr. Priebus said. "We're going to win this election by addition and multiplication, not division and subtraction."
Mr. Perry, aware that he was a long way from Texas, alluded to Michigan's storied history as an automaker when he called Representative Candice Miller, who recently endorsed him and introduced him, "the Chevrolet of congresswomen - like a rock." And he recalled his father driving up to Michigan to buy a "new GMC pickup truck" after their farm had an especially good season.
"Speaking of Chevrolet, it is great to be in this part of the country, where they make some of the finest automobiles that this country has ever had," Mr. Perry said. "We were coming up here and they said, 'Don't mispronounce the island's name.' "
He made a point of pronouncing Mackinac Island correctly while referring in passing to a similar mispronunciation issue in Texas for the town of Mexia, and talked about how he was struck by the area's beauty while coming over on the ferry.
"What an incredibly beautiful place and, I might add, rather romantic as well, so I look forward to coming back with my wife," he said. 
Mr. Perry talked about his record of job growth as governor, joking that it was not Texas's notoriously hot summer that drew people to his state.
"There is a reason that all of those jobs moved to Texas over the course of that decade, and it wasn't because we just got great weather in August," Mr. Perry said. "In spite of that July, August, and September weather, they came, and they came because they know something instinctively, that there is still a land of opportunity in this country and one of those lands is Texas. I want to do that same thing for this country."
Though Mr. Perry never mentioned Mr. Romney by name, he did offer a not-so-subtle dig at his main rival, whom many Republicans believe outshone him at the most recent debate.
"Yep, there may be slicker candidates and there may be smoother debaters, but I know what I believe in and I'm going to stand on that belief every day," Mr. Perry said, to a small ripple of knowing laughter. "I will guide this country with a deep, deep rudder, knowing exactly what keeping the tax burden and the regulatory climate and having a regulatory system that doesn't allow for over-suing does for the small business men and women of this country."
The Republicans, many of whom were wearing blue Romney stickers, gave Mr. Perry a standing ovation and enthusiastic applause. But as they filtered out of the lunch, party activists did not show signs of being won over by his 15-minute speech.
"It's gutsy. I think it shows that he's pugnacious to come into the lion's den, so I give him props for that," said Tim Boyko, the Republican chairman from Charlevoix County. "It shows that he has self-confidence and is willing to show himself off."
But Mr. Boyko said the economic challenges facing the country require what he described as "a global thinker," which he believes better suits Mr. Romney. He said that Mr. Perry has failed to prove himself in the early debates.
 Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, was the governor of Michigan during the 1960s, and the state is considered his to lose. Mr. Romney's campaign likes to cite the 2008 Michigan primary as the moment when he finally hit his stride during his presidential bid four years ago.
Mr. Romney started the day with an early morning stop at a diner off the island in St. Ignace, where he chatted about his Michigan roots. The summer residence of the Michigan governor, a historic white pine mansion, sits upon a bluff on Mackinac Island, and it was where a young Mr. Romney first learned to water ski, and later brought his then girlfriend, Ann, for a day of biking, sailing and horse backriding for her 16th birthday. He is scheduled to address the crowd this evening. 
The chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, Bobby Schostak, offered a welcome on Saturday to both candidates. He said conservatives were excited by Mr. Perry's candidacy, but added that he expected the deep ties to the Romney family, which he described as "an affection that goes back to his dad," would give Mr. Romney a strong advantage in the state's primary.
"There is a strong connection there," Mr. Schostak said. "He's the one to beat in Michigan."
The admiration was clear from the moment Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, stepped off the ferry on Saturday morning, where a "Welcome Home Mitt" banner greeted them. As they walked along Main Street, it seemed at times as though they were leading an impromptu parade, with admirers rushing over to say hello and take a quick picture. Campaign volunteers, some of whom were waving signs saying, "Michigan loves Mitt," formed a backdrop.
After his speech, Mr. Perry held court behind closed doors with about three dozen Michigan Republican leaders. A crowd gathered outside, with people peering into the windows to find a smiling, laughing Texas governor working the room, which gave him a hearty round of applause when he finished.
It was unclear whether he signed on any new supporters. But if nothing else, Mackinac did not send Mr. Perry away empty-handed. A proud Eagle Scout, Mr. Perry was no doubt pleased with the discounts on fudge the island shops offered the rambunctious Boy Scouts who filled the cobblestone streets.

HEADLINE: Obama and Bill Clinton Tee Off

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama on Saturday broke with his usual practice of golfing with three junior aides and for the first time teed up with former President Bill Clinton, who has written a new book on the government's role in the 21st-century economy. 

 BODY:
Oh, to be a fly on the golf cart.
 President Obama on Saturday broke with his usual practice of golfing with three junior aides and for the first time teed up with former President Bill Clinton, who has written a new book on the government's role in the 21st-century economy.
 Completing the foursome at the Joint Base Andrews golf course outside Washington on a gray, muggy afternoon was Mr. Obama's chief of staff, William M. Daley, who was commerce secretary in Mr. Clinton's administration, and Doug Band, a longtime aide-de-camp to the former president.
 More than four hours later, their game was over and spokesmen for the current and former presidents issued a joint statement reporting that the two men "enjoyed their round of golf." It added, "Periodically, over the last two and a half years, they've gotten together to discuss the unique honor and extraordinary opportunity to lead this country. They were pleased to have the chance to visit once again today."
Mr. Obama expanded on his conversations with Mr. Clinton later, when he spoke at a gala dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. He told several thousand diners that he and Mr. Clinton talked about his resolve to let the Bush-era tax cuts expire after 2012 for high incomes - the top tax rates then would return to levels in place during Mr. Clinton's administration - and Mr. Clinton recalled that the economy thrived during his presidency despite Republicans' predictions otherwise.
 Mr. Obama has been criticized for not using his frequent golf outings to do a little business, like engaging with members of Congress or business leaders - as Mr. Clinton did when he was president. In June, Mr. Obama for the first time played with Speaker John A. Boehner, the Republican House leader and a fanatical golfer, but their collegiality ultimately did not yield business benefits. A month later their negotiations on a deficit-reduction compromise collapsed in acrimony, unsettling financial markets. 
 Dozens of times in the past, Mr. Obama has golfed with the same three or four aides, including one who is not long out of college. In a sign that Saturday was different, the small pool of reporters and photographers that always accompanies a president - and on golf trips usually waits out of sight in a clubhouse -- was briefly taken to a green just as Mr. Obama and Mr. Clinton were finishing up at the first hole and getting back into their cart. Mr. Daley and Mr. Band had a separate cart.
 After a few minutes, the press pool was ushered to a food court to wait. 
 Mr. Clinton, having put far behind him the ill will of the 2008 Democratic nomination race, lately has been outspoken in defense of Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy against Republicans' attacks. Occasionally Mr. Clinton has offered public advice, like suggesting in July that Mr. Obama could invoke the 14th Amendment to avoid a government default if Congressional Republicans refused to increase the federal debt limit. Mr. Obama rejected that counsel, saying his lawyers argued otherwise.
 As the last Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt to be re-elected, Mr. Clinton increasingly is asked in interviews what advice he has for Mr. Obama, whose prospects in 2012 have darkened as the economic recovery has seemed to stall. It is hard to imagine that the subject of politics did not come up in the golf cart.
 Mr. Clinton has distilled his political and policy thoughts into a 208-page book to be released in November, "Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy."
 Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton has been a cheerleader for federal aid to the infant green-energy industry, especially to counter China's growing market share. Mr. Obama calls his agenda for government investments in education, research and cutting-edge technology "Winning the Future"; similarly, Mr. Clinton will offer "a plan to get America 'back into the future business,' " according to a statement from the Alfred A. Knopf publishing house.
 The statement quotes Mr. Clinton as saying an implicit slap at Republicans: "There is no evidence that we can succeed in the twenty-first century with an antigovernment strategy, with a philosophy grounded in 'You're on your own' rather than 'We're all in this together.' "

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington and a recap of the president's weekly address. 

 BODY:
Today's Times
Less than six months after the fiscal confrontation that left the government on the precipice of a shutdown, Congress has brought the nation close to that point again. The Senate shot down a House measure that would have bridged the impasse over a bill to keep the government open after Sept. 30 and provide aid to disaster victims, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.The deeply visceral issue of illegal immigration has shown that geography sometimes trumps ideology in politics, Trip Gabriel reports. As leader of a border state with a large Hispanic population and entwined cultural identities, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has a more moderate, nuanced position than his rivals.The rest-of-the-pack candidates are offering starkly different visions for how the party might win the presidency without Mitt Romney or Governor Perry. In speeches to conservative activists and social conservatives in Florida, the other candidates are urging a variety of choices: pick someone who is electable, pick someone who is a true believer, or pick someone who is both, Michael D. Shear reports.The chief executive and the chief financial officer of Solyndra, the bankrupt solar company, took the Fifth Amendment before a House subcommittee on Friday as they were verbally pummeled by committee members until Democrats complained that the interrogation was becoming unseemly, Matt Wald reports.
Weekly Addresses
President Obama unfurled another aspect of his jobs agenda in his weekly address from the White House. Education, he said, is an essential part of his administration's plan to create an economy - and an America - that will flourish into the future. "It is an undeniable fact that countries who out-educate us today will out-compete us tomorrow," he said. With students in the United States trailing "too many other countries" in math, science and reading, the president expressed concern over the future of America's workforce. "Businesses will hire wherever the highly skilled, highly-trained workers are located," he said. "What this means is that if we're serious about building an economy that lasts - an economy in which hard work pays off with the opportunity for solid middle-class jobs - we had better be serious about education." That process will begin, he said, by providing students with the right resources - "quality schools, good teachers, the latest textbooks and the right technology" - and instituting changes based on the work of local teachers, principal, school boards and communities. "It is time to rebuild and modernize our schools," he said. "And it is time to raise our standards, up our game, and do everything it takes to prepare our children to succeed in the global economy."
Around the Web
A majority of Americans find it hard to differentiate between Mr. Obama's presidency and George W. Bush's, Politico reports.
Happenings in Washington
The Library of Congress will host the National Book Festival on the National Mall this Saturday. The event, will feature a variety of family-friendly activities and discussions with renowned authors.On Saturday night President Obama will attend the Congressional Black Caucus annual awards dinner.

HEADLINE: The Man In the Middle Is Thriving On the Net

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
San Francisco
NO journalist likes to be told he's naive. But that's what Zach Yungst, co-founder of cater2.me, told me after I wrote a Ping column suggesting that companies that pay for their employee's meals, as many high-tech firms do, retard the economic life of a neighborhood.
It's true that these companies, which are paying engineers $100,000 or $150,000 a year, have every incentive to keep their employees at their desks working, he said in an e-mail. Paying for a meal gets a firm another $50 to $70 of work from an office-bound worker during the lunch hour. 
Mr. Yungst and his business partner, Alex Lorton, have thought a lot about that. Cater2.me, the company they've started in San Francisco, delivers food from carts and small restaurants to businesses that aren't big enough to afford their own chefs. ''We fill a big void,'' says Mr. Yungst.
Mr. Yungst and Mr. Lorton are online much of the day reading food blogs, looking for trends and figuring out which chefs to approach on the weekends, but they are classic middlemen.
Hold on, though, wasn't that a job description that the Internet was destroying? There was even a 25-cent word for it: disintermediation. The Web, we were told, was eliminating the need for the layers of brokers, agents, wholesalers and even retailers that separate the consumer from the producer.
That has happened in some instances, drastically reducing the role of travel agents, for example. But consumers still need help and the Internet has provided the tools and the environment for companies like cater2.me to flourish. It has made it easier for middlemen to reach consumers and made it remarkably easy and inexpensive for these middlemen to create companies to do just that.
While there has been a lot of talk about how the technology industry does not create jobs on the scale of traditional manufacturing -- a shrunken General Motors still employs more people than a thriving Google -- the Internet has made it a lot easier to create a broad array of new small businesses.
Cater2.me is a good example of it. Both of its founders are Wharton business school graduates who began their careers in the kinds of jobs you'd expect B-schoolers to take; Mr. Yungst joined an investment bank and a private equity firm while Mr. Lorton took a job as a business consultant.
Mr. Yungst visited many offices in San Francisco, and strolled past food trucks on the city streets selling porchetta sandwiches, curries, barbecue and just about anything you can think of stuffed in a taco. This gave him an idea: if people can't get out to the food, Mr. Yungst would bring the food to them. Mr. Lorton, who had met Mr. Yungst when they were both freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania, liked the idea and joined him.
They talked to chefs who were just starting out, many of them hoping to break into the catering business while working in communal kitchens and running pop-up restaurants, farmers' market food stands or food trucks. The chefs lacked the time and the connections to get inside offices to sell their food.
The two partners found Feldo Nartapura outside a Mission district art gallery grilling skewers of Indonesian sate on a portable grill. Entree to the office-worker market has given him more business and spread his weekend-concentrated business over seven days.
''I have consistent work,'' he said. ''Before I'd only look forward to the weekend.''
Joseph Ahearne, who makes Argentine empanadas, says of the new arrangement, ''It helps to keep the wheels rolling.'' The consistent work means he has hired seven people to help him make little meat-filled pastries using his mother's recipe. Without worrying as much about drumming up business, he says, ''I can concentrate on the kitchen.''
All the while, the two were talking to financial and technology companies in downtown San Francisco. (The Internet doesn't eliminate the need for old-fashioned shoe leather.) Many companies were already having food delivered. Cater2.me's pitch was that they'd reliably provide variety.
This is where the Internet was a boon to the new middlemen. They could provide a slick order form that even the newest and lowliest employee -- the one often stuck with the task of coordinating lunch for everyone else -- could navigate. ''We understand the stresses on the person who orders the food,'' said Mr. Yungst. ''We make them look good.''
NOW, an office containing 10 to 250 people can order around 30 kinds of food from 70 vendors. One day it might be Dontaye Ball's barbecue and the next Veronica Salazar's chicken mole sliders. (''We call them sliders because people don't know they are hojaldritas,'' she says.) The company says that it provides Malaysian, Venezuelan, Jamaican and African meals as well as more familiar Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Italian food.
They built a back-end system that tracks which companies prefer what kind of foods. Cater2.me now has about 80 clients including prominent start-ups like Ngmoco, Yelp and Posterous.
The middlemen have put the chefs front and center with their clients. ''We never white label a product,'' says Mr. Lorton.
The chefs are pleased that new customers are becoming acquainted with their fare. People seek them out at farmers' markets or fairs. Mr. Nartapura's Satayisfied stand and Ms. Salazar's El Huarache Loco stand are now fixtures at San Francisco street food fairs.
Mr. Hall, who delivers his sandwiches and salads in his ''pulled-pork Prius,'' says, ''It's kind of cool to see corporate customers embrace street food.''

Before the police or news reporters had even arrived at the underpass outside Veracruz where gunmen held up traffic and dumped 35 bodies at rush hour last week, Twitter was already buzzing with fear and valuable information. The flurry of Twitter messages about the bodies arrived on the same day that the State Assembly in Veracruz made it a crime to use Twitter and other social networks to undermine public order.

INVESTIGATING IN TEAMS 
The Joint Mobile Group, with its main office in Nizhny Novgorod in the Russian republic of Chechnya, recruits lawyers and investigators from human rights organizations around the country to work in teams of three for a month or more to take on kidnapping and torture cases in the region that it considers too dangerous for resident human rights workers to handle.

Government officials ordered more tests after detecting elevated levels of radiation in rice crops near the crippled nuclear power plant at Fukushima. Radioactive substances have already been discovered in beef, milk, spinach and tea leaves, leading to recalls and bans on shipments. But officials have been especially worried about rice, which makes up a significant part of the Japanese diet. Page 17
ATLAS ERROR CAUSES A STIR
Scientists are taking issue with the Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World in its assertion that Greenland had lost 15 percent of its permanent ice cover from 1999 to 2011. That translates to 125,0000 cubic miles, according to a rough calculation by a glaciologist with the University of Toulouse, enough melted ice to raise sea levels three to five feet. The corresponding map in the atlas itself indicated that significant portions of Greenland's coastline had become ice-free. Page 17

Arizona, after almost a decade of sending monitors to classrooms across the state to check on teachers' articulation, recently made a sharp about-face on the issue.

Pig thefts in the Midwest have left law enforcement officials stumped. Among other challenges, the missing are difficult to single out.

HEADLINE: As State Tuition Rises, Financial Aid Offices Struggle to Adjust

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GOLLAN. 
jgollan@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
On what should have been a carefree day of reconnecting with friends and settling into new classes recently, more than two dozen students at the University of California, Berkeley, sat in uneasy silence outside the financial aid office.
The airy room on the second floor of Sproul Hall took on the desperate feeling of an unemployment office, with students waiting their turn to plead for emergency loans.
''I want to have enough money to pay for school,'' Daniel Seman, a junior majoring in English and music, said as he waited to see a financial aid counselor last Wednesday. ''My mom is really worried.'' 
Mr. Seman, 23, said he had already spent an emergency loan of $500 from the university on books and food. But faced with about $7,230 for tuition and fees this semester, roughly $1,000 more than the fall semester last year, he was back in line trying to get another loan.
Faced with drastic cutbacks in state financing, U.C. tuition increased 18 percent this school year, and the university's Board of Regents is expected to vote on a plan to raise tuition 8 percent to 16 percent a year through 2015-16. With the cost of rent, food and books also soaring, more students like Mr. Seman are scrambling to be able to afford their education.
The financial aid department is hustling to meet the increased demand, and some officials and students worry that the situation could undercut the university's reputation as one of the nation's foremost low-cost public education systems.
For the first time this year, the University of California will receive more of its money from student tuition than from the state -- a shift that will inevitably put more pressure on students from middle- and low-income backgrounds.
In a letter to parents and students about the recent tuition increase, Mark Yudof, the University of California president, struck an apologetic note, acknowledging the ''economic uncertainties and hardship'' facing many families.
''No one should feel they have to leave U.C. due to rising tuition and fees,'' Mr. Yudof wrote in the letter, dated July 27. ''I implore you to discuss your financial aid options with your campus financial aid office.''
Systemwide, roughly three-quarters of undergraduates applied for financial aid this year, up from two-thirds three years ago. With demand expected to grow, the university is considering new measures, including outsourcing some financial aid services, boosting corporate fund-raising and expanding aid for needy students.
Among the proposals is a plan to cover all tuition for students from families with incomes of less than $90,000 a year. Currently, students' families must earn less than $80,000 to qualify.
''We need to be creative in dealing with the additional demand from students,'' said Kate Jeffery, director of the Student Financial Support Unit for the 10-campus system.
Last week, Richard Blum, a University of California Regent, suggested a public fund-raising campaign to offset cuts in state financing. The University of California, Berkeley, has added three financial aid counselors to its staff, bringing the total to about 50 this year, and it put in an upgraded computer system to process applications.
But students say any enhancements to the university's financial aid still will not be enough.
Elizabeth Beltran is a junior from a low-income family whose fees are covered by the university. Because of increases in student housing costs this year, she had to move back home with her family in East Oakland.
''I won't be able to hang out with friends or get to go to study groups late at night,'' said Ms. Beltran, who needs financial aid to buy a laptop she could use from home.
The steep tuition increases forced Mario Lopez to postpone graduation by a year, until next summer.
Last spring, Mr. Lopez, a 23-year-old political science major, raised nearly $2,500 from private donors. He also took an extra job over the summer and invited a roommate to move in last month, cutting his rent in half.
''I really wanted to continue my education, so there was really no alternative,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''It has definitely been sort of a love and hate relationship. I love U.C., but I hate that I had to go through these tough circumstances.''

HEADLINE: The Price of Political Gossip

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
HAS American political life become a carnival so invasive, indiscriminate and sometimes even crude that it repels some of the best potential officeholders and almost guarantees that the most important business of the country won't be properly done? I wonder sometimes. I wondered in particular last week.
That's when Joe McGinniss's ''The Rogue,'' about Sarah Palin, and Ron Suskind's ''Confidence Men,'' about the rocky start of President Obama's presidency, were officially published. I say officially because both books already seem to have been around forever, thanks to the painstakingly orchestrated drum rolls, the parceled-out previews and the blanket media coverage. But it was only on Tuesday that hungry readers outside the news media could actually buy and begin to digest, in full, the tattling, hearsay and innuendo that McGinniss and Suskind, to different extents, serve. 
There's certainly some nutrition in these meals, but a whole lot of empty calories as well: anecdotes as intent on titillation as illumination; scoops of questionable provenance and dubious reliability; winding digressions from anything central to public discourse. Taken together, ''The Rogue'' and ''Confidence Men'' illustrate the unsettling degree to which journalism and entertainment overlap and to which elected officials are regarded as all-purpose celebrities, their every inner thought, every little tiff and every last peccadillo consumed as raptly as paparazzi shots of Brangelina. There's a market, seemingly more robust than ever, for political secrets.
And there are real downsides to this, one of which was suggested by yet another book published Tuesday, ''Keeping the Republic,'' a policy prescriptive by Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana. Daniels's book doesn't focus on the messy intrusions of American politics, but it affirms him as an earnest, serious politician, one who declined in the end to compete for the Republican presidential nomination. By all accounts that decision was guided by family members who had no appetite for the national stage, with its merciless spotlight. If they've read much about ''The Rogue'' or ''Confidence Men,'' they must feel powerfully vindicated.
Maybe Daniels would have been better than the existing Republican candidates. Maybe not. The point is that we'll never know, and we'll also never know how many other thoughtful would-be contenders are turned off and away by the crass spectacle of modern politics. I suspect we're losing valuable people and wish all of us -- reporters, talk-show bookers, blog devourers, hardcover buyers -- would pause to think about that.
I'm cheating somewhat by lumping ''The Rogue'' and ''Confidence Men'' together. The former is an infinitely more salacious project, with a subject who has arguably surrendered any right to gripe about overly prying eyes by inviting those gazes she and her family can monetize themselves. That of course doesn't stanch her complaints. There's a transcendently hilarious moment in the reality show ''Sarah Palin's Alaska'' when she asks, in regard to McGinniss's camping out in the house next door, whatever happened to privacy. She herself exiled it, along with any last vestiges of self-awareness.
Be that as it may, McGinniss's provocative, sometimes puerile approach sets a dangerously low bar with implications for politicians less vainglorious than Palin. It asserts that nothing is out of bounds, when some things really ought to be. I don't care how exuberantly Christine O'Donnell proclaimed the virtues of abstinence during her 2010 Senate campaign; that didn't give Gawker an adequate hypocrisy clause to publish someone's account of a past one-night stand of sorts with her, including an appraisal of her kissing and analysis of her grooming.
''Confidence Men'' doesn't concern itself with bedroom exploits. It mulls the worthy topic of Obama's response to the economic crisis. But in the manner of the shrewd 2010 best seller ''Game Change,'' about the 2008 presidential election, it also turns serious matters into the sudsiest opera possible, emphasizing discord and establishing a set of rules by which the gabbers come out looking best. They garner control of the storyline, while public servants with a more appropriate, honorable sense of discretion are punished for it.
This has big implications, too. Books like Suskind's force politicians to wonder whether they can hope for loyalty and speak freely behind closed doors. The books foster a distracting climate of paranoia.
Speaking of distractions, how much of an administration's energy is diverted by the need to respond to serial tempests like the one Suskind whipped up with his book's charges -- possibly accurate, but possibly overwrought -- of sexism in the White House? The premium for such juicy controversies prompts the reporting of more and more of them, which can turn governing into an endlessly repeating cycle of scandal alerts and scandal finessing.
Some political insiders say that it's long been thus and that things aren't significantly worse now. ''How many millions of hours have been spent by folks in Washington, D.C., managing Bob Woodward?'' asked Jim Jordan, the initial manager of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, noting that Woodward's exposes go back more than three decades.
Jordan also said that perhaps the current rat-tat-tat of so many breathless revelations meant that none stuck around long or needed to be sweated all that much. ''And maybe voters are so cynical they're not shocked by anything,'' he said.
But I'm not sure that's strong consolation for someone understandably hesitant about having almost every aspect of his or her family's lives declared fair game from the outset and splashed, however fleetingly and meaninglessly, across magazine covers and computer and TV screens. That must give many reasonable leaders pause, as must the farcical pageantry of the present-day campaign, including the sound-bite vacuity of even a ritual as supposedly substantive as a debate. The Republican one on Thursday night was a bonanza of well-rehearsed one-liners and cynical, selective attacks. It was spirited, but it wasn't pretty.
We in the news media are in a difficult position. We can't know what information voters at a given time feel entitled to. And we often can't guess what's going to be relevant until the digging and the damage have been done. I read ''Game Change'' and thought: Elizabeth Edwards shouldn't have been mortified like this. I also thought: John Edwards should have been mortified sooner.
Even so, we can adopt tactics more dignified and trustworthy and a tone less voyeuristic. And we should. If we persist in treating politics as a three-ring circus, we just might find ourselves with nothing but clowns.

HEADLINE: Far From the Factory, Adding Final Touches

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PORT NEWARK, N.J.
TO travelers landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, the vast asphalt fields of vehicles on the ground below look like so many livestock pens. Staged in these open-air waiting rooms are thousands of cars and trucks that will shortly be hauled to dealerships up and down the Eastern Seaboard.
What can't be seen from the air are the dockside finishing schools that apply the final touches to half a million vehicles that pass through each year. Here as at other seaports, dedicated facilities owned by individual automakers, as well as giant multibrand processing centers, shepherd autos arriving from overseas and ready them for buyers.
It's not just a quick wash and wax. Within these nondescript buildings at the edge of Newark Bay, inspections are done, repairs are made and hundreds of accessories, from satellite radios to alloy wheels to roof racks, are installed. 
Take, for example, the sprawling 250-acre operation of FAPS, which has the contracts for makers including Ferrari, Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Volvo. The company, which moved to Newark 55 years ago from New York, established itself repairing the damage done when imported cars were still hoisted off the ship by cranes. Today its services still include body repairs (though cars are now driven from the ship's hold) but it also does the accessory installations and manages distribution logistics.
Toyota's 98-acre operation at Newark's port is something of a scaled-down assembly plant, though the work -- adding a range of so-called port-installed options into 21 different models -- is done largely by hand using simple tools, not by industrial robots controlled by computers. About 185 employees work in Toyota's car wash, quality control center and five production shops here.
By adding items like floormats and GPS systems at its distribution centers instead of at its factories, Toyota gives customers a chance to tinker with their orders until just two days before the vehicles dock in Newark. And it gives dealers a way to stand apart from their competitors.
''We want to tailor the vehicle to what the customer wants,'' said Bill Barrett, the national logistics manager at the Newark location. ''We build the car they want.''
The facility, which Toyota has operated for more than two decades, serves as a way station for up to 12,500 cars at a time that arrive by ship from Japan. Nearly every Toyota, Lexus and Scion built in Japan and destined for sale from Virginia to Maine passes through the facility.
In a typical week, two shiploads of Toyotas arrive, though since the March tsunami slowed production, the pace has slowed to one ship a week. The process of customizing the roughly 3,000 vehicles that arrive on each ship starts the day before it docks in Newark. That's when John Hagel, who runs the driving team, determines how many longshoremen and drivers will be needed to get the vehicles to their parking spots, which are assigned by the accessories to be added.
One day last month, for instance, it took about 100 drivers eight hours to unload a ship that had made the four-week trip from Tahara, Japan, through the Panama Canal. Once parked, the vehicles are inspected; any damaged in transit go to the body shop. Only one vehicle that arrived on that boat in August needed work, Mr. Barrett said.
Next, the bar codes on the shipping manifests, which include a list of accessories to be added, are scanned. Lexus vehicles, which receive more attention than Toyotas and Scions, are also driven on a bumpy track to check for squeaks and rattles.
This month, Toyota's production returned to pre-tsunami levels. That means more to do for Nelson Noda's team of about a dozen workers, whose job is to install electronics, including alarms, satellite radios and remote starters. The work is done as the cars move down the middle of a building about the size of a football field.
Employees at the work stations to the left and right complete a variety of tasks. One worker spent about 30 minutes installing a Bluetooth hands-free system under the steering column of a red Prius. He needed just a few tools to complete his task and test the system.
''Everything is now plug-and-play,'' Mr. Noda said. ''No splicing wires like we did years ago.''
At the opposite end of the shop, another set of workers unbolted the factory-installed wheels from a 4Runner and replaced them with alloy rims. In the next shop, teams installed wheel locks, bumper protectors, body moldings and a variety of exterior items, including a clear film that helps to prevent paint chips on front ends. Nearby, two workers used a metal fixture to determine where to drill holes before bolting a roof rack on an S.U.V.
The work would grind to a halt without Rui Sousa, whose job it is to order accessories daily from suppliers, based on expected needs in two days' time. The key, he said, is limiting the volume of accessories for unpopular cars or those that are undergoing model changes, while keeping enough on hand for more popular cars.
''We're trying to find the right balance,'' said Mr. Sousa, who has honed his orders so finely that the amount of just-in-time inventory has been cut by about two-thirds during the last four years.
Port facilities were not always about efficiency or convenience. In past years they provided a place to install parts not available near the factories or to add catalytic converters and other equipment needed on imported vehicles to meet local regulations. Ports have also played a role in trade tiffs, providing a workaround for retaliatory taxes by making it possible for Japanese automakers to import just the cab and chassis of small pickups and install the cargo bed at the port when they landed.
In all, vehicles spend from two and six days at Toyota's facility, depending on the work they require. It takes on average another 1.9 days for a vehicle, once completed, to leave the facility.
Some 112,000 Toyotas are expected to arrive here this year by ship from Japan -- about a third of the peak in 2006, a result of the weak economy and the tsunami. Another 279,000 vehicles are expected to arrive by rail from Toyota factories in North America and go directly to dealerships. Even in the downturn, Newark is Toyota's busiest port in the United States.
BMW's port operation takes a different approach, putting its logistics center some three miles away in Jersey City. That means having to drive up to 1,500 BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce models that arrive by boat each week from Germany (with a stop in Britain) or South Africa to the facility, an all-day job for as many as 100 drivers.
Because many BMWs are effectively made to order, the range of accessories installed in New Jersey is generally limited more to performance kits and cosmetic items like spoilers, air dams and custom wheels, said Carol Furey, the facility manager.
''We're an extension of the factory,'' Ms. Furey said, ''the quality check at the end of production.''

HEADLINE: Mark Varian

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Varian, 62, is the president of John Gallin & Son, a family-owned construction company that specializes in commercial building interiors for both landlords and tenants. Its client list has included major developers like the Durst Organization and the Rudin Management Company, as well as corporations like Disney and NBC Universal.
The company was founded in 1886. 
Interview conducted and condensed by Vivian Marino
Q John Gallin & Son started 125 years ago this year. How are you celebrating the anniversary?
A It's a great milestone. This firm has made it through several wars, the Great Depression, the great recession -- you name it.
We've been having small gatherings with special clients. For our 120th year we did a rather big splash, but we didn't feel that the atmosphere out there was one that would really benefit from another event. It's been tough for the construction industry.
Q Has business picked up at all?
A We had a rough year last year. This year is considerably better -- our fiscal year ends this month.
Q How many projects are you working on?
A We're probably handling 30 to 35 projects. We do everything from the $1,000 job to multimillion-dollar jobs. The size of the job this year has definitely increased.
Q Who are some of your current clients?
A Well, we do ongoing work with Wells Fargo here in New York, on their corporate side. We're still doing work for Ann Taylor -- who over the years is probably our biggest client -- at the corporate headquarters at 7 Times Square. We just did a 200,000-square-foot demolition for Mitsui Fudosan at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, the Exxon Building.
Q Is most of your work in New York City?
A Most of our work is on Manhattan Island. We prefer to walk to our jobs.
Q Are you still doing many office prebuilts?
A We're continuing to do a lot of prebuilts. That used to be a trend that would only happen in a down real estate market, but it seems to be continuing, and they're higher-end. Most of the major building owners in the city are spending good money and putting in great materials.
Q Are there any trends in building materials and designs?
A As the market improves, we start to see more use of stone floors or woodwork, and a lot of glass and metal -- the expensive elements of interior construction. They want that look, and they want that sustainability, and if they're going to be there for 10 years they want it to last.
The next generation coming in doesn't want the old-fashioned office; they want the open space. We're also doing a lot of window wall installations.
Q Why has the company focused on interiors?
A Ninety-five percent of our work is interior. We usually work directly for a tenant, or we'll work for the building owner.
After World War II, when suddenly office space had to be created for the returning G.I.'s, major companies built out office after office knowing they had to put these guys back to work. And it was at the same time that air-conditioning was introduced. So all the old building stock had to be upgraded.
Q How many family members are working at the firm?
A At the moment, eight. There are four principals, which are three brothers and myself; and we have a project manager; a couple of administrative folks; and the woman who operates our plan desk. We're fourth- and fifth-generation.
Q The company has always been headed by a family member; your mom was a Gallin. Is there someone waiting in the wings to take over after you retire?
A Everybody's a half Gallin in the Gallin family, even though they have the name.
We haven't decided who would take over. The other principals are considerably younger; it will be their determination.
Q Have you had to deal with any family clashes in the business?
A Certainly, and they probably do bite a little deeper than a typical professional conflict, but they're few and far between.
People always ask, why work in a family business? Well, we're never really able to choose exactly who we're going to work for or with, or have work for you. But when it's a family member and blood is involved, and there's a certain commitment and understanding of a culture, it just makes it a lot more enriching.
Q You didn't start out in the construction business -- you were actually trained as a Shakespearean actor.
A I spent 10 years in the theater, all in regional theater.
Q Why did you leave it?
A I needed money.

A CONTEST FOR SUPREMACY
China, America, and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia
By Aaron L. Friedberg
360 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
It seems inevitable that Chinese-/American relations will increasingly come to preoccupy the world. The United States continues to be the only global superpower, but in the not-too-distant future China promises to acquire the status of an equal or near equal. How this relationship evolves during a period when the balance of power between them is shifting so rapidly is inevitably a cause for concern.
To be sure, there is at least one important source of encouragement. Ever since the Nixon-Mao rapprochement in the 1970s, the relationship between the two countries has been remarkably stable, notwithstanding the many changes of leadership and the numerous twists and turns of history. The future, though, promises to be different. 
In ''A Contest for Supremacy,'' Aaron L. Friedberg outlines several reasons a closer relationship between the two powers is possible: economic interdependence, the prospect that China may become more open and democratic, its continuing integration into the international system, common threats like climate change, and nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, he believes two other factors -- a growing clash of interests and deep ideological and political differences -- will prove more decisive and will make the relationship more tense and competitive.
For Friedberg, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, the stakes could hardly be greater. He quotes Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore: ''If you do not hold your ground in the Pacific, you cannot be a world leader.'' Signaling his agreement, Friedberg writes: ''If we permit an illiberal China to displace us as the preponderant player in this most vital region, we will face grave dangers to our interests and our values throughout the world.'' Asia, as he correctly observes, is the key crucible of future conflict, with East Asia in particular set to assume central importance. This, after all, is China's backyard. It is already the most important economic region in the world.
Friedberg is certainly right that a situation characterized by the emergence of a rising power and the decline of an existing hegemon has generally been a recipe for instability and conflict. But the fact that the United States is a liberal democracy and China a one-party system is not as important as another factor Friedberg barely mentions: the very different histories and cultures of the two countries about which, in contrast, Henry Kissinger is eloquent in his recent book, ''On China.'' Friedberg's discussion is conducted largely, though not exclusively, in security terms, but by far the most important factor in determining the future will be economics. It is China's extraordinary economic performance that has been driving and will continue to drive the change in the relationship.
Friedberg's failure to give sufficient weight to that performance means that he underestimates the forces that, with enormous speed, are reshaping East Asia in China's favor and to America's disadvantage. Within a remarkably short space of time, China has become the largest market for most countries in East Asia, Japan included, and the destination for almost one-quarter of Asia's total exports, excluding India. The relative importance of the American market, on the other hand, is declining rapidly. China is fast becoming a major source of capital for many countries, while Beijing's decision to begin internationalizing the renminbi means that within the next five years it could rival the dollar in the settlement of East Asian trade.
As Friedberg points out, countries in the region are, in varying degrees, wary of China's rise. But the predominant trend over the last decade has been for them to move closer to Beijing. This, of course, was the pattern over the many centuries of the tributary system, a situation now being resumed as China once more assumes its position as the major economic power in the region. China's neighbors will be increasingly disinclined to antagonize it, because they are fully aware that their economic futures are bound up far more with Beijing than with Washington.
Friedberg similarly gives insufficient weight to America's economic decline. True, he recognizes that the Western financial crisis has hurt America badly, while China has been relatively little touched. But the effect of the crisis has been even more profound than is generally understood: it has ushered in a new era defined by American decline and the beginnings of a Chinese economic world order. So it is essential that America set itself realistic targets with regard to China and not seek to deal with the world as it was, but rather how it will be.
This brings me to Friedberg's conclusion. For the most part, the tenor of the book is considered, balanced, informative and restrained, even somewhat tentative in tone. In the final chapter, however, he adopts a far more strident voice. He takes issue with what he describes as the ''Shanghai Coalition,'' those in the United States who advocate engagement with China rather than containment, accusing them of self-interest or worse, and he mounts a fierce case for developing new military systems for projecting American power, including ''long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles, submerged or low-observable 'arsenal ships' loaded with precision weapons, long-range conventional ballistic missiles and perhaps a new intercontinental-range stealthy manned bomber.'' Combined with a more assertive approach to China, he calls for a new security framework in Asia that includes the United States -- now largely excluded from regional organizations -- and what he describes as a ''community of Asian democracies'' designed specifically to neutralize Chinese ambitions.
Essentially, Friedberg seeks to counter China's rise in its own region by the deployment of hard power. This will inevitably lead to a more tense and dangerous international environment, quite possibly a new cold war. It is also highly doubtful whether it can be successful.
America's problem, ultimately, is not military but economic, a point also made by Kissinger. If the Chinese economy, as projected by Goldman Sachs, overtakes the American economy by 2027, and is almost double the size by 2050, then hawkish responses to China's power are misplaced. Instead, two very different emphases are required. First, America must concentrate on economic regeneration, including huge expenditure on modernizing its infrastructure and education system. Second, it must come to terms with the fact that China's rise and America's decline are not simply a result of a failure of policy but are rather one of those great -- and highly infrequent -- historical shifts that governments can do relatively little to affect, let alone prevent.

HEADLINE: In Company Town, Cuts but No Layoffs

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
WARROAD, Minn.
THREE THINGS matter big in this flyspeck city just south of the Canadian border: hockey, walleye and Marvin.
Not necessarily in that order. Yes, Warroad, nicknamed ''Hockeytown, U.S.A.,'' has sent six of its sons to the N.H.L. And the walleye plucked from Lake of the Woods are served for breakfast, lunch and dinner down at the Lakeview Restaurant.
But Marvin -- as in, Marvin Windows and Doors -- is the commercial engine in these parts and has been since George G. Marvin arrived in 1904. So when times get tough at Marvin, as they are now, the 1,700 or so residents of Warroad hold their collective breath.
But in this season of economic unease, when neither Washington nor Wall Street seems to have the answers, the descendants of George Marvin are going against the grain. Unlike so many other companies, Marvin Windows has neither laid off workers nor reduced health insurance benefits. And, its executives vow, it won't. 
Marvin Windows might seem like a footnote in the nation's economic ledger. It employs roughly 4,300 people, about 2,000 of them here, and has annual sales somewhere from $500 million to $1 billion. But what this company is doing -- and, more to the point, what it is not doing -- is worth knowing.
Marvin Windows and Doors is a throwback to another era. For starters, it is a private company. No public stockholders are complaining that the latest numbers fell short, that the share price is down.
What's more, Marvin takes an old-fashioned, even paternal view of its role here in Warroad, where the Marvin family has run things for just about as long as anyone can remember. The company has cut employees' pay and reduced perks like tuition reimbursement and 401(k) matching. Employees haven't received profit-sharing checks in two years, nor have the 16 members of the Marvin family who work for the company.
But, unlike its top competitors, Marvin has refused to fire people.
Many here wonder if Marvin can hold out, particularly if, as many fear, the economy sinks into another recession. Company executives say they aren't panicking yet.
''Housing isn't in a recession. It's in a depression,'' says Susan Marvin, the company's president and a granddaughter of George Marvin. ''While it's challenging for our people right now, and not everybody understands all the reasons why, the alternatives are devastating. These people would have to pick up and leave.''
Some have, for places like the booming oil fields of North Dakota. Others are working two jobs to make ends meet.
THE change is palpable in Warroad. This is a place where Marvin employees get the first Monday of November off for ''Deer Monday,'' so they can go hunting. And where on the Fourth of July the company hands out two nickels to children in town, as George Marvin did during the Depression.
When the housing market collapsed and, with it, the market for windows and doors, competitors shuttered plants and cut work forces. But as a fourth generation of Marvins prepares to take over, the most obvious -- some would argue most effective -- option was off the table.
While Marvin's story might seem quaint, even naive, Ms. Marvin says the no-layoff policy is as much a business wager as an act of benevolence. She says she is confident that it will ultimately pay off. Already, she says, Marvin is gaining market share from weakened rivals.
Ms. Marvin acknowledges that her family's private company may have more leeway than public counterparts. It has forgone profits for two years to keep everyone employed, for instance. Nonetheless, Ms. Marvin suggests that corporate America could learn a thing or two from Marvin's approach and long-term outlook.
''You can't cut your way to prosperity. You can't grow if you are cutting your lifeblood -- and that's the skills and experience your work force delivers,'' she says, adding later: ''Today, I think, to a great a degree, I think things have gotten out of balance. We see Wall Street almost punish companies that take the long view.''
Several other window manufacturers are based in the upper Midwest. (The abundance of white pine and the proximity to the Mississippi River were two reasons companies located there). Andersen is outside of St. Paul. Pella is in Iowa. Several dozen smaller operations are scattered throughout the region.
Like Marvin, many of these companies are privately held, often by descendants of their founders. Among the four biggest manufacturers, only Marvin and Jeld-Wen of Oregon continue to be managed by family members. Marvin is the smallest of the four.
Not surprisingly, the fortunes of window manufacturers are tied closely to housing construction and have followed the same precipitous rise and fall. New housing starts began climbing in 2000 and peaked in 2005, at more than two million, as new subdivisions sprouted across the country, particularly in the South and West.
Marvin's chief executive, Jake Marvin, says his company's peak year for profitability was 2006, and it continued to perform well through 2008.
Then the financial crisis hit, and housing construction collapsed. In 2005, an estimated 34.1 million windows were shipped for new construction. This year, that figure is projected to be 11.9 million. Mr. Marvin says new housing used to account for 60 percent of his business. These days, it is closer to 25 percent.
Most manufacturers responded to the collapse by closing plants and laying off employees, so much that the industry work force is a third smaller than it was a few years back, says Michael O'Brien, the chief executive of the Window and Door Manufacturers Association, a trade group.
Making matters worse, some manufacturers were saddled with debt from acquisitions they made in the boom years. Others confronted formidable financial problems.
Jeld-Wen, for instance, has closed 21 facilities and reduced its work force by 25 percent in the last three years, according to Standard & Poor's. The company is still struggling to fix its finances.
Other companies have made more modest layoffs, and like Marvin, they are trying to gain market share during the industry shakeout.
Kathy Krafka Harkema, a spokeswoman for Pella, says her company closed two plants, one in Iowa and one in Arizona. The move resulted in just over 300 layoffs. But Pella, which has roughly 8,000 employees, has remained profitable during the downturn, she says.
Mr. O'Brien at the window and door association says consumers remain skittish.
''It's always, 'Next year it will turn around,' '' he says. ''It's a challenge. No one thought we'd be where we are today, having not pulled out of it.''
THE fortunes of Warroad and Marvin Windows, like those of Detroit and the Big Three automakers, are deeply intertwined. Back when this was a Chippewa village, the Sioux invaded by way of the Red and Roseau Rivers, a route that ended at the mouth of the Warroad River -- the ''war road'' in the town's name.
Today there are more Marvin employees in Warroad, about 2,000, than there are residents, 1,722. (The company's other employees are scattered at plants in North Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Oregon.) The company's factory sits on the western edge of town. The visitor center, which includes a company museum that holds a lock of George Marvin's hair, is nearby, as is company headquarters. The Marvin Home Center, a spacious hardware store, is closer to the town center.
Mayor Bob Marvin is the brother of Jake Marvin, the chief executive, and Susan Marvin, the president. The town library, the senior center, the indoor swimming pool at the high school -- all were financed by Marvin or the Marvin family. So was most of the 1,700-seat hockey arena. A Marvin scholarship fund provides college tuition for about 20 Warroad graduates each year.
''These are people we went to school with,'' Jake Marvin says. ''We go to church with them. We see them in the same restaurants. Indeed, a lot of us have married local girls and boys.''
He later added, ''We could be anywhere. But we are in Warroad.''
JAKE MARVIN, a stout 63-year-old with slicked back hair, wire-rimmed glasses and a deep, gravelly voice, says he never saw the economic collapse coming. But when it came, he says, it wasn't too difficult to decide what to do.
Marvin Windows has laid off employees only once, in the late 1960s, Mr. Marvin says. He had no appetite to do it again. His grandfather kept his eight employees through the Depression.
Jake Marvin could afford to make that decision. His company had no debt and had some money in the bank. Call it luck or shrewd planning, but while others splurged on acquisitions in good times, Marvin Windows stuck to its knitting and grew organically.
Nonetheless, given the severity of the financial crisis, it became clear that something had to give. Other than jobs and medical benefits, everything was on the table.
Salaries were cut by 5 percent. Hourly workers were pulled back to 32 hours a week. While 32-hour weeks weren't uncommon during slow winters, this time the hours were reduced indefinitely. Raises were suspended, too.
In addition, Marvin stopped paying tuition reimbursement and financing a program that brought professors to Warroad to teach classes. Employees could no longer cash in vacation days they didn't use. Pizza parties and award ceremonies were nixed.
Employees were encouraged to take unpaid leave, and many did. Through attrition, Marvin pared its work force back to about 4,300 from a peak of over 5,000.
''Every month, something came off the table,'' Mr. Marvin says. ''We wanted to find a point where we could operate indefinitely until the market turned around.''
MARVIN'S no-layoff announcement was cheered by employees, and in April 2009, Ms. Marvin and a Marvin employee were hailed as ''great Americans'' on national television. But much of that euphoria has worn off in the three difficult years since, as the reality of smaller paychecks has taken hold.
''Is 32 tough? Absolutely,'' says Travis Kelley, a 16-year Marvin plant employee who took a second job at a local supermarket, Doug's, to help pay the bills. The cut in hours was harder than it might seem because Marvin workers made so much in overtime. ''We were taking home some big checks,'' Mr. Kelley, 39, says.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kelly said he was grateful for the job and had come to realize that he might have been spending too much anyway. ''I sold off my toys -- snowmobile, a couple of guns,'' he says. ''Now when I am home, I am home.''
Another Marvin employee, Nathan Hoy, 30, is working a second job at the Warroad Municipal Liquor Store. His reduced hours have taken a toll. ''You drive less, drink less, go out less often,'' he says.
In Warroad's downtown, at Lake Street Floral and Gifts, Toby Larson says business is down 40 percent. He attributes the decline to the cuts at Marvin and the broader economic malaise.
''As far as the person who used to buy off the sidewalk or cooler, that doesn't happen any more,'' he says.
Over at Thomson Thrifty White Pharmacy, the owner, Dennis Thomson, says customers are still filling prescriptions and buying items ''they need to live.'' Sales of discretionary items at the front of the store have fallen off.
With little chance of a quick turnaround, some Marvin employees have quit to try their chances elsewhere. Mike Gamache, who worked for the company for 15 years, says he was treated well and earned a two-year college degree on Marvin's dime.
But he left about six months ago, along with three friends from Warroad, to work in the North Dakota oil fields. ''It got to the point where you start looking around. I didn't see where the economic prospects for the company were getting any better,'' he says. ''If someone offers you $6 an hour more and tons more overtime, can you blame a guy?''
The Marvins don't dispute Mr. Gamache's assessment. But they don't have second thoughts about their no-layoff stand either, at least not publicly. Layoffs, they say, would hurt everyone here.
''I've talked to other business people about it, and they have challenged it. They have challenged the wisdom of it,'' Susan Marvin says.
Asked how long Marvin can keep its promises, given the potential for another recession, Jake Marvin replies with a question of his own: ''How long does that second recession last?''

SEPTEMBER
'ATYS' The season is off and running. And a thoroughbred put out to pasture after a few great years is back in the gate: William Christie's acclaimed presentation of Lully's opera ''Atys'' with Les Arts Florissants, seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1989 and 1992, a landmark in the modern early-music movement. Some of the old costumes and wigs were dispersed to museums as Mr. Christie went on to other triumphs. But one Brooklyn Academy patron, Ronald P. Stanton, couldn't put the experience behind him. Avid to see the production again and having the wherewithal to do something about it, he financed this revival -- which has already made its way around Europe and appeared at Versailles, where the opera had its premiere in 1676 -- to the tune of $3.1 million. Once again, Jean-Marie Villegier directs, and Mr. Christie conducts Les Arts Florissants. Anything Mr. Christie is involved with carries an almost ironclad guarantee of quality. But this promises to be something truly special, as the Academy acknowledges by presenting it to kick off celebrations of its 150th anniversary. Opens today. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House. 
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC After a hectic September preseason -- live accompaniments to the film of Bernstein's ''West Side Story''; a Mahler ''Resurrection'' Symphony for Sept. 11 (on Sept. 10, actually, with performances to follow on Sept. 22, 24 and 27); an Andrea Bocelli blowout in Central Park; and Walton's music for Shakespeare's ''Henry V'' with narration by Christopher Plummer -- Alan Gilbert and the orchestra finally get around to starting their season officially. The soprano Deborah Voigt, fresh off her portrayal of Annie Oakley in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' at the Glimmerglass Festival, shifts moods drastically and repeatedly in ''Dich, teure Halle'' from Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' ''Andromache's Farewell'' by Samuel Barber and the final scene from Strauss's ''Salome.'' Ms. Voigt will presumably remain offstage, or at least clothed, as the orchestra adds Strauss's ''Dance of the Seven Veils.'' The concert is to be broadcast in the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series on PBS; let's hope that the players appear a happier bunch than they did in the glum PBS close-ups of last year's opening concert. Wednesday. Avery Fisher Hall.
KRONOS QUARTET This group has long been recognized as much for its pioneering social and internationalist mission as for its music-making, so a program addressing the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 comes as no surprise. ''Awakening,'' originally presented in San Francisco for the fifth anniversary in 2006 and described as a musical meditation, has its New York premiere here. Composers represented include Michael Gordon, Terry Riley and Osvaldo Golijov, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus joins in arrangements of traditional songs of various cultures. Wednesday-Saturday. BAM Harvey Theater.
NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In a gala concert with several agendas, the ensemble opens its season and celebrates its 80th anniversary and the 40th of the Kennedy Center. Joshua Bell plays Bruch's First Violin Concerto, Thomas Hampson sings selections from Copland's ''Old American Songs,'' and Christoph Eschenbach, in his second season as the orchestra's music director, conducts it all, including a couple of sure-fire crowd pleasers: Dvorak's concert overture ''Carnival'' and Ravel's ''Bolero.'' Sept. 25. Kennedy Center Concert Hall, Washington, (202) 467-4600 or (800) 444-1324, kennedy-center.org.
'ANNA BOLENA' The Russian soprano Anna Netrebko is the lovely face (and sometimes bosom) of the Metropolitan Opera season, undoubtedly showing on a poster near you, as Manon if not Anna Bolena. For starters, the company has given Ms. Netrebko not only a new production and an opening-night showcase but a Donizetti work never presented in the house. How well the role's vocal fancywork will suit her voice in the big house remains to be seen, but one way or the other, she instantly becomes a part of Met history. David McVicar directs a cast that also includes Ekaterina Gubanova, Stephen Costello and Ildar Abdrazakov. Marco Armiliato conducts. Sept. 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER The society opens its 43rd season with ''Fireworks!,'' a program celebrating virtuosity in works by Mendelssohn, Brahms, Saint-Saens and others. The society's artistic directors, the cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, anchor the performances. Sept. 26. Alice Tully Hall.
AMERICAN CLASSICAL ORCHESTRA This period-instrument band, conducted by Thomas Crawford, moves into Alice Tully Hall to start (and end) its 27th season. The well-balanced opening program features the mezzo-soprano Jill Grove in Brahms's Alto Rhapsody and adds Haydn's Symphony No. 104 (''London'') and Schubert's incidental music for ''Rosamunde.'' Sept. 29. Alice Tully Hall.
SEATTLE SYMPHONY Ludovic Morlot, in one of his first subscription series as this orchestra's new music director, serves up a doozy of a program, opening with Stravinsky's epochal ''Sacre du Printemps'' and closing with a work that carried it to its logical, raucous conclusion, Varese's ''Ameriques.'' In between, Mr. Morlot whimsically eases the pressure with, of all things, Gershwin's perky ''American in Paris.'' Well, the honking car horns, at least, should fit right in with the churning chaos that surrounds them. Sept. 29, Oct. 1. Benaroya Hall, (206) 215-4747 or (866) 833-4747, seattlesymphony.org.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA In what was supposed to be the last season of his contract as the orchestra's music director, James Levine, by present plans, will not conduct it at all. After the March announcement of his resignation, forced by chronic back problems (for which he continues to have operations), he was scrubbed from the schedule before it was announced, though some of his trademark programming remains in place, including a continuing cycle of the symphonies of John Harbison. As for Mr. Levine's eventual replacement, the orchestra -- which had to canvas conductors and their agents repeatedly to fill his vacancies in recent seasons -- must have a pretty good idea of who is out there. But now it accelerates the search with a parade of conductors that presents, along with elderly and fledgling maestros, plausible candidates, including Riccardo Chailly, surprisingly in his Boston Symphony debut; Andris Nelsons, who evidently impressed others in his debut with the orchestra in March more than he impressed me; and Esa-Pekka Salonen. But the season opens in understated fashion, with Anne-Sophie Mutter playing and leading the five Mozart violin concertos over two nights. Ms. Mutter, for her part, has made it clear that she has no conducting ambitions beyond overseeing her own performances. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Symphony Hall, Boston, (617) 266-1492, bso.org.
VICTORIA SACRED WORKS You would expect the quiet celebrations of the 400th birthday of Tomas Luis de Victoria that are scattered about in concerts and on disc. What you might not have expected is a 10-CD set of 93 works newly recorded, some for the first time. But here it is, from Michael Noone and the 10-year-old Ensemble Plus Ultra, a London-based group specializing in Spanish Renaissance liturgical music, on Deutsche Grammophon Archiv. A Deutsche Grammophon blurb describes Victoria as ''a towering composer whose works glow with the passion and vibrant tonal palette of El Greco,'' presumably the case these recordings are trying to make. September.
OCTOBER
'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Robert Wilson directs the Weill-Brecht classic, performed in German by the Berliner Ensemble, descended from the company founded by Bertolt Brecht and his wife in 1949. Mr. Wilson, the Brooklyn Academy says, has drawn on ''the striking designs of German Expressionist cinema and the shattering, seductive world of Weimar-era cabaret.'' There is also talk of a geometric concept, presumably coupled with a certain angularity of gesture, unless Mr. Wilson has lost his spots. Oct. 4-8. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CARNEGIE HALL It is a great boon to latter-day Carnegie Hall programmers and marketers that Tchaikovsky -- having conducted a work of his own at the hall's opening concert, in 1891 -- can forever be commemorated as a sort of founding father. The hall continues its celebration of the 120th anniversary of that opening (which occurred last May) with a citywide festival, Tchaikovsky in St. Petersburg. Along with music, ballet and exhibits, there will be talks and panel discussions focusing on New York at the turn of the 20th century. One of St. Petersburg's great orchestras, the Mariinsky, and its maestro, Valery Gergiev, are in residence for the occasion, and they open the season here with Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme, with the cellist Yo-Yo Ma as soloist, as well as Shostakovich's ''Festive Overture'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade.'' Oct. 5.
ALAN GILBERT Alan Gilbert the fiddler, that is, performing Bach's D minor Concerto for Two Violins with the New York Philharmonic and the violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann, the orchestra's artist in residence this season. With that bit of showmanship out of his system, Mr. Gilbert reverts to form, conducting the Philharmonic in Berg's Violin Concerto, with Mr. Zimmermann as soloist, and Brahms's Third Symphony. Oct. 5-7. Avery Fisher Hall.
MARIINSKY ORCHESTRA Carnegie is spending so much Tchaikovsky capital celebrating its 120th anniversary that you have to wonder what it has in mind for its 125th, seemingly a bigger deal. (Fear not; the planners are already at work.) Here Valery Gergiev conducts his St. Petersburg-based ensemble in all six Tchaikovsky symphonies, in each case pairing an overfamiliar later work with a less familiar earlier one. The opening juxtaposition of the ever fresh First Symphony (''Winter Dreams'') with the soul-weary Sixth (''Pathetique'') should be especially striking, even disconcerting. Oct. 6, 9-10. Carnegie Hall.
DANIIL TRIFONOV Valery Gergiev, who as the new chairman of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, scored points for lending greater transparency and presumably more probity to the judging process in June, comes with a grand prize winner in tow. This young pianist, who also won the Rubinstein International Master Piano Competition in Tel Aviv in May and drew acclaim for a New York recital in July, joins Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra in -- what else? -- Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. The orchestra also plays Shostakovich's First Symphony and three selections from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Oct. 11. Carnegie Hall.
RACHMANINOFF VESPERS Kent Tritle, the choral maestro who swallowed Manhattan, continues to direct Musica Sacra, which he conducts here, even as he becomes music director and organist at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. (He also directs the Oratorio Society of New York and is organist of the New York Philharmonic and director of choral activities at the Manhattan School of Music.) Presented by Carnegie Hall, Rachmaninoff's a cappella Vespers is shoehorned into its St. Petersburg series, otherwise devoted mostly to Tchaikovsky, and I would be the last to object to a high-level performance of this glorious work, however it comes about. But Carnegie could have done a greater service to Tchaikovsky by highlighting some of his great liturgical music, less well-known but scarcely less exquisite than Rachmaninoff's and more revelatory of another side to Tchaikovsky than any of the orchestral war horses opening the season. (Maybe Nikolai Kachanov and the Russian Chamber Chorus of New York, who have made a specialty of Tchaikovsky's sacred works, will perform some at their Oct. 22 Carnegie neighborhood concert on Staten Island.) Oct. 12. Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 405 West 59th Street,(212) 330-7684, musicasacrany.com.
JORDI AND FERRAN SAVALL Inveterate followers of early music have come to know and love not only the virtuoso violist da gamba Jordi Savall but also his family: especially his wife, Montserrat Figueras, a wide-ranging vocalist, and their daughter, Arianna Savall, a harpist and singer. But I, for one, have encountered their son, Ferran, a lutenist and singer, only once, when all four performed together at the Metropolitan Museum. To say that he more than held his own in this exalted company is to say a lot. In ''Folias and Variations: Music Dialogues From Orient and Occident,'' a program presented by the Morgan and the Boston Early Music Festival, Ferran Savall, singing and playing theorbo, joins his father in works from the 13th through 17th centuries by Tobias Hume, Marin Marais and others. Oct. 12. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org.
SPHINX VIRTUOSI The Sphinx Organization has been working hard and long, 15 years now, to help black and Latino musicians prepare themselves for professional careers in classical music. Many wonderful players have gained recognition through its competitions, and some of them make up this aptly named group, which performs annually at Carnegie (formerly as the Sphinx Chamber Orchestra). The continuing paucity of blacks in major American symphony orchestras shows how sorely the organization's efforts are needed and how much work it still has to do. But for tonight, just enjoy the music in the hands of young, gifted and committed performers. Oct. 12. Carnegie Hall.
'DON GIOVANNI' There will be plenty to attend to onstage in a new production of Mozart's opera by Michael Grandage. Mariusz Kwiecien takes the title role opposite the scene-stealing Luca Pisaroni as Leporello. But a newly heightened curiosity will also be directed to the pit, as Fabio Luisi, suddenly the principal conductor at the Met, replaces an ailing James Levine on the podium. Separate article by Anthony Tommasini. Opens Oct. 13. Metropolitan Opera House.
MET ORCHESTRA And no sooner has Fabio Luisi spelled James Levine at the start of the Metropolitan Opera's ''Don Giovanni'' run than he conducts Met forces in another guise. From a program closely tailored to Mr. Levine's proclivities, Mr. Luisi retains John Harbison's ''Closer to My Own Life,'' in its premiere performance (with texts by Alice Munro sung by Christine Rice), but jettisons Gershwin's ''American in Paris'' in favor of Strauss's ''Till Eulenspiegel.'' The rest is Mozart: the Piano Concerto No. 25, with Richard Goode as soloist, and the ''Zauberflote'' Overture. Oct. 16. Carnegie Hall.
PAUL LEWIS You may well know this insightful pianist's comprehensive survey of Beethoven, on disc if not from concerts. You may even have followed some of his unfolding Schubert explorations. If not, time's a-wastin', and here are a couple of chances to catch up, with Schubert both familiar (Impromptus, ''Wanderer'' Fantasy, the later A minor Sonata) and less familiar. Oct. 18, April 26. 92nd Street Y.
LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Lincoln Center's Great Performers series has yet to plunge into the brightness of the White Light Festival, but the venerable maestro Colin Davis can hardly be said to remain in the dark as he plies a specialty in the music of Sibelius: the Violin Concerto, with Nikolai Znaider as soloist, and the Second Symphony. Oct. 19. Avery Fisher Hall.
YUJA WANG Fashionistas may vie with pianistas for the good seats when this gifted and attractive young Chinese pianist makes her New York recital debut. Ms. Wang seems bent on radically altering concert dress, to judge from reports of her recent appearance at Hollywood Bowl wearing what The Los Angeles Times called ''an orange, thigh-grazing, body-hugging dress atop sparkly gold strappy stiletto sandals.'' Well, Hollywood Bowl is one thing; Carnegie Hall may be another (let alone the Ladies' Morning Musical Club in Montreal, three days later). The program, should anyone be listening, offers works by Scriabin, Liszt's Sonata in B minor and Prokofiev's Sonata No. 6, and the performances are almost sure to be wonderful. So what does Ms. Wang wear for an encore? Oct. 20. Carnegie Hall.
AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The seemingly indefatigable and ever voluble Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, music director of this ensemble and inveterate champion of thematic programming, adds to his workload this season with preconcert chats, ''Conductor's Notes Q&As,'' presented an hour before each program. The first concert, ''Bauhaus Bach,'' tracing connections between Bach and modernism, follows on the exhibition ''Lyonel Feininger: At the Edge of the World'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art and presents works of Bach orchestrated by Wolfgang Graeser, Reger and Schoenberg; Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra; and Feininger's own composition Three Fugues. Oct. 21. Carnegie Hall.
WHITE LIGHT FESTIVAL ''It's such a great work, it should never be performed,'' Colin Davis has said of Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis.'' Happily, he has not lived by that bit of hyperbole (reported by John Canarina in his book ''The New York Philharmonic: From Bernstein to Maazel,'' Amadeus Press, 2010), and Mr. Davis tries to take the measure of the work again, with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, as the second annual White Light Festival at Lincoln Center gets rolling. Then Gianandrea Noseda leads the orchestra and chorus in another daunting masterpiece, Britten's ''War Requiem,'' with the tenor Ian Bostridge and the baritone Simon Keenlyside delivering the death-haunted poetry of Wilfred Owen. Oct. 21, 23. Avery Fisher Hall.
TENET This vocal group, directed by Jolle Greenleaf, stole the show in an early-music sampler program a year ago with a segment called ''A Feast for the Senses.'' One number in particular, Charles H. Gabriel's hymn ''His Eye Is on the Sparrow,'' with the line ''I sing because I'm happy,'' epitomized the group's approach to the whole: a sheer, unabashed joy in music-making. Here Tenet presents the program complete to celebrate release of its ''Feast for the Senses'' CD. Oct. 22. St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church, 552 West End Avenue, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com.
PACIFICA QUARTET With Hilde Limondjian having left her position as director of concerts and lectures at the Metropolitan Museum more than a year ago, and her successor, Limor Tomer, having arrived only in May, this will be a season of transition in programming. Lisa Doyle, the senior manager of concerts and lectures, and the staff did most of the planning, and some old formulas now seem open to question. But this one remains strong: a series of Saturday evening concerts by a resident string quartet in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. For more than four decades, it was the Guarneri Quartet; since 2009, it has been the Pacifica. Having dispatched the 15 Shostakovich quartets last season, the Pacifica now presents a complete cycle of Beethoven's 16 quartets. The first program sets the pattern, with works early (Op. 18, No. 2), middle (Op. 74) and late (Op. 131). Oct. 22 (also Nov. 12, Dec. 10, Jan. 7, Feb. 25, March 10). Metropolitan Museum.
JENNIFER KOH Two seasons ago, this fine violinist played Bach's unaccompanied sonatas and partitas one per day in a popular series of free lunchtime concerts presented by the Miller Theater in Philosophy Hall of Columbia University. Now she puts all six works together in a single afternoon in the theater itself. To judge from reports on the earlier performances, tickets will probably be scarce. Oct. 23. Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway, at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheatre.com.
ANNA NETREBKO The Russian diva is almost as ubiquitous as Tchaikovsky this season, and -- no surprise -- she sings 8 of his songs here, in her New York recital debut, alongside 11 by Rimsky-Korsakov. Elena Bashkirova is the pianist. Oct. 26. Carnegie Hall.
'SIEGFRIED' What can Robert Lepage possibly add to the technological wonders of the first two installments of his unfolding Wagner ''Ring'' cycle at the Met? Why, the latest wrinkle, of course: 3-D. ''If the technology works as advertised, the singers will appear to move inside a three-dimensional world created by projections,'' Daniel J. Wakin and Steve Lohr reported in The New York Times. ''But tuxedo-clad operagoers will not face the indignity of wearing goofy 3-D glasses.'' Amazing, to be sure, but none of this helps -- you have to hope that it doesn't hinder -- the poor tenor at center stage for most of five hours, singing his heart and his voice out: in this case, Gary Lehman, replacing Ben Heppner, who withdrew from the punishing role in February because, according to his manager, it ''was just not the right repertoire for him.'' The opera is also a long haul for the conductor, and here again, Fabio Luisi has replaced James Levine. Deborah Voigt sings Brunnhilde; Bryn Terfel, the Wanderer; Eric Owens, Alberich. Opens Oct. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA As much as we love hearing Osmo Vanska and these players perform symphonies of Sibelius and Beethoven (and we do), it is high time New Yorkers got to hear something else from them, and here it is. As the Tchaikovsky binge continues, the probing pianist Stephen Hough can be counted on to provide fresh insights into the First Concerto, and perhaps Mr. Vanska can awaken interest in the ''Voyevoda'' Overture. But the real attraction is the ''Sinfonia Espansiva,'' the Third Symphony of the great Dane Carl Nielsen, whose works are not heard here nearly enough (though Alan Gilbert has also taken up the cause at the New York Philharmonic, which will perform the ''Espansiva,'' in June). Mr. Vanska and his quasi-Scandinavian band should be just the ones to do the music justice. Oct. 27. Carnegie Hall.
BUDAPEST FESTIVAL ORCHESTRA The thoughtful Hungarian-born pianist Andras Schiff begins his season-long Carnegie Perspectives series, focusing on Bartok, with favorite collaborators: the conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest players, who are becoming regular and welcome visitors to New York. Mr. Schiff performs the three Bartok piano concertos over two evenings. Mr. Fischer and the orchestra fill out the programs with works of Schubert, including the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, and more Bartok. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 28-29. Carnegie Hall.
MIDORI This excellent violinist, possessed of a rare aesthetic and social sensibility, has carved out a major career on her own terms, devoting at least as much effort to education and public service as to performing. After her repertory adventures and commissioning projects of recent years, she reverts to standard fare -- works of Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Shostakovich -- for this recital, and she should be at her communicative best in the Y's intimate hall. Ozgur Aydin is the pianist. Oct. 29. 92nd Street Y.
JONAS KAUFMANN The way cancellations have gone in recent seasons, the Met should post betting odds with its rosters. This German tenor, who has swept all before him in recent seasons at the house, is scheduled to make his New York recital debut there less than two months, it turns out, after surgery to remove a node from his chest. Helmut Deutsch is the pianist. So what are the odds? Oct. 30. Metropolitan Opera House.
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT CARNEGIE The pianist Mr. Schiff rounds out the opening volley of his Perspectives concerts with a recital in the Stern Auditorium, offering more Bartok, the Piano Sonata, along with Bach's Three-Part Inventions and Beethoven's ''Diabelli'' Variations. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. Oct. 31. Carnegie Hall.
IVES VIOLIN SONATAS Hilary Hahn is the latest in a line of superb active female violinists with a fiercely independent streak, not following in the footsteps of Anne-Sophie Mutter, Midori or anyone else. It is only appropriate that Ms. Hahn should alight on the music of the surly nonconformist Charles Ives. Valentina Lisitsa is the equally fine pianist on this Deutsche Grammophon release, which should do much to establish these four works in the active repertory. October.
NOVEMBER
ROBERT ASHLEY A big season for the composer Robert Ashley begins with several nights of old and new pieces performed by his associates Tom Hamilton and Thomas Buckner with a number of young players, followed by a guerrilla performance of his opera ''Perfect Lives'' by the experimental ensemble thingNY in private and public spaces on the Lower East Side. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 1, 4-5. St. Mark's Church in the Bowery, 131 East 10th Street, (212) 420-1916, incubatorarts.org. Nov. 6. Various locations.
'KOYAANISQATSI' Though no expert on film, admittedly, I found this effort by Godfrey Reggio hopelessly simplistic in its lamentation of the ''life out of balance'' of the subtitle, despite its gorgeous cinematography. Some might level a similar charge against Philip Glass's music, but for me it was the best part of the film: enough to elevate it above the ordinary. The New York Philharmonic and the Philip Glass Ensemble play the score live to accompany a screening of the film, with Michael Riesman conducting. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Nov. 2-3. Avery Fisher Hall.
'SPECTRAL SCRIABIN' Not all the light in Lincoln Center's White Light Festival is a transcendent white. In this production, for a program of Scriabin played by the Georgian pianist Eteri Andjaparidze, the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton updates the various experiments with color organs extending back at least to the 18th century and expands on Scriabin's own cues for colorization in his orchestral ''Promethee: La Poeme du Feu.'' Nov. 3-5. Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org.
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA As its financial doldrums drag on and key players decamp or contemplate new positions, the orchestra waits yet another season for its new music director, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, to arrive. The stalwart Charles Dutoit continues in the interim position of chief conductor, and in a significant gesture, Mr. Nezet-Seguin has added a fourth week of subscription concerts to the three he was scheduled to conduct this season. But the dispirited ensemble needs more than gestures, and you have to wonder how long the center can hold. For his first subscription week, Mr. Nezet-Seguin offers Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and -- with the soprano Dorothea Roschmann, the baritone Matthias Goerne and the Westminster Symphonic Choir -- Brahms's ''German Requiem.'' Nov. 3-5. Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, (215) 893-1999, philorch.org.
'SATYAGRAHA' Richard Croft returns as Gandhi in a revival of Phelim McDermott's production of this touchstone work by Philip Glass. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Opens Nov. 4. Metropolitan Opera House.
ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The orchestra missed a chance to play in Carnegie Hall in May, when it had to cancel its participation in the Spring for Music Festival for financial reasons. But here it appears under Carnegie's own auspices, with its music director, Robert Spano, conducting Scriabin's ''Poem of Ecstasy''; Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Garrick Ohlsson as a presumably commanding soloist; and the New York premiere of Esa-Pekka Salonen's ''Nyx.'' If there is a New York connection embedded in the title of that work, commissioned by Carnegie Hall, Mr. Salonen's Web site (esapekkasalonen.co.uk) guards the secret well. Nov. 5. Carnegie Hall.
OPERA ORCHESTRA OF NEW YORK In his first concert as the company's full-fledged music director, Alberto Veronesi conducts Cilea's ''Adriana Lecouvreur.'' The ''dream cast,'' as the company's Web site (operaorchestrany.org) calls it (wait, aren't the newly enriched Philadelphia Eagles the dream team?), is led by Angela Gheorghiu and Jonas Kaufmann: a sort of consolation prize for the Gheorghiu-Kaufmann partnership that won't be happening in the Met's ''Faust,'' even if Mr. Kaufmann has recovered from his preseason surgery by then, because of Ms. Gheorghiu's withdrawal. Nov. 8. Carnegie Hall.
'DARK SISTERS' As New York awaits a Nico Muhly opera on a large scale -- ''Two Boys,'' which opened to considerable acclaim at the English National Opera in June and is due at the Metropolitan in the 2013-14 season -- the Gotham Chamber Opera presents the premiere of one on a small scale. Set to a libretto by Stephen Karam and based in part on reports out of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it deals with the plight of a woman trapped in a polygamous relationship and those of her sister wives. Opens Nov. 9. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 279-4200, gothamchamberopera.org.
OLIVIER LATRY This French virtuoso played all the organ works of the great mystic Olivier Messiaen on the Mander organ at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in six programs in 2000. You might think that this single concert of Messiaen, part of Lincoln Center's White Light Festival, represented a mere distillation, but nothing about Messiaen is mere. Spiritual exaltation is assured, and this should be a good technical workout for the reinstalled and restored Kuhn organ, showing the range of its distinctively French colorations. Nov. 11. Alice Tully Hall.
HUELGAS ENSEMBLE The White Light Festival at Lincoln Center seems to have adapted Thomas Tallis's 40-part motet, ''Spem in Alium,'' as a sort of theme song. Last year the festival, in its first season, presented an installation based on the work: an electronic deconstruction that placed listeners inside a circle of 40 speakers, each delivering mainly the sound of a single voice. Now this excellent Belgian choir, directed by Paul Van Nevel, performs the work straight, in the first of two festival concerts in more or less neighboring churches. That program, ''Utopia,'' also offers works by Gabrieli, Striggio, Brumel, Josquin and others. The second program, ''Medieval Apocalypse,'' includes works by Perotin, Machaut, Ciconia and Matteo de Perugia. Nov. 10. Fourth Universalist Church, 160 Central Park West. Nov. 12. Church of St. Mary the Virgin, 146 West 46th Street, (212) 721-6500, whitelightfestival.org.
VIENNA SYMPHONY No question, this is Vienna's other orchestra, though still in a very good league. Unlike the Vienna Philharmonic, it has a principal conductor, Fabio Luisi, whom New York is quickly getting to know as an opera maestro, now the principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera and the presumptive heir to James Levine as music director. But the Vienna orchestras have things in common beyond their home city: for one, of the 25 or so Vienna Symphony players pictured in Lincoln Center's brochure, 2, maybe 3, are women, and fuller pictures on the orchestra's Web site (wiener-symphoniker.at) show an even smaller percentage of women. In two programs, Mr. Luisi conducts works by Beethoven (Triple Concerto), Brahms (Second Symphony), that Austrian favorite Franz Schmidt (Fourth Symphony) and Rachmaninoff (Second Piano Concerto, with Lisa de la Salle as soloist). Nov. 13-14. Avery Fisher Hall.
ORCHESTRE REVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE John Eliot Gardiner and his period band have visited New York in recent years with substantial helpings of Haydn and Mozart. Could Beethoven have been far behind? Here they offer most of the heart of Beethoven's batting order, the Symphonies Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 7, along with the overtures to ''Egmont'' and ''The Creatures of Prometheus.'' Nov. 16-17. Carnegie Hall.
'KOMMILITONEN!' British eyebrows twitched when the Scottish composer Peter Maxwell Davies, a former enfant terrible, was appointed master of the queen's music in 2004. Did the queen (or whoever dispenses such honors) know what she was getting? Had Sir Peter gone soft in his knighthood (conferred in 1987)? Not entirely, it seems. ''My new opera deals with brave students who stood up for what they believed in and triggers a wonderful example of adversity,'' Mr. Davies has said of ''Kommilitonen (Young Blood!),'' which had its premiere in March at the Royal Academy of Music in London. The opera interweaves three stories of students embroiled in political activity, in Germany, China and the United States. ''At the end,'' Mr. Davies says, ''everything comes together in a great cry of freedom.'' Anne Manson conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and Juilliard Opera singers in the American premiere of the work, commissioned by the Juilliard School and the British academy. David Pountney, the librettist, directs. Nov. 16, 18, 20. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
EUGENE SYMPHONY Spring for Music, a festival intended to encourage adventurous symphonic programming, made its debut in May at Carnegie Hall, drawing welcome attention to the full range of North American orchestras, including smaller ones not often heard outside their home regions. Perhaps the greatest triumph was the Oregon Symphony's, with an imaginative program built on a war theme. But Oregon evidently has another orchestra capable of thinking big thoughts. The Eugene Symphony opens Counterpoint 2011, a three-week series of concerts and community events centering on the topic of war and peace, with a performance of Shostakovich's ''Leningrad'' Symphony, conducted by its music director, Danail Rachev. Other concerts will include John Adams's ''On the Transmigration of Souls,'' a Sept. 11 commemoration, and Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait,'' in a multimedia presentation narrated by Tom Brokaw (Nov. 22); and Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony (Dec. 1). Nov. 17. Hult Center, Eugene, Ore., (541) 682-5000, eugenesymphony.org.
TAFELMUSIK BAROQUE ORCHESTRA This respected ensemble has devised ambitious thematic programs in recent years: notably, ''The Galileo Project,'' a riveting theatrical evening experienced at Tafelmusik's home base in Toronto in March. We can hope that one of those programs will find its way to New York soon, but the looser assemblage of works by Lully, Bach, Fasch and Vivaldi here should serve handsomely in the meantime. Nov. 18. Zankel Hall.
BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Not to trivialize the exploits and martyrdom of Joan of Arc, but Marin Alsop, this ensemble's music director, knows a thing or two about overcoming obstacles in a field dominated by men. So who can blame her if, as she conducts Honegger's oratorio ''Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher,'' she identifies just a touch with the heroine? An array of choruses includes the Concert Artists of Baltimore, the Peabody-Hopkins Chorus and the Morgan State University Choir. Nov. 19. Carnegie Hall.
'THAT MORNING THING' Robert Ashley's 1967 opera receives a new production as part of the Performa 11 series. Separate article by Steve Smith. Nov. 19-21. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org.
ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA The conductorless ensemble, pushing 40 and comfortably ensconced in an annual series at Carnegie Hall, has plenty of laurels to rest on. But it looks to fresh adventures this season, taking on its first composer in residence, Gabriel Kahane, and starting a new series at Galapagos in Brooklyn. The first concert there presents two segments by Mr. Kahane -- his ''Orinoco Sketches,'' based on the diary of a grandmother who fled Nazi Germany, and songs from his new album, ''Where Are the Arms'' -- alongside Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 1 (which will also be heard at Carnegie on Dec. 3). Mr. Kahane supplies vocals and plays piano. Nov. 20. Galapagos Art Space, 16 Main Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 222-8500, galapagosartspace.com.
'FAUST' Again, you have to make allowances for the pace of Jonas Kaufmann's recovery from surgery in September. Mr. Kaufmann is scheduled to take the title role here as -- in Des McAnuff's production, shared with the English National Opera -- an aging nuclear physicist in the aftermath of Hiroshima. (Other Fausts, Roberto Alagna and Joseph Calleja, are to appear later in the run in any case.) Marina Poplavskaya replaces the originally announced Angela Gheorghiu as Marguerite, and Rene Pape is a Mephistopheles not likely to be lost in the shadows. Yannick Nezet-Seguin conducts. Opens Nov. 29. Metropolitan Opera House.
BACH TRAUERMUSIK With the Taverner Consort and Players, the conductor and scholar Andrew Parrott presents his reconstruction of Bach's funeral music for Prince Leopold, his former patron at Cothen, first performed by the New York Collegium in 2004. Do not expect something completely new and different. Writing in 1728, Bach evidently drew heavily on the near-contemporaneous ''St. Matthew Passion,'' so most of the tunes -- and what tunes! -- will be familiar, but the texts will not. A fascinating venture. Avie Records. November.
DECEMBER
'ORANGO' The opera 'Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District' got Shostakovich into a heap of trouble with Soviet officialdom after its premiere in 1934; he didn't need more. So it may be just as well that he never finished ''Orango,'' a satirical opera (involving a hybrid of human and ape) aimed at the press, which he worked on at the same time. He completed only the prologue, 40 minutes of music, in a piano-vocal score discovered in 2006, which the musicologist Gerard McBurney has orchestrated. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale in the premiere of that version, with staging directed by Peter Sellars. Mr. Salonen also conducts the orchestra in Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony, and the political history of that work is a whole other story. Dec. 2-4. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA There have been staged productions of Handel's ''Messiah'': notably, in recent decades, those of Achim Freyer in Berlin and Deborah Warner in London, but they were conceived for opera companies. At a time when symphony orchestras have been all too ready to cede Baroque repertory to early-music specialists, the Pittsburgh Symphony seems an unlikely source for this sort of experimentation. But there it is: a fully staged production, it is said, ''with dramatic lighting effects, costumes and sets, with the orchestra in the pit.'' Where the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh will find a perch is anyone's guess. The orchestra's innovative music director, Manfred Honeck, will conduct, and Sam Helfrich will direct. Dec. 2-4. Heinz Hall, (412) 392-4900 or (800) 743-8560, pittsburghsymphony.org.
'MESSIAH' There is no lack of excellent performances of Handel's seasonal oratorio at Christmastime (no matter that this is not the season Handel wrote for) in New York. Kent Tritle alone will conduct two different versions on three consecutive days at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 19, the Mozart arrangement with the Oratorio Society of New York; Dec. 20 and 21, straight Handel with Musica Sacra), both eminently recommendable. But the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, trained and conducted by John Scott, is generally first off the mark and often stands up as the best in the end. As always, the orchestra is the fine period-instrument Concert Royal. Dec. 6, 8. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA When the Philadelphia Orchestra was looking for its next music director, Vladimir Jurowski -- the London Philharmonic's principal conductor, who had had great success in Philadelphia -- met with a groundswell of support. But once the Philadelphia administrators had settled on Yannick Nezet-Seguin, you began to hear less of Mr. Jurowski in this country. You would like to think that these concerts might rekindle interest, but Tchaikovsky's ''Manfred'' comes like coals to Newcastle at Carnegie this season, and not the highest-grade coals at that. And the two programs are otherwise of interest as much for their soloists -- Janine Jansen in Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 5, Emanuel Ax in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 -- as for Mr. Jurowski's moments in the spotlight: Matthias Pintscher's ''towards Osiris'' and Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Dec. 7-8. Carnegie Hall.
ELLIOTT CARTER The birthdays keep coming, and so do the compositions. The cellist Fred Sherry is organizing a concert for Mr. Carter's 103rd birthday that will include the premiere of a string trio and the American premieres of a double trio and a work called ''Trije Glasbeniki'' (''Three Musicians,'' in Slovenian). And who knows? Maybe Mr. Carter will have dashed off another piece or three for the occasion. Dec. 8. 92nd Street Y. TRINITY CHOIR And yet another run of ''Messiah'' performances. The Trinity Choir and its attendant orchestras, in their many activities for the Sept. 11 anniversary, gave considerable evidence that under Julian Wachner's directorship, they are very near the top of musical life in New York, and you can expect further proof here. Yes, I know, music may be incidental to their higher purpose, but they sure know how to pull music lovers into a church that for most of them is well out of the way. Dec. 11, 12. Trinity Church, Broadway at Wall Street, (212) 602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org. Dec. 19. Alice Tully Hall.
ANONYMOUS 4 This wonderful female vocal quartet is celebrating a 25th anniversary. But wait: how does the Great Disbandment of Aught-Four figure into that? Aw, who cares. Just be grateful that the group is still around to take part in the Met Museum's cherished holiday series with music appropriate to the season performed before the Christmas tree and Neapolitan Baroque creche in the Medieval Sculpture Hall. Dec. 15. Metropolitan Museum.
CONTACT! O.K., so maybe things are changing, incrementally, at the New York Philharmonic. The orchestra continues to ghettoize contemporary music in this series of concerts off premises, but it celebrates Beethoven's birthday in the quirkiest fashion imaginable (though not the most contemporary), with H. K. Gruber singing his 1977 magnum opus, ''Frankenstein!!'' Alan Gilbert conducts a program that also includes Magnus Lindberg's ''Gran Duo'' and Alexandre Lunsqui's ''Fibers, Yarn and Fabric.'' Dec. 16. Metropolitan Museum. Dec. 17. Symphony Space.
'THE ENCHANTED ISLAND' For the man who has every role: this pastiche -- cobbled together in good Baroque fashion from music of Handel, Vivaldi, Rameau and others by Jeremy Sams, who supplies his own English libretto -- gives Placido Domingo a way to expand his seemingly limitless repertory without having to resort to more baritone roles or conductorial gigs. He sings Neptune in a loose revamp of Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' and ''Midsummer Nights' Dream.'' Joyce DiDonato is Sycorax; Danielle de Niese, Ariel; David Daniels, Prospero. William Christie conducts, and Phelim McDermott directs. This confection may be just frothy enough for New Year's Eve. How it will stand up on long, cold, punishing nights in January and February remains to be seen. Opens Dec. 31. Metropolitan Opera House.
JANUARY
GREEN MOUNTAIN PROJECTPerformances of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers by this group, built around Jolle Greenleaf's vocal ensemble Tenet, at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin were highlights of the New York season for two Januarys running. Now, evidently trusting that the third outing will be an even greater charm, the project is relocating and expanding, with a second performance in New York and a third in Cambridge, Mass. It is also deepening its explorations, this time presenting what it calls ''Vespers of 1640,'' combining music from Monteverdi's ''Selva Morale e Spirituale'' with works of Giovanni Gabrieli. Jan. 3-4. Church of St. Jean Baptiste, 184 East 76th Street. Jan. 7. St. Paul's Church, Cambridge, (646) 470-5809, tenetnyc.com.
MAHLER PROJECT Gustavo Dudamel conducts all the Mahler symphonies in just over three weeks: Nos. 1, 4, 6, 9 and 10 (Adagio) with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 7 with the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra (formerly Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra) of Venezuela; No. 8 (''Symphony of a Thousand'') with both orchestras. For good measure, in the first program -- alongside the Fourth Symphony, with the soprano Miah Persson as soloist -- Mr. Dudamel throws in the ''Lieder Eines Fahrenden Gesellen,'' sung by Thomas Hampson. Then, with all that behind them, the Los Angeles players will follow Mr. Dudamel and the Venezuelans to Caracas, where they will perform the symphony cycle again in mid-February. Jan. 13-15 (also Jan. 19-21, 22, 24, 26-29, 31; Feb. 2-5). Walt Disney Concert Hall, Shrine Auditorium (No. 8), Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
MUSIC OF TEREZIN Will to Create, Will to Live is an interdisciplinary series of concerts, films, exhibits and lectures focusing on artists who, in the Y's description, ''during World War II faced the horrors of incarceration and death yet managed to persevere and raise their voices.'' The Nash Ensemble of Britain presents three programs, sharing two of them with the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair and the pianist Russell Ryan. Another pianist, Shai Wosner, accompanies Mr. Holzmair in a fourth concert. Jan. 17, 19, 21, 23. 92nd Street Y.
THOMAS HAMPSON Much of the Met Museum's concert programming this season is tied to exhibitions or openings of galleries. In this case, to greet the New American Wing Galleries for Paintings, Sculpture and Decorative Arts, which opens on Jan. 16, the estimable baritone Mr. Hampson continues his multiyear project ''Song of America,'' performing works of Copland, Barber, Ives, Thomson and others in the American Wing, with Craig Rutenberg as pianist. Jan. 22. Metropolitan Museum.
OPERA LAYAYETTE It has always seemed odd that -- as the season-opening ''Atys'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music reminds us -- God's greatest gift to French Baroque opera in the modern era should have been an American, the conductor William Christie. It seems hardly less surprising that Mr. Christie's work should be notably furthered by another American, Ryan Brown, and his Washington-based company. They visited New York in February with ''Le Magnifique'' by Gretry, a composer some had heard on recordings if not encountered live. But Monsigny? You're more likely to know the street in Paris than Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, the composer of ''Le Roi et le Fermier,'' a 1762 gloss on social issues that Opera Lafayette brings to New York between its opening at the Kennedy Center in Washington (Jan. 21) and two performances at Versailles. Didier Rousselet is the director, and Mr. Brown conducts a cast including Dominique Labelle, Yulia Van Doren and William Sharp. Jan. 26. Frederick P. Rose Theater, 60th Street and Broadway, (202) 546-9332, operalafayette.org.
'GOTTERDAMMERUNG' And now that Robert Lepage has constructed his wondrous technological contraption of a Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, it is time for it all to come crashing down. Even in lower-tech productions, the final conflagration has occasionally produced moments of actual physical danger for some on stage. (Hildegard Behrens was decked by a stray beam at the Met in 1990.) Enough has already gone wrong with the current mechanisms, and enough pratfalls have occurred on the monstrous set, that a shiver of real fear may accompany the illusion of Valhalla's collapse. This will also be the time to check in on James Levine's recovery, since he now projects these performances as his return to the podium. Opens Jan. 27. Metropolitan Opera House.
FOCUS! FESTIVAL On one hand, this contemporary-music event's focus is narrower than usual, since it centers on a single composer, John Cage, in honor of his centenary. On the other hand, Cage was in some ways the least focused of composers, ranging restlessly through musical styles and the sounds of silence, and venturing into the worlds of literature, dance and visual art. The festival will touch mostly on the musical manifestations and will touch on other American composers in performances by the New Juilliard Ensemble and the Juilliard Percussion Ensemble. Jan. 27-Feb. 3. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Paul Hall, Juilliard School; Alice Tully Hall.
KAYHAN KALHOR Here is another concert at the Met Museum inspired by a new display space, in this case the New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia, which opens on Nov. 1. No one familiar with the Iranian Mr. Kalhor's emotionally rich yet superbly nuanced playing of the kamancheh (a Persian spike fiddle) -- and many Westerners are familiar with it, thanks especially to Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Project -- will want to miss this evening of traditional Persian music. (Mr. Kalhor's latest recording, ''I Will Not Stand Alone,'' is to be released by World Village in connection with the concert.) Jan. 28. Metropolitan Museum.
'RIENZI' When Eve Queler gave up the music directorship of the Opera Orchestra of New York in the spring, she left some business unfinished. In the 2008-9 season, the company, hit hard by the recession, had to cancel a concert performance of this early Wagner opera, which it had made something of a specialty over the decades. It promised the work for the next season but is only now catching up. Ms. Queler, as music director laureate, conducts the New York Choral Society and a cast including Ian Storey and Elisabete Matos. Jan. 29. Avery Fisher Hall.
AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA With ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and ''Satyagraha'' already out of the way, there continues to be a lot of music by Philip Glass this season, much of it in connection with his 75th birthday. The performance here, the American premiere of his Ninth Symphony, hits the birthday right on the nose. Dennis Russell Davies, a longtime Glass champion, conducts a program that also includes the New York premiere of Arvo Part's ''Lamentate.'' Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Jan. 31. Carnegie Hall.
FEBRUARY
COLLEGIATE CHORALE ''A Child of Our Time,'' by Michael Tippett, and Bruckner's Te Deum, each a compelling choral statement in its own right, otherwise have little in common, but that's what intermissions are for. Nicole Cabell and John Relyea are soloists in the Tippett, and James Bagwell conducts. Feb. 3, Carnegie Hall.
MET + JUILLIARD Two years ago in this space, through a slip of the brain, I attributed the ''Armida'' being presented by the Metropolitan Opera to Gluck rather than Rossini. Now I can properly welcome Gluck's ''Armide,'' which in fact was performed in concert in that 2009-10 season, by Opera Lafayette, and which Anthony Tommasini called ''a seemingly flawless masterpiece'' in The New York Times It will be jointly presented here by the Met and the Juilliard School in a semistaging directed by Fabrizio Melano. Jane Glover conducts the Juilliard Orchestra and singers from the Met's young artist development program and Juilliard's institute for vocal arts. Feb. 8, 11. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Juilliard School.
IMMORTAL INVESTMENTS The good thing about a festival devoted to, say, Tchaikovsky or Oswald von Wolkenstein, is that you have a pretty good idea what you're going to get. With the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's high-concept fall festival, Dedications (Mozart dedicated to Haydn, Schumann dedicated to Mendelssohn; Nov. 4, 6), and its higher-concept winter festival here, the title tells you little. ''Immortal investments'' refers to patronage, tributes and commissions. So there are Haydn and Beethoven quartets commissioned by Prince Lobkowitz; works by the mutual admirers Joachim and Brahms; music by Stravinsky, Debussy, Faure and others associated with salons hosted by the Princesse de Polignac; and pieces by Ravel, Bartok, Poulenc and Copland commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. It all fits into a season-long theme of synergy: a tough one for a marketing department to wrap its cliches around. Feb. 10; 12; 24; 26, 28. Alice Tully Hall.
'LA TRAVIATA' The newly nomadic New York City Opera finally opens its season of full productions. On a recent visit to The New York Times, administrators of the Brooklyn Academy of Music made clear that they were happy to provide a home for City Opera performances, but only if the presentations jibe with Brooklyn Academy's own programming philosophy. Verdi's war horse, for example, might not otherwise have qualified, but the director of this new production (with scenery and costumes created for the Glimmerglass Opera and the Vancouver Opera) is Jonathan Miller, whose work has generally played well at the house. Laquita Mitchell sings the title role, David Pomeroy is Alfredo, and Steven White conducts. Opens Feb. 12. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
CHICAGO SYMPHONY IN SAN FRANCISCO The two programs, conducted by Riccardo Muti, will be performed in Chicago first, but here they are part of an American Orchestra Series the San Francisco Symphony is presenting to celebrate its centennial. It has invited six major ensembles to perform two concerts each, including works they have commissioned. Chicago presents works by its composers in residence, Mason Bates's ''Alternative Energy'' (with Honegger's ''Pacific 231'' and Franck's Symphony in D minor) and Anna Clynes's ''Night Ferry'' (with Schubert's Ninth Symphony and an entr'acte from his incidental music for ''Rosamunde''). Other orchestras participating are the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Feb. 14, 15. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, (415) 864-6000, sfsymphony.org.
'PRIMA DONNA' When challenged recently as to why, with only four productions to spare this season, the scaled-down New York City Opera would stake so much on a Rufus Wainwright opera that even some of Mr. Wainwright's staunchest admirers found wanting at its premiere in Manchester, England, in 2009, George Steel, City Opera's general manager and artistic director, rose to a spirited defense. ''It's a beautiful and remarkably accomplished work,'' he said, ''a love letter to French opera. It's never been performed in the United States, and it's precisely the kind of thing City Opera ought to perform.'' The Brooklyn Academy's administrators seem to agree. The rest will be history, of one sort or another. Opens Feb. 19. BAM Howard Gilman Opera House.
ERIK OWENS This bass-baritone turned the seemingly thankless role of Alberich in Wagner's ''Rheingold'' into a star vehicle last season. And now -- in addition to singing Alberich this season in ''Rheingold,'' ''Siegfried'' and ''Gotterdammerung'' -- Mr. Owens does what stars do, taking over the stage for a solo recital. The program includes works by Schubert, Schumann, Wolf, Debussy, Duparc, Ravel and, yes, Wagner; and the pianist, in a bit of glamour casting, is the conductor Robert Spano. Feb. 21. Zankel Hall.
BERLIN PHILHARMONIC When last heard in Carnegie, in 2009, Simon Rattle and this great orchestra had to compete with sounds intruding from a concert of Cape Verdean music in Zankel Hall. Carnegie seems to have ironed out that wrinkle in its programming strategy and made the world safe for pianissimos again. Of those there will be many (often opposite mighty fortissimos), in Debussy's ''Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune,'' Schoenberg's ''Verklarte Nacht'' and Elgar's ''Enigma Variations'' on the first night; a completion of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony on the second; and Mahler's ''Resurrection'' Symphony on the third. Feb. 23-25. Carnegie Hall.
TUNE-IN MUSIC FESTIVAL This event, in its second season, is one of many celebrations of Philip Glass's 75th birthday and includes a performance of the huge and seminal Music in 12 Parts. Separate article by Allan Kozinn. Feb. 23-26. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org.
MARCH
THE MODERN BEETHOVEN You don't need much of a pretext to sell a Beethoven festival to your marketing department, especially at the New York Philharmonic. David Zinman conducts the orchestra in all the master's symphonies except the Fifth (say, what?), the Sixth (presented earlier in the season) and the Ninth, interspersed with 20th-century concertos of sorts by Stravinsky, Barber and Karl Amadeus Hartmann. Beethoven's Second and Seventh and Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra lead off. Expect brisk tempos from Mr. Zinman, one who supports the notion that Beethoven's metronome marks, disputed over the centuries, were probably what he wanted after all. March 1-3, 6 (also March, 8, 10, 13; 15-17, 20). Avery Fisher Hall.
JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA While David Zinman tends to the New York Philharmonic and Beethoven, Alan Gilbert conducts his Juilliard charges for the first time since he took over as the school's director of orchestral and conducting studies. Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' is hardly child's play, but these prize students may just make it sound easy. The program also includes Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin'' and Christopher Rouse's Violin Concerto. March 2. Avery Fisher Hall.
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC As New Yorkers well know, if only from his tenure with their Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel can be an exasperating conductor, given to overcontrolling mannerisms. But he can also be deeply satisfying in certain repertory, and he has often proved so in Sibelius. The first of these three concerts, with Sibelius's First, Fifth and Seventh Symphonies, could well be a knockout. And to whatever extent Mr. Maazel just lets this magnificent band play, the other programs should hold many rewards, too, with Mozart's Symphony No. 40 and Mr. Maazel's own Wagner arrangement, ''The Ring Without Words,'' on Saturday evening and works by Richard Strauss and the Johann Strausses on Sunday afternoon. March 2-4. Carnegie Hall.
KAIJA SAARIAHO Ms. Saariaho, who occupies the composer's chair at Carnegie Hall this season, will be represented in concerts by the Finnish Avanti! Chamber Ensemble (Nov. 30), the St. Louis Symphony (March 10) and the Cleveland Orchestra (May 23). And with the cellist Anssi Kartunen, she will conduct a professional training workshop for composers and solo string players. Here she is featured in Carnegie's Making Music series with a program of her works performed by the French vocal ensemble Solistes XXI. March 5. Zankel Hall.
SEQUENTIA Harold Camping, there is nothing new under the sun. A streamlined version of this excellent Paris-based early-music ensemble -- Benjamin Bagby, singing and playing harps and symphoniums, and Norbert Rodenkirchen, on flutes and harp -- presents ''Fragments for the End of Time,'' a program of millennium-old music based on apocalyptic texts. Mr. Bagby, acclaimed nowadays for his solo renditions of ''Beowulf,'' draws on that epic for the ''Lay of the Last Survivor'' as well as on the Edda and other writings. March 6. Morgan Library & Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, (212) 685-0008, ext. 560, themorgan.org.
BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Before three Carnegie concerts by the orchestra in March, there was a last-minute scramble to find replacement conductors for James Levine after his cancellation for health reasons. Around the same time, for the same reasons, Mr. Levine gave up the music directorship of the orchestra, which thus had plenty of time to find replacements for this season. They are Kurt Masur (himself seemingly in parlous health) in Beethoven's ''Missa Solemnis,'' Christoph Eschenbach in a program of Berlioz and Ravel, and Stephane Deneve in works by Ravel, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. March 6-7, 9. Carnegie Hall.
PIATIGORSKY INTERNATIONAL CELLO FESTIVAL The American cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, long resident in London, founded the respected Manchester International Cello Festival at the Royal Northern College of Music in 1988, which ran at two- or three-year intervals, and oversaw it to its end, in 2007. Mr. Kirshbaum has since moved to Los Angeles, where he teaches at the University of Southern California and now unveils a successor event, a partnership involving the university's music school, the Colburn School and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. More than 20 noted cellists are scheduled to appear, and 6 of them will divvy up the Bach solo suites in a single evening (March 11). Three will perform concertos in Philharmonic concerts conducted by Neeme Jarvi in the Walt Disney Concert Hall: Mr. Kirshbaum in the Dvorak Concerto (March 15), Mischa Maisky in the Shostakovich First (March 17) and Alisa Weilerstein in Tchaikovsky's ''Rococo'' Variations and Respighi's ''Adagio con Variazioni'' (March 18). March 9-18. Various locations in Los Angeles, (213) 740-3129, usc.edu/piatigorsky--festival.
ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY The Finnish soprano Karita Mattila sings ''Quatre Instants'' by her compatriot Kaija Saariaho, Carnegie's composer in residence, and David Robertson, the orchestra's music director, conducts Debussy's ''Printemps'' and Stravinsky's complete ballet score ''L'Oiseau de Feu.'' March 10. Carnegie Hall.
L'ARPEGGIATA Carnegie Hall bestows the honor of a Perspectives series on an early-music group for the first time. And it does so to performers who made their North American debut just last fall, in Zankel Hall, and are known in this country almost solely through recordings. But those recordings are impressive, as were reports on the Zankel concert, which The New York Times didn't manage to cover on a typically hectic October evening of performances. March promises to be the other busy month this season, but it will be hard to miss this lineup of four programs, which bring those recordings to life and will undoubtedly add novelties and surprises, for they appear to be rich in the group's trademark quasi-jazz improvisations. The repertory reflects its specialty in early-17th-century French and Italian music. Christina Pluhar, a lutenist and harpist, is the artistic director. March 14-17. Zankel Hall, Weill Recital Hall.
AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR You may think you know nothing of Bach's Cantata No. 147 (''Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben''), but if you know the tune ''Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring,'' you're two chorales ahead of the game. And if you don't know Bach's spectacular and wonderfully compact Magnificat, you're in for a second huge treat. All that -- and another cantata, ''Du Hirte Israel, Hore'' (No. 104) -- by expert performers, led by Ton Koopman. Not to be missed. March 15. Alice Tully Hall.
CALLAS ON FILM You saw ''Master Class,'' with Tyne Daly if not before. You've read about charisma, courtesy of Zachary Woolfe in The New York Times. Now see and hear Maria Callas in action (insofar as the technology of the era allowed) in Alain Ferrari's 1978 documentary ''Vissi d'Arte,'' a film of a 1959 Hamburg concert and a selection of clips of the diva in conversation and on stage. March 17-18. Walter Reade Theater.
'COSI FAN TUTTE' Christopher Alden, who directed an acclaimed production of ''Don Giovanni'' at the New York City Opera in 2009, continues his survey of the Mozart operas to librettos by Lorenzo Da Ponte. Separate article by Zachary Woolfe. Opens March 18. Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 58th Street, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
EMERSON STRING QUARTET After years of adventuring and exploration, the group homes in on monuments of the literature, presenting the late quartets of Beethoven in three programs laced with late quartets by Mozart. The Emerson's recording of those Mozart quartets (K. 575, 589 and 590) will have been released in November by Sony Classical. March 21, April 4, 29. Alice Tully Hall.
'ST. JOHN PASSION' A Bach Passion can rise (or fall) on the strength (or weakness) of the tenor singing the Evangelist. Bernard Labadie's expert performances of Handel's ''Messiah'' and Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio'' at Carnegie Hall with his Violons du Roy and Chapelle de Quebec in 2009 would have raised expectations for another major outing in any case, despite some suspect work by vocal soloists. But here Mr. Labadie and his forces have the inestimable advantage of -- to judge from recordings, at least -- a great Evangelist, the English tenor Ian Bostridge. And if Mr. Bostridge is not the best Bach Evangelist at work today, then it can only be the English-German tenor Rufus Muller. New Yorkers have the remarkable opportunity to hear them both in the ''St. John'' within less than a week. Mr. Muller, who performs the work with the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and the period-instrument Concert Royal, conducted by John Scott, has so internalized the role that he sings it from memory. Unable to choose between them, I choose to hear both. Labadie-Bostridge, March 25. Carnegie Hall. Scott-Muller, March 30. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org.
'MANON' And here is Anna Netrebko in another new production. New to the Met that is. Laurent Pelly's staging of Massenet's opera originated at the Royal Opera in London, where, according to one quaintly mixed metaphor in the British press, it ''triggered'' a ''shower of plaudits.'' The cast also includes Piotr Beczala and Paulo Szot, and Fabio Luisi conducts. Opens March 26. Metropolitan Opera House.
AMERICAN MAVERICKS Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony return to a concept they developed in 2000, presenting music by strong-willed Americans of the 20th and now 21st centuries, this time transporting it to New York as well. The Carnegie series opens (after a few neighborhood concerts) with a celebration of John Cage, in honor of his centenary, by So Percussion. Then the orchestra chimes in -- in whole (Varese's ''Ameriques'') or in part (Steve Reich's ''Six Marimbas'') -- with four programs of music by American pioneers (Ives, Cowell, Ruggles, Partch) and latter-day settlers (John Adams, David Del Tredici, Mason Bates, Meredith Monk). March 26-30. Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall.
'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Familiarity, on recordings and in New York performances, has bred the opposite of contempt for Philippe Herreweghe's treatment of this monumental Bach work with his Collegium Vocale Gent Choir and Orchestra. Here, as in the ''St. John Passion,'' the role of the Evangelist is all-important, and Mr. Herreweghe has had great tenors singing it over the years, including Ian Bostridge. You have to trust that Maximilian Schmitt, his current one, will fit comfortably into that lineage. From the chorus and orchestra, expect only the best. March 31. Alice Tully Hall.
APRIL
'DER RING DES NIBELUNGEN' Unless the climactic conflagration of ''Gotterdammerung'' has by now swallowed up Robert Lepage's mighty machine along with all Valhalla, the Met will stretch the four operas of its new Wagner ''Ring'' cycle end to end for the first time, then a second and a third. Next comes the question of its future. Once you know all the technological tricks, will you want to see the thing again? True, hearing it -- with James Levine's splendid orchestra and a generally fine cast -- is something else, and since the production undoubtedly cost too much even to contemplate scrapping it quickly, seeing it again will undoubtedly be the price operagoers have to pay to hear ''The Ring'' here again anytime soon. Mr. Levine's future should also be clearer by now. He is scheduled to conduct all three cycles, but from this distance the notion that he could muster the necessary strength and stamina seems a forlorn hope. Then again, any hope is better than none. Opens April 7. Metropolitan Opera House.
MITSUKO UCHIDA This superb pianist plays the three great posthumous sonatas of Schubert (D. 958-60), and I can only repeat much of what I said two seasons ago, when she played the three last sonatas of Beethoven: Ms. Uchida, who does so many things well, is typically at her best when plumbing the philosophical depths of late works by composers like Beethoven and Schubert, and I, for one, ache to hear her play an evening of the ineffable late piano works of Brahms, miniature in form but vast in expressive content. That, clearly, remains for another day. Meanwhile, we can only welcome Ms. Uchida's latest thoughts on Schubert; her earlier thoughts, on Philips recordings, were already remarkable. April 11. Carnegie Hall.
ORCHESTRA OF ST LUKE'S The versatile maestro Ivan Fisher scored many points as a Mozartean this summer at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, directing as well as conducting a concert staging of ''Don Giovanni'' and leading a program of the ''Jupiter'' Symphony and sacred works, early and late. Here he offers a variation on that concert, with Mozart's Symphony No. 34 (in C, like the ''Jupiter'') and the unfinished Requiem, with the orchestra joined by Musica Sacra and vocal soloists. April 12. Carnegie Hall.
FASIL SAY Some prominent features of recent Met Museum seasons seem to have gone by the board, at least for this transitional year, like the series of piano recitals in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium. The outing here, by a sometimes quirky but compelling pianist, in works by Janacek and Prokofiev and music of his own, should be fascinating. It had better be, since that's pretty much it for the season. April 20. Metropolitan Museum.
'GHOSTS OF VERSAILLES' In an ambitious undertaking, the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater presents a major opera by John Corigliano, who studied composition at the school as a graduate student and taught composition there from 1971 to 1991. The work was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera (in days when the Met wasn't doing much of that sort of thing) and given its premiere there in 1991. Jay Lesenger directs, and Steven Osgood conducts. April 25, 27, 29. Borden Auditorium, Manhattan School of Music, 120 Claremont Avenue, (917) 493-4428, msmnyc.edu.
MAY
ANDRAS SCHIFF AT ZANKEL For his second Perspectives recital, Mr. Schiff adds contemporary composers, Gyorgy Kurtag and Jorg Widmann, to his earlier three B's (Bach, Beethoven and Bartok) in a program of miniatures. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. May 2. Zankel Hall.
SALZBURG MARIONETTE THEATER And now the pianist Andras Schiff brings puppets into the act for Debussy's ''Boite a Joujoux'' (''Box of Toys'') at a full concert and a shorter family concert in his Carnegie Hall Perspectives series. How, exactly? Well, you probably have to be there. Separate article by Vivien Schweitzer. May 5-6. Zankel Hall.
SPRING FOR MUSIC This festival, wisely placed at a time of year when the concert season has started to slow, generated considerable attention in its first outing last May and great excitement for several North American orchestras that had seldom if ever played in Carnegie Hall. In the festival's second season, the Alabama Symphony Orchestra, based in Birmingham and conducted by Justin Brown, and the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra of Alberta, conducted by William Eddins, will make their Carnegie Hall debuts. Also appearing are the Houston Symphony, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra and the Nashville Symphony. Since the choices were made on the basis of innovative programming ideas and tickets are priced at $25, the potential rewards far outweigh the risks. May 7-12. Carnegie Hall.
NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY I single out for double mention a Spring for Music program that includes an odd personal favorite, Ferruccio Busoni's Piano Concerto, which is also -- not incidentally -- a favorite of Thomas W. Morris, the festival's artistic director. (The New Jersey Symphony obviously did its homework before applying.) Christoph von Dohnanyi conducted the Cleveland Orchestra in this unwieldy beast (five movements, complete with male chorus in the finale) with Garrick Ohlsson as the commanding pianist in 1989, when Mr. Morris was the orchestra's executive director (and I was its program annotator and editor), and they also recorded it for Telarc. Jacques Lacombe conducts the piece here with Varese's ''Nocturnal'' and Weill's ''Berliner'' Symphony. The concerto makes huge demands on the pianist's technical skills and stamina, and Mr. Lacombe's partner in this performance, his fellow Canadian Marc-Andre Hamelin, is one of the few who could hope to rival Mr. Ohlsson in those regards. (Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra will also perform the work at Carnegie on Dec. 11, with Piers Lane as soloist.) May 9. Carnegie Hall.
'ORPHEUS' The New York City Opera has played no small part in the Handel opera revival of recent decades. Now, in a season in which the newly nomadic company looks to extend its traditions with any number of twists, it turns its Baroque attentions to Telemann, a composer steeped in a German style less influenced by the Italian than Handel's. Those unfamiliar with the work -- almost everyone, surely -- would do well to bone up with Rene Jacobs's recording of it on Harmonia Mundi. The baritone Daniel Teadt sings the title role in an auditorium said by some who know it to be acoustically and atmospherically ideal for Baroque opera. Opens May 12. Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, (212) 870-5600, nycopera.com.
CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF When a performer sells you on a work that used to seem intractable, you remember. For me, hearing Mr. Tetzlaff play Schoenberg's Violin Concerto with Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra in 1988 was such an experience. Here Mr. Tetzlaff plays the Schoenberg with the Met Orchestra, still scheduled to be conducted by James Levine, and for most violinists, that would be more than enough exertion for a day. But Mr. Tetzlaff also throws in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and Mozart's Adagio in E (K. 261). Truly, what does he do for an encore? May 20. Carnegie Hall.
BAMBERG SYMPHONY Jonathan Nott is an enterprising conductor, though his two programs here look a little more adventurous than they are. The Webern that leads up to Schubert's Fourth Symphony and Brahms's Second Piano Concerto is the Five Pieces (Op. 10): like all Webern, short. And the Ives that separates Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto from Schubert's ''Unfinished'' Symphony is ''The Unanswered Question'': also short. But with Christian Zacharias as the piano soloist and Mr. Nott a devoted Schubertian, each program should hold rewards aplenty on its own terms. May 20-21. Avery Fisher Hall.
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA Franz Welser-Most, who may have won new fans in New York with his performances of Bruckner and John Adams at the Lincoln Center Festival this summer, would like you to know that -- now the general music director of the Vienna State Opera -- he can also be a formidable opera conductor. The second program here is a blockbuster: a concert performance of Strauss's ''Salome,'' with the fast-rising dramatic soprano Nina Stemme in the title role, Eric Owens as Jochanaan and an orchestra starrier than either. The first program is as multifaceted as the second is single-minded, offering Brahms's Second Piano Concerto, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist; Shostakovich's Sixth Symphony; and the New York premiere of Kaija Saariaho's ''Laterna Magica.'' May 23-24. Carnegie Hall.
MAHLER'S NINTH SYMPHONY For the New York Philharmonic's free Memorial Day concert at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, the atmospheric but echoey cathedral acoustics are a perennial problem. When Alan Gilbert conducts Mahler's valedictory symphony, the overall scale should be right, but subtleties are sure to be lost. And how will you be able to tell exactly when the thing has ended, as the pianissimo string tones (actually ppp and pppp) fade to silence? May 28. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org.
'THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE OTHER MARY' Here, in its premiere, is another in a line of evening-length oratorios that John Adams began with ''El Nino,'' based on the nativity of Jesus, in 2000. This one takes off from Jesus' Passion and incorporates the story of Lazarus. Peter Sellars produced the libretto, using writings of the Mexican poet Rosario Castellanos, Dorothy Day, Louise Erdich and June Jordan. Gustavo Dudamel conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Master Chorale and soloists including three countertenors, who carry the narration. May 31; June 1-3. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, (323) 850-2000, laphil.com.
JUNE
'SINFONIA ESPANSIVA' Alan Gilbert continues to work his way through the symphonies of Carl Nielsen with the New York Philharmonic, here adding the Third. Mr. Gilbert and the orchestra are recording the symphonies and concertos for the Danish label Dacapo. The Third will be released with the Second, performed last January, in the first release, next fall, and the project is to run to 2015. ''I'm sure Nielsen's time has now come,'' Mr. Gilbert has said, and high time, though whatever neglect Nielsen's music may have suffered over the decades has not been for lack of excellent recordings. Here's hoping that Mr. Gilbert has whatever touch or timing is needed to make the difference. June 14-16. Avery Fisher Hall.
PHILHARMONIC AT THE ARMORY Kurt Masur, as music director of the New York Philharmonic in the 1990s, had his eye for a time on the Park Avenue Armory as a site for a series of summer concerts akin to the BBC Proms concerts in the vast Royal Albert Hall in London. Well, there's no series yet, but here is a program that takes his idea and walks with it. Alan Gilbert conducts, joined by two other maestros, Magnus Lindberg and Matthias Pintscher, as needed, since the main attraction is Karlheinz Stockhausen's ''Gruppen'' (''Groups''), which divides the ensemble into three separate orchestras playing simultaneously and at odds with one another. The program also includes works by Ives, Pierre Boulez and Mozart. Mozart? The Act I finale from ''Don Giovanni'' was chosen, presumably, because Mozart uses three little bands playing competing dance tunes at the same time. Now can we expand on this delightful escapade? And invite Mr. Masur back to conduct in the next outing? June 29-30. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 875-5656, nyphil.org.

HEADLINE: Congressman's Remarks Stir the Blogosphere

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Mike Quigley knows about cheap shots on ice. Now he's an expert on being blindsided on the Internet and cable TV.
Mr. Quigley, a Democratic Chicago congressman, had a relatively light Saturday recently. He played ice hockey in the morning, did a beach cleanup with the Sierra Club and hit four block parties in the 32nd, 43rd and 44th Wards. Along the way he surfaced at a conference held by the American Islamic College. It was a quick in-and-out, with remarks to perhaps 100 attendees about the strengths of American pluralism, the sort he makes to many groups. They included:
''Forms of discrimination come in many forms, many shapes and many guises. You have my pledge to work with you to fight them, and I think that it is appropriate for me to apologize on behalf of this country for the discrimination you face.'' 
He then bicycled to the first block party. The Islamic College audience was apparently grateful but didn't find his appearance especially notable as they returned to the business of their meeting.
Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, found the address nice and patriotic. ''What we'd expect of a congressman,'' he said.
Neither he, Mr. Quigley nor anybody else there was prepared for the response initiated in the conservative blogosphere, then intensified on radio and TV.
The congressman was attacked harshly, with at least one death threat on a Fox News site that by week's end was still not taken down despite requests.
Andrew Breitbart, a conservative activist, blogged that Mr. Quigley made a ''surprise appearance'' before ''the primarily Muslim audience. He rambled on about the typical racism and discrimination that the liberal left is so convinced America is rampantly infected with.''
The appearance was not a surprise, even if not on the formal program. But the nefarious implication was repeated on blogs and the Fox News Channel. Video links included the lines above but not related comments about the legacies of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others.
Social media posts and hundreds of nasty calls, e-mails and faxes poured in to his offices, which deleted profane and violent posts and passed direct threats to law enforcement.
But the conservative echo chamber was in high dudgeon. Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News host, decided that Mr. Quigley's remarks were a story and thus conferred high-profile legitimacy to the bloggers' vituperation on Tuesday. Mr. Quigley could not appear, but Mr. Rehab did, initially nonplused that the remarks were deemed newsworthy.
With ''Questionable Apology'' emblazoned on the screen, Mr. O'Reilly repeated the same two sentences Mr. Quigley had uttered and declared: ''Wow! What discrimination?'' Statistics don't support claims of bias against Muslim Americans, he said.
Much data and polling contradicts him. As an unabashed Mr. Rehab told him, ''You'd have to be living under a rock'' to miss the overarching reality.
Mr. Rehab cited federal figures on rising workplace complaints of anti-Muslim discrimination and polls showing both that 39 percent of Americans would require Muslims to carry special identification and that one-third don't think Muslims should be allowed to run for president.
''O.K., those stats bolster your argument,'' Mr. O'Reilly conceded. ''But in economic realms, Muslim Americans are doing well, pretty well,'' he said. ''We don't want anybody to be anti-Muslim. Thank you for coming on here,'' Mr. O'Reilly concluded brusquely, with Mr. Rehab having clearly failed to fulfill a role of self-righteous liberal pinata.
But Fox wasn't done.
On Wednesday, its morning ''Fox and Friends'' show saw Mr. Quigley, 52, called a ''silly old fool'' by Ralph Peters, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and advocate of aggressive military actions. He belittled Muslims with a series of mock apologies like ''We should apologize for preventing them from beating their daughters to death for flirting.''
Eboo Patel, an Indian-born Muslim and former Rhodes Scholar who runs the Chicago-based Interfaith Youth Corps, found the response offensive. But he noted a Gallup poll finding that American Muslims remain very optimistic despite facing discrimination.
He mentioned that his nephew in Houston was hassled when, for religious reasons, he wouldn't eat school pizza with pork.
Well, at least we occasionally try to curb school bullies. We clearly don't when it comes to the bullies who can drive our public dialogue.

HEADLINE: Farmers on Alert As Pig Thieves Strike Under Cover of Night

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
LAFAYETTE, Minn. -- Here in pig country, the pigs are vanishing.
This month, 150 pigs -- each one weighing more than an average grown man -- disappeared from a farm building in Lafayette despite deadbolts on its doors. Farther north near Lake Lillian, 594 snorting, squealing hogs disappeared last month, whisked away in the dark.
And in Iowa, with added cover from the vast stretches of tall cornfields, pigs have been snatched, 20 or 30 at a time, from as many as eight facilities in the last few weeks, said the sheriff of Mitchell County, adding that among other challenges, the missing are difficult to single out. 
''They all look alike,'' said Curt Younker, the sheriff, who said he had only rarely heard of pig thefts in his decades on the job. ''Suddenly we're plagued with them.''
Some livestock economists pointed to the thefts in this hog-rich region as one more sign of the grim economy, a reflection of record-high prices for hogs this year and the ease of stealing pigs from the large barns that are often far from the farmer's house.
''This is the hot commodity of the moment, like copper a few years ago and gold,'' said Ryan Bode, whose family company, Rebco Pork, discovered that 150 of its pigs were missing on Sept. 16, shortly before they were to be taken to market.
The loss was $30,000, he said, on top of the ''ungodly high'' price of corn that he had paid to feed those pigs for six months until they were fat enough to be sold. ''And after all that, they're not here,'' he said.
The Nicollet County sheriff's investigator was swapping details with law enforcement authorities in other places where pigs have been taken and calling for tips of any sort, but Mr. Bode seemed doubtful about seeing his pigs again.
''My guess is that they're bacon and pork chops already,'' he said.
For the moment, as worried hog producers around the region pledged to strengthen their security systems and considered offering rewards to solve the string of cases, investigators in Iowa and Minnesota, which are among the nation's top hog producers, were left with a tangle of complicated questions.
Was this all the work of a single roving band of pig thieves, or were they isolated incidents with separate culprits, all driven by the high price of pigs (which are going for about $200 apiece right now, and were even higher last month)?
And who would have enough experience with 270-pound pigs (a group that would not, for instance, simply march out of their barns with a whistle and a ''come here, boy'') and sufficient equipment (at least a large livestock trailer) to pull off such heists?
And where exactly would they have taken the pigs?
''Hundreds of pigs don't just disappear,'' said Marc Chadderdon, a sheriff's investigator who has worked in Nicollet County, home to about 33,000 people, since 1994 and said he had never before received a similar crime report.
''It's not exactly like stealing a pot of gold,'' he added. ''You have to do something with them.''
Investigators suspect that the pigs may have been taken to meat-processing plants or affiliated ''drop-off'' facilities or that they were sold at auction barns, which are less common these days as more large pig producers have direct arrangements with food-packing companies.
But that has raised an uncomfortable suggestion in an industry where many of the biggest farmers and pork buyers know one another personally and where a stranger pulling up to sell 100 hogs should give pause.
''Someone in the business somewhere has the answer as to who's doing this,'' Mr. Chadderdon said.
Changes in the way pigs are raised have probably made stealing them easier.
The large, low-slung buildings that often house thousands of pigs, known as ''finishing barns,'' are often off gravel roads, far from most houses and busy towns, in part to avoid complaints about the smells of pig waste and other environmental concerns.
In some, workers tend to a facility only a few times a day, but mostly leave it operating on its own, with automated feeding and water systems.
As word of the thefts has spread, some farmers in both states said they were keeping closer count of their animals, considering adding more security systems or even tattooing their pigs as a way of identifying them, a practice already used by some farmers (though not in the cases of the missing pigs).
In truth, no one here is precisely sure on what evening (or evenings) the 150 pigs were taken from this facility in Lafayette.
It was not until the pigs here were heavy enough to be sold that Mr. Bode's family company -- which raises 60,000 pigs a year at eight such buildings -- noticed that they were missing. The doors were always locked, but, strangely, there had been no sign of a break-in.
Finally, after searching the building from top to bottom, workers spotted a razor-straight opening -- just enough for a person to slip through -- sliced all the way down heavy bird netting on a side of the building that automatically opens slightly to let air in on hot nights.
''They definitely did their homework,'' Mr. Bode said the other day, running his fingers over the gap in the netting. ''And they definitely knew what they were doing.''
Mr. Bode, 37, whose family has farmed around here for generations, recalled stories of a missing pig, perhaps even two, years ago.
''In the past, that would have been just for himself, maybe, a way to fill the freezer,'' Mr. Bode said. ''But now, it's different. This isn't about putting food on the table.''
Online Correction: September 24, 2011, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted Ryan Bode of Rebco Pork. Commenting on 150 missing pigs, he said, ''My guess is that they're bacon and pork chops already,'' not ''baking in pork chops.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: A rash of pig thefts in Iowa and Minnesota has puzzled farmers and law enforcement officials. Ryan Bode, below, whose family has raised pigs for decades, showed where thieves gained access to a barn in Lafayette, Minn., by cutting through some netting.
 Marc Chadderdon, an investigator in Nicollet County, Minn., said he could not recall thefts of such scale. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ALLEN BRISSON-SMITH FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Mild-Mannered Redesign Lands in a Tough Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

 BODY:
NOW is not the time for Honda to rest the updated 2012 Civic on its ancestors' laurels. The compact car market is stacked.
Hyundai redesigned the Elantra for 2011, and it's better in every way except where it was already ahead -- it is still keenly priced and covered by a 10-year powertrain warranty.
The new Kia Forte can't be taken for granted, the Mazda 3 is slick, Subaru has a nice niche with its all-wheel-drive Impreza and Volkswagen has re-engineered the Jetta for American mass consumption. Then there is Ford's all-new Focus, a huge leap forward, and even Chevrolet, burdened with a 50-year legacy of wretched small cars, is booking big sales with its pretty good Cruze.
It's a tough crowd, and half-efforts and skin-deep revisions aren't likely to be enough to rise to the top. 
But that's exactly what Honda has delivered with the somewhat-new ninth-generation Civic. The car is, for the most part, a mild revamping of the eighth-generation coupes and sedans that went on sale for the 2006 model year. Most of the mechanical elements carry over in a new shell that's even less visually interesting than before.
Maybe this isn't a surprise. Most of Honda's recent new products haven't been inspired designs, and in August, Consumer Reports pointedly left the 2012 Civic LX off its list of recommended cars.
The Civic is still a good car -- it's a Honda, after all -- but it is not the gold standard that the Civic had long been. And it's no longer the car to which every other member of its class must be compared.
I tested three 2012 Civics: the mainstream $19,425 LX and the up-market $24,225 EX-L sedans (the L is for leather), both equipped with automatic transmissions, along with the performance-oriented $24,655 Si coupe that comes only with a manual gearbox. I skipped the DX stripper model and the version fueled by natural gas. The expansive Civic line also includes the higher-mileage HF and Hybrid sedans.
Because of the tsunami that struck Japan in March, availability of some parts for the 2012 Civics has been restricted. According to Jon Fitzsimmons, a Honda spokesman, though most Civics sold here are assembled in Indiana and Ontario, production has not yet fully recovered.
In silhouette, the new Civic sedan doesn't look much different from the outgoing model, though the wheelbase has shrunk 1.2 inches, to 105.1 inches. Honda says the percentage of high-strength steel in the structure has increased to 55 percent, from 50 percent, resulting in a 7 percent drop in body weight and a 10 percent increase in ''static and dynamic'' rigidity.
What's disappointing is the anonymous, blunter nose and a tail that appears to have been ripped off the hind end of a 2001 Toyota Camry and then shrunk in the wash. The 2006 Civic still looks newer than the 2012 redesign.
The basic interior design also updates what the 2006 model established. As before, the dashboard is divided into two tiers with a tachometer ahead of the steering wheel and a digital speedometer one level higher.
The new elements include an information screen to the right of the speedometer, and Eco Assist bar graphics alongside the speedometer that light, on the LX and EX, in gradient shades of color to represent how environmentally conscious your driving style is. It's easy to glow indulgent blue or righteous green; the challenge is to maintain an even shade of turquoise. On the hotter Civic Si, the Eco Assist bars shine red and stay red.
The Civic's seats, no matter the trim level, are well shaped, nicely padded and perfectly upholstered -- paragons of seating virtue. And the leather on the EX-L is tufted on the seats, as in an old Buick Park Avenue.
The steering wheel is the perfect diameter, and there are audio, information-display and cruise-control switches fitted neatly into its spokes. The ergonomics are just about perfect, with intuitive ventilation controls, big cup holders and plenty of receptacles for flotsam.
Beyond all that, the cabin isn't just roomy -- Honda claims a 1.6-inch increase in rear legroom -- it feels roomy, too.
There are, however, too many hard plastic panels on the dashboard and doors. Certain switches, most prominently the single knob that's charged with doing too much to control the standard audio system, feel cheap to the touch and don't operate with, well, Honda-like precision. The Civic has taken a step back in tactile satisfaction.
In previous-generation Civics a small LED was embedded in the overhead console to light the shifter. That's just gone. Honda took some weight out of the interior materials, and it shows in both the quality and the features.
The LX and EX-L are both powered by a carryover 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine with a single overhead cam and 16 valves. Enhanced by Honda's signature i-VTEC variable valve timing system, the 140-horsepower engine is easygoing, though it lacks leading-edge direct-injection technology and its output is modest for the class.
More disappointing, the engine comes hooked only to 5-speed transmissions -- manual or automatic in the LX, automatic only in the EX. In contrast, the Hyundai Elantra's 1.8-liter 4 pumps out 148 horsepower and its manual and automatic transmissions each have 6 forward gears.
According to testing by Car and Driver magazine, the Civic EX sedan will run from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 9 seconds flat. The 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited performs that feat in 8.6 seconds. Beyond that, while the Environmental Protection Agency rates the Civic at a solid 28 miles per gallon in city driving and 39 m.p.g. on the highway, the Elantra does a bit better, at 29/40 m.p.g.
Both the engine and the 5-speed automatic operate almost inaudibly in the EX-L. In the LX, though, which has less sound-deadening material, mechanical noise intrudes. It's not an altogether unpleasant sound, but it's noticeable.
Press a big green button on the EX or LX and the car goes into Econ mode: the action of the electronic throttle is slowed, the automatic transmission's software is altered to keep revs down and the climate control system restrains itself from power-sucking extremes. For most drivers most of the time, puttering around in Econ makes little noticeable difference -- until you try to accelerate to freeway speeds.
What is annoying in the LX is tire noise. Compared with the LX, the EX models get additional blankets of sound insulation on the rear wheel wells and use thicker material in the doors, in addition to the extra shushing on the firewall. So while the drone of the EX's P205/55R16 all-season radials is subdued on most road surfaces, the LX's P195/65R15 all-season radials roar like a Kraft Foods factory grinding out Maxwell House. That's not good in a car that costs nearly $20,000.
According to Honda, the LX and EX suspension systems are tuned identically save for the different wheels and tires. But the LX's ride motions seem more sudden, jarring and stiffer.
Honda says there is only about a one-pound difference between the weight of each of the LX's 15-inch steel wheel and tire combinations and the EX's 16-inch alloy wheel and tire assemblies. And while the LX and EX tires differ in size, in general construction and specification they're close. Probably it's the LX's additional noise that makes it seem to ride rougher -- it's messing with my brain.
The difference in tires doesn't make much difference in how the two Civic sedans handle. The electric power steering in both is among the best in the class, the all-independent suspension is tenacious, the antilock brakes work well and the stability and traction control systems are unobtrusive.
If only the transmission had a nice overdrive sixth gear for cruising and five more closely spaced cogs beneath it for squirting through urban traffic. You know, like the Hyundai Elantra's.
Atop the sound deadening, the EX gets things like a fold-down armrest in the middle of the back seat, heated side mirrors, two more speakers, some additional power outlets and a power moonroof, so it's worth the additional $1,850 over the LX (before adding leather).
But as a value proposition, both the Civic LX and the EX pale in comparison with the more powerful, more frugal, better warranted, and similarly priced Elantra GLS and Limited. Particularly now that, according to Auto Lease Guide, the Hondas and Hyundais are likely to retain their values similarly.
--
The 2012 Civic Si is a different beast altogether, whether as a coupe or a sedan. In looks, the two-door body is more changed than the four-door: more streamlined, more heavily sculptured and likely to be more polarizing among potential buyers.
But the Si's big change is the engine: the 197-horsepower 2-liter 4 used in 2006-11 Si models has been swapped for a 201-horse version of Honda's 2.4-liter 4 similar to the one in the Acura TSX.
The extra displacement of the new engine brings with it a big gain in low-end and midrange torque -- the old Si made its 139 pound-feet of peak torque at 6,100 r.p.m., while the new Si's peak of 170 pound-feet comes at 4,400 r.p.m. But that extra torque carries a price.
One of the great joys of the previous Si is that it could be revved to 8,000 every time the driver wanted to merge into traffic without attracting every cop within 30 miles. And it made a wonderful, wailing induction noise as the i-VTEC system transitioned to more aggressive high-r.p.m. cam profiles, making a sound like a Formula One engine hitting its stride. The new Si's engine revs only to 7,000 r.p.m. and it doesn't sound special at all.
Of course Honda can point to cries from reviewers and previous Si owners for more torque, but what they really wanted was both more torque and the high-revving thrills of the 2-liter engine. There's now a ''sequential rev limit indicator'' that tells the driver when the engine is approaching its redline. That's a poor substitute for the old Si's glorious growl.
Fortunately the new Si still gets Honda's great short-throw 6-speed transmission, fantastic front bucket seats, and a suspension that gets instant responses from the 215/45R17 Michelin all-season performance tires. And yes, it's an easier car to live with in traffic and it gets slightly better fuel economy than the outgoing Si (31 vs. 29 m.p.g. on the highway).
And, according to Car and Driver, it's quicker, running from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.3 seconds compared with the old car's 6.7 seconds. I just want all that alongside the eager, bratty personality of the old Si.
And, incidentally, Hyundai offers no version of the Elantra comparable to the Civic Si. But there are much quicker turbocharged alternatives available in the Mazdaspeed 3 and Subaru WRX.
My family has owned four Civics over the last 20 years. Every month I pay $347.66 on my daily driver, a Civic Si sedan I bought new back in 2008. With this new, indifferent Civic, alongside the hulking second-generation Pilot sport utility; the Insight, a cut-rate Prius clone; and virtually all of the current Acura models, Honda seems intent on eradicating its own distinctiveness.
Where is the Honda that built the sophisticated Prelude sporty coupe, the intuitive S2000 roadster, the overachieving Integra Type R and the world-beating NSX supercar? The Honda where keeping things simple also meant better quality, thoughtful detailing, exquisite engineering and delightful mechanical operation?
I want that Honda back.

HEADLINE: New Condos: 'Survivor' Edition

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
DURING the real estate boom, it seemed that every day brought news of a new condominium project in New York. Big or small, classic or modern, luxurious or merely comfortable -- there would be something to satisfy both buyers' needs and buyers' wallets.
But as the fall season begins, this year's crop of condos is sparse. The new and newly converted buildings that are starting sales have had to hurdle the global economic collapse and the credit crisis. Many projects have not survived, and the number of units introduced this year will be a fraction of the total of the boom years.
According to data compiled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, 1,111 new units have opened or are projected to open this year in Manhattan south of Harlem, down from 1,767 a year ago and 8,552 in 2007.
For developers whose buildings are about to hit the market, the scarcity of new condos is good news, signaling a lack of competition and, perhaps, higher prices and an end to concessions. For people hoping to buy new apartments, the market is worrisome for the exact same reasons. 
''It's not just about rising prices,'' said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine, which markets new and converted condominiums. ''It's also about not having the same kind of choices. Those buyers who are looking for something very unique are going to have a very difficult time finding it.''
Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, agreed that inventory is lower. But in Manhattan, especially downtown, he said, there is ample ''shadow inventory'' -- new apartments that are being rented out or held off the market.
In Brooklyn, Mr. Miller said, lower prices have made development financing easier to get, which has led to a steady rise in market share for new condos. In the second quarter of 2010, he said, 14 percent of closed sales in the borough were on newly developed units. By the second quarter of this year, he said, that number had risen to 24.6 percent.
Most of the buildings entering the market this fall are on the small side. Of the 20 that have opened or are projected to open this year in Corcoran Sunshine's Manhattan coverage area, only 3 have more than 100 units. Brokers marketing the small buildings say they have much to offer in the uncrowded market, including views, historic details and all-around plushness.
But several high-rise, high-profile buildings will soon angle for buyers, including one project that promises to change the city's skyline: One57, a 90-story mixed-use tower at 157 West 57th Street.
The building, which Extell, the developer, says will be the tallest residential property in Manhattan, 40 rental units starting on the 32nd floor and 95 condominium units starting on the 39th floor, ranging from two- to five-bedrooms, from the 32nd floor up.
Detailed pricing information has not been released, but Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said units would cost $3,000 to $7,000 per square foot -- or $3 million and up -- when sales start in November. One57's Web site, which invites potential buyers to ''register your interest,'' gives a price range beginning at $5 million and topping out at $30 million-plus.
Mr. Barnett said in an interview that, with construction financing for large projects still difficult to obtain, he believes his building is years ahead of anything comparable entering the market.
''Really nothing is even close to sales, let alone for delivery,'' he said. ''So to some extent, we have the market to ourselves for the next two to three years. The only caveat is, we can't have the world melt down. If the world melts down, all bets are off.''
He added that he did not believe that would happen.
Shaun Osher, the chief executive at the brokerage and marketing firm CORE, said several factors had hindered large projects, including the disappearance of large lenders like Lehman Brothers, the reluctance of landholders to sell buildable lots in a weakened market, and a distaste among developers for risk. Large and well-capitalized developers, though, have had more leeway. Extell is one, and Related Properties, which will soon start selling condo units at its new building at 460 West 42nd Street, is another.
That project, known as 1 MiMa Tower and designed by Arquitectonica, has 151 condo units along with a 50-story rental component that opened in the spring. They range from studios to three-bedroom units. Joanna Rose, a Related spokeswoman, said prices had not been set.
Toll Brothers, one of the country's largest residential developers, has two condo buildings opening in the coming months: the Touraine, a 22-unit structure at 132 East 65th Street with prices from $1 million to $15 million, and 205 Water Street, in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn.
The latter, in a cobblestoned part of the neighborhood dominated by converted factories and warehouses, has 65 units. Prices will be around $850 per square foot, according to David Von Spreckelsen, the president of the Toll Brothers City Living division.
The building, designed by GreenbergFarrow, is seeking LEED Gold certification for environmental sustainability, and has apartments ranging from 550-square-foot studios to a 2,300-square-foot penthouse, Mr. Von Spreckelsen said. The list of potential buyers, he added, is more than 1,100 names long.
Brooklyn -- both emerging and established neighborhoods -- is the site of much of the season's new condo development. The reasons, said Mr. Osher of CORE, are economic.
''I think it's been easier in this market to put deals together that are smaller in size because of financing,'' he said. And Brooklyn, he added, has a lot of sites that can be developed for the available money.
One of the borough's most eye-catching buildings is on a lot where ground was broken years ago. A 14-story, 186-foot tower at 144 North Eighth Street, jutting over an otherwise low-rise section of Williamsburg, it has been under construction since 2005. Because construction started just before a neighborhood zoning change, the building's status as the tallest object for blocks may well remain unchallenged.
Residents' opposition, ownership disputes and the bad economy stalled the project until GFI Development bought it in 2008. The company, and the project's architect, Robert M. Scarano Jr., reduced the planned height by two stories and finished construction. The result is a 41-unit building with on-site parking and a sprawling green roof on the second floor, with areas for flowers and a vegetable garden.
There are views of the Empire State Building, nearby Bedford Avenue and most everything else in between. Sales started this month; units available so far range from a one-bedroom one-bath condo on the fourth floor, for $575,000, to a three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath unit on the 10th floor for $1.925 million.
Several neighborhoods away, in eastern Brooklyn Heights at 75 Clinton Street, is a rare new condo development for the area. The W Development Company is converting a prewar commercial building there into 74 condominiums.
The building, with a 5,000-square-foot roof deck and the amenities usual to a new building, among them a gym, officially started sales this month. Apartments range in size from studios to three-bedrooms, and in price from $479,000 to $2.05 million.
In Clinton Hill, NLH Developers is opening Lineage II, designed to evoke vintage brownstones and town houses, at 136-146 Clifton Place. The 48-unit first phase, which went on sale a year ago, is almost sold out, said Jackie Buddie, a spokeswoman for the Corcoran Group, which is marketing the project. The second phase, designed by Karl Fischer, has 32 units meant to look, from the outside, like four connected houses. Units there range from 777 to 1,392 square feet, and are priced from $389,000 to $599,000.
Large projects like MiMA and One57 aside, Manhattan condo-hunters will have mostly small and midsize buildings to consider, though smaller does not necessarily mean cheaper. There is 55 Warren Street, in TriBeCa, a converted five-story building with an Italianate limestone facade and just four floor-through apartments. Amenities include a stone-walled wine cellar. Only one condo is listed so far -- a 3,627-square-foot four-bedroom, for $6.75 million -- but the others are expected to cost as much as $16.5 million.
In Greenwich Village, the season's major new development is 130 West 12th Street, a converted prewar building that was once part of the St. Vincent's Hospital campus, housing both offices and residences. Rudin Management, the developer, bought the building in 2007 and, after St. Vincent's moved out the following year, gutted it, reducing the number of units to 43 from 100.
The building, where sales are expected to start sometime this fall, will have a rooftop terrace and garden, and units ranging from one-bedrooms of 869 square feet to four-bedrooms of 2,837 square feet. There will also be three duplex penthouses, starting at 3,202 square feet. Prices start around $1.395 million.
William C. Rudin, the company's chief executive, said prices would reflect the market.
''There's very strong demand for quality, elegantly designed, well-located projects,'' he said.
Stephen G. Kliegerman, the president of Halstead Property Development Marketing, says the scarcity of new condos in the city has several consequences. One is that rents are edging up as fewer people are choosing to buy. Another is that developers and lenders, seeing the opportunity to fill a void, are beginning to make deals on large new developments. Several around the city are planned for 90 to 150 units -- though those projects will not be completed for years.
For now, he said, ''I think you'll continue to see inventories reduce, and as that happens you'll see prices slightly increase.''
A good indication of the market's health, Mr. Kliegerman said, will be sales at projects in less established neighborhoods, including those that started over the summer, or earlier.
New condos in prime neighborhoods, like 15 Union Square West or the Laureate, at 2150 Broadway on the Upper West Side, have already done well, he said, whereas buildings like his own company's 109 Gold Street, in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn, or 58 Metropolitan Avenue, in Williamsburg, could be bellwethers for buildings off the beaten path. Either way, Mr. Kliegerman said, buyers going condo-hunting should not expect bargains.
''Developers are starting to say no to negotiations,'' he said, adding that at his company's recently opened Kirkman Lofts, in Dumbo, Halstead had not been listening to lower offers.
''Whether it's the buyer, their friend, or the buyer's attorney,'' Mr. Kliegerman said, ''they're all surprised that the developers are able to say no. But what they're realizing is, the developers can say no, because there's such a lack of product out there.''

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
IT was unusual in the post-housing-crash world that Michael L. Breaux fell for an apartment at PS90, a once-decrepit public school in central Harlem converted to a mixed-income condominium in 2009, before seeing a finished unit.
Buyers who a few years ago might have snapped up apartments in new developments after merely viewing floor plans have been reluctant to do so, and new projects, including many in Harlem, have suffered mightily along with the economy. 
Mr. Breaux, a bassoonist and former high school band director, and his partner, Reggie Grayson, had seen only online renderings of the 75 units at the condo and its restored collegiate Gothic-style architecture before arriving on a snowy February morning last year in search of someone to show them an apartment.
On that wintry day, the two couldn't find a broker in the building -- an advertised open house might have been canceled because of the weather, they thought -- but they made their way past scaffolding and into an apartment. Workers were restoring the limestone, terra cotta and brick facade of the six-story building, dating to 1906 and designed by Charles B. J. Snyder. In the apartment they found the concrete floors unfinished. The 12-foot-high ceilings immediately made an impression, but there were no lights or appliances.
They were convinced, though, that this was the home they wanted to buy, in part because Mr. Breaux, 53, whose mother was a school librarian and whose father was an industrial-arts teacher, loved the way the building evoked family history and his occupation: he is pursuing a doctorate in music education. Seeing the herringbone oak floors in the renderings, he remembered that his grammar school in Lafayette, La., had oiled wood floors, and now he meticulously polishes his wood floors at PS90 with tung oil.
''It felt very meaningful to be in a school,'' he said.
Since they moved into their finished one-bedroom last October, sales have picked up at PS90, at 220 West 148th Street between Frederick Douglass and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, and at other new developments in the area. The project was developed by L+M Development Partners and is being marketed by Sidney S. Whelan, an agent at Halstead Property.
All but 9 of the 74 condos at PS90 have sold (one is for the super), and a number of musicians, artists and photographers have moved in, according to brokers. Also, the National Dance Institute is soon opening a new headquarters in the building. All this is making for what Mr. Breaux described as a tightly knit creative community.
He declined to say how much he had paid. Twenty units were classified as moderate-income, with much lower asking prices than the market-rate units, which have been listed for a range of $450,000 to $899,000. They include studios, one- and two-bedrooms, and a single three-bedroom, for $849,000.
Most of the units sold so far have gone for slightly below asking price.
The sales at PS90 and nearby developments are good news for the central Harlem housing market. Since March, this submarket -- Harlem and Hamilton Heights -- has been performing below the overall Manhattan market, according to Noah Rosenblatt, the founder of the real estate data site Urban Digs. His numbers showed the pace of sales in that market was down 28.6 percent, compared with a decline of 16.7 percent in Manhattan overall.
But, in a more positive sign, housing inventory also fell. The supply was down 26.4 percent, versus 7.2 percent in the overall Manhattan market, so buyers faced less choice and the potential for higher prices.

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to the American Left?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KAZIN

 BODY:
Michael Kazin is a professor of history at Georgetown, a co-editor of Dissent and the author of ''American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation.''
SOMETIMES, attention should be paid to the absence of news. America's economic miseries continue, with unemployment still high and home sales stagnant or dropping. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and their fellow citizens is wider than it has been since the 1920s.
And yet, except for the demonstrations and energetic recall campaigns that roiled Wisconsin this year, unionists and other stern critics of corporate power and government cutbacks have failed to organize a serious movement against the people and policies that bungled the United States into recession. 
Instead, the Tea Party rebellion -- led by veteran conservative activists and bankrolled by billionaires -- has compelled politicians from both parties to slash federal spending and defeat proposals to tax the rich and hold financiers accountable for their misdeeds. Partly as a consequence, Barack Obama's tenure is starting to look less like the second coming of F.D.R. and more like a re-run of Jimmy Carter -- although last week the president did sound a bit Rooseveltian when he proposed that millionaires should ''pay their fair share in taxes, or we're going to have to ask seniors to pay more for Medicare.''
How do we account for the relative silence of the left? Perhaps what really matters about a movement's strength is the years of building that came before it. In the 1930s, the growth of unions and the popularity of demands to share the wealth and establish ''industrial democracy'' were not simply responses to the economic debacle. In fact, unions bloomed only in the middle of the decade, when a modest recovery was under way. The liberal triumph of the 1930s was in fact rooted in decades of eloquent oratory and patient organizing by a variety of reformers and radicals against the evils of ''monopoly'' and ''big money.''
Similarly, the current populist right originated among the articulate spokespeople and well-funded institutions that emerged in the 1970s, long before the current crisis began. The two movements would have disagreed about nearly everything, but each had aggressive proponents who, backed up by powerful social forces, established their views as the conventional wisdom of an era.
THE seeds of the 1930s left were planted back in the Gilded Age by figures like the journalist Henry George. In 1886, George, the author of a best-selling book that condemned land speculation, ran for mayor of New York City as the nominee of the new Union Labor Party. He attracted a huge following with speeches indicting the officeholders of the Tammany Hall machine for engorging themselves on bribes and special privileges while ''we have hordes of citizens living in want and in vice born of want, existing under conditions that would appall a heathen.''
George also brought his audiences a message of hope: ''We are building a movement for the abolition of industrial slavery, and what we do on this side of the water will send its impulse across the land and over the sea, and give courage to all men to think and act.'' Running against candidates from both major parties and the opposition of nearly every local employer and church, George would probably have been elected, if the 28-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican who finished third, had not split the anti-Tammany vote.
Despite George's defeat, the pro-labor, anti-corporate movement that coalesced around him and others kept growing. As the turn of the century neared, wage earners mounted huge strikes for union recognition on the nation's railroads and inside its coal mines and textile mills. In the 1890s, a mostly rural insurgency spawned the People's Party, also known as the Populists, which quickly won control of several states and elected 22 congressmen. The party soon expired, but not before the Democrats, under William Jennings Bryan, had adopted important parts of its platform -- the progressive income tax, a flexible currency and support for labor organizing.
During the early 20th century, a broader progressive coalition, including immigrant workers, middle-class urban reformers, muckraking journalists and Social Gospelers established a new common sense about the need for a government that would rein in corporate power and establish a limited welfare state. The unbridled free market and the ethic of individualism, they argued, had left too many Americans at the mercy of what Theodore Roosevelt called ''malefactors of great wealth.'' As Jane Addams put it, ''the good we secure for ourselves is precarious and uncertain, is floating in mid-air, until it is secured for all of us and incorporated into our common life.''
Amid the boom years of the 1920s, conservatives rebutted this wisdom and won control of the federal government. ''The chief business of the American people is business,'' intoned President Calvin Coolidge. But their triumph was brief, both ideologically and electorally. When Franklin D. Roosevelt swept into the White House in 1932, most Americans were already primed to accept the economic and moral argument progressives had been making since the heyday of Henry George.
Will Rogers, the popular humorist and a loyal Democrat, put it in comfortably agrarian terms, ''All the feed is going into one manger and the stock on the other side of the stall ain't getting a thing. We got it, but we don't know how to split it up.'' The unionists of the Congress of Industrial Organizations echoed his argument, as did soak-the-rich demagogues like Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin. The architects of Social Security, the minimum wage and other landmark New Deal policies did so as well.
After years of preparation, welfare-state liberalism had finally become a mainstream faith. In 1939, John L. Lewis, the pugnacious labor leader, declared, ''The millions of organized workers banded together in the C.I.O. are the main driving force of the progressive movement of workers, farmers, professional and small business people and of all other liberal elements in the community.'' With such forces on his side, the politically adept F.D.R. became a great president.
But the meaning of liberalism gradually changed. The quarter century of growth and low unemployment that followed World War II understandably muted appeals for class justice on the left. Liberals focused on rights for minority groups and women more than addressing continuing inequalities of wealth. Meanwhile, conservatives began to build their own movement based on a loathing of ''creeping socialism'' and a growing perception that the federal government was oblivious or hostile to the interests and values of middle-class whites.
IN the late 1970s, the grass-roots right was personified by a feisty, cigar-chomping businessman-activist named Howard Jarvis. Having toiled for conservative causes since Herbert Hoover's campaign in 1932, Jarvis had run for office on several occasions in the past, but, like Henry George, he had never been elected. Blocked at the ballot box, he became an anti-tax organizer, working on the belief that the best way to fight big government was ''not to give them the money in the first place.''
In 1978 he spearheaded the Proposition 13 campaign in California to roll back property taxes and make it exceedingly hard to raise them again. That fall, Proposition 13 won almost two-thirds of the vote, and conservatives have been vigorously echoing its anti-tax argument ever since. Just as the left was once able to pin the nation's troubles on heartless big businessmen, the right honed a straightforward critique of a big government that took Americans' money and gave them little or nothing useful in return.
One reason for the growth of the right was that most of those in charge of the government from the mid-1960s through the 2000s -- whether Democrats or Republicans -- failed to carry out their biggest promises. Lyndon Johnson failed to defeat the Viet Cong or abolish poverty; Jimmy Carter was unable to tame inflation or free the hostages in Iran; George W. Bush neither accomplished his mission in Iraq nor controlled the deficit.
Like the left in the early 20th century, conservatives built an impressive set of institutions to develop and disseminate their ideas. Their think tanks, legal societies, lobbyists, talk radio and best-selling manifestos have trained, educated and financed two generations of writers and organizers. Conservative Christian colleges, both Protestant and Catholic, provide students with a more coherent worldview than do the more prestigious schools led by liberals. More recently, conservatives marshaled media outlets like Fox News and the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal to their cause.
The Tea Party is thus just the latest version of a movement that has been evolving for over half a century, longer than any comparable effort on the liberal or radical left. Conservatives have rarely celebrated a landslide win on the scale of Proposition 13, but their argument about the evils of big government has, by and large, carried the day. President Obama's inability to solve the nation's economic woes has only reinforced the right's ideological advantage.
If activists on the left want to alter this reality, they will have to figure out how to redefine the old ideal of economic justice for the age of the Internet and relentless geographic mobility. During the last election, many hoped that the organizing around Barack Obama's presidential campaign would do just that. Yet, since taking office, Mr. Obama has only rarely made an effort to move the public conversation in that direction.
Instead, the left must realize that when progressives achieved success in the past, whether at organizing unions or fighting for equal rights, they seldom bet their future on politicians. They fashioned their own institutions -- unions, women's groups, community and immigrant centers and a witty, anti-authoritarian press -- in which they spoke up for themselves and for the interests of wage-earning Americans.
Today, such institutions are either absent or reeling. With unions embattled and on the decline, working people of all races lack a sturdy vehicle to articulate and fight for the vision of a more egalitarian society. Liberal universities, Web sites and non-governmental organizations cater mostly to a professional middle class and are more skillful at promoting social causes like legalizing same-sex marriage and protecting the environment than demanding millions of new jobs that pay a living wage.
A reconnection with ordinary Americans is vital not just to defeating conservatives in 2012 and in elections to come. Without it, the left will remain unable to state clearly and passionately what a better country would look like and what it will take to get there. To paraphrase the labor martyr Joe Hill, the left should stop mourning its recent past and start organizing to change the future.
Correction: October 2, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A historical photograph on Sept. 25, with an opinion essay about the absence of a vibrant left-wing movement in the United States, was published in mirror image. The picture, of a Communist rally in Union Square in Manhattan on May 1, 1934, was taken by The Associated Press. The park pavilion should have been on the right, and the row of buildings should have been on the left. In the distance is the former Tammany Hall building, on East 17th Street near the northeast corner of Union Square Park.
The photograph also appeared in mirror image in The Times on May 2, 1934. After a writer for The Times pointed out the recent error, editors retrieved the photograph, which was distributed by The A.P., from The Times's archives; it also was printed in mirror image. An editor at The A.P. checked its copy of the original photograph and found that it too was printed in mirror image.
It is not known why the original prints were made in mirror image. But one possibility is that editors at The A.P. did so in order to make several signs, carried by members of the crowd in the foreground, legible to readers. (The letters evidently bled through the signs, which appear to have been made of cloth, and would have appeared backward if the image had been printed without alteration.) At the time, retouching and altering images for clarity's sake were not uncommon practices; The A.P. and The Times no longer permit such changes to photographic images.

HEADLINE: Why Rent When You Can Nest?

BYLINE: By GREGORY WARNER

 BODY:
Gregory Warner is a reporter at Marketplace, the public radio show about business and economics.
A FRIEND of mine named Eugene who is 28 and an investment banker lives at home in Connecticut with his parents. He can afford to live on his own, but he doesn't see the point. He's putting the money he would have spent on rent toward co-ownership of a pizza restaurant. And when he wants to stretch his limbs, he drives to his girlfriend's apartment.
Prolonged adolescence? Extended dependency? Neither. My friend, who was born in Russia and moved here as a child, is more future-focused than most American-born people his age. Chalk it up to culture. Ex-Soviets know how to survive in stagnant times. My Russian wife, after graduating from Cornell, moved in with her grandfather in Brooklyn; in this way she stretched the salary she made in one year as a paralegal for the three years it took her to write her first book. 
I, on the other hand, celebrated my first job after graduation by promptly signing away half my take-home pay on a $1,250-a-month rental. I grew up with an unspoken assumption, just as my parents had, that I would live on my own after college. My parents shared that assumption; they sold their large house for a smaller apartment that was big enough only for the children to visit. I couldn't have moved back even if I'd wanted to.
In some ways our parents see ''success'' and ''independence'' as synonyms, though no such conflation exists for many immigrants.
The children of baby boomers have inherited an expectation of early independence that in today's economy is hard to sustain, and many of them are moving back home -- if, of course, their parents live in a place that holds the potential for jobs. Census figures show that adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are living in multigenerational households at a rate not seen since 1950.
I suspect that many young American adults who have to move in with their parents feel crummy about it. Most Russian immigrants I know do not. They don't see it as a sign of failure but as a means to achieve their financial goals more quickly.
Are Americans really all that desperate to break free of their parents? Or does the push toward independence originate from the top? Are baby boomers sending the not-so-subtle message to their children that they prefer an empty nest?
Maybe so. Last month, I had lunch at a beach club with a group of my parents' friends and my 6-month-old son. As long as my son was smiling and giggling, my parents' friends passed him around with joy. When he got hungry and started to fuss, he was rapidly dumped back in my lap.
''That's the best part about being a grandparent,'' commented a woman to the crowd, wiping her hands for effect. ''You get to give them back!'' As I juggled bib, spoon, jar of pureed peas, and one squirmy young boy, I compared that woman unfavorably to my mother-in-law, who often gives my wife and me needed breaks by commandeering the baby for many hours at a time, dismissing our (insincere) protestations with the Russian saying, ''An old lady isn't good for anything except bouncing a baby on her knee.'' (It's pure irony. My mother-in-law is an engineer at a top research center and makes more than both of us combined.)
Some economists anticipate that this period of low growth will continue at least until 2016. The Czech economist Tomas Sedlacek suggests two ways to deal with this reality. One is to try everything we can to kick growth back into high gear, and that's what all our fervent public debate is about right now. The other is to reduce demand: to accustom ourselves to consuming less, which he notes is a tougher psychological exercise than it appears.
To survive this new slow-growth economy, don't we need a new set of family values? I think back to my friend Eugene, the investment banker; he spends many evenings eating his mom's cooking and happily discussing with his parents his latest capitalist schemes. His parents, no slouches themselves, are astonished by what their son has managed to achieve in this country. What son wouldn't want to bask in that astonishment?
And then I think of so many American parents, who struggle to hide their disappointment when they tell their friends that their adult children have -- oh dreaded words -- ''moved back in.'' What child wouldn't want to escape from that shadow into the trappings of independence, even if it meant tumbling into indebtedness?

HEADLINE: FAVORITE PLACE: LITTLE COMPTON, R.I.; Drawing a Line In the Sand

BYLINE: By DOMINIQUE BROWNING. 
DOMINIQUE BROWNING, author of the memoir '','' is a founder of , an organization fighting air pollution as a children's health issue.

 BODY:
MY favorite places, like my favorite people, tend to be complicated. Perhaps even difficult. I like strong character, with an I-dare-you-to-like-me attitude, cut with the zest of simple charm. I know, I know. You can waste a lot of time with these types, going nowhere fast. But I've come to appreciate the value in going nowhere. Which is why my favorite place in the world happens to be just down the street from me -- the public beach in Little Compton, R.I.
If ever there were a complicated beach, South Shore Beach is it. It has a serious case of split personality. This is a beach with tawdry charm dangling from a bracelet of breath-taking beauty. Half of it is resplendently tacky. The other half, officially Goosewing, is gorgeously unspoiled. Its appeal is infinitely variable, no matter the season. What with climate chaos, ocean warming and unemployment, many of us are hanging out at the beach well into October. 
Even ravaging hurricanes don't stop us; they only demonstrate our eternally optimistic attitude that, once we bulldoze everything back into place, we belong at the beach and the beach belongs to us. Because of all the frenetic, we're-here-to-have-fun determination of summer visitors blanketing the sand, the differences between beaches tend to get blurred -- mine, in August, is probably not that different from yours on the Jersey shore. It is in the quieter autumn days that the real soul of a beach shines forth.
South Shore is a beach for all seasons, and it is for people of all seasons. Among its crowning virtues: it is open to everyone. Most of our town's beaches are private. By law, anyone has access to the beach, up to the high-tide mark. Anyone who can get to the beach, that is. Try parking a car without a permit: impossible. Or getting permission to walk down a private lane. Or screwing up the courage, even with permission, to get past a barking homeowner who thinks she controls miles of beachfront. Small towns have their share of petty tyrants.
Many of eastern Rhode Island's beaches are rather short affairs, a bit of cobble-strewn sand boundaried by ancient upheaves of red granite cliffs that glow with sunrise, as one legend has it, giving the state its name. We're in that transitional zone between the sandy stretches of Long Island and the rock-strewn coast of Maine. Rhode Island's beaches are gorgeous, dramatic places, but frustrating for walkers and swimmers who like to go the distance. But South Shore features a long stretch of sand, ringed with visitor parking, and -- here's where the personality splits -- it is the only way into another gentle crescent of beach, where no cars can venture, and the swales and dunes are left alone, protected by the Nature Conservancy, called Goosewing Beach Preserve.
Most people think they like an empty beach; they admire the fiction of unspoiled stretches of wilderness. But I have noticed that most people gravitate to ... most people. Because of this deeply entrenched quirk in human nature, South Shore is able to offer both solitude and cacophony. One end is crowded with clusters of human encampments; the other, Goosewing, reached by wading across a shallow tidal breach, is usually empty.
In fall, Goosewing's grassy dunes ripple in chilly breezes and swollen rose hips turn tawny; swallows emerge from holes drilled into high, eroding clay banks; seaweed and lichen on the boulders blaze with color, just like the leaves of the tupelo and maple in nearby woods. Georgia O'Keeffe clouds scud across the sky. Fishermen scan for roiling water as the ferocious bluefish migrate to Florida from Maine.
The ropes demarcating piping plover protection sites, put up by Conservancy volunteers, come down -- thin cordons of hope that we can help birds who can't help but lay eggs in shallow bowls of sand, nests that are frequently drowned in spring tides and storm surges. The signs warning people to keep dogs away because they frighten the birds, who then abandon their eggs -- signs that are, sadly, infuriatingly, ignored all summer (and yes, I've become the kind of crank who stops dog owners, points to the signs, and begs them please to respect the birds) -- are put away until the following spring, when we all try, and sometimes fail, again to do better by one another.
At the other end of the beach, a $12 parking fee gives you the right to nose up to the edge of a compacted sand lot, bermed with boulders, that runs the length of South Shore. This clever feature means that people who don't like sand, don't like water and don't like to walk can enjoy a panoramic view of the ocean from inside their cars -- and many do. It also means that a mother whose son (like mine) has decided to learn to surf can ride out a storm in her car while her child bobs up and down on the rough water -- because when else would you want to learn to surf? The beloved child becomes a tiny figure against an infinite horizon, and the mother ponders eternal questions, like what, exactly, she would do if the surfer got into trouble? Drive the car into the water?
People who must deploy all manner of housekeeping accessories to enjoy the beach unload their vans and set up tents, cots, chairs, lounges, grills, umbrellas, radios, volleyball and badminton courts, and whatever else is needed to give the beach all the comforts of home. Autumn chill calls for heavy blankets. Ritualized territorial behavior is on display: plots are marked with rock or fringed with seaweed -- only to be scattered in the mad scramble for dry beach when high tide pounds in.
R.V.'s have their own neighborhood in the parking lot, and they cluster like the covered wagons of yesteryear. They set up camp until late autumn; when a hurricane comes, they evacuate, but they're always the first back. Throughout the summer small trucks tow in picturesque carts -- Seashore Hot Dogs, Anita's ice cream -- or cleverly roll up their sides, hang out a flag, and transform themselves into natty fried-clam shacks. Shack food is humble and delicious -- as my children learned early, having had to fight off aggressive gulls that would swoop in and snatch a bag of chips from an unsuspecting toddler's fist. But of course we all know that even M&M's are enhanced by the tang of salt air. In late fall, the farm stands and local vineyard on the way to the beach offer picnic fare. There is never any danger of going hungry at South Shore.
The people-watching, needless to say, is endlessly fascinating. South Shore is a beach as accessible to the creaky as it is to the crawling -- and everyone in between. It's where I spot the latest trends in needle art (tattoos), body piercing, and the colorful feathery hair accessories, formerly known as fishing lure, available from local tackle shops. South Shore is also a resounding answer to the eternally vexing question of the bathing suit shopper: Do I look fat in this? The answer is, 8 times out of 10, yes. But South Shore poses a better question: Who cares? No matter who you are, or how you look, you will fit right in.
Surfers seem to get the most out of being in the water; they come to South Shore, which is a good break and picks up swell fairly easily (so I'm told by my son) well into December. I have noticed that actual swimming is the least of anyone's concerns at South Shore. Most visitors wade in, stand around, maybe do some splashing, and go back to their chairs. Braver souls lounge on chaises set up in shallow water.
But I'm a swimmer. Wherever I go, I have to find a pool, a lake, a quarry. Pool water, pristine as it is, feels like wispy chiffon against my skin. The ocean is a heavy satin that drapes around my arms. I swim well into October, when I don a wetsuit.
South Shore and Goosewing nudge up against the border of Rhode Island, so you can blithely set out at one end and swim to Massachusetts. The satisfaction of doing such a thing is akin to the thrill of the child who announces she is running away from home, only to hide at the end of the road. A distance swimmer also sets off a crackle of walkie-talkie alarms relayed from one lifeguard chair to another, so that, like the game of telephone, what begins at one end as ''swimmer swimming'' ends, at the other, with ''swimmer must be lunatic, go fetch.'' Many's the time I've been stopped by a lifeguard wanting to know where, exactly, I thought I was going. To Massachusetts, of course.
In the autumn, there are no lifeguards. My ocean swims are blissfully uninterrupted, but the absence of protectors means sharper twinges of anxiety when I brush against something that might be a jellyfish, or a shark, or a whale, depending on how vivid my imagination is that day.
South Shore attracts lots of students in the fall, especially the arty types from Brown and Rhode Island School of Design. In the evening, when the sun is setting, a string of campfires lights the way down the beach; you stroll past guitar and ukulele-strumming loners and get a contact high off memories of the days when you, too, were a young arty person.
There is less trash to pick up on an autumn beach walk, but the human hand is always present; there is no getting away from it. Hurricane surfs kick the debris of boaters onto the land. I'm liable to return with a trash bag full of bleached sneakers, rubber gloves and plastic bottles. Still, Goosewing is as close to pristine as it gets on the East Coast.
My beach in autumn is redolent of absence. Even the slant of the light, as if it wanted to bend back time, brings on nostalgia. I miss the frantic summer activity, its sounds and smells and colors still lingering in the air; weekdays are quiet, though the weekend still swells with activity. I wonder where everyone is going. And why am I left at the beach? But I suppose that's what I love best about being here; the eternal susurration of the wind in the grass and the foam at my feet, reminding me that life is always in flux.

HEADLINE: Children in Need, And Class Disparities

 BODY:
In last week's Metropolitan cover article, John Leland interviewed couples with children adopted from China, where recent reports reveal that some adoptees had been seized from their parents or sold. Some of the more than 100 comments posted on NYTimes.com follow. Readers also weighed in on Ginia Bellafante's first Big City column, which contended that huge economic gaps among New Yorkers are often ignored or glossed over.
I feel terrible for these parents, but their nonsense about ''doing what's right for the child'' by keeping them, not questioning their origins and pushing this under the rug is nauseating -- not to mention self-serving. Being involved in an international child-stealing ring, whether at first by sheer ignorance but then by willful ignorance, is not a morally defensible position. It also has a strong element of racial or cultural superiority to it. 
Armen V,
San Francisco
It pains me to hear the judgments many people have toward adoptive parents. Children are abandoned all the time, and while coercion and kidnapping do occur, there is no doubt that there are many millions of children in need of homes around the world and the vast majority of adopted children are legitimately abandoned and extremely lucky to have been adopted. Let's not lose sight of this.
Mary,
N.Y.
You know, there are an awful lot of in-need and at-risk children available for adoption right here.
Ed in Ct.,
Woodbury, Conn.
Why are American children more worthy of adoption than non-American children?
Jamie,
Madison, Wis.
The Wealth Gap
And what's the point of this article? That there are vast income disparities in our society is nothing new. That there are vast differences in people's innate abilities at birth is not news either, and our knowledge-based economy exacerbates the financial results of those differences. The implicit prescription (or maybe it's just my reading into it) seems to be to punish the hypocritical well-to-do. That seems to be our national policy these days, as well, at least at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It's not working out so well, is it? Instead of ''a rising tide lifts all boats,'' we're going to shoot some holes in the boats of everyone, so everybody can sink together!
Eddie the Geek,
Rochester
The class hatred in these posts is appalling. Look, some people have been lucky; others have worked hard and been lucky; others have worked hard and been very unlucky indeed. The wide class disparities described in these articles are not the fault of any of the individuals. Of course, if you can afford to be in a safe neighborhood, or eat food you really enjoy, you will choose to do this. What's wrong is the organization of our economy in a way that rewards the already-rich and makes things harder and harder for the working middle class and the working poor, not to mention the children of the middle classes and the poor who have made no choices at all but are still suffering.
Howard,
Los Angeles
Ginia Bellafante writes about ''years of gentrification'' as though it's a bad thing. It doesn't have to be.
There's a nationwide effort to spread out low-income housing so that it coexists in middle- and upper-class areas. The idea is that if you give low-income residents access to better schools and other amenities in these areas, you're giving them a way out of poverty. If it's done carefully, gentrification can actually accomplish the same goal -- by bringing better schools and amenities to poorer neighborhoods.
So boundaries like 96th Street and the others should not be seen as tourist destinations, or as walls between rich and poor. Rather, they should be seen as lines in the sand that are meant to be crossed. The rich should not be afraid to bring their wealth north of 96th Street.

HEADLINE: Is Junk Food Really Cheaper

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
THE ''fact'' that junk food is cheaper than real food has become a reflexive part of how we explain why so many Americans are overweight, particularly those with lower incomes. I frequently read confident statements like, ''when a bag of chips is cheaper than a head of broccoli ...'' or ''it's more affordable to feed a family of four at McDonald's than to cook a healthy meal for them at home.''
This is just plain wrong. In fact it isn't cheaper to eat highly processed food: a typical order for a family of four -- for example, two Big Macs, a cheeseburger, six chicken McNuggets, two medium and two small fries, and two medium and two small sodas -- costs, at the McDonald's a hundred steps from where I write, about $28. (Judicious ordering of ''Happy Meals'' can reduce that to about $23 -- and you get a few apple slices in addition to the fries!) 
In general, despite extensive government subsidies, hyperprocessed food remains more expensive than food cooked at home. You can serve a roasted chicken with vegetables along with a simple salad and milk for about $14, and feed four or even six people. If that's too much money, substitute a meal of rice and canned beans with bacon, green peppers and onions; it's easily enough for four people and costs about $9. (Omitting the bacon, using dried beans, which are also lower in sodium, or substituting carrots for the peppers reduces the price further, of course.)
Another argument runs that junk food is cheaper when measured by the calorie, and that this makes fast food essential for the poor because they need cheap calories. But given that half of the people in this country (and a higher percentage of poor people) consume too many calories rather than too few, measuring food's value by the calorie makes as much sense as measuring a drink's value by its alcohol content. (Why not drink 95 percent neutral grain spirit, the cheapest way to get drunk?)
Besides, that argument, even if we all needed to gain weight, is not always true. A meal of real food cooked at home can easily contain more calories, most of them of the ''healthy'' variety. (Olive oil accounts for many of the calories in the roast chicken meal, for example.)In comparing prices of real food and junk food, I used supermarket ingredients, not the pricier organic or local food that many people would consider ideal. But food choices are not black and white; the alternative to fast food is not necessarily organic food, any more than the alternative to soda is Bordeaux.
The alternative to soda is water, and the alternative to junk food is not grass-fed beef and greens from a trendy farmers' market, but anything other than junk food: rice, grains, pasta, beans, fresh vegetables, canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, bread, peanut butter, a thousand other things cooked at home -- in almost every case a far superior alternative.
''Anything that you do that's not fast food is terrific; cooking once a week is far better than not cooking at all,'' says Marion Nestle, professor of food studies at New York University and author of ''What to Eat.'' ''It's the same argument as exercise: more is better than less and some is a lot better than none.''
THE fact is that most people can afford real food. Even the nearly 50 million Americans who are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) receive about $5 per person per day, which is far from ideal but enough to survive. So we have to assume that money alone doesn't guide decisions about what to eat. There are, of course, the so-called food deserts, places where it's hard to find food: the Department of Agriculture says that more than two million Americans in low-income rural areas live 10 miles or more from a supermarket, and more than five million households without access to cars live more than a half mile from a supermarket.
Still, 93 percent of those with limited access to supermarkets do have access to vehicles, though it takes them 20 more minutes to travel to the store than the national average. And after a long day of work at one or even two jobs, 20 extra minutes -- plus cooking time -- must seem like an eternity.
Taking the long route to putting food on the table may not be easy, but for almost all Americans it remains a choice, and if you can drive to McDonald's you can drive to Safeway. It's cooking that's the real challenge. (The real challenge is not ''I'm too busy to cook.'' In 2010 the average American, regardless of weekly earnings, watched no less than an hour and a half of television per day. The time is there.)
The core problem is that cooking is defined as work, and fast food is both a pleasure and a crutch. ''People really are stressed out with all that they have to do, and they don't want to cook,'' says Julie Guthman, associate professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of the forthcoming ''Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice and the Limits of Capitalism.'' ''Their reaction is, 'Let me enjoy what I want to eat, and stop telling me what to do.' And it's one of the few things that less well-off people have: they don't have to cook.''
It's not just about choice, however, and rational arguments go only so far, because money and access and time and skill are not the only considerations. The ubiquity, convenience and habit-forming appeal of hyperprocessed foods have largely drowned out the alternatives: there are five fast-food restaurants for every supermarket in the United States; in recent decades the adjusted for inflation price of fresh produce has increased by 40 percent while the price of soda and processed food has decreased by as much as 30 percent; and nearly inconceivable resources go into encouraging consumption in restaurants: fast-food companies spent $4.2 billion on marketing in 2009.
Furthermore, the engineering behind hyperprocessed food makes it virtually addictive. A 2009 study by the Scripps Research Institute indicates that overconsumption of fast food ''triggers addiction-like neuroaddictive responses'' in the brain, making it harder to trigger the release of dopamine. In other words the more fast food we eat, the more we need to give us pleasure; thus the report suggests that the same mechanisms underlie drug addiction and obesity.
This addiction to processed food is the result of decades of vision and hard work by the industry. For 50 years, says David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and author of ''The End of Overeating,'' companies strove to create food that was ''energy-dense, highly stimulating, and went down easy. They put it on every street corner and made it mobile, and they made it socially acceptable to eat anytime and anyplace. They created a food carnival, and that's where we live. And if you're used to self-stimulation every 15 minutes, well, you can't run into the kitchen to satisfy that urge.''
Real cultural changes are needed to turn this around. Somehow, no-nonsense cooking and eating -- roasting a chicken, making a grilled cheese sandwich, scrambling an egg, tossing a salad -- must become popular again, and valued not just by hipsters in Brooklyn or locavores in Berkeley. The smart campaign is not to get McDonald's to serve better food but to get people to see cooking as a joy rather than a burden, or at least as part of a normal life.
As with any addictive behavior, this one is most easily countered by educating children about the better way. Children, after all, are born without bad habits. And yet it's adults who must begin to tear down the food carnival.
The question is how? Efforts are everywhere. The People's Grocery in Oakland secures affordable groceries for low-income people. Zoning laws in Los Angeles restrict the number of fast-food restaurants in high-obesity neighborhoods. There's the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, a successful Pennsylvania program to build fresh food outlets in underserved areas, now being expanded nationally. FoodCorps and Cooking Matters teach young people how to farm and cook.
As Malik Yakini, executive director of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, says, ''We've seen minor successes, but the food movement is still at the infant stage, and we need a massive social shift to convince people to consider healthier options.''
HOW do you change a culture? The answers, not surprisingly, are complex. ''Once I look at what I'm eating,'' says Dr. Kessler, ''and realize it's not food, and I ask 'what am I doing here?' that's the start. It's not about whether I think it's good for me, it's about changing how I feel. And we change how people feel by changing the environment.''
Obviously, in an atmosphere where any regulation is immediately labeled ''nanny statism,'' changing ''the environment'' is difficult. But we've done this before, with tobacco. The 1998 tobacco settlement limited cigarette marketing and forced manufacturers to finance anti-smoking campaigns -- a negotiated change that led to an environmental one that in turn led to a cultural one, after which kids said to their parents, ''I wish you didn't smoke.'' Smoking had to be converted from a cool habit into one practiced by pariahs.
A similar victory in the food world is symbolized by the stories parents tell me of their kids booing as they drive by McDonald's.
To make changes like this more widespread we need action both cultural and political. The cultural lies in celebrating real food; raising our children in homes that don't program them for fast-produced, eaten-on-the-run, high-calorie, low-nutrition junk; giving them the gift of appreciating the pleasures of nourishing one another and enjoying that nourishment together.
Political action would mean agitating to limit the marketing of junk; forcing its makers to pay the true costs of production; recognizing that advertising for fast food is not the exercise of free speech but behavior manipulation of addictive substances; and making certain that real food is affordable and available to everyone. The political challenge is the more difficult one, but it cannot be ignored.
What's easier is to cook at every opportunity, to demonstrate to family and neighbors that the real way is the better way. And even the more fun way: kind of like a carnival.

HEADLINE: Gunning for Wall Street, With Faulty Aim

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE. 
E-mail: bigcity@nytimes.com

 BODY:
By late morning on Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street, a noble but fractured and airy movement of rightly frustrated young people, had a default ambassador in a half-naked woman who called herself Zuni Tikka. A blonde with a marked likeness to Joni Mitchell and a seemingly even stronger wish to burrow through the space-time continuum and hunker down in 1968, Ms. Tikka had taken off all but her cotton underwear and was dancing on the north side of Zuccotti Park, facing Liberty Street, just west of Broadway. Tourists stopped to take pictures; cops smiled, and the insidiously favorable tax treatment of private equity and hedge-fund managers was looking as though it would endure.
''I've been waiting for this my whole life,'' Ms. Tikka, 37, told me. 
''This,'' presumably was the opportunity to air societal grievances as carnival. Occupy Wall Street, a diffuse and leaderless convocation of activists against greed, corporate influence, gross social inequality and other nasty byproducts of wayward capitalism not easily extinguishable by street theater, had hoped to see many thousands join its protest and encampment, which began Sept. 17. According to the group, 2,000 marched on the first day; news outlets estimated that the number was closer to several hundred.
By Wednesday morning, 100 or so stalwarts were making the daily, peaceful trek through the financial district, where their movements were circumscribed by barricades and a heavy police presence. (Various arrests for disorderly conduct were made.) By Thursday, the number still sleeping in Zuccotti Park, the central base of operations, appeared to be dwindling further.
Members retained hope for an infusion of energy over the weekend, but as it approached, the issue was not that the Bastille hadn't been stormed, but that its facade had suffered hardly a chip. It is a curious fact of life in New York that even as the disparities between rich and poor grow deeper, the kind of large-scale civil agitation that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently suggested might happen here hasn't taken shape. The city has two million more residents than Wisconsin, but there, continuing protests of the state budget bill this year turned out approximately 100,000 people at their peak. When a similar mobilization was attempted in June to challenge the city's budget cuts, 100 people arrived for a sleep-in near City Hall.
Last week brought a disheartening coupling of statistics further delineating the city's economic divide: The Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans, which included more than 50 New Yorkers whose combined net worth totaled $211 billion, arrived at the same moment as census data showing that the percentage of the city's population living in poverty had risen to 20.1 percent. And yet the revolution did not appear to be brewing.
Most of those entrenched in Zuccotti Park had indeed traveled from somewhere else; they had come from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Missouri, Texas and so on with drums, horns, tambourines and, in the instance of one young man, a knee-length burlap vest, fur hat, ski goggles and tiny plastic baby dolls applied to the tips of his fingers.
One of the few New Yorkers I met, a senior at Bronx High School of Science, was stopping by in fits and spurts, against the wishes of his psychiatrist mother, who feared the possibility of tear gas and had chastised her son for giving his allowance to the cause.
That cause, though, in specific terms, was virtually impossible to decipher. The group was clamoring for nothing in particular to happen right away -- not the implementation of the Buffett rule or the increased regulation of the financial industry. Some didn't think government action was the answer because the rich, they believed, would just find new ways to subvert the system.
''I'm not for interference,'' Anna Katheryn Sluka, of western Michigan, told me. ''I hope this all gets people who have a lot to think: 'I'm not going to go to Barcelona for three weeks. I'm going to sponsor a small town in need.' ''
Some said they were fighting the legal doctrine of corporate personhood; others, not fully understanding what that meant, believed it meant corporations paid no taxes whatsoever. Others came to voice concerns about the death penalty, the drug war, the environment.
''I want to get rid of the combustion engine,'' John McKibben, an activist from Vermont, declared as his primary ambition.
''I want to create spectacles,'' Becky Wartell, a recent graduate of the College of the Atlantic in Maine, said.
Having discerned the intellectual vacuum, Chris Spiech, an unemployed 26-year-old from New Jersey, arrived on Thursday with the hope of indoctrinating his peers in the lessons of Austrian economics, Milton Friedman and Ron Paul. ''I want to abolish the Federal Reserve,'' he said.
The group's lack of cohesion and its apparent wish to pantomime progressivism rather than practice it knowledgably is unsettling in the face of the challenges so many of its generation face -- finding work, repaying student loans, figuring out ways to finish college when money has run out. But what were the chances that its members were going to receive the attention they so richly deserve carrying signs like ''Even if the World Were to End Tomorrow I'd Still Plant a Tree Today''?
One day, a trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Adam Sarzen, a decade or so older than many of the protesters, came to Zuccotti Park seemingly just to shake his head. ''Look at these kids, sitting here with their Apple computers,'' he said. ''Apple, one of the biggest monopolies in the world. It trades at $400 a share. Do they even know that?''

HEADLINE: Stars Add New Tunes To Country King's Lyrics

BYLINE: By ALAN LIGHT

 BODY:
BOB DYLAN has long claimed Hank Williams as an influence and an inspiration. In his 2004 memoir, ''Chronicles Volume One,'' Mr. Dylan recounted his discovery of that country giant's music in the 1950s. ''I became aware that in Hank's recorded songs were the archetype rules of poetic songwriting,'' he wrote. ''The architectural forms are like marble pillars.''
Mr. Dylan added that when he got word of Williams's death at the age of 29 on New Year's Day, 1953, the news ''hit me squarely on the shoulder.''
''Intuitively I knew, though, that his voice would never drop out of sight or fade away,'' he continued. 
With a new project titled ''The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams,'' Mr. Dylan is doing his part to keep the work of one of America's greatest songwriters -- the author of classics like ''I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' ''Cold Cold Heart,'' and ''Hey Good Lookin' '' -- in the spotlight. The album collects the lyrics for a dozen unrecorded songs by Williams, set to melodies and recorded by an array of rock and country stars, including Jack White, Norah Jones, Merle Haggard and Sheryl Crow. ''The Lost Notebooks'' is being released on Oct. 4 on Mr. Dylan's imprint, Egyptian Records, in conjunction with the Country Music Hall of Fame and Columbia Records. (The only previous release on Egyptian was a 1997 group tribute to the country pioneer Jimmie Rodgers.)
Artists who participated in the album, which has been in the works for almost a decade, expressed their sense of honor at being asked to complete the work of such a monumental musician. ''There's a lot of magic still left in these songs,'' said Alan Jackson, who opens the album with ''You've Been Lonesome, Too.'' Ms. Jones, who sings the bluesy, melancholy ''How Many Times Have You Broken My Heart,'' said she found the idea behind the project ''really daunting,'' but that ''the people who were putting it together were doing it with respect and love and creativity, and I had trust in that.''
Lucinda Williams -- whose poet father met Hank Williams the month before the singer died and Ms. Williams was born -- felt such an emotional connection to her selection, ''I'm So Happy I Found You,'' that she sang it immediately before she and her husband exchanged vows at their onstage wedding in 2009. The seeds of the project were planted in 2002 when the all-star Hank Williams tribute album ''Timeless'' (also with Mr. Dylan, Ms. Williams and Ms. Crow) won the Grammy for country album of the year. One of that record's executive producers, the veteran manager and A&R executive Mary Martin, was approached by Peggy Lamb, the Hank Williams authority at Williams's publishing company, Acuff-Rose. Ms. Lamb told her about the cardboard box containing four notebooks and scattered scraps of paper full of Williams's unrecorded lyrics (66 songs in all) that was locked in a vault in her office. Williams's family had passed the material to Acuff-Rose soon after the singer died, but its existence wasn't widely known until a few of the pages were reprinted in the book ''Hank Williams: Snapshots From the Lost Highway,''
''Nashville is a small community,'' said Ms. Martin, who worked with Mr. Dylan's legendary manager Albert Grossman and first introduced Mr. Dylan to the members of the Band. ''If three of us have a passion, we're bound to end up in a bar together.''
Initially Ms. Lamb's idea was to ask one artist to record a full album based on the manuscripts. Ms. Martin approached Mr. Dylan, sending him 27 of them; he weighed the idea for ''about a year and a half,'' she said, before replying that ''the task is too mighty.'' He chose one song, ''The Love That Faded,'' for himself -- setting lines like ''Vows that we made turned into lies/My life is empty, my lonely heart cries'' to a chugging waltz with a pedal-steel guitar refrain -- and they started coming up with a roster of potential contributors and sending them lyrics to consider; Mr. Jackson was the first artist asked.
Ms. Martin said that some of the choices -- Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young -- opted not to participate and laughed as she described Mr. Dylan's wondering why they weren't involving Luciano Pavarotti.
The finest of the ''Lost Notebooks'' lyrics offer the economy and precision that characterized Williams's work. Given the range of styles in which Mr. Williams wrote, from the spiritual revelation of ''I Saw the Light'' to the physical joy in ''Jambalaya (on the Bayou),'' the selections of each artist can be telling. Though there were a number of gospel songs among the lyrics, only Mr. Haggard chose a religious theme, the album's closer, ''The Sermon on the Mount.'' The sly humor of ''You Know That I Know'' feels like familiar territory for Mr. White. The tradition-minded country singers Vince Gill and Rodney Crowell utilize a recited section, like those on the records Williams made as the street preacher character Luke the Drifter, in ''I Hope You Shed a Million Tears'' (and called on Williams's pedal steel player, Don Helms, for what turned out to be his final recording session; he died in 2008).
Ms. Crow said she didn't feel intimidated by the idea of finishing a master's work. ''It's meant to be a project honoring him and his legacy,'' she said. ''It's not really a contest, so I didn't feel there would be any judgment.''
Still, most of the songs on the ''Lost Notebooks'' album hew to Williams's sound; Ms. Martin noted that it was difficult to settle on a sequence because so many of the artists submitted waltzes.
The least familiar name among the contributors is Holly Williams, Williams's granddaughter, who has previously released two albums of folk-inflected country originals. She had to add two verses of her own to the song fragment ''Blue Is My Heart,'' on which her father, Hank Williams Jr., adds backup vocals.
''As I've gotten older, I've gotten so much into my family's heritage,'' she said. ''Growing up I really didn't understand his legacy. It was when I heard Bob Dylan and Tom Waits and Neil Young talking about Hank Williams that I started to understand. Now I just want to make sure that someone keeps it going for the next generation in our family.'' (Williams's grandson Shelton Hank Williams, who performs honky-tonk country and punk-metal as Hank 3, was not asked to participate, and has said that ''it seems a little strange for somebody to finish a half-finished Hank Williams song.'')
Others have also expressed apprehension about the concept, whose closest precedent is the use of unpublished Woody Guthrie lyrics on the two ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums that Billy Bragg and Wilco released in 1998 and 2000. There is a Facebook group called Stop the Desecration of Hank Williams Unfinished Songs. Chet Flippo, the editorial director of CMT and CMT.com, recently wrote that the album is ''utterly fascinating'' but also asked, ''If you were a painter and were asked to execute a painting based on a very rudimentary fragment of sketches by Picasso, would you do that?''
Jakob Dylan, Bob's son, whose inclusion on the album marks the first time his work has appeared side by side with his father's, was circumspect about the project. ''I wouldn't be so lofty or arrogant to think I was actually co-writing with Hank Williams,'' he said. ''This was one way to interpret the lyrics, but I don't think it defines the song.'' Ms. Crow saw it as a challenge that might help her own songwriting. ''I think whenever you're playing tennis with John McEnroe, it ups your level a little,'' she said, ''so I hope this did something for my own art.''
Most of the musicians, though, immediately recalled the thrill they felt when first given their assignment. ''This has got to be one of the coolest things ever,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''To be credited as writing a song with Hank Williams, that means more to me than winning a Grammy.''
'It Felt Like I Did Conjure the Ghost'
Some of the artists who participated in the ''Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams'' album discuss how they approached the song they selected.
Alan Jackson
''You've Been Lonesome, Too''
The song I chose was pretty complete, where some of the others felt a little more rambling. The melody just kind of jumped out -- that was the easy part. I wanted it to be a tribute, to do it as much like Hank as I could. I recorded with the same instrumentation he used, no drums. I was trying to sing like Hank. The guys in the band all said it felt kind of haunting in the studio. Everybody got goose bumps.
Sheryl Crow
''Angel Mine''
Hank had such a distinct cadence to his writing. I just picked up the lyric and read it, and the flow of reading it set up how I would sing it. I could feel the tempo, how he would have sung it, where he might have yodeled. I tried to picture myself sitting around with Hank or the Carter Family, to get myself into that place. I played a 1930s Martin guitar, something that felt like it would have been in the room.
Jakob Dylan
''Oh, Mama, Come Home''
All the lyrics I looked through already had a melody inherent in the writing, so I picked something where it just kind of busted out at me. I thought it was important to stick with a melody that he might have used, but I didn't try to mimic or replicate his sound. These songs really are timeless, so I didn't think there was a need to be precious.
Lucinda Williams
''I'm So Happy I Found You''
I immediately picked this one, because it was so unusual for a Hank Williams song: it's a happy love song. I didn't change anything in the lyrics, I felt like that was sacred. I initially cut it with my band, but it sounded too straight or something, so I cut it with just me and my guitar. That gave it a more languid, jazzy feel. It felt like I did conjure the ghost, but that wasn't a new feeling. I've always had such affinity for his music, I felt that connection already.

BYLINE: By TIM SULLIVAN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I GREW up outside Albany, N.Y. When I was about 14, I got to work for the Washington Redskins. My father, a family physician, cared for the mother of the coach, George Allen. For two summers, I spent two weeks at the team's training camp, handing out towels and water to legendary players like Joe Theismann. I even traveled with the team to a couple of preseason games, where I'd try to catch kickoff balls from Mark Moseley during the pregame warm-up. It was a kid's dream.
For my last three years of high school I attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn. Then I attended the University of North Carolina as a Morehead Scholar. The program paid for college and it funded terrific summer internships. I completed an Outward Bound program in Colorado, I worked for the county police department in Portland, Ore., and one summer I worked for the Coors brewery in the public relations department. 
In 1985, after graduating with a bachelor's degree in political science, a couple of friends and I started a video production company. For me, it was a way to stay in Chapel Hill while my girlfriend, Jane, finished. We got married in 1989 and moved to Boston so I could attend Harvard for an M.B.A. I graduated in 1991.
My first job after that was working for the Walt Disney Company in California in the home video group. As a senior financial analyst, I focused on financial modeling using Excel spreadsheets. I developed carpal tunnel syndrome and had to wear wrist braces while typing.
In 1994 I moved to Hong Kong to help set up an office in Asia, and in 1997 I was promoted to managing director for the region. It was a fantastic climb in a booming business, but then the Asian economic climate took a nosedive and video piracy exploded in the region. In turn, our business imploded. Learning to manage in crisis stayed with me longer than managing in the boom. In 1999 we shuttered the office and I returned to California. I commuted to Asia part of the month visiting one of our other offices there, but that got old fast. I started looking for new opportunities.
I was interested in the Internet, so next I joined Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch as vice president of e-commerce. I was hired to build a business to sell concert memorabilia on the site, but the venture wasn't successful.
IAC took over the company and in 2001 company executives asked me to move to Dallas and become C.E.O. of Match.com. I had a fantastic run building the business, but in 2004, Barry Diller, then chief executive of IAC, Match.com's parent company, decided to make a change in leadership and I stepped down.
A headhunter contacted me about the C.E.O. job at MyFamily.com, a precursor of Ancestry.com. It seemed to be a highly promising business that hadn't reached its full potential. It also offered the chance to live in the mountains. I joined MyFamily.com in 2005, and in 2009 we changed the name to Ancestry.com and took the company public. Our target audience is someone at least 45 years old at a stage in life where they're interested in their heritage. Our biggest season is after the holidays, after families have gotten together. Perhaps a family member has passed away, and another member becomes reflective.
I've never had a master plan. I don't think there's a linear path from high school to college to where a person ends up in their 40s. I've tried to be opportunistic and react intelligently to events. Leaving Match.com involuntarily was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me that what seems like a negative at the time can be a positive change. It led me to my position at Ancestry.com, which I love.

HEADLINE: Try a Private Jet, at Public Prices

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
FLYING in a private jet may not be as far out of reach as you think. Though it's still not cheap, prices are rivaling first- and business-class tickets -- and even, occasionally, coach -- thanks in part to new Web sites, social media and a greater willingness by charter companies and private jet brokers to negotiate in an era of high fuel prices.
Here's how you can land a seat on a private plane for less.
SEARCH FOR LAST-MINUTE, ONE-WAY DISCOUNTS Air Partner, a charter broker based in London, introduced emptysectors.com last year, to help fill so-called empty legs (when the aircraft flies without passengers back to base or between jobs) at discounted rates. Travelers can view which flights are available online but must call for pricing. Other brokers and private jet operators like JetSuite also make empty legs available to individual travelers, so it can pay to shop around. 
''The dirty little secret of the industry is, about a third of our flights are empty,'' said Alex Wilcox, chief executive of JetSuite, based in Southern California, which recently began posting last-minute $499 deals on Facebook for empty legs on the company's four-passenger Embraer Phenom aircraft. ''Say a Gulfstream pulls into San Francisco and is going back to Vegas empty,'' he said. ''A few years ago, if you were to say, 'if I give you $500 will you take me and my family?' you would get laughed at.'' But the recession changed such attitudes, Mr. Wilcox said. Now, he said, more companies are saying, ''Sure, it'll help pay for the gas.''
But empty-leg flights involve a bit of a gamble. If the private jet owner's arrangements change (say, the client they were planning to meet in Miami cancels at the last minute), you're out of luck.
You also need to be flexible to get the best deals. Last month, Mike Lewis, chief executive of a property management company in Los Angeles, was able to score one of JetSuite's $499 Facebook deals for himself and his girfriend for a last-minute empty leg on a four-passenger plane to Tucson. It was just six hours between the time he booked the flight and takeoff. Still, he said, the deal was so good -- at roughly the same cost as he paid to fly back in coach on US Airways -- without connections, security hassles and time lost waiting around at the airport, that he hopes to snap up similar bargains in the future.
''For $500 it's a no-brainer to me,'' he said.
SPLIT THE COST THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA For travelers who can't find an empty leg to meet their schedule, social media is opening up new avenues to private jet travel.
Last month, for example, JetSuite started SuiteShare, which allows a customer to charter a four-passenger aircraft and then offer seats that won't be needed through Facebook(facebook.com/jetsuiteair). Each time another customer joins your flight, the price everyone pays decreases, though JetSuite makes a little more.
Here's how it works: a four-passenger jet from Oakland, Calif., to Las Vegas starts at $1,500. If a second person joins, you pay $750. If a third joins, you pay $375. While that may not be cheaper than simply buying a one-way first-class ticket from San Francisco (such seats were going for about $285, based on a recent online search), if a fourth person joins, the person who booked the charter gets to fly free. The other passengers pay $450, $600 and $750 respectively, based on booking order, and JetSuite makes an additional $300 on the deal.
Social Flights, a new collective buying company in Smyrna, Tenn., started an online service in February that uses social networking to help charter companies fill seats and travelers lower their costs by sharing a plane. Already 57 private plane operators have signed on, offering flights on some 400 aircraft. Travelers register with the site, socialflights.com, and post messages to online groups called Travel Tribes, which are based in the same city or share similar interests -- for example, football fans who want to follow their team to the Super Bowl. If enough people want to travel to the same place at the same time, each passenger simply pays the cost of his seat. Earlier this year, for example, Social Flights sent 91 Mississippi State fans on three 30-passenger turboprop planes from Jackson, Miss., to Jacksonville, Fla., for the Gator Bowl for $395 round trip each -- roughly $95 less than the going rate at the time for a coach seat on a commercial flight, according to the company.
SocialFlights also posts one-way empty legs. A recent search pulled up open seats from $200 between Nashville and Knoxville, Tenn., and $300 between Teterboro, N.J., and Big Flats, N.Y.
USE A BROKER TO FIND YOU THE BEST DEAL If you don't have the time or inclination to hunt online for empty legs or to organize your own charter flight, you can hire a broker to do it for you. For a commission, independent private jet brokers can act as your agent to solicit bids for the flight you want from jet companies they have vetted and negotiate the best rate.
They can also help walk you through the fine print of the contract. ''If something happens with your child or your health and you can't fly, you need to have a reputable broker who can be your advocate,'' said Chet Dudzik Jr., president of JetWay Private Air. ''If that broker or agent has a good relationship with the charter company, the chances are good you can cancel.'' In addition, he said, ''We assume every aircraft won't take off, so we have a recovery aircraft in place,'' and no one is left on the ramp.
Even if flying private costs more than you'd like to pay, when you factor in all the hassles of commercial travel that you can avoid -- from long security lines to overcrowded airplanes to long drives to major airports -- some travelers may find the splurge worth it.
''Once you've had a taste of it, it's really hard to go back to commercial,'' said Katrina Garnett, founder of mylittleswans.com, a high-end travel site that partners with Lufthansa Private Jet, a brand of the European carrier, for connecting flights in Europe. Being able to simply show up at the airport at the time you want, ''you never have that feeling like you're part of the cattle,'' she said.
CHECK SAFETY RATINGS Like commercial carriers, charter operators must adhere to government rules, called Federal Aviation Regulations. Still, it is a good idea to check the safety record of the private jet company you are considering flying on. While the number of private charters involved in crashes has dropped in recent years, accidents do occur more frequently outside the commercial mainstream of scheduled flights.
To ensure the plane and crew you're getting are up to snuff, ask for an Argus TripCHEQ or Wyvern PASS report, offered by the two largest private jet safety firms -- Argus International Inc. and Wyvern Consulting Ltd. -- which audit charter companies and conduct background checks on crew members, making sure pilots have the requisite number of flying hours for the specific type of aircraft. Either your broker or the private jet company itself (if you're booking directly) should be able to provide this.

HEADLINE: The Greed Police

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN

 BODY:
How much time should Raj Rajaratnam spend in prison? Rajaratnam is the hedge fund founder who was convicted in May of trading on illegal stock tips -- tips that produced fantastic results for his Galleon Group. Federal authorities compare him with notorious white-collar crooks like Bernie Madoff and Jeffrey Skilling, and they argue for a long time behind bars. His lawyers, however, say Rajaratnam is a lesser-order felon -- ''not . . . as culpable as a defendant who affirmatively steals,'' as they put it in a pre-sentencing memorandum. The lawyers raise a problem of culture and law: Is insider trading merely an illicit version of a common American cleverness, trading on gossip from a colleague or friend that helps the trader and hurts no one? Or is it the quintessential Wall Street crime, one that has undermined Americans' faith in the markets? 
Richard J. Holwell, a Manhattan federal judge, will give his answer to that question when he sentences Rajaratnam on Sept. 27. A lengthy sentence would go a long way toward validating not just the federal prosecutors who brought the case but also the Securities and Exchange Commission, which first investigated the hedge fund. Before and since the Rajaratnam trial, the S.E.C. has brought numerous cases, part of a campaign to root out insider trading and, in theory, make markets fairer for the average investor. In recent weeks alone, the S.E.C. filed complaints against traders who ran the gamut from celebrity to ordinary. It settled charges with Doug DeCinces, a former Baltimore Orioles third baseman who bought stock in Advanced Medical Optics after learning from a tipster that the company was about to be taken over; it reached an agreement with Hugh Hefner's son-in-law, who blatantly ignored written warnings against trading in the stock of Playboy, where his wife was the chief executive; and it settled with a Denver businessman, who tipped his son, an investor, about a pending acquisition.
No one knows how much cheating of this kind occurs, but regulators have developed good tools for spotting it. Every time there is market-moving news, like a merger or an earnings report, computers at Finra, a regulatory body, scan millions of buy and sell orders, looking for suspicious trades, like a big stock purchase in advance of a takeover. Finra refers some 250 trades a year to the S.E.C. for a closer look. Getting a stock-market tip has always been a sort of all-American fantasy, and despite the risk of detection, the desire for an edge seems irresistible. ''People are greedy,'' says Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement. ''They think they won't get caught.'' Even those who should know better: Donald L. Johnson, an official at Nasdaq, was entrusted with confidential information from listed companies, and he used his privileged knowledge to trade in advance of news of drug trials and other results. Johnson dimly supposed that by trading in an account listed in his wife's name, his behavior would go undetected. He was sentenced to three and a half years.
Not all cases are so black and white. The law on insider trading, which has developed over the years from judicial rulings and is not specifically found in a statute, is ambiguous enough to allow for a range of interpretations. And at a time when the government is accused of going easy on white-collar crime, Khuzami has pursued an aggressive approach, pushing the boundary of what is deemed illegal. Strengthening the S.E.C.'s long-running effort, Khuzami has focused, particularly, on the hedge fund industry, which for reasons related to its competitiveness, capital and connections, he sees as especially prone to insider trading. Wall Street has taken notice. For one thing, the Rajaratnam case, which was prosecuted by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, led to dozens of criminal convictions. Perhaps more important, the bread-and-butter civil actions brought by the S.E.C. is putting pressure on traders to refrain from using information that is even borderline illegal.
The dollar amounts involved in such cases tend to be small, which has led critics to question whether the S.E.C. shouldn't be spending more of its resources on larger offenses like mortgage fraud. But in truth, insider trading is just the sort of activity the S.E.C. was created to combat. Not so very long ago, the public had a sense that the agency was watching out for small investors and keeping markets safe. Then in 2008 came a pair of cataclysmic failures: virtually the entire investment-banking industry, which the S.E.C. regulated, either failed or sought a bailout; then, having ignored explicit warnings about Madoff, the agency was further humiliated by the revelation that he'd been running a Ponzi scheme.
Some have criticized the emphasis on insider trading cases as a kind of quick fix to the S.E.C.'s battered image. ''Nonsense,'' says Khuzami, who joined the agency two months after the Madoff fiasco. But image actually is important; it's part of providing an effective deterrent. To an unusual degree, respect for insider trading laws depends on the visibility of enforcement. In a survey of 2,500 traders taken in 2007, more than half said they would take advantage of an illegal tip if they were assured they wouldn't be caught. Without S.E.C. enforcement, Wall Street would degenerate into a cesspool of conspiratorial tipping -- as it was before the agency existed. If you think that doesn't matter, ask yourself if you'd be comfortable investing in, say, Oracle, if Larry Ellison, its lavishly compensated C.E.O., were free to buy and sell the stock, and to clue in his friends, every time Oracle's sales took an unexpected but not yet public twist. By bringing cases and challenging hedge funds, the S.E.C. aims, at very least, to remind investors that insider trading isn't simply financial naughtiness -- it's a crime.
Over the past several months, I met with Khuzami and others at the S.E.C. and pored over some of the more controversial cases on the agency's docket. There is no question that the agency is pushing the boundaries, and the definition of insider trading was blurry to begin with. Linda Thomsen, Khuzami's predecessor, once remarked approvingly that ''the genius of insider trading law . . . is its flexibility.'' Though lawmakers have proposed legislation codifying insider trading in the statutes, the S.E.C. seems to prefer a common-law approach, on the theory that it will be a less fixed -- thus a more worrisome -- deterrent.
The courts have established that it is illegal to trade on ''material'' information in breach of a duty to keep the information private. The legal ambiguity arises on two fronts. First, the standard for ''material''-- any news that a trader would consider important -- is fuzzy enough to recall Potter Stewart's famously elusive definition (he would know it when he saw it) of pornography. Rumors and gossip circulate in the stock market every day; not all of it is ''material.'' Background information on an industry is clearly O.K. And it's fine to ask the manager of a local Best Buy about the store's iPod sales (this is called a channel check). Getting advance word on the entire chain's sales, however, could be a problem. In general, investors are allowed to assemble pieces of information that, viewed collectively, give them a fuller picture of the whole. But if any one of the mosaic pieces is, in itself, too revealing, the S.E.C. looks askance.
Second, the question of who has a duty to keep the material information private is not always clear. In one influential case in the 1980s, Barry Switzer, the University of Oklahoma football coach, was sued for buying stock in a company run by a team booster -- a company that was acquired shortly after he invested. At trial, Switzer claimed that he was sunbathing in the stands when he innocently overheard the booster describing the deal. Since the leak was inadvertent, the court ruled that Switzer did not have a duty not to trade.
One of the more contentious current cases also involves a sports mogul, Mark Cuban, the irreverent owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. A few years ago, Cuban was a big shareholder in a Canadian search engine, Mamma.com, which needed to raise cash. The company decided to offer stock to large investors at a discounted price; so in June 2004, according to the S.E.C.'s complaint, the chief executive of Mamma.com called Cuban and asked if he would like to participate. The C.E.O. supposedly prefaced his offer by telling Cuban he was about to impart confidential information. Typically, when such private placements are disclosed, the market price falls -- and for that reason, Cuban reacted angrily. At the end of the call, the S.E.C. claims, he snarled: ''This means I'm screwed. I can't sell.'' But hours later, he phoned his broker; the next day, he dumped his stake. When the private offering was announced, the stock plunged; Cuban's early sale saved him $750,000.
Cuban's behavior was exactly what the insider trading rules should prevent: a mogul profiting from privileged information. But it isn't clear that the rules do prevent it, at least in this case. The difficult part centers on Cuban's relationship with the Mamma.com chief executive. According to the S.E.C., at some point during their eight-minute phone call, Cuban acquired a duty not to trade. Cuban has denied that he agreed to keep the information about the offering private; even if he did agree, his lawyers argue, he would still have been free to trade, because he and the C.E.O. were not in a relationship of trust. A district court agreed and dismissed the complaint; on appeal, however, the decision was reversed. The case may now go to trial. Cuban, who has been fined nearly $1.7 million for yelling at basketball officials over the years, has, through his lawyers, cried foul against the S.E.C., which he accuses of ''a transparent plan to expand the scope of insider trading liability.'' The billionaire is said to be fuming and is considering making a movie about the case when it is done.
What the Cuban case is to the question of ''duty,'' the S.E.C.'s suit against the consummately ordinary Steffes family is to the definition of ''material.'' Last year, the S.E.C. charged six family members with tipping or trading on tips in advance of the 2007 leveraged buyout of Florida East Coast Industries. Two defendants were employees: Gary Griffiths, a former trainman who had risen to the executive position of chief mechanical officer; and his trainman nephew, Cliff Steffes. The two supposedly tipped other relatives; collectively, the family purchased $1.6 million in stock and options. What makes the case unusual is that the S.E.C. is not charging that either man was given an explicit tip. Rather, the complaint charges that a procession of pinstriped bankers took minibus tours of company facilities, that the tours gave rise to rumors of a deal among railyard workers and that Griffiths was asked to arrange a private tour for one group. Such circumstantial evidence gave them to ''know'' that a deal was in the works, or so contends the S.E.C. Thomas Bishop, the lawyer for Griffiths -- who, like Steffes, is fighting the charges -- says: ''This means anybody who works for a company possesses insider information. That's past the frontier of what the security laws are intending.''
The scale of the family's investment does suggest that they knew something was up. Yet few Americans would have dreamed they could get into trouble for drawing an inference based on observations at work. And until recently, they might not have. But the Florida East Coast case is the third of its kind in recent years. Whether it will hold up in court is another matter. Khuzami has already had some embarrassing setbacks on insider trading cases -- one against a Goldman director that was recently dropped and another, relating to credit-default swaps, that was dismissed by a federal judge. ''What the S.E.C. is doing,'' says Tom Gorman, a lawyer at Dorsey and Whitney, ''is changing the law.''
I met Khuzami on a Friday afternoon, when official Washington was heading out for the weekend. The son of ballroom dancers, he is 54, his hair tinged with gray, and has the kind of resume you often see in Washington: successful prosecutor in his 30s for the Southern District of New York, then a well-paid lawyer for Deutsche Bank. His seven-year stint in the private sector coincided with the years in which securities regulation was, at least in retrospect, too lax. He returned to government in 2009, with a goal of restoring the S.E.C.'s reputation for vigilance. He has nurtured a close relationship with Preet Bharara, the United States attorney who prosecuted Rajaratnam. The S.E.C. has at times seemed out of its element while handling complex mortgage cases, though lately it has been stepping up activity in that area. But insider trading cases are closer to its ken.
Khuzami scoffed at the notion, proposed to me by defense lawyers, that he is bringing ''gray area'' cases and noted that many of the S.E.C.'s targets took pains to hide their tracks. In other words, they knew they were doing wrong. ''People claim it's a trap for the unawares because they don't know where the line is drawn,'' Khuzami said. ''From where I sit, it's pretty clear. Insider trading requires intent.'' The traders often rationalize that intent, of course, by telling themselves that cheating is normal and not really so serious. A smattering of free-marketers defend insider trading as aiding market efficiency; except in extreme cases, they question whether it should be a crime at all. Unlike with, say, Ponzi schemes, you can't identify a victim who suffers a loss when someone profits from an illegal tip.
On a little reflection, though, that rationalization doesn't hold up. The American system of markets may get a lot wrong, but one thing it gets absolutely right is the principle of disclosure. This bedrock of U.S. markets was established in the 1933 Securities Act, and the S.E.C. was created, in 1934, largely to enforce a single proposition: that a corporation issuing securities to the public has to come clean about its financial results and outlook. Disclosure prevents corporations from duping investors. It's worth noting that disclosure, though a technical term in the context of securities, expresses a broader and distinctly American ideal -- that of openness. Governments and most institutions operate better in the sunlight; markets too. Since insiders have a duty of disclosure to people who buy their securities, the courts have ruled that executives who trade in their own stock while failing to disclose confidential information are committing fraud.
The traditional theory of insider trading applies to corporate insiders and other fiduciaries (even to executives' psychiatrists); it also covers traders who pay insiders for information or otherwise induce them to leak. Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur who pleaded guilty to securities fraud in the 1980s, was the classic case. But the traditional theory doesn't, by a long stretch, cover all of the behavior that the public would consider cheating. What happens, for instance, when a corporate outsider steals information? The law on that issue was, for years, unresolved. Then, in the '90s, James O'Hagan, a partner in a Minneapolis law firm, learned that a client of the firm was planning a bid for Pillsbury. O'Hagan bought options on Pillsbury and made a quick $4 million. His conviction was reversed under the theory that since his firm had no obligation to Pillsbury, he hadn't defrauded it. But in a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1997, the Supreme Court reinstated it. Stealing information, the court reckoned, was just that: stealing. The decision validated ''misappropriation theory,'' which holds that outsiders are guilty of securities fraud when they misappropriate confidential information ''in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information.'' This seems the right result: whether an executive trades on a secret or a lawyer steals the secret and trades on it makes little difference.
And without ''misappropriation theory,'' Khuzami's crusade against hedge funds would scarcely be possible.
Khuzami assured me he wasn't intent on ''slamming'' hedge funds, but he clearly sees them as breeding grounds for potential cheaters. ''People ask me, 'Is there more inside trading going on?' '' Khuzami said. ''Developments in the market'' -- he meant the growth of hedge funds -- ''suggest there might be. People are looking for any advantage.'' Hedge funds, he noted, command large sums of capital (in total, an estimated $2 trillion); many have contacts with well-placed Wall Street and corporate sources, and they operate hidden from public view (this will change somewhat as a result of the Dodd-Frank law, which will require medium- and large-size funds to register with the S.E.C.). Finally, the hedge fund business is immensely lucrative and fiercely competitive, which ratchets up managers' incentives to cheat.
In testimony to Congress, Khuzami said the S.E.C. was canvassing the industry for funds with ''aberrational performance,'' on the theory that above-average funds may be benefiting from tips. Khuzami went further at the hearing and declared that ''anybody who is beating market indexes by 3 percent and doing it on a steady basis'' could be a suspect. This pronouncement horrifies professional money managers, who rightly point out that there are plenty of ways of beating the market that don't involve cheating.
Khuzami and Bharara have advanced a theory that, for some minority of the hedge fund industry, trading on illegal tips has become a ''business model'' -- a routine aspect of doing business. In effect, they view insider trading as a white-collar version of organized crime.
This theory was years in the making. In 2005, the S.E.C. learned that, improbably, a retired seamstress in Croatia had bet big on Reebok stock just before the sneaker company announced a takeover. The seamstress turned out to be a front. The agency ultimately charged 17 people in a huge insider trading ring, prominently including Eugene Plotkin, a dashing ballroom dancer and Russian-born Goldman Sachs analyst. For Sanjay Wadhwa, a lawyer in the S.E.C.'s Manhattan bureau, the ''seamstress case'' was a new concept: inside trading as a group endeavor. It ''whetted our appetite,'' Wadhwa recalls.
Then, in August 2006, the S.E.C. got a tip about a New York hedge fund, Sedna Capital Management. Wadhwa was assigned to this case, too. Sedna was a small fund, but its manager, Rengan Rajaratnam, was the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam, the head of Galleon Group, a $7 billion fund. Born in Sri Lanka and educated at Wharton, the elder Rajaratnam kept an extensive network of business associates, many of whom were also South Asians. Since 2000, his fund outperformed its peers by a stunning eight percentage points a year. Wadhwa's focus began to shift to Raj, a gregarious, daring trader who reminded him of Plotkin.
When I met Wadhwa at a coffee bar near his office, he seemed upset by the agency's bad press and, perhaps for that reason, eager to tell me how they caught Rajaratnam. In 2007, the S.E.C. began an examination of Galleon, issuing subpoenas for its trading, telephone and bank records, its appointment calendars and e-mail. Wadhwa's interest was piqued by the cryptic tone of Rajaratnam's instant messages with Roomy Khan, a former Intel employee with extensive contacts in Silicon Valley. One, from Khan to Rajaratnam, urged the hedge fund magnate not to buy Polycom stock until she got ''guidance.'' Sensing the potential for a criminal case, the agency briefed lawyers at the Southern District, who agreed the case looked promising. Then, in March 2007, the S.E.C. received an anonymous letter on plain white paper claiming that Galleon traded tips in exchange for prostitution and ''other forms of illegal entertainment.'' The author hurled a taunting challenge at the regulators: ''It hurts my heart to see how these guys make monkeys out of individual investors, S.E.C. insider trading regulations and the attorney general's office.''
The S.E.C. could not identify the letter's author, nor did prostitution figure in the eventual charges. But that June, Rajaratnam trooped downtown to the S.E.C. for a formal deposition. The agency's lawyers asked about insider trading -- which he denied. Less than a month later, Hilton Hotels revealed that it was being acquired; Finra promptly notified the S.E.C. that Galleon had invested in Hilton before the news broke. Wadhwa was stunned by Rajaratnam's brass.
Two weeks later, Rajaratnam did it again: Galleon sold Google just before it announced disappointing earnings. In November, an F.B.I. agent visited Khan and asked if she would be willing to talk about Rajaratnam. Khan replied, ''What took you so long?'' In a bid for a reduced sentence, she agreed to be a cooperating witness. In interviews with the S.E.C. and prosecutors, she divulged the identity of numerous tippers and sketched a broad map of inside traders. Armed with Khan's proffer, prosecutors for the Southern District obtained the first of many wiretaps, which were crucial in winning convictions.
The Rajaratnam case exposed some of the elite of American business: an Intel executive, a former McKinsey partner, a married senior vice president of I.B.M. who was tipping his lover. The trial transcripts suggest a Wall Street subculture that is, in a word, rotten. The tipped information was plainly material; much of it amounted to brazen cheating. But it's unclear that Galleon is a template for the industry. The S.E.C. has yet to find another large hedge fund for which insider trading is a ''business model.'' It is known to be investigating SAC Capital Advisors, one of the country's biggest and most successful hedge funds. Since its inception in 1992, SAC has returned 29 percent a year. Steven A. Cohen, the founder, told me that the fund comes by its results without cheating; as compared with other funds, he says, SAC has more analysts (900 traders and support staff) and more-effective incentives to discourage losses, and it has magnified its returns with leverage. This is plausible, although his returns remain eye-catching. SAC's huge volume gives it privileged relationships with traders across Wall Street. At very least, it would be hard to argue that firms like SAC do not have an informational edge.
At least three traders who worked at SAC have pleaded guilty to using inside information while employed at other hedge funds. One, Noah Freeman, a Harvard grad who traded computer-chip stocks, testified that he also cheated while at SAC. There is no evidence that SAC knew this, and in fact, Freeman testified that he took pains to circumvent SAC's compliance policies. SAC eventually fired Freeman for poor performance.
Hedge fund managers are plainly frightened of becoming the next target. McDermott, Will & Emery, an international law firm, has warned its clients, ''Investment managers who outperform the market should be aware that the S.E.C. may soon come knocking.'' Compliance staffs of hedge funds are warning their traders to report information sources that might be a problem. Though information is central to what they do, fund managers are becoming sensitized to thinking about whether the information gleaned by their traders is, in fact, too good to use. One New York investor, explaining why he took a loss rather than sell a stock on which he had borderline information, said, ''The line on what is material is blurry.'' If traders who were not engaged in illegal behavior have stepped back from the line, I sensed that that was O.K. with Khuzami.
One sign of the S.E.C.'s impact is that hedge funds have sharply cut their use of so-called expert networks. These networks hire people with knowledge of specific industries to talk to traders. Networks serve a valid research function, but the potential for experts to cross the line into illegal tipping is plain. Six onetime employees at a Mountain View, Calif., network, Primary Global Research, have been indicted (Freeman was one of those). Since the scandal, business at networks is down by 40 percent, according to Integrity Research. No other network has been implicated, but if hedge funds and other traders have to be extra careful about how they do research -- even if an occasional borderline trade is ruled off limits -- it's a reasonable price for ensuring that markets are fair.
The real problem with the S.E.C.'s focusing on high-return funds is that it skates over the crucial distinction between short- and long-term investing. There are at least 8,000 hedge funds in the United States, and quite a few, like SAC, are engaged in rapid-fire trading -- basically trying to outguess the competition with regard to disclosures that will become public in a week or two anyway. Freeman, for instance, was obsessed with trying to outguess the Wall Street ''chatter'' and the ''whisper number'' (the predisclosure estimate of earnings). Absent some tip regarding forthcoming news, he had no value added and no edge. For investors working longer horizons the picture is different. Skillful, long-term investors can make money without tips, by analyzing information that is already public. Indeed, to someone holding a stock for years, a quarterly earnings tip would be of little use.
Society has an interest in genuine -- hopefully intelligent -- research, the kind that asks whether Google or Apple will be the more dominant business down the road or whether oil reserves will run short. But the sort of desperate hypertrading that was Freeman's specialty does not add to economic output or jobs or anything that matters. What it does do is ratchet up market volatility, contributing to the mind-numbing daily swings that send ordinary investors to the sidelines. Lately, thanks in part to that feverish trading, triple-digit market moves have become routine. The marked increase in volatility complicates the S.E.C.'s job considerably. When stocks jump or plummet in reaction to news, the payoff for those who trade on tips ahead of the news rises as well. Ferreting out who is prescient and who is crooked becomes more important than ever.
The Galleon case instilled fear in a lot of traders -- just as the Boesky-era cases did -- but the fear may have subsided somewhat. Especially in volatile markets, the temptation to cheat is fierce. A stiff sentence for Rajaratnam would reinvigorate the sense of a deterrent; on the other hand, a light penalty would make the lengthy, costly prosecution look like a waste. It would discourage future prosecutions and stoke the populist suspicion that no one on Wall Street ever really does time. The loser would be the public's faith in market integrity. And, as Khuzami notes, ''Who's going to trade if they think the game is rigged?''

HEADLINE: Fed Up With the Author of 'Fed Up!'?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
IN a flash, Rick Perry has gone from Republican front-runner to cycling domestique, riding in front of the pack and taking all the wind -- or in this case, hot air -- to allow the team leader to pedal in the slipstream.
In the debate on Thursday night in Florida, as Perry grew more Pinteresque, lapsing into long, paralyzed pauses, Mitt Romney grew less statuesque, breaking his marble mold and showing a new sarcastic streak. 
Romney unveiled his own version of Reagan's ''There you go again,'' repeatedly blowing off Perry with a smile and a ''Nice try.''
Slapping Perry for backtracking from his suggestion in his book ''Fed Up!'' that Social Security should be left up to states, Romney snidely noted, ''There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying'' that, ''so you'd better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.''
Romney, a champion flip-flopper, has painted Perry as a floppier flipper.
In the high school version of the 2008 Republican primary contest, Romney was regarded by John McCain and other contenders as the loathed hall monitor, prissy and hypocritical. It's not that he has gotten so much more popular or less plastic, although he has improved his performance. It's just that his rivals keep getting more implausible.
The only reason Perry got in the race in the first place was that Republicans yearned for an alternative to Romney. (This weekend, they were drunk-texting Chris Christie.) But for now, Perry is proving to be Romney's best asset.
Asked the 3 a.m. question by a moderator, Bret Baier of Fox News, what would a President Perry do if he got a call saying Pakistan had lost control of its nuclear weapons to the Taliban, the Texas governor offered a Palinesque meditation on ''the Pakistani country.''
''Well, obviously, before you ever get to that point, you have to build a relationship in that region,'' he said. ''And that's one of the things that this administration has not done. Just yesterday we found out through Admiral Mullen that Haqqani has been involved with -- and that's the terrorist group directly associated with the Pakistani country -- so to have a relationship with India, to make sure that India knows that they are an ally of the United States.'' But can he see the Taj Mahal from his house?
Romney used his new sarcasm on President Obama, too, claiming the Democrat takes his inspiration from the ''socialist democrats'' in Europe. ''Guess what?'' Romney said. ''Europe isn't working in Europe. It's not going to work here.''
He also poked the president on jobs: ''I happen to believe that to create jobs it helps to have had a job, and I have.''
Those are strong words from a candidate whose liability is that he made a living eliminating jobs.
In any other economy, working at Bain would be a bane to Romney's presidential craving because it's hard to trust a flip-flopper who's a company flipper. Romney himself has used the phrase ''creative destruction'' to describe what his former private equity firm, Bain Capital, excelled at: buying companies, restructuring and downsizing, and selling them for a profit.
As Howard Anderson of M.I.T. told The Washington Post's Karen Tumulty: ''Private equity is a little like sex. When it's good, it's very, very good. When it's bad, it's still pretty good.''
But in this economy, a predatory business plan from a man worth $200 million may not sound so bad. Especially now that the former community organizer is being limned as a president who was too naive and hesitant in handling the cascading crises of his first two years.
In ''Pretty Woman,'' Richard Gere played a financial shark who downsized companies; he wore expensive suits, went to polo matches and drove an expensive sports car. (No dog or hooker tied to the roof.) Romney, by contrast, is trying to downplay his downsizing fortune and his upgrading of his snazzy La Jolla beach house.
He makes sure everyone knows about his Carl's Jr. jalapeno chicken sandwiches and his Jet Blue middle seats. And he pushes the regular-guy image in tweets: ''Great deep-dish at @ginoseast''; ''Just got a Trim at Tommy's in Atlanta''; ''Thanks @subwayfreshbuzz for breakfast. Better than the usual campaign diet of morning donuts''; ''Thanks to the great @SouthwestAir crew for an easy flight.'' On Friday, his adviser Ron Kaufman tweeted a picture of the candidate in an airport terminal with his laptop on his lap, presumably tweeting more encomia to fast-food emporia.
Just as George Bush the elder, a Yalie, used to mock Michael Dukakis as part of the ''Harvard boutique,'' Willard Mitt Romney, a Harvard alum, in a speech in Florida on Thursday, mocked Obama as an elitist who hung out in the ''Harvard faculty lounge.''
For now, Romney is effectively using Perry as a whipping boy on issues that matter to conservatives, like illegal immigration. And when Perry attacks Romney as ''Obama lite,'' he could be doing Mitt a favor by reminding independents and Democrats that the Stormin' Mormon is a pseudo-conservative whom they can abide.
Authenticity can be overrated, especially in a rabid conservative.

HEADLINE: Speculators Get a Break In New Rule

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A LOAF of whole wheat. A gallon of gasoline. A pair of Levi's. Americans are paying more for many basic items this year, making tough economic times even tougher.
But these hardships for consumers provide another reason to check in on Dodd-Frank, that package of financial reforms that Congress passed in 2010. Here's why:
Congress told federal regulators to write rules that would ensure that Dodd-Frank does what it's supposed to do, which includes protecting consumers. But the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has proposed rules that critics say might actually encourage speculation in the commodities markets, rather than reduce it. 
Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, says that as things stand, the C.F.T.C.'s plan could cost ordinary Americans.
''Despite a clear directive from Congress to rein in excessive speculation, regulators still are listening too much to Wall Street and not acting quickly enough to protect American consumers,'' Mr. Nelson said last week.
Granted, prices of various commodities, including heating oil and gasoline, fell last week amid all the economic gloom. But that's no reason to give speculators a pass.
There are those who reject the notion that financial speculation has made commodity prices more volatile and even driven up prices in recent years. Some of them work for the C.F.T.C.
But Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School, says that a majority of academic studies on this issue -- from Texas A&M, Rice and Stanford -- demonstrate the ill effects of speculation on energy and food prices.
Indeed, a bipartisan report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 2009 concluded that there was ''significant and persuasive evidence'' that skyrocketing wheat prices reflected high levels of speculation in that market.
That report highlighted trading linked to commodities indexes and other financial instruments, a field that's exploded with the growth of commodity index investment funds.
''Dodd-Frank was intended to include these commodity index swaps with strict limitations on the participation of speculators in the commodities staples futures markets,'' Mr. Greenberger says. But the response from the C.F.T.C. ''is a horrifically weak rule.''
At the center of the debate are rules that would place a cap on how many financial contracts traders can accumulate for any given commodity. The idea is to prevent a small group from dominating an entire market.
The C.F.T.C. has proposed a limit of 25 percent of the deliverable supply of the underlying commodity. Mr. Nelson last week proposed a bill that would put that position limit at 5 percent of the deliverable supply. He says the C.F.T.C.'s limit is so high that it would encourage speculation and make markets more volatile.
The C.F.T.C. declined to comment, as the rule is still being considered.
Commodity index funds are big business. Such funds have attracted as much as $350 billion from investors in recent years. As such players have grown, the influence of commercial traders, like food producers and airlines that use the commodities markets to hedge against price swings, has declined. Hedging has gotten more expensive, and those higher costs have been passed on to consumers. Dodd-Frank determined that position limits were a solution to excessive speculation.
Mr. Nelson's bill, the Anti-Excessive Speculation Act of 2011, sets limits in energy contracts that would apply to speculators as a class of traders, aiming to cap the overall level of speculation in the market at its historic 25-year average. In the oil markets, speculative trading accounts for about half of all trading. He says his plan would reduce that figure to about 20 percent. He cited research showing that speculators may add $21 to $27 -- or about 25 percent at current prices -- to the price of a barrel of oil.
''This legislation aims to ensure that prices at the pump better reflect the true supply and demand for oil -- and not the activities of speculators,'' he says.
The C.F.T.C. proposal has drawn other criticism as well. It also would allow for greater position limits for commodities contracts that are settled for cash, rather than by physical delivery of the underlying goods. Most of these financial contracts trade on unregulated exchanges.
The proposal would let traders in cash-settled contracts hold five times the amount of contracts allowed for traders of physically settled versions in the final days of trading, or the so-called spot month. Traders employing this higher limit cannot participate in the market for the physically settled contracts.
That's a bad idea, according to the Commodity Markets Oversight Coalition, a group of commodities end-users including smallish heating oil companies in Vermont, New Mexico and Maine. In a comment letter to the C.F.T.C., the group said that because the spot month is when futures prices converge with the spot price of an underlying commodity, allowing five times the leverage in cash contracts at that time would probably increase volatility and costs for end users who are hedging.
''The adoption of the current proposed rulemaking will increase the threat of price manipulation, especially in the final days of trading,'' the group wrote, adding that Congress didn't intend to allow position limits to give favorable treatment to unregulated exchanges at the expense of regulated markets.
Interestingly, a recent enforcement action filed by the C.F.T.C. against several crude oil speculators seems to confirm the possibility for manipulation using outsize amounts of cash-settled contracts. Outlining the case filed last May against Parnon Energy, based in California, and its affiliate Arcadia Petroleum, which is based in London, the C.F.T.C. accused the companies of manipulating the market for crude oil in early 2008 using a combination of physically settled and financially settled contracts.
At the time the C.F.T.C. contended that the manipulation took place, there were market-imposed limits on the number of physically settled contracts a trader could hold but no caps on the cash-settled version. The scheme generated $35 million in improper profits, the C.F.T.C. said.
Parnon denied the C.F.T.C.'s accusations and is contesting them in federal court.
According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the collapse of the $10 billion Amaranth Advisors hedge fund in 2006 also involved manipulation conducted through a combination of cash-settled and physically delivered contracts, in that case, for natural gas. Once again, there were limits on the physical contracts but none on those settled for cash. The Energy Regulatory Commission settled with Amaranth Advisors in 2009 for $7.5 million.
The C.F.T.C. might still change its proposal. The commission is expected to vote by mid-October. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: Light Hand on Officeholders in Reporting Free Trips

BYLINE: By HUNTER CLAUSS. 
hclauss@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
While Mayor Rahm Emanuel prepares to release his 2012 city budget next month, Alderman Daniel Solis (25th Ward) will be bicycling in the Netherlands. But Mr. Solis will not be on a European vacation; he will be peddling amid the canals of Amsterdam on a study trip paid for by a bicycling advocacy group.
Mr. Solis revealed the trip on Twitter and said he would report the $2,000 gift on his aldermanic Web site, but nothing in the city's municipal code requires him to disclose the free travel. The travel disclosure rules that apply to Chicago's elected officials are far more lenient than the ethics laws for state and federal leaders, as well as for the politicians in many other major American cities. 
The city's ethics ordinance does not consider work-related trips to be gifts, though it does require that elected Chicago officials and some city employees report gifts worth more than $500 in annual financial disclosure statements. The gift restrictions do not cover ''reasonable hosting, including travel and expenses, entertainment, meals or refreshments furnished in connection with public events, appearances or ceremonies related to official city business, if furnished by the sponsor of such public event,'' the ordinance states.
Mr. Emanuel's push to reform City Hall and make it more transparent to the public has not touched on the issue of greater disclosure of privately financed trips. Tarrah Cooper, a spokeswoman for Mr. Emanuel, referred questions to Steven I. Berlin, the executive director of the city's Board of Ethics.
Mr. Berlin said in an e-mail to the Chicago News Cooperative that the ordinance ''has long been interpreted by the board'' to allow business travel paid for by nonprofit organizations.
Former Mayor Richard M. Daley took dozens of trips during his final years in office, many financed by groups including World Business Chicago, the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and the bid committee for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Chicago News Cooperative reported in December 2009 that Mr. Daley had visited Abu Dhabi on a trip organized by World Business Chicago earlier that year, shortly before that Persian Gulf emirate became a major investor in the privatization of Chicago's parking meters.
''Anything beyond reasonable travel -- i.e. anything beyond what's necessary to accomplish the business purpose of a trip -- would be considered a gift,'' Mr. Berlin wrote. ''Such 'gifts' might include golf greens' fees or entertainment that's not part of the public event.''
Mr. Berlin issued two advisory opinions in 2007 to unnamed aldermen who asked the ethics board about the propriety of accepting free overseas trips. In the case of an alderman who went on trips to Israel and China, Mr. Berlin replied that ''cultural and educational trips'' are not forbidden as long as the travel is not paid for by ''an anonymous donor or based on a mutual understanding that the recipients' City judgments or decisions would be influenced thereby.''
Many elected leaders in other cities face far stricter regulations requiring them to detail free travel that they accept.
In New York City, all elected and high-ranking officials are required to report trips worth more than $1,000 to the city's Conflicts of Interest Board if they are paid for by a nongovernmental entity. Wayne Hawley, a deputy executive director with the board, said he was not surprised that Chicago was behind New York on public disclosures.
''This stuff is a hodgepodge around the country,'' Mr. Hawley said. ''Frankly, it's mainly a function of what happened to get into the public's craw at one point or another.''
Members of Congress must publicly disclose trips they or their staff members take that are paid for by private organizations. While a congressman, Mr. Emanuel reported taking all-expenses-paid trips, including two visits to Los Angeles for appearances on HBO's ''Real Time with Bill Maher.''
Under the Illinois ethics act, traveling expenses are considered to be an ''honorarium,'' and state officials and employees must report any gifts and honorariums worth more than $500 on their statements of economic interest.
Alderman Solis said that the advocacy group Bikes Belong, based in Boulder, Colo., would pay for his trip to Amsterdam and that activists had not asked him to vote a certain way on any piece of legislation. He said the trip, which takes place as the expansion of Chicago bike lanes is becoming a political discussion, would be purely educational.
''My expectation is that we're going to learn their strategies and their practices that they have implemented in Amsterdam specifically, and make bike riding more popular and easier to happen across the city,'' Mr. Solis said.
Bikes Belong paid for two other City Council members, Joe Moreno (1st Ward) and Rey Colon (35th Ward), to go to Spain in March for a conference on bicycling. Last month, Mr. Colon gave a presentation on the trip during a council committee hearing on how to make the city more bike friendly.
Bruno Maier, the vice president of Bikes Belong, said the group had paid for trips for officials from across the country.
''None of this stuff is confidential,'' Mr. Maier said. ''For us, we're not telling them, 'Go back and implement X amount of bike trails.' ''

HEADLINE: Loan Ranger

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
On a hot summer day in Manaus, Brazil, Diana Taylor, the former banking superintendent of New York and longtime companion of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was strolling through a slum. A city of about two million in the middle of the Amazon, Manaus is where the Boston-based microfinance group Accion International started an ambitious lending operation in February, and Taylor, who is chairwoman of the group's board, had flown down with a delegation of staff and investors to observe how the experiment was coming along on the ground. Nearly six feet tall, thin and wearing large, round sunglasses, khaki pants and leather driving moccasins that had the kind of distressed effect only years of wear can produce, Taylor did not blend in.
But as pedestrians paused to stare, she neither reveled in the attention nor was fazed by it, instead noting details of the storefronts she passed: whether they had adequate signage, say, or were advantageously located in front of a bus stop. After two blocks, having passed four businesses bearing stickers with Accion's logo - indications that the owners had taken out loans - Taylor stopped in front of a cellphone supply kiosk. ''These are really smart,'' she said, pointing to a sticker in the shop's window. ''We should have them everywhere!'' 
With some 30 affiliates in 23 countries, Accion is among the biggest organizations that do microlending - that is, make small loans to the poor as an antipoverty strategy. It is also one of the oldest; this year is the group's 50th anniversary. But in the large and varied constellation of microfinance groups, it is most known for developing and promoting a profit-making approach to the work. The commercial model worries factions of the microfinance world that find a for-profit drive at odds with a mission to lift the poor out of poverty. It does not worry Taylor, who, despite a mild distaste for the limelight - and increasing scrutiny of all microlending - is quietly emerging as one of its most influential proponents.
''The hope is that we can test it here and really prove that it can be done,'' Taylor said. We were in a van on our way to visit more clients, ''microentrepreneurs'' in the parlance, across town. ''Then we can attract more capital.'' So far, she seemed pleased. There were Accion billboards at key intersections, a truck with a sound system affixed to its roof blasting an Accion ad, and, in one outdoor market, an Accion jingle playing over a loudspeaker. Of the dozen or so clients she had met with - fruit vendors, seamstresses, seafood sellers - most said they hoped to take out another loan.
Taylor wound down the afternoon at Salon Pop Star, a barbershop on the edge of town that had been renovated with money from an Accion loan. As she had been with all the clients that day, she was warm and engaging with the salon's owner, Levistone Melo, 29. He answered her questions between snips of a customer's hair: his loan was for $1,000 and carried a monthly interest rate of 3.8 percent; he had a year to pay it off; with it, he purchased a second barber chair and better hair products, installed a bathroom and hired an employee; he estimated that he had seen a 50 percent uptick in business.
After nearly half an hour, Taylor glanced at the mirror and ran a hand through her own hair. ''The weather here is so damp, my hair needs a lot of work,'' she said. Having finished with his customer, whose hair was cropped into blunt, angular lines that would meet army grooming standards, Melo motioned for Taylor to have a seat in the barber chair. She flashed a broad smile, then waved away the offer. ''I'm fine, thank you.''
Diana Taylor grew up in Old Greenwich, Conn., with all the usual old-money trappings - skiing, sailing, rowing crew and playing tennis and lacrosse. Though her great-grandfather, an investment banker, helped finance the Spence School, she attended Milton Academy and then Dartmouth, graduating with a degree in economics. She went on to a dual-degree program in business and public health at Columbia but left with only the M.B.A. portion to take a job as an investment banker at Smith Barney. Midcareer, she decided to try government work and held various positions in the Pataki administration. She met Bloomberg in 2000 at a lunch, where the two were seated next to each other. At a dinner the following night, ''I looked up at one point and Mike was looking at me, so I waved at him. He asked me out for a drink afterwards, and that was that.''
It was during her stint as superintendent of banks, from 2003 to 2007, that she took an interest in why some people were left out of the banking system altogether. It was hard not to notice a correlation, she said, between a map of the city's poor, minority populations and a map of the so-called unbanked. She started a program to give incentives to banks to open branches in these areas (Bedford-Stuyvesant, East Harlem), with some success. In part to better understand development economics, in 2005, during Bloomberg's re-election bid, she decided to finish the degree she'd started years before at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, cramming for exams in the back of the campaign bus.
Around the same time, the United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit. ''I didn't know very much about microfinance at all,'' she said, ''except that it was this thing where you make very small loans to very poor people and they build businesses, and I thought that sounded like a really good idea.'' Taylor went to several United Nations-sponsored events and found that the premise of microfinance - that the poor are often ingenious handlers of money, but merely face obstacles to saving money and growing businesses - spoke to her.
''It's absolutely astounding how enterprising people are,'' she said at a lunch meeting in Manaus. The 40 or so staff members, investors and other assorted ''Accionistas'' had gathered at the organization's first Manaus branch, a sun-filled storefront. A line of prospective borrowers was forming nearby. ''The ability to smooth out consumption when your income is very wobbly, and to figure out how to store value when you have no bank, is very sophisticated.''
Taylor first became involved with Accion shortly after meeting Maria Otero, then the president and C.E.O. (Otero is now Hillary Clinton's under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs.) Started in 1961 as a student-run volunteer program in the shantytowns of Caracas, Accion had been issuing microloans since 1973 and urging commercialization of the movement since the 1990s. (An Accion affiliate, BancoSol in Bolivia, became the first private commercial bank dedicated to microfinance in 1992.) Taylor agreed with Otero's view that the only way microfinance could ever help largenumbers of people - could achieve ''scale'' in industry-speak - was by tapping capital markets. They became fast friends.
''She not only understood and cared a great deal about it, she had a remarkable ability to straddle the world of high finance and the needs of the poor,'' Otero said. ''I was completely taken with the clearness and earnestness of her approach, but also the power she brought.'' In 2006, Otero asked Taylor to join Accion's board. ''She accepted immediately.''
Microfinance was having a moment. Investments in the sector were doubling; Bill Clinton and Natalie Portman were singing its praises; and Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and co-winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in microlending, was predicting that by 2030 there would be ''poverty museums.''
Though Taylor earned a reputation as a rigorous watchdog, opposing a 2004 decision that allowed banks to evade state supervision and warning of dubious loan products, she stepped down as bank superintendent in 2007, joined a private investment firm and took on more at Accion. ''I saw in her a woman leader, a woman who had operated so effectively in a world of men,'' Otero said. ''She dealt with bankers nonstop and navigated all of it with a manner that was not only not brusque and abrasive, but the opposite.''
On the trip to Manaus, Taylor wielded her influence subtly and seemed determined to deflect credit for what staff and investors described as a key role in obtaining licenses to open the northern Brazil branch. The process took three years and ultimately required an approval from President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The closest she came to acknowledging her part was during opening remarks she delivered on the first day, when she allowed that she had met with the minister of finance and ''tried desperately'' to get the O.K.
Taylor became chairwoman of Accion's board in June 2009. She joined the board of Citigroup that same summer, and it seems no accident that a key subsequent Accion hire came from the bank. When Hillary Clinton tapped Otero, Otero's position was filled by Michael Schlein, Citigroup's president of international franchise management. The microfinance sector continued to grow, despite - and in some places because of - the widening credit crisis. The total volume of microloans rose from $8.5 billion in 2003 to $71 billion in 2009, and investment in the sector grew from $1.4 billion in 2003 to $19.5 billion in 2009, according to M.I.X. (Microfinance Information Exchange).
But by the end of 2010, a backlash of opinion had taken firm hold. A few studies, notably one led by M.I.T.'s Esther Duflo and others, concluded that benefits for microfinance borrowers were real but modest at best. Lenders from Bangladesh to Nicaragua had come under scrutiny. In Andhra Pradesh, one of India's largest states, many borrowers stopped repaying their loans, and more than 80 people there committed suicide after defaulting. In an op-ed in The New York Times in January, Muhammad Yunus blamed commercialization. ''Poverty should be eradicated,'' he wrote, ''not seen as a moneymaking opportunity.''
The critics of microfinance might be said to fall into two categories: those who feel it does some good, just not all that its most fervent proselytizers claim it does; and those who feel it does borrowers harm. The first group is inclined to see the backfire as an inevitable result of the overselling of microfinance's promise, and to feel that, in whipping up so much hype, microlenders have in a sense been their own worst enemy. This is not a take that Taylor disputes. (''There is no silver bullet for poverty alleviation,'' she told me.) The second group tends to point to the situation in India and say that microlenders, with their necessarily high cost of services, cannot but sink borrowers into debt. Where Yunus faults the profit motive, arguing that it will lead inexorably to ''mission drift,'' Taylor contends that the solution is strong regulation, not abandonment of commercial microfinance. ''There are ways to abuse the microfinance system, just like there are ways to abuse the mortgage system,'' she said. ''The solution is not to ban mortgages.''
Coming on the heels of the backlash, the three-day trip at times took on the feel of a pep rally. One evening, the Accion delegation gathered for dinner in an ornate banquet hall. As a Brazilian band played Beatles covers, an elegantly dressed wait staff served steak and Champagne. The president and C.E.O., Michael Schlein, stood at a microphone and told of Ana Ferreira, one of the first borrowers in Manaus. Before her loan, Ferreira, a seamstress, spent mornings buying as much fabric as she could afford, which was enough for one afternoon of work. With the loan, she could buy fabric in bulk, freeing up her mornings and allowing her to double her productivity. ''It's so simple,'' Schlein said.
Toward the end of the night, a troupe of dancers wearing feather headdresses, bikinis and loincloths performed, drawing guests from their seats for samba lessons. Among those coaxed into shimmying on the floor were Taylor, Schlein and Livy Parsons, Accion's C.F.O. ''This happens a lot at Accion,'' said Bruce MacDonald, an Accion spokesman. ''Every time we have a ceremony, there's native dancing involved.'' When the music ended, Parsons ambled over to the sidelines. ''Well, next time I'm approached by 15 people in Amazonian dress, I'll know just what to do,'' he said, wiping his brow. ''That never happened to me in banking.''
In part because of her prescient moves as banking superintendent, Taylor is increasingly seen as a potential political candidate. She has been approached about running for office by Republican lawmakers and operatives, who have described her variously as a ''perfect candidate,'' a ''shoo-in'' and a ''grand-slam home run.'' Unusually, her appeal extends to the other side of the aisle, and beyond. (Speaking at an Accion event in Ghana, Bono once teased, ''Diana, you know how I feel about you. But don't tell the mayor.'')
For her part, Taylor has signaled an interest in politics, considering both a nomination to head the F.D.I.C. in 2006 and a campaign for United States Senate in 2010, but these days seems decidedly averse to a position on the federal side. Over breakfast in Manaus, I asked about her decision not to run against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand last year. ''You run, and then you either give an acceptance or concession speech. I thought, Concession speech? Easy. Acceptance speech? Not so much.'' Why? ''Because then you have to go to Washington!'' She went on, ''If I were to run for something, it would be something in New York, on the executive side.''
On a nearby table sat a newspaper that had a photo of Taylor - ''la primeira-dama de Nova York'' - next to an article on the Manaus operation. On the now unlikely prospect that she might find herself first girlfriend of the United States, she had this to say: ''I think he'd be a really good president, but personally, it would be horrible. I told Mike the No. 1 reason he couldn't run for president is I wouldn't be able to swear on the golf course anymore.''
Later that morning, Taylor joined the others for a boat ride up the Amazon, past pink dolphins and flooded tree canopies to the confluence of the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes, where the two tributaries meet but do not mix, forming a stark line between dark and sand-colored waters. ''I have something to add,'' she said. ''Microfinance is about helping people help themselves, about helping people think of themselves as productive human beings who have some merit to society. What's the message of a subsidy? That you have nothing to give. This approach says, 'You don't have to just sit there in abject poverty and take it.' '' Not long later, the boat docked and Taylor and a few staff members boarded a bus, which took them to her jet for the flight back to New York.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Small Donors Slow to Return To Obama Fold

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Kitty Bennett and Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They were once among President Obama's most loyal supporters and a potent symbol of his political brand: voters of moderate means who dug deep for the candidate and his message of hope and change, sending him $10 or $25 or $50 every few weeks or months.
But in recent months, the frustration and disillusionment that have dragged down Mr. Obama's approval ratings have crept into the ranks of his vaunted small-donor army, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to rekindle grass-roots enthusiasm for his re-election bid.
In interviews with dozens of low-dollar contributors in the past two weeks, some said they were unhappy with what they viewed as Mr. Obama's overly conciliatory approach to Congressional Republicans. Others cited what they saw as a lack of passion in the president, or said the sour economy had drained both their enthusiasm and their pocketbooks.
For still others, high hopes that Mr. Obama would deliver a new kind of politics in his first term have been dashed by the emergence of something that, to them, more resembles politics as usual. 
''When I was pro-Obama in 2008, I was thinking of him as a leader who could face the challenges that we were tackling,'' said Adnan Alasadi, who works in behavioral health in Mesa, Ariz. Mr. Alasadi contributed repeatedly to Mr. Obama during his first campaign but says he will not give the president -- or anyone else -- any more money.
''Now I am seeing him as just an opportunistic politician,'' Mr. Alasadi said.
Such defections are not merely symbolic. About a quarter of Mr. Obama's record haul during the 2008 cycle came from donors giving $200 or less, supporters who could be tapped again and again without hitting federal contribution limits. Many of those same people were also volunteers in his campaign, knocking on doors, calling friends and neighbors and helping turn out the voters that fall.
Nadine Kurland, 62, of Falling Waters, W.Va., made over a dozen contributions to Mr. Obama during the 2008 election and also made phone calls on his behalf. But when an e-mail arrived recently inviting her to an Obama-themed get-together, she ignored it.
''I have been very disappointed in the president,'' Ms. Kurland said. ''He has not stood up to the Republicans.''
Unhappiness with Mr. Obama can be found even among the supporters his team recruited to appear in campaign materials.
When Mr. Obama formally announced his re-election bid in April, his campaign released a video featuring supporters from swing states like Colorado and Michigan. One of them was Edward Blair, a 65-year-old lawyer from North Carolina, who sent a half-dozen checks to Mr. Obama during the last campaign and knocked on doors in his hometown, Lenoir, but has not given him money this year.
''What I said in that video was I didn't agree with Obama on everything, but I respected him and trusted him,'' Mr. Blair said in a recent interview. But Mr. Obama's decision this month to abandon stricter new smog regulations, Mr. Blair said, had renewed his worries about the president's ability to lead.
''I certainly respect him, and I trust him,'' Mr. Blair said. ''But I am disappointed, and I'm bewildered.''
Compared with his Republican rivals, Mr. Obama remains in an enviable position. No Republican candidate for president has built a grass-roots fund-raising machine as formidable or sophisticated as his.
Through June 30, the close of the most recent campaign reporting period, more than 552,000 people had contributed to Mr. Obama's re-election effort, according to campaign officials. Half of them were new donors, and nearly all of them gave contributions of less than $250.
But those figures obscured another statistic: a vast majority of Mr. Obama's past donors, who number close to four million, have not yet given him any money at all.
The campaign is still in its early stages, and the president is likely to show far stronger numbers than any Republican when the candidates report their third-quarter fund-raising early next month. But his recent political difficulties -- a protracted battle over raising the national debt limit, sagging approval ratings -- have raised questions about whether he will be able to sustain his fund-raising momentum.
''He did not articulate either to the Republicans that he was negotiating with or to the American people a strong stance for what we feel the Democrats believe in,'' Theodore Weiss, 77, a retired federal employee in Florida, said of the debt negotiations.
While he was impressed with Mr. Obama's recent jobs speech, Mr. Weiss said, he will not send Mr. Obama any checks this year. Instead, he said, he will use that money to help out his two sons, a teacher and a small-business owner, both of whom are struggling in the economic downturn.
Aides to Mr. Obama said the campaign was well ahead of its 2008 benchmarks. That year, Mr. Obama did not reach one million total donors until February, about a month after he won the Iowa caucuses.
A campaign spokesman said that the number of people who had given more than once to Mr. Obama this year and the number of people who had contributed for the first time were both higher than his total number of donors at the same point in 2007.
Many of the donors interviewed said they were pleased with the president's performance, or blamed Republicans in Congress for his difficulties.
''I am happy with him,'' said Christine Carvajal, 45, a teacher in Pittsburgh who made several small contributions in 2008. ''I just feel like the Congress is completely obstructing him.''
Some said they would like to give Mr. Obama money but had not done so simply because they could no longer afford to make political contributions.
''Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to contribute anything,'' said Judyann Allen, a retiree in Covington, Wash., who added that she and her husband were living month to month. ''I would if I could. But I can't afford to give anything to anyone.''
This month, the Obama campaign is staging a ''Grass-roots Fund-Raising Challenge,'' a contest for Obama supporters who have set up fund-raising Web sites for him, with the goal of raising 20,000 contributions by the end of September.
Mr. Obama has also provided ''grass-roots fund-raising tips'' on his Twitter feed. ''Make a hard ask,'' one entry read. ''Be clear about what you want and when you need it.''
And Mr. Obama's campaign is deploying volunteers to contact all his past supporters one by one, in part to ensure that they have a chance to voice any concerns or criticisms they may have. The campaign also plans to roll out an initiative that will provide donors with real-life examples of how the campaign is spending their dollars to build a field operation in critical states.
But some of Mr. Obama's supporters, echoing concerns expressed by many Democrats in polls, said they were less interested in what he would do with their contributions than in seeing him play tougher.
''There has been less passion than I might have hoped for,'' said Andra Bohnet, a musician and professor in Mobile, Ala., who sent Mr. Obama five checks in 2008. ''I think that in some ways, they have been too conciliatory.''
Asked whether she would give to him again, Ms. Bohnet paused.
''Now, I think I'll wait and see,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Economic Reforms Likely to Continue Under Putin

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- During his two terms as president, Vladimir V. Putin muscled a new kind of capitalism onto the Russian stage, blending government and private business, jailing tycoons and demanding control of the ''commanding heights'' of the economy, the petroleum companies that now pump more oil than Saudi Arabia.
As Mr. Putin announced his intentions on Saturday to run for a third term, economists were not expecting Russia to swivel sharply back to such policies, in what would be yet another shift between state control and privatization in the country's recent economic history. 
Russia has already embarked on reforms under his successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to diversify away from oil dependence and foster a high-technology sector, in all likelihood with Mr. Putin's blessing.
This is not because of any discernible change in Mr. Putin's economic beliefs, but because the profits from oil and other exports can no longer sustain the rising living standards that have underpinned his leadership and the rollback of democratic institutions.
Over the next decade, oil output in Russia is projected to be flat, at about 10 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, rising demand for consumer goods will outpace Russia's ability to pay for them, opening a current account deficit by about 2014.
Then Russia, like the United States, will rely on foreign lending to finance a trade deficit. In a speech on Friday, also at the congress of his United Russia Party, Mr. Putin hinted at the changes that make a return to the ''Putinomics,'' or state capitalism, of his first two terms unlikely.
''The task of the government is not only to pour honey into a cup, but sometimes to give bitter medicine,'' he said. ''This should always be done openly and honestly, and the overwhelming majority of people will understand the government.''
Just last week, the ruble fell against the dollar to its lowest point this year, compelling the Central Bank to intervene by selling foreign currency reserves. In last week's stock market swoon, the Russian MICEX index plunged more sharply than exchanges in Europe and the United States. Longer term, Russia will struggle with federal budget and trade deficits, and with them deepening reliance on foreign investors, including from Western countries, like ExxonMobil, which last month announced a deal to explore for oil in Russia's sector of the Arctic Ocean.
''Russians will continue down the road of privatization and diversification away from oil, not because they like to, but because they will be forced to,'' Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist for Renaissance, a Moscow investment bank, said in a telephone interview.
Chris Weafer, the chief equity strategist at Troika Dialog Bank, went further in a research note published after Mr. Putin's announcement, suggesting the former K.G.B. agent was now likely to recast himself as an economic reformer. ''I expect Putin will establish a very pro-business and pro-reform cabinet,'' Mr. Weafer said.
Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington, writing before the announcement on Saturday, said of Mr. Putin that ''even if he is not as fully committed to change as others,'' he might be Russia's best chance to weather a decline in oil output because he ''can get initiatives implemented.''
Many Russians still associate Mr. Putin with the end of the economic depression that cast millions into penury in the 1990s.
During his time in power, Mr. Putin, who has a graduate degree in economics from the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, seesawed between reforms hailed by liberal economists -- like a flat income tax -- and policies verging on Soviet-style command management.
As far back as 1999, in a thesis and an academic article, he laid out his view that natural resources could revive Russia's economic fortunes after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but only with a strong state hand. In the article, published in an obscure mining industry journal, he wrote that Russia should form vast new, state-controlled conglomerates to compete with Western multinationals, the policy that he put into place over the next decade.
Rosneft, the state oil company, and Gazprom, the natural gas giant, bulked up on assets bought from the private sector. Gazprom, for a time, was the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization.
''Analysis of the economic processes taking place in the world demands all possible state support for creating strong financial-industrial corporation,'' Mr. Putin's article said. ''Such corporations will be capable of competing on equal terms with Western multinational corporations.''
Mr. Putin's critics have pointed out that insiders benefited along with the state, leading to the rise of a new class of ultrawealthy bureaucrats among the security service officials and former St. Petersburg city government functionaries who moved to Moscow with Mr. Putin a decade ago.
Under Mr. Medvedev, in contrast, the government announced a plan to privatize $10 billion in state assets annually for five years to draw in Western capital and expertise during the global financial crisis. Under his watch, the economic pendulum swung back toward reform. The authorities drastically reduced the number of enterprises considered strategic and off limits to foreign investment and came close to negotiating Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Oil and natural gas constitute 17 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, but taxes on these resources make up 44 percent of the federal budget.
As Siberian oil production declines, new sources must be developed. To allow for vast capital outlays, new, lower taxes on the industry take effect next month, further diminishing the government's share.
On Saturday, Mr. Putin suggested raising taxes on the rich.
During his first term as president, Mr. Putin implemented a flat, 13 percent income tax that improved collection. The new proposal would not raise income tax but increase consumption and estate taxes on the wealthy.
''We won't be able to grow the economy by simply increasing oil production anymore,'' Aleksei L. Kudrin, the finance minister, said in an interview this year. ''More complicated work is ahead of us.''

HEADLINE: The Solyndra 'Panic': One company's failure should not deter robust public investments in clean energy

 BODY:
In August, Solyndra, a California-based solar panel maker, announced it would file for bankruptcy. The collapse cost 1,100 workers their jobs and American taxpayers $535 million in loan guarantees that Solyndra had received under a Congressionally authorized program to encourage young companies to develop clean-energy technologies.
President Obama had hailed Solyndra as a model investment and the face of ''a brighter and more prosperous future.'' Republicans have now pounced on the bankruptcy as proof that the loan program is a bust, that the president's signature green jobs program is a fraud, and that this country's solar energy business is in terminal decline. 
None of that is true. Solyndra made a bad bet, investing heavily in a new type of solar array just as the price of silicon, the main ingredient in competitors' solar cells, was dropping. Its demise should not spell the end of federal investment in the alternative fuels and energy sources that are critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, easing this country's dependence on fossil fuels and keeping it competitive in the race for clean-energy jobs.
The United States, which three years ago led the world in investments in clean energy, has now fallen behind China and Germany, which provide far more generous subsidies. The failure of a single company -- and anyone who knows anything about transformative technologies knows there will be failures -- is no reason to stop our efforts to catch up.
There are important issues here that need a hard look. The Justice Department is investigating whether Solyndra was upfront about its problems with investors. A House committee is asking whether the company's loan application was hurried along by Obama officials so that the White House could trumpet its job creation efforts.
The administration claims to have exercised due diligence and seems to have been forthcoming in responding to Congress. The company has been decidedly less so; two senior executives, citing the Justice Department inquiry, took the Fifth Amendment when they appeared before a Congressional committee on Friday.
It is also important to note where some of the loudest criticism is coming from: House Republicans who want to undermine the president, belittle global warming and discredit clean fuels. Their agenda was on full display Thursday at a hearing led by Darrell Issa called ''How Obama's Green Energy Agenda Is Killing Jobs.''
The proceedings mainly consisted of Representative Issa and others asserting that money spent on environmentally friendly fuels and jobs would be much better spent on ''domestic carbon-based resources'' -- that is, dirtier fuels like oil, gas and coal. What was not mentioned was that at least 10 of the 23 Republicans on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- including Mr. Issa -- have lobbied the Department of Energy to approve green projects in their own districts.
The truth of the matter is that when judged by its diverse portfolio, the loan program appears, at least so far, to have performed well. The Solyndra investment represents less than 2 percent of nearly $40 billion in loan guarantees for about three dozen innovative projects. Some of them -- advanced automobile battery projects, for instance -- have provided thousands of much-needed jobs in Michigan and other recession-battered states.
As for the supposedly doomed solar industry, Solyndra and three other smaller failed companies that were not part of the federal program represented about one-fifth of the nation's manufacturing capacity for solar panels. But highly competitive companies remain, and in many sectors, including sales of silicon, the United States dominates. Mr. Issa to the contrary, jobs in the solar industry have doubled to roughly 100,000 since 2003.
Recent studies suggest that, globally, renewable energy will grow faster than any other energy source in the coming decades. The surest way to guarantee that America gets its fair share of that business and those jobs would be to enact a comprehensive energy strategy that raises the price of older, dirtier fuels. Failing that, continued government support is absolutely essential.

HEADLINE: Putin Once More Moves to Assume Russia's Top Job

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Reporting was contributed by Michael Schwirtz, Olga Slobodchikova and Seth Mydans from Moscow, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, who transformed post-Soviet Russia by imposing Kremlin control over most aspects of public life, moved on Saturday to return to the presidency and could remain until 2024, giving him a rule comparable in length with that of Brezhnev or Stalin.
President Dmitri A. Medvedev announced at a party convention in Moscow that he would step aside for Mr. Putin, who served as president from 2000 to 2008 but was limited by the Constitution to two consecutive terms. Mr. Medvedev is to take his place as prime minister after presidential elections in March that Mr. Putin is assured of winning.
At the announcement, wave upon wave of applause washed over the hall, where 11,000 members of Mr. Putin's party, United Russia, had gathered. Mr. Medvedev's face was projected on a giant screen above the stage, and he gave a flickering smile as the crowd roared, rose and swung its attention away from him toward Mr. Putin, who was sitting in the audience. 
The move brings an end to years of uncertainty, inside and outside Russia, about whether Mr. Putin intended to loosen his grip on power. Neither leader offered any reason for the decision, but Mr. Putin said the deal had been made years ago. If that is true, Mr. Medvedev's presidency, and the tension that accompanied its end, now looks like an orchestrated political drama that drew in much of the world.
''I want to say directly: An agreement over what to do in the future was reached between us several years ago,'' Mr. Putin said. Mr. Medvedev also said there had been no conflict, though his account was less definitive.
''What we are recommending to the convention, it is a deeply thought-out decision,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''Moreover, we really discussed this possible turn of events at the time when we formed our comradely union.''
The change casts uncertainty on the future of the so-called reset in relations between the United States and Russia, which benefited from an easy rapport between Mr. Medvedev and President Obama. But a senior Obama administration official played down such concerns on Saturday, saying that American officials ''have very deliberately sought to avoid playing favorites.''
''Everyone knows that Putin runs Russia,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Remembering this obvious fact means that Putin has supported the reset with the U.S.''
As the news filtered into the street, most Russians expressed little surprise. Mr. Putin's rise to power accompanied an oil-fueled rise in income, and most Russians feel no nostalgia for the chaotic political pluralism of the 1990s. Opposition to Mr. Putin's government is growing, however, in places like Moscow, whose residents get information from the Internet and are less dependent on government social payments.
''I don't know what feelings I have about it because on one hand, it seems like we don't have any alternative, we have to accept that Putin will be president,'' said Yulia Belova, an advertising manager. Ivan V. Chaikin, 71, was similarly philosophical, saying his own hopes for democratic reform had withered a decade ago.
''They decided between themselves who will hold which job,'' he said. ''It's like a swap in chess -- my bishop for your rook.''
There is little evidence that the change will portend dramatic policy shifts.
Mr. Medvedev has called for political and judicial reforms that would decentralize power away from the Kremlin, and his rhetoric won him the backing of many in the West and in progressive circles. But he was widely viewed as a weak executive whose initiatives were subject to veto by Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin, meanwhile, has signaled in recent months that he may restyle himself as an economic reformer, wrapping himself in the mantle of the tsarist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin.
In his speech on Saturday, he proposed raising some taxes on the rich and addressed problems that had been considered Mr. Medvedev's territory.
''We must speak openly about the dependence of our economy on raw materials, about the dangerous level of social inequality, violence, corruption, about the feeling of injustice and vulnerability that people feel when they are dealing with government bodies, courts, and law enforcement,'' Mr. Putin said.
''All this, unfortunately, continues,'' he said. ''We can and must overcome these problems.''
Mr. Putin's embrace of reform may prove unconvincing to international investors, who have expressed wariness over conditions for business in Russia. A common complaint is that Mr. Putin's rule hollowed out the country's institutions, so that even major deals hinge on personal relationships with the country's leaders.
Mr. Putin is expected to face painful and unpopular decisions over the coming years as oil production levels off and the rise in Russians' standard of living slows. In 2014, when imports of consumer goods is projected to exceed oil production, the government will find itself increasingly dependent on foreign investment.
The governing United Russia Party has been gradually losing popularity, dropping 9 points since January, according to the Public Opinion Foundation. And back-to-back elections -- for Parliament in December and president in March -- neither of which offers an alternative to the current government, will strain the state's coffers and voters' patience.
But those concerns did not dampen the holiday atmosphere at Saturday's convention, or the satisfaction of Mr. Putin's fans.
''When else in Russian history has the highest power in the state been handed over so peacefully, so worthily, so honestly, and in such a friendly way?'' said Archpriest Vsevolod Chaplin, a top official in the Russian Orthodox Church, in comments carried by the Interfax news service.
This achievement, he said, ''can be envied not only by our forbears and people who lived in the Soviet time, but citizens of most of the world's countries, including those who try to teach us.''
Mr. Putin is by far the country's most popular politician, and he is likely to face only token competition in the March election, given the complete marginalization of any opposition parties. One of Mr. Medvedev's first acts as president was to extend the term to six years, meaning that Mr. Putin could serve for up to 12 years. If that carries through, he will have been Russia's pre-eminent leader for more than 24 years, putting him in the same category as two of the Soviet Union's definitive leaders: Leonid Brezhnev, in power for 18 years at the height of the cold war; and Josef Stalin, who kept a grip on power for roughly 30 years.
Over recent months, Mr. Putin, who turns 59 in October, has left little question that he intended to remain the dominant partner in Russia's ''ruling tandem,'' making televised appearances on a Harley-Davidson, deep-sea-diving and engaging in soulful dialogue with ordinary people. After Mr. Medvedev delivered a major speech in Yaroslavl this month, the analyst Lilia Shevtsova, of the Moscow Carnegie Center, titled her blog post on the subject ''The Last Act of the Play.''
''How difficult it has become for Medvedev to fill the time,'' she wrote. ''It was not long ago that he practically reveled in his function. He clearly believed in its seriousness. But now the moment has come when it became clear -- he has to get his things together.''
Mr. Medvedev had developed a circle of supporters during his presidency, and there was palpable disappointment from those people on Saturday. One of Mr. Medvedev's closest aides, Arkady V. Dvorkovich, vented via Twitter during the United Russia event, remarking, first, ''there is no reason for celebration,'' and then ''now it is time to switch to the sports channel.'' The influential political consultant Gleb O. Pavlovsky, whose longstanding contract with the Kremlin was severed this spring, gave one of the sharpest comments.
''The fact that the president, as a politician, betrayed those who believed in him -- that is political self-annihilation, and he has the right to do it,'' Mr. Pavlovsky told the radio station Ekho Moskvy. He called the move ''a blow to the prestige of the institution of the presidency in Russia.''
Various political experts questioned Mr. Putin's assertion that the decision was long since set in stone. The economist Mikhail G. Delyagin, a former government aide, said Mr. Medvedev had ''exhibited a degree of independence,'' and, if elected to a second term, could have tried ''to become a real president and not a technical one.''
''I know that Putin and Medvedev had to clarify their agreement several times and that at times these conversations were difficult,'' said Mr. Delyagin, director of the Institute of Globalization Issues. ''There were moments where there was absolutely a sense that Medvedev spat on this agreement and tried to play his own game. But in the end he turned out to be weak.''

HEADLINE: Europe Seeks To Ratchet Up Effort on Debt

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Under increasing pressure from global investors and world leaders, European government officials indicated Saturday that they were working to intensify their response to the continent's growing debt problems. It was an acknowledgment, after weeks of public stonewalling, that a plan announced in July had failed to calm financial markets.
Fears that Greece could default on its mounting debts, and that other European countries might follow, have repeatedly sent global markets plunging in recent weeks. Investors are also increasingly concerned that uncertainty itself is disrupting economic activity around the world and slowing growth. 
Olli Rehn, the European Union's monetary affairs commissioner, said Saturday that there was ''increasing political will'' among European leaders for a new effort to soothe investors. He said they were discussing a plan to multiply the financial impact of an existing bailout fund designed to make up to 440 billion euros ($600 billion) in loans to troubled nations and banks, so that it could instead insure a few trillion euros in loans.
French and German officials here continued to insist publicly that they were focused on the July plan, but in private meetings this weekend they made clear that they now understand the need for a new proposal, according to a senior American official who described the private conversations on condition of anonymity.
The shift in European strategy follows several days of intense pressure from world leaders gathered here for the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. One after another, they have warned publicly and privately that Europe's problems are dragging down their nations, too.
''We are in a precarious situation,'' said Singapore's finance minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, chairman of the fund's steering committee. ''And contributing to that is a problem of lack of confidence, in particular lack of confidence in the credibility of policy actions to arrest the crisis.''
The United States also has sharpened its tone. ''The threat of cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic risk must be taken off the table, as otherwise it will undermine all other efforts, both within Europe and globally,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement on Saturday. ''Decisions as to how to conclusively address the region's problems cannot wait until the crisis gets more severe.''
The Obama administration has been pressing European leaders, particularly the Germans, to act more forcefully, fearing that a continued deterioration of the continental economy, and instability in global markets, might undermine the fragile health of the American economy -- and President Obama's re-election prospects.
Perhaps the most obvious option would be an increase in the size of the bailout fund, which was created in 2010 by the 17 nations that use the euro. Independent analysts generally agree that the fund is not large enough to meet the borrowing needs for all the countries with problems, including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.
But political opposition to bailouts and the strained finances of some European countries make such an increase unlikely, and as a result, officials are focused instead on ways of making each euro go farther.
One option under consideration, suggested by American officials, is to treat the fund as an insurance program. The European Central Bank, which has an unlimited ability to create money, would lend money to investors to buy the debt of troubled countries. The bailout fund would agree to absorb any losses but, as an insurance program, its capital would be sufficient to guarantee loans with an aggregate value several times as large.
This approach, too, faces some obstacles. Europe's central bank, which is far more conservative than the Federal Reserve in the United States, would need to accept a new role as a direct lender to investors. Governments would need to embrace an idea that amounts to providing public subsidies for those investors. And the only precedent, an American effort called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, created during the 2008 financial crisis, is not regarded as a clear success.
The discussions among European officials are intense, reflecting the urgency of the situation, but they remain at an early stage. Mr. Rehn said that countries were focused first on approving the July plan, which allows the fund more flexibility -- for example, to make pre-emptive loans to nations that are not yet in distress. Legislatures in each country must approve the changes, and so far only 6 of the 17 have, but Mr. Rehn and other officials said they were confident the process would be done by mid-October.
European officials have promised to unveil ''a collective and bold action plan'' with other major economies in early November, when the leaders of the Group of 20 largest economies holds a scheduled meeting in France.
If financial markets continue to plunge this week, however, there will almost certainly be pressure for more immediate action.
The rest of the world appears to be impatient.
The fund's steering committee, which represents the 187 member nations, said Saturday that it was committed to restoring ''confidence and financial stability'' and rekindling growth.
But it announced no new measures, reflecting in part the widespread conviction that Europe is the cause of the current problem, and that Europe needs to fix it.
''It is the responsibility of European policy makers to ensure that their actions stop contagion beyond the euro periphery,'' Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, said in a statement on Saturday. ''Europe has a crucial role to play and needs to act swiftly and boldly.''

HEADLINE: Mme. Lagarde Goes to Washington

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
MARSEILLE, France
EARLIER this month a phalanx of limousines and black vans lined up near the Palais du Pharo, an imposing Napoleonic-era chateau here whose chandeliered halls had been temporarily transformed into a bunker.
Chauffeurs had just dropped off precious cargo -- the dark-suited finance ministers of Germany, France, the United States and the four other wealthy nations that form the Group of 7. The officials were gathering for a working dinner to talk about the swirling European debt crisis, which, despite their concerted efforts, seems to worsen by the day.
Their eyes soon turned toward Christine Lagarde, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Not so long ago, she was one of them. But almost as soon as she crossed the Atlantic to take up her post in Washington, she had morphed into someone who now slightly bewildered them.
Ms. Lagarde had gone independent. 
In the few short months since becoming the first woman to lead the monetary fund, Ms. Lagarde, 55, had taken her former European colleagues to task for not talking with a single voice to save the euro. In speech after speech, she had warned that the austerity that Europe was pressing on Greece and its debt-weakened neighbors was choking economic growth and needed to be tamed.
Worse, as far as the men seated in the room were concerned, Ms. Lagarde was partly responsible for the collapse of confidence bedeviling the financial markets. She had dared to state what few of them would admit publicly: European banks were not as sheltered from this storm as they might seem.
Was this the International Monetary Fund talking? It was now, under Ms. Lagarde. As the future of the euro hangs in the balance, she is emerging as a European who is willing to speak openly about Europe's problems.
If Greece defaults on its government debt, as many predict, and Europe's banks stumble, as some fear, the reverberations would be felt around the world. The next domino would be Italy, itself a member of the Group of 7. The Obama administration, alarmed by the possible spillover effects, is pressing European leaders to act decisively.
The monetary fund is already overseeing multibillion-euro bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- a situation that would have been unthinkable just three years ago. So, as much as anyone, Ms. Lagarde will help determine whether the union that has bound 17 European nations together, in the biggest postwar effort to ensure peace through economic stability, survives.
''Her first couple of months have been reassuring for those who feared the appointment of a European from a euro zone economy at a time of crisis,'' says Simon Tilford, the chief economist of the Center for European Reform, a London research group that supports European integration. ''She recognizes that the I.M.F. has to distance itself from the euro zone policy elite and its strategy for the crisis, which is clearly not working.''
At the annual meetings of the monetary fund and the World Bank continuing in Washington, Europe has dominated the discussion. In an announcement that added to the gloom in world markets last week, the fund cut its forecast for global growth and warned of worldwide economic repercussions if Europe couldn't solve its debt problem soon. Ms. Lagarde's lieutenant, the monetary fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said the Continent needed to ''get its act together.''
WHETHER MS. LAGARDE can do much to contain this crisis is uncertain. Sometimes her blunt talk has made a bad situation worse, and she has backpedaled after overstepping her bounds. In August, the share prices of Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, and many other big European banks tumbled after she proclaimed that European banks were in ''urgent'' need of capital.
Irritated European officials and an even angrier banking establishment scrambled to control the damage. Christian Noyer, the governor of the French central bank and a friend of Ms. Lagarde, declared: ''Quite frankly, I don't understand what she said.''
Now, on this sweltering September evening in Marseille, finance officials pressed Ms. Lagarde to ease up. A senior American official let it be known that the monetary fund was starting to retreat on estimates that Europe's banks might need at least 200 billion euros of capital. The next day, Ms. Lagarde appeared before reporters to say that that figure was ''tentative,'' and that the monetary fund was now discussing the final numbers with its European partners.
Ms. Lagarde has backed off in the past. But this time, she did not climb down from her principal point: That many banks still need a bigger cushion against potential losses in the event of a Greek default. Last week, the monetary fund warned that Europe's banks had as much as 300 billion euros at risk on various European government bonds but stopped short of saying they needed to raise that much in new capital.
Whatever the figure, it is almost certainly far more than the 2.5 billion euros that European regulators said the banks might need last spring. For some, the fact that so many European leaders are biting back proves that Ms. Lagarde has touched a nerve.
''It's a long time coming that the I.M.F. called a spade a spade when it comes to the banking sector,'' says Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former chief economist for the fund. ''They know there's a problem and they don't want to acknowledge it.''
Another former monetary fund economist, Simon Johnson, says it is too soon to know if Ms. Lagarde will succeed. ''We need at least another month or two to get a fix on who she is and what she will achieve,'' he says.
IN A SENSE, Ms. Lagarde has something to atone for. Her record on divining trouble was spotty while she was France's finance minister. In the days before Lehman Brothers collapsed, for instance, she assured the French that the worst was already over. Last July, she predicted that financial stress tests would show that European banks were ''solid and healthy,'' and declared that French banks were among the soundest.
Indeed, as Greece began to stumble, Ms. Lagarde was among those who planted the seeds of the problems that are now destabilizing Europe. She joined the French establishment in acquiescing to a German blueprint for responding to the crisis. That plan called for tax increases and deep spending cuts in countries that were already so weak that they needed bailouts from wealthier neighbors and the monetary fund.
Later, after disclosures that Greece had cooked its books to join the euro -- an open secret in European financial circles -- Ms. Lagarde warned that the country was at risk of default if it didn't do ''more to bring its public finances in order.'' She sided with the European Central Bank in resisting any restructuring of Greece's debts.
That plan, many experts now agree, magnified the crisis by placing impossible demands on Greece, and fanned concern that bigger economies, like Italy and Spain, might be engulfed by the crisis too. That has come back to haunt banks in Ms. Lagarde's home of France, which bought large amounts of European government bonds.
Meanwhile, the push for austerity has angered citizens in Greece and other countries. Some observers expect that the backlash might lead to a rise of far-right politicians over time.
''In that sense, she's culpable,'' Mr. Tilford says. ''By backing the strategy of fiscal austerity, she has helped push some economies that were in a bad situation over the edge, and caused a profound loss of confidence that has pushed the crisis into the core of the euro zone.''
Since those days, Ms. Lagarde seems to have seen the writing on the wall. One of her most surprising acts at the International Monetary Fund has been an about-face on austerity. The fund historically has compelled poor nations to reduce spending and raise taxes in exchange for its help. It has changed its tune for wealthier ones. Amid prolonged recessions and rising unemployment, Ms. Lagarde is advising the United States and Europe to stimulate growth and create jobs through new government spending, even if that spending temporarily inflates the public debt.
Lawrence H. Summers, the former economic adviser to President Obama, says Ms. Lagarde is making the right call. She is breaking with International Monetary Fund orthodoxy, he says.
''The I.M.F. has traditionally said cutting budget deficits is the solution to problems,'' Mr. Summers says. Ms. Lagarde's reversal is a ''welcome change in thinking, emphasizing that we should be establishing a basis for growth.''
Ms. Lagarde said she was too busy to sit for an interview for this article but responded to questions via e-mail. ''Everyone -- including markets -- realize that commitments to cut spending cannot survive a lengthy stagnation with prolonged high unemployment and social dissatisfaction,'' she wrote.
But Ms. Lagarde also made what many view as another questionable call before arriving at the monetary fund. One of the biggest problems with Europe's currency union is that no mechanism was ever put in place to ease a swift transfer of money from big countries like Germany to troubled ones like Greece. Neither Germany nor France was willing to cede an ounce of sovereignty to see that through.
As the crisis snowballed, people like Mario Draghi, the Italian who will become the head of the European Central Bank in November, have called for the creation of bonds backed by countries in the euro union as a way around this problem.
Germany balked and, early on, Ms. Lagarde's response was an almost unequivocal ''non.'' Late last year, when the idea started circulating, she said she ''absolutely'' did not want to see these bonds created -- at least not until a more common economic governance has been put in place by the euro club's members. Now that the Europeans are pushing the idea again, financial markets are hoping that these bonds could provide a solution.
Ms. Lagarde has remained silent. Last week, the monetary fund said Europe should hold off until euro countries are more closely knit.
But she continues to harp on Europe. ''Europe needs a common vision for its future,'' she wrote via e-mail. ''Put simply, it needs more Europe, not less.''
That is a message that she delivered for the last couple of years from the French finance ministry, where her offices were adorned with a zebra-striped rug and caricatures of her from various publications, including one depicting her as a dominatrix whipping a banker.
At one point, she pressed her message so hard that she ticked off another powerful woman in Europe: Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. While Ms. Lagarde's former boss, France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has had a tumultuous relationship with Mrs. Merkel, Ms. Lagarde has nurtured a close personal relationship with her. The women are on first-name terms. But their friendship was strained last spring when Ms. Lagarde noted that Germany was at least partly to blame for the deepening divide in Europe.
Germany became an economic powerhouse in part by exporting so much to weaker countries like Spain. But, now that economies like Spain's were in trouble, she said, Germany was refusing to buy imports.
The solution, Ms. Lagarde insisted, was for Berlin to lift domestic consumption. ''When there is an effort to make an interdependent economic zone such as the euro zone,'' Ms. Lagarde said at the time, ''everybody must make an effort.'' The result was a scathing backlash in the German press, and a lot of huffing around Mrs. Merkel's office.
Back in Paris, she was advised not to rock the boat further. But she was used to that: as a woman who did not come from France's Grandes Ecoles, like nearly every French politician, policy maker and corporate chief, she had long been labeled an outsider and was sometimes accused of being out of her depth on economic issues. The former head of Baker & McKenzie, the big law firm based in Chicago, she lived in the United States for six years, from 1999 to 2005. The stint earned her the moniker ''l'Americaine'' among French who did not necessarily see an American tour as a plus.
And, amid all the troubles in Europe, a French court recently opened an investigation into whether Ms. Lagarde abused her power as finance minister in 2007 by intervening in a legal dispute involving a prominent businessman and hundreds of millions of dollars in state money. The monetary fund's board was aware that a case might be opened when it selected her.
Since Ms. Lagarde's German gaffe, Mr. Sarkozy has made an effort to trumpet the unity between France and Germany, giving Mrs. Merkel air kisses in front of cameras or grasping her on the arm. Tall and stylish, with an elegant wardrobe that is adorned by Chanel jackets, Hermes sacs and Christian Louboutin heels, Ms. Lagarde was also accused by members of the mostly male French establishment of studying her clothes more than her dossiers. During her candidacy for the International Monetary Fund, when asked if Ms. Lagarde would get the job, Laurent Fabius, a former finance minister, said: ''She'll make it. She's an elegant woman.'' The French press jumped on the snub.
ONCE at the monetary fund, Ms. Lagarde hopped back on her soapbox. Warning that the economic crisis has entered ''a dangerous new phase'' -- a catch phrase she repeated several times during the fund meetings -- she insists that further steps are needed to strengthen the euro zone.
''There is no room for ambivalence about the future direction,'' she said via e-mail. ''An unclear or confused message will add to market uncertainty and magnify economic tensions.''
All this came back to the fore last week in Washington, when she met many of the same men she had confronted at the Palais du Pharo, as well as troupes of other finance ministers from around the globe.
This time, the circumstances were different. The last set of monetary fund meetings was overseen by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned in May to deal with charges of attempted rape. Ms. Lagarde allowed him to return to the fund to apologize to a cynical staff, and bid adieu before he returned to France, where he used his first television interview since the scandal to hold forth on the European crisis.
At the International Monetary Fund, the D.S.K. chapter is considered closed. There is a feeling among employees that Ms. Lagarde has risen to the occasion, and the talk about her being too European has dissipated. ''People feel like there is a leader, there's a boss,'' one monetary fund official says.
Ms. Lagarde has moved full steam ahead with a multitude of speeches, television appearances and profiles in magazines as heavy as Der Spiegel and as glossy as Vogue. Some media have embraced her as proof that a woman can pay attention to world affairs as well as her wardrobe without losing credibility. A recent Huffington Post photo montage of Ms. Lagarde's ''Proudly Parisian Styles'' drew gushing comments from readers.
Still, Ms. Lagarde faces a long road. But in a speech on Sept. 15 at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, she signaled that the monetary fund wouldn't back down. The fund, she said, could help during a crisis ''by turning up the heat at times.''

HEADLINE: Placing Islamic Art On a New Pedestal

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
IN one of Washington Irving's tales from ''The Alhambra,'' the short-story collection that rooted the great 14th-century Moorish landmark in the American imagination, a poor Spaniard and his daughter discover a hidden chamber deep within the abandoned palace's crumbling walls and spirit away the treasure inside.
Over the last three years in a suite of galleries concealed from public view on the second floor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it is as if Irving's fable of Islam's rich past has been unfolding in reverse. Treasures, in this case more than a thousand pieces from the museum's extensive holdings of Islamic art, have been slowly populating newly constructed rooms, taking their places in gleaming new vitrines with Egyptian marble underfoot and mosque lamps overhead, amid burbling fountains and peaked arches framing views of 13 centuries of art history. 
When this 19,000-square-foot hidden chamber is finally opened to the public on Nov. 1 with the unwieldy but academically precise new name of the Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia, it will not only represent the culmination of eight years of planning and work. The reinstallation and enlargement of the collection -- one of the most important outside the Middle East -- also promises to stand as a watershed moment in America's awareness of the visual culture of the Islamic world, at a time when that world looms as large as ever on the international stage and in the American psyche.
Over the last year and a half the museum allowed a reporter to watch the galleries come into being, as bare brick walls were slowly transformed into visions of ninth-century Baghdad, medieval Iran and early Islamic India, and as the museum found itself in a transformed position. It had long harbored ambitions to put its Islamic holdings in a bigger spotlight. But it had little idea when it began rethinking the galleries almost a decade ago that it would be doing so against such a culturally loaded backdrop: the American military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, the escalating tensions with Iran and the outbreak of the Arab Spring. For an institution that seems to exist as a sanctuary from geopolitics, and often operates in isolation from them, the project became a delicate diplomatic as well as curatorial undertaking.
With advice from the State Department, the museum has reached out to more than 20 countries whose regions are represented by artifacts in the overall collection, including ones in the throes of regime change or revolt, like Libya, Egypt and Syria. It has sought advice from more than 40 Islamic-art scholars from around the world throughout the course of the project. It has worked with New York City officials to make contacts in New York Muslim organizations and has given early peeks of the project to groups as multifarious as the Arab Bankers Association of North America and the regional offices of the Anti-Defamation League.
''Thirty years ago there was just a small group of specialists interested in this material and a few people who collected rugs and objects,'' said Sheila Canby, who was recruited from the British Museum to lead the Met's Islamic department and oversee the completion of the reinstallation. ''Now there's much more attention and anticipation, though I think it's driven by news events that are focused mostly on war. The history and culture represented by the objects in these galleries is still not known nearly as much as it should be, and the goal here is to change that.''
The museum has also had to confront the question -- much more in the public eye now than it was when the original Islamic galleries opened in 1975 -- of whether to display art that depicts the Prophet Muhammad. (It will, though the rare pieces on paper that do, like a folio from a 16th-century illuminated manuscript showing Muhammad on his winged steed Buraq, cannot be shown continuously because of their sensitivity to light.)
''We hope that it does not become a lightning-rod issue,'' Thomas P. Campbell, the museum's director, said in June, as the galleries began to take final shape. ''These are not 20th-century cartoons setting out to be confrontational. They're representative of a great tradition of art.'' He added, of the issue: ''We could duck it, but I don't think it would be the responsible thing to do. Then we'd just be accused of ducking it.''
The closing of the original Islamic galleries in 2003 to make way for the enlargement of the Greek and Roman galleries below them on the first floor came at an awkward time, an almost symbolic displacement of Islamic by Western art in the wake of Sept. 11. But many experts inside and outside the museum had felt for years that the 1975 galleries -- opened with great fanfare, by far the largest such permanent display in America -- were showing their age. Two pre-eminent American scholars described the rooms as ''somewhat dim and mysterious.'' The mostly chronological arrangement, many felt, presented too narrow a picture of the Met's overall collection, and scholars had long complained that too much of that collection -- some 12,000 objects -- was not sufficiently cataloged, making study difficult.
One of the first objects to greet visitors to the new galleries will be a 1,000-year-old Iranian earthenware bowl whose edge is circled with elegantly elongated Kufic script spelling out a kind of Poor Richard's Almanac maxim of its day: ''Planning before work protects you from regret.'' The saying might as well have been taken to heart by the museum, which originally projected that the galleries would reopen within four years. But with the rare blank slate that the renovation provided, curators' and designers' ambitions grew, as did the project's timeline and cost, which now stands at $50 million, money that also covers a new endowment for the collection along with a new, expanded catalog and educational programming.
The project did not even move from the drawing board to the construction phase until late winter of 2009. But despite taking place during a period when the museum has been forced to lay off staff members and tighten its belt because of the economic downturn, the renovation has been notable for pulling out most of the stops.
It imported a group of highly respected artisans from Fez, Morocco, to build a Maghrebi-Andalusian-style courtyard from scratch, a painstaking project that took several months. It recruited woodworkers in Cairo for special doors (delivered on time despite the upheaval there) and glass blowers in Red Hook, Brooklyn, to make new mosque lamps based on ancient designs. It put textile conservators to work for more than three years for an inch-by-inch restoration of ''The Emperor's Carpet,'' a renowned 16th-century Iranian rug believed to have belonged to Peter the Great and then to Leopold I, which has been displayed briefly only twice since the Met acquired it in 1943 because of its worn condition.
(''With most 16th-century Western tapestries, the yellows are almost gone,'' said Florica Zaharia, the conservator in charge of the textile department, surveying the carpet in a lab in the summer of 2010. ''But here you still somehow have these wonderful, bright yellows. I think it's going to be a revelation to a lot of people.'')
The new galleries have gained 5,000 more square feet through deft architectural annexing of former offices and restrooms. As their title suggests, the 15 rooms will now present the works more by the map than the calendar, showing the catchall term ''Islamic art'' to mean little because it means so many things depending on how and where it is applied: art made in regions where Islam might have been the dominant but by no means the only religious culture; art made by Muslims for religious purposes but more often for secular, luxury ones, sometimes for non-Muslim patrons; art made by Muslims that so absorbed non-Muslim influences as to be almost indistinguishable from its Chinese or European cousins.
The galleries will triple the space given over to the Ottoman Empire. They will give a more central stage to one of the collection's blockbusters -- a brilliantly colored prayer niche from a theological school in the Iranian city of Isfahan -- previously installed in a small side gallery. An entryway leading from the Islamic galleries into an adjoining European paintings gallery will provide a new, unusually literal West-meets-Near-East vista, allowing viewers looking at Orientalist fantasias like Gerome's 1871 ''Prayer in the Mosque'' to see all the way across to the deep blue and turquoise of the prayer niche, a genuine devotional article.
The new setup will also emphasize more strongly how the visual trademarks of Islamic art -- geometric abstraction and calligraphy, as both language and decoration -- have co-existed over the centuries with lively figuration, from the form of a leaping hare on an 11th-century Egyptian lusterware bowl to painted scenes of bourgeois splendor in 17th-century Iran that look as if Manet could have dreamed them up.
On some days over the last several months the galleries have seemed like a surreal conflation of the ancient and the postmodern: the Moroccan workers microwaving their lunch kebabs on a break from incising intricate stucco patterning that reaches back centuries; a radio pumping out Sly and the Family Stone as conservators put finishing touches on another of the collection's masterpieces, the Damascus room, a nearly intact 18th-century wood-paneled reception chamber from a wealthy Syrian residence. (Some small pieces of this room remain in Hawaii, where Doris Duke acquired them for her Islam-theme Honolulu mansion, Shangri-La.)
One day last May a New York City imam, Abdallah Adhami, an American-born cleric who runs a nonprofit educational center, came to visit the galleries with his staff. And while standing with Ms. Canby, the curator in charge of the Islamic department, Mr. Adhami looked at the inscriptions on the Damascus room's walls, recognized them as being inspired by the 13th-century Egyptian poet al-Busiri and showed her how to read them in their proper sequence. ''It was a wonderful surprise,'' she recalled.
Mr. Adhami -- who was for a brief period chosen to direct religious programming for the proposed cultural center and mosque near ground zero -- said he hoped the new Met galleries would not only help bridge cultural differences between America and the Muslim world but serve as a nucleus for American Muslims, whom he sees as woefully unaware of the riches of their cultural past. (On the question of works from that past presenting representations of Muhammad, Mr. Adhami holds a nuanced view. ''Theologically it's unacceptable, and that's pretty straightforward.'' But he added that he believed the images should be seen in context, as pieces of centuries-old history. ''Let's say that I would leave the room on a vote on this kind of question, figuratively speaking,'' he said.)
To ask art and artifacts -- even magisterial examples from a sweep of more than a millennium -- to make a difference, or even a dent, in American anti-Muslim sentiment might be expecting too much. But the opening of the new galleries, less than two months after the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, comes at a time as propitious as the 2003 closing was unfortunate and holds the possibility at least of reshaping many Americans' views about the deep affinities between Western and Islamic art.
And maybe it could do more, Ms. Canby said. Over half of the collection comes from Iran -- in part because of Met excavations there in the 1930s -- and those objects will now stand as a powerful counterpoint to preconceptions about a country that has come to symbolize Islamic antagonism.
''There is always a tendency to vilify a people as if they have come out of nothing,'' she said in an interview in the galleries in August, with more than a third of the objects installed. ''But these things are humanizing. They show the beauty and achievement and even the sense of humor of a great culture. Whether people apply that to their view of public affairs is their own business. But at least they will be able to use their eyes and draw their own conclusions.''

HEADLINE: Lessons for Fire-Stricken Texas from Down Under

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: From Australia to Texas, fire risk follows as communities spread into the bush. 

 BODY:
With fresh winds putting a large area of east Texas under a red flag fire warning even as the cleanup continues in dozens of communities already swept by flames, I thought it worth getting some insights from John McAneney, the director of Risk Frontiers, a natural hazards research center at Macquarie University in Australia. McAneney is a seasoned analyst of threats where human settlements occur in dry, combustible places.
I sent him my recent post noting how the population had quadrupled since 1970 in Bastrop County, Tex., one of the areas hit worst early this month. There's much of interest, particularly his finding that if you analyze fire data in Australia carefully -- doing for housing density what inflation adjustment does for economic change -- there is no trend in the frequency of the most destructive type of wildfires. Here's his take on things: 
I can't comment with any specific knowledge about the fires in Texas but the arguments you draw about the importance of vulnerability certainly hold true in Australia, where home destruction is very much a land-use planning problem. In short, we have too many people choosing (and being allowed to live) either within, or in very close proximity to, fire-prone bushland in what is often proudly referred to "as the most fire-prone part of the planet."
The figure [] shows the history of house losses in Australia since 1925, the first big event loss of last century. The time series has been normalized to current day exposure in order to suggest the likely losses if all events had taken place during the 2008/2009 fire season; in other words, as if each historical fire had impacted upon today's distribution of houses and population. The vertical axis shows House Equivalents, which is an attempt to capture all property losses -- residential, commercial and industrial buildings -- but in the case of bushfire (your wildfire) you can simply take this metric as being approximately equal to the number of residential homes destroyed.
That the figure shows no long-term trend is interesting for a number of reasons, especially as we have had professional fire services for less than half of the period covered by the data. Ten of the largest fires account for about 80 percent of the accumulated home destruction and in these fires there was very little the fire services could do on the day to prevent damage to property. Fine distinctions as to whether the temperature was 42, 44 or 45 degrees C. on those days is as irrelevant as the possible role of climate change in making such conditions more frequent. Once started, these fires were uncontrollable, something that is now being belatedly recognized by some fire services.
Another issue highlighted by the figure is that the very destructive fires happen infrequently so that a firefighter (or reporter) is only likely to experience one such fire in their career and so, when they do happen, they are always considered "unprecedented."
In our research we have also examined loss of life by searching out and inspecting the coroners' records of all bushfire deaths that have occurred since 1900. At the risk of simplifying things, the data show that in the early part of last century people died while working and living in the bush -- often around sawmills -- whereas today they are dying because they chose to live in bushlands. And often without any real awareness of the risk. In my view, such lifestyle choices should come with responsibilities and, in particular, there should not be an expectation that others, such as the volunteer firefighters, risk their lives to save them and their homes.
You can argue whether or not the State has the right to restrict people's lifestyle choices but, at least in Australia, the government is not reticent about interceding in other ways to improve public safety.
Some have argued that the above figure should have a downward trend because of improvements in weather forecasting whereas we interpret the experience of the 2009 Victorian fires in which 173 people lost their lives as suggesting that even with near perfect forecasts there is always the possibility of large numbers of fatalities.
Now consider vulnerability. In the Australian context, vulnerability and exposure to bushfire can be jointly parameterized by a simple function of distance from the nearest bushland. In the most destructive of the Black Saturday fires in 2009, our post-event measurements show for the towns of Marysville and Kinglake that the likelihood of home destruction [for structures separated from brush by less than 10 meters] was around 90 percent and that 60 percent of all homes destroyed on that day were within this distance of bushland. Putting a bit of separation from the bushland is the most expedient means of improving your odds of survival.
The equations that you cite from Alexander [primary source here] are mathematically flawed even if the first does at least identify the key risk ingredients. In general, it makes more sense to define risk to buildings from natural hazards as a function of these factors:

where the first refers to the frequency-magnitude relations that characterize the hazard, exposure refers to the spatial distribution of homes and their values, and vulnerability, the fractional destruction as a proportion of the replacement value that is in turn a function of the hazard intensity. One has to integrate over all possibilities of the hazard to determine the average annual loss, estimate the worst case scenario, or the entire spectrum of possible outcomes. Risk here can be defined in either dollar values or numbers of destroyed buildings.
Alexander's second equation is completely fallacious. Let's return to bushfire: if one were to construct a home in the form of a fireproofed bunker capable of resisting flames of any intensity and keeping the inhabitants perfectly safe then this would simply reduce the vulnerability, and therefore risk, to zero. It has nothing to do with resilience which I would define as the propensity of a family or community to recover after a disaster and this capacity may in part depend upon the availability of financial resources.
Resilience is a complex notion and to give just one example, suppose someone who loses his or her home in a fire or earthquake may, even if the loss were completely covered by insurance, let's say, chose to leave the community and live somewhere else. As I understand it this happened after Katrina and may yet prove to be the case in some small towns afflicted by the Australian fires on Black Saturday. These individuals proved resilient but the community may not be if too many others chose to leave the area.
Our equation (1) just looks at risk from a financial-loss perspective. Many would argue that risk has social and behavioral components and I agree with this. However, the equation does acknowledge other dimensions to risk besides the hazard, over which we can have little control. We may have terrible fire weather, but if there are no ignitions by lightning or arson or accidents, there will be no fires. We can also have huge fires whose footprint intersect no communities. These fires pose no risk, at least to buildings, and so again this points towards the other factors that can be controlled: vulnerability and exposure.
Where and how we build are where big gains can be made in reducing the cost of fires (as well as to many other location specific hazards such as flooding), but to achieve these will require hard choices that thus far we have mostly been reluctant to make.

HEADLINE: Up South

BYLINE: NICOLE ETCHESON


HIGHLIGHT: Northern and Southern sympathies clash in the lower Midwest. 

 BODY:
Abraham Lincoln may have won Indiana in the 1860 presidential election, but on a summer night in Greencastle, Ind., locals could see just how much the state was split between Unionists and Confederate sympathizers. On the evening of July 21, 1861, residents had gathered at the railroad depot, where the telegraph "dripped" news "from the wires indicating the rising or falling tide at the distant battle" at Bull Run. Eager anticipation turned to dismay when they learned that, at the end of the day, the tide had turned and the North had suffered a shocking defeat. But not everyone at the depot was discouraged: the face of Judge Delana Eckels, who publicly sided with the South even as he held a leading position in the community, was wreathed in smiles at the news of the Union army's panicked retreat. 
Indiana, like its neighboring lower Midwestern states Ohio and Illinois, had been settled by Southern migrants, and many carried their old allegiances with them. Like many of his fellow townspeople, Judge Eckels had grown up in Kentucky. During the secession crisis, Indiana Representative Daniel W. Voorhees promised his constituents never to "vote one dollar, or one man, or one gun to the administration of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, to make war upon the South." Still, despite Voorhees's assertion, the firing on Fort Sumter sparked intense Union sentiment in the Midwest. When the war came, over half of adult Hoosier men signed up, many as three-year volunteers, placing Indiana second in the nation for the percentage of its military-age population in service. 
Although the Civil War divided the nation, it especially divided Midwesterners whose strong ties to the South competed with a fierce attachment to the Union. No one embodied that paradox more strongly than Abraham Lincoln, who was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, married into a slaveowning family and rose to political power in Illinois.
In addition to family ties, the lower Midwest had important trade links to the South, which they knew would be hurt by sectional conflict. Farmers shipped pork, corn and other agricultural products down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to the market at New Orleans (Lincoln, as a youth in Indiana and Illinois, made two such trips to that port). War closed the Mississippi, hurting cities all along the Ohio River. Agricultural prices plummeted. In the fall of 1861, Peter Demaree, a farmer in Johnson County, Ind., complained to his brother that "times is very hard here every thing we have to sell is very low & every thing we buy is very high." True, as the war continued, railroads supplanted the rivers as the chief means of transportation, and the Northern army's demand for food and supplies brought Midwestern farmers high prices and prosperity: corn, which sold for 15 cents a bushel in the depressed days of 1861, rose to 95 cents by 1864. But in 1861 the good times were not apparent, and Midwesterners greeted the economic shocks with dismay.
Moreover, while Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were free states, all three maintained "black laws" that prohibited African Americans from voting, serving on juries, marrying whites and testifying against whites in court. Informal segregation existed as well: Ellis Mitchell, a well-to-do free black man traveling through Ohio, had to eat in the kitchen while his white traveling companions were served in the dining room of a tavern. All three states also possessed or considered prohibitions against African Americans moving into them; in Indiana such a bar was written into its 1851 constitution. David M. Dobson, an Owen County delegate to the state's constitutional convention, summed up the prevailing attitude, which worried that Indiana would become the "receptacle for . . . all the broke down and worthless slaves of the South."
States rights doctrine was also popular in the region. Sympathetic Midwesterners agreed with Southerners that the political quarrels of the 1850s constituted an attack on Southern rights. President James Buchanan appointed Judge Eckels, who was a powerful figure in the Indiana Democratic party, chief justice of Utah Territory; nevertheless, during the 1860 election Eckels campaigned in Indiana for the Southern rights candidate, John C. Breckinridge. Eckels wanted "complete enjoyment of every constitutional right," including to slaves, for "every portion of the Union, North and South."
Despite Eckels's endorsement, Breckinridge received less than 5 percent of Indiana's popular vote in 1860. Another pro-Southern candidate, John Bell, whose platform called for respecting the Fugitive Slave Law, received less than 2 percent. Instead, the race in Indiana was between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, both Illinoisans and both arguing that slavery could be prevented from expanding. Midwestern fear of black migration came as much from their dislike of haughty slaveowners, who often freed aging slaves and sent them north of the Ohio River, as it did from animosity toward African Americans themselves. 
In other words, many Midwesterners, especially those in the lower Midwest, opposed the Southern candidates not out of an ideological difference, but because they feared the growth of the "Slave Power" South that would force them to allow blacks to live in their region, whether as slaves or freedmen. To them, Douglas was a "Judas" who had authored legislation that opened Kansas Territory to slavery in exchange for Southern political support. 
But in April 1861, the Confederate firing on Fort Sumter shifted the blame to the Confederacy. The "war spirit" infected entire communities. One Democrat in Greencastle, John A. Matson, "made a stirring and patriotic appeal in behalf of the Union." Another, Lewis Sands, opened a recruiting office. Sands raised two companies of soldiers and, despite his advancing age, hoped to enlist as well. His exertions, however, taxed his health and he died within a month. Matson's son, Courtland, quit college to volunteer and served throughout the war. 
The entire community found ways to support the war. Most of the early volunteers were unmarried men like Courtland Matson, but nonetheless a committee formed to see that married soldiers' families would be cared for during their absence. Local women sewed uniforms for their sons, cooked farewell dinners for the troops and honored them with flags. George L. Chapin belonged to the first company to leave Putnam County for the muster grounds in Indianapolis. He described the farewell: "The Ladies of GreenCastle presented us with a beautiful Flag." 
Shortly after the Confederacy formed, President-elect Lincoln wrote the new Republican governor of Indiana, Oliver P. Morton, that for "the salvation of this Union there needs but one single thing, the hearts of a people like yours." Yet Hoosier hearts were as deeply riven as the Union itself. In northern Indiana, the news of Fort Sumter caused Theodore Upson's grandmother to sob for those of her children who remained in the South: "Oh to think that I should have lived to see the day when Brother should rise against Brother." Her grandson would march through Georgia with Sherman's army.

HEADLINE: Tennessee Senator Takes a Stand for Compromise

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: In stepping down from the Republican leadership, Senator Lamar Alexander will embrace the independence enjoyed by an individual senator or a government executive, a role he has always preferred. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Insiders could spot the constraints on Lamar Alexander in the Senate at least six years ago, as the two parties fought over judicial nominations.
After a series of Democratic filibusters against the nominees of President George W. Bush, Senator Alexander helped start the bipartisan "Gang of 14" that worked to forestall the Republicans' "nuclear option," which would have eliminated the use of filibusters to block judicial appointments. But he could not publicly join the group.
Why? He feared undercutting the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, his fellow Tennessee Republican.
Multiply that demurral a hundredfold, and Mr. Alexander's decision last week to leave the Senate Republican leadership becomes easier to understand. So does the inability of contemporary Washington to achieve consensus on problems facing an anxious American electorate.
Congressional leaders spend more time devising rationales for permanent warfare than strategies for accommodation. Polarization by ideology as well as party, which raises the stakes in each election, permits nothing else.
It is this kind of "political messaging" that Mr. Alexander has abandoned. Instead he will embrace the independence enjoyed by an individual senator or a government executive, a role he has always preferred.
"What I'm best at doing is trying to set an agenda, lay out a solution and persuade at least half the people that I'm right," Mr. Alexander said in an interview. "As a governor, I can do that. As a senior senator, I can do that.
"As a part of the Senate leadership, I'm restricted, because it has to reflect a consensus within the caucus." 
Party Upheavals
As governor of Tennessee, Mr. Alexander helped change the face of the state. He recruited Nissan to build an auto assembly plant employing 4,000 workers and worked with Democratic legislators to overhaul public education.
But changes in the two parties during his career have diminished openings for deal-making pragmatism.
In 1979, when Mr. Alexander became governor, self-described conservatives (31 percent) outnumbered liberals (21 percent) in the Democratic rank and file nationwide, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. Among Democrats today, the number of liberals (38 percent) dwarfs self-identified conservatives (18 percent), and moderates represent 40 percent of the members.
At the same time, the Republican base has grown more ideologically pure.
In 1979, 42 percent of Republicans said they were conservatives, outpacing moderates (35 percent) and liberals (15 percent). Today, conservatives represent 63 percent of the party's members, moderates 28 percent and liberals 6 percent.
The result is a bottom-up drive for ideological conformity. Elected officials fear primaries as much or more than general elections, increasing the risks of defying orthodoxy.
"If the voters wanted politicians with courage, they'd reward them," said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who has advised Mr. Alexander. "Voters punish people who behave like that."
So do Congressional leaders. Instead of mavericks "out there on the edge trying to solve problems," said Tennessee's other Republican senator, Bob Corker, leaders prefer a "lowest-common-denominator approach" that preserves party unity.
No surprise, then, that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, discouraged attempts by the bipartisan "Gang of Six" to resolve the debt-limit crisis. That would have required Democrats to accept cuts in entitlement benefits and Republicans to accept some tax increases.
Crossing Boundaries
What was surprising was the way Mr. Alexander quietly made his way to a critical meeting and embraced the effort to find common ground.
"The whole character of that room changed when Lamar stood up and, without a lot of qualification, said, 'I'm in,' " recalled Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.
Mr. Alexander had warned Mr. McConnell, whom he has known for four decades, since both were young Senate aides. He would not discuss Mr. McConnell's reaction.
"I don't have to agree with him all the time," Mr. Alexander said. "I just have to not surprise him."
Of course, Mr. McConnell's resistance prevailed. Soon Mr. Alexander was on a fishing trip drafting his departure statement.
He is, to be sure, avoiding a contest for the position of Republican whip, which he might have lost to Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who leads the party's campaign arm. Some distance from leadership might help him win a third term from Tennessee voters in 2014.
But it also frees him to work across party lines on deficit reduction, the storage of nuclear waste and ideas for economic growth that some Republicans disdain.
"Roads and bridges and national laboratories and college scholarships all ought to be part of our jobs program," Mr. Alexander said.
In a Senate requiring 60 votes to overcome perpetual filibusters, he added, Democrats shoulder the same responsibility for crossing boundaries.
"We could be more constructive on both sides," he said. "I'm not interested in bipartisanship as a goal. I'm interested in it as a tactic to solve problems."
That sounds like the sort of unifying message that presidential candidates take to the nation, as Barack Obama did in 2008, when he was a senator, and that Mr. Alexander attempted in unsuccessful races for the Republican nomination in 1996 and 2000. At 71, he will not be trying again.
"That wouldn't be a risk," Mr. Alexander concluded, laughing. "That'd just be stupid."

HEADLINE: Retailers Get Heat for Sales That Generate Anti-Gay Aid

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The culture war over gay rights has entered the impersonal world of e-commerce.
A handful of advocates, armed with nothing more than their keyboards, have put many of the country's largest retailers, including Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Wal-Mart, on the spot over their indirect and, until recently, unnoticed roles in funneling money to Christian groups that are vocal in opposing homosexuality.
The advocates are demanding that the retailers end their association with an Internet marketer that gets a commission from the retailers for each online customer it gives them. It is a routine arrangement on hundreds of e-commerce sites, but with a twist here: a share of the commission that retailers pay is donated to a Christian charity of the buyer's choice, from a list that includes prominent conservative evangelical groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family.
The marketer and the Christian groups are fighting back, saying that the hundred or so companies that have dropped the marketer were misled and that the charities are being slandered for their religious beliefs. 
The national battle was ignited in July by Stuart Wilber, a 73-year-old gay man in Seattle. He was astonished, he said, when he learned that people who bought Microsoft products through a Christian-oriented Internet marketer known as Charity Giveback Group, or CGBG, could channel a donation to evangelical organizations that call homosexual behavior a threat to the moral and social fabric.
''I said, 'You've got to be kidding, Microsoft,' '' he recalled, noting that the software giant -- like many other corporations accessible through the commerce site, including Apple and Netflix -- was known as friendly to gay causes.
In July, Mr. Wilber went to a Web site that helps groups and individuals circulate petitions, called Change.org, and started one, asking Microsoft to end its association with what he called ''hate groups.'' By that night, 520 people had signed, with their ire copied to Microsoft officials -- and Microsoft had quietly dropped out of the donation plan. Much to Mr. Wilber's surprise, this would be the start of an electronic conflict that has put hundreds of well-known companies in an unwelcome glare.
On one side are angry gay-rights advocates and bloggers, wielding the club of the gay community's purchasing power.
On the other side are conservative Christian groups that say they are being attacked for their legitimate biblical views of sex and marriage, as well as a Web marketing firm that feels trampled for providing consumers with free choice.
Caught in the middle are companies, including such giants as Macy's, Expedia and Delta Air Lines, which have the dual aims of avoiding politics but not offending any consumers. In this case, they have been pressured to make a choice that may involve little money either way but that could offend large blocs of consumers.
''This is economic terrorism,'' said Mike Huckabee, the former pastor, governor and presidential contender, who is a paid CGBG consultant. ''To try to destroy a business because you don't like some of the customers is, to me, unbelievably un-American,'' he said in an interview.
CGBG, a for-profit company formerly called the Christian Values Network, resembles hundreds of so-called affiliate marketers, which retailers use to bring customers to their own Web sites. The affiliate receives a commission on any sales, and CGBG allows buyers to send half that commission to any of the Christian charities on its list.
In July, as word of Mr. Wilber's victory spread virally, Ben Crowther, a college student in Bellingham, Wash., started a similar Internet appeal to Apple, which would soon succeed after drawing 22,700 signers. Roy Steele, who runs a gay-rights Web site in San Francisco, picked up the crusade, directly contacting about 150 companies listed on the e-commerce site.
AllOut.org, a gay-rights group in New York with hundreds of thousands of e-mail-ready members, focused on the travel industry, helping to push Avis, Westin Hotels & Resorts, Expedia and many other hotels and travel agencies to disassociate themselves from CGBG.
Close to 100 companies have left the charity arrangement, though most refuse to discuss the matter. These have become the objects, in turn, of a countercampaign from the Christian groups -- ''Please Don't Discriminate Against My Faith'' is the heading of a sample letter -- and of high-level entreaties from Mr. Huckabee and other Christian leaders.
A few companies that briefly left the network have been persuaded to rejoin, including Delta, PetSmart, Sam's Club, Target and Wal-Mart.
''People have been misled. The retailers are not donating to anyone; they are simply paying a commission to get traffic,'' John Higgins, the president of CGBG, said in an interview.
He said CGBG focused on Christian consumers and marketing through large organizations like Focus on the Family because it saw an untapped commercial opportunity.
''Retailers should keep their doors open to everybody,'' Mr. Higgins said. He also complained that some competing e-commerce sites included the same conservative groups on charity lists but had not been subjected to similar attacks.
Beyond condemning the advocates' efforts as an infringement on consumer freedom, Mr. Huckabee said it was offensive to apply the ''hate group'' label to organizations that are legal, peaceful and promote biblical values.
The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled the Family Research Council a hate group for ''regularly pumping out known falsehoods that demonize the gay community,'' said Mark Potok, a project director at the law center -- and not, he said, because the council calls homosexuality a sin or opposes gay marriage. The falsehoods, he said, include the discredited claim that gay men are especially prone to pedophilia.
The Family Research Council has accused the law center of ''slanderous attacks.''
Advocates insist that their push is not anti-Christian. ''It has nothing to do with biblical positions,'' said Mr. Steele, the blogger. ''It has to do with the fact that these groups spread lies and misinformation about millions of Americans.''
The discomfort of retailers has been evident in their varied responses. Expedia, in an e-mail to AllOut.org in August, confirmed that it had withdrawn from the network. ''Expedia values diversity in its employee base and customer base and does not support discrimination of any kind based on sexual orientation,'' the message said.
Barneys New York said it had left CGBG because of the site's support for groups that promote discrimination.
But Microsoft, though it led the way with its swift response, has never said a public word about it, nor has Apple been willing to do more than confirm that it no longer is associated with CGBG.
This summer, Macy's told Change.org that it had left the network because ''Macy's serves a diverse society'' and is ''deeply committed to a philosophy of inclusion,'' but the retailer declined to comment for this article.
In a statement explaining why it had returned to the network, Wal-Mart and its sister company Sam's Club said their marketing affiliates included ''more than 43,000 diverse organizations'' that ''serve a wide range of interests with diverse viewpoints.''
Delta changed course ''because of the letters we received from several faith-based leaders,'' including Mr. Huckabee, said Chris Kelly Singley, manager of corporate communications. ''This was important to them, and we were willing to reconsider,'' she said, adding that Delta had a history of supporting gay and lesbian causes.
''We don't want to engage in a political debate,'' Ms. Singley said. ''And we just thought we were flying airplanes.''

HEADLINE: Protesters Bare All Over a Proposed San Francisco Law

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Perhaps it should not be a surprise that San Francisco does not have a law against being naked in public, nor that a small, unselfconscious segment of the city's residents regularly exercise that right.
That tiny minority was joined this weekend in the autumn fog and cold by unclothed sympathizers at a ''Nude-In.'' One of their objectives was to draw attention to a proposed law -- introduced by Scott Wiener, a city supervisor -- that would prohibit nudity in restaurants and require unclad people to put a towel or other material down before sitting bare-bottomed on benches or other public seats. 
Mr. Wiener said the law was introduced in response to an increase in nakedness in parks, streets and restaurants.
''It used to be that there would be one nude guy wandering around the neighborhood and no one thought twice about it,'' said Mr. Wiener, who represents the city's Castro district. ''Now it's a regular thing and much more obnoxious. We have guys sitting down naked in public without the common decency to put something down underneath them.''
Mr. Wiener's effort was destined to grab headlines, but he probably did not anticipate that his legislation would inspire even more people to disrobe.
''Wiener might as well have shot lasers and fireworks into the sky announcing that public nudity is legal,'' said George Davis, 65.
A self-described ''urban nudist'' who once ran for mayor and often campaigned in the buff, Mr. Davis now spends most afternoons lounging in his birthday suit in a public plaza in the Castro.
Putting a towel between your backside and a seat is ''basic nudist etiquette,'' said Mr. Davis, adding that the legislation requiring it was ''totally unnecessary.''
Still, Mr. Davis said, the publicity about the proposed law could be credited for the new faces at the Nude-In, which was held Saturday at the Jane Warner Plaza in the Castro.
Other nearby cities like Berkeley and San Jose have passed laws prohibiting public nudity, but in San Francisco it remains legal. In accordance with state law, public nudity is only illegal when accompanied by ''lewd thoughts or acts'' or ''where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed.'' But since state law prohibits police officers from being the offended party, it takes a citizen's arrest-- a rare occurrence in a city that prides itself on its open-mindedness and tolerance -- to take a naked person into custody.
Many of the people who took part in the Nude-In said that they already used towels when they sat down, and that they thought Mr. Wiener's legislation was pointless. The event itself was originally organized not as a protest but as a curtain-raiser for the Folsom Street Fair, which spread over 13 city blocks on Sunday. ''This is about body acceptance, not politics,'' said the Nude-In's organizer, Mitch Hightower, 50, who runs a pornographic Web site.
Nowhere is brazen public nudity more evident than at the Folsom Street Fair, which is billed as the largest leather and fetish event in the world. The gathering attracts hundreds of thousands of people every year, many of them wearing black leather chaps and nothing else.
''In San Francisco, public nudity is a big part of a lot of social street events, and that's a good thing,'' Mr. Hightower said.
Businesses in the Castro are divided over the role that naked people play in the neighborhood's economic and cultural appeal. Despite receiving some complaints about nudity from business owners, Steve Adams, president of the Merchants of Upper Market and Castro, says he often sees tourists posing for photographs with the nudists.
''Nudity really doesn't impact business,'' said Mr. Adams, whose group represents about 300 businesses. ''In fact, it is kind of a draw for tourists. As long as the people who come to look spend money in the neighborhood, that's all I care about.''
At the Nude-In, bystanders in sweaters and jackets circled the cluster of several dozen naked people, gawking and snapping photos with their smartphones. Two teenage girls posed with a man carrying a ''Nude Is Not Lewd'' sign and wearing nothing more than a white cowboy hat and a pair of worn leather boots.
''I brought my out-of-town guests here to show them an 'only in San Francisco' experience,'' said Maggie Cahill, 53, a technology manager at a bank who stood scrunching her nose at the scene with friends from Los Angeles. ''Where are the supermodel types?'' she asked. ''We want to know why it's always the people who should not be naked who get naked.''
Some of the nudists at the rally seemed to already be adhering to the sought-after decorum by sitting on newspapers. In fact, The San Francisco Bay Guardian, one of the city's weeklies, explicitly advertised its usefulness for just that purpose, printing a special clip-out page in last week's issue. The page pointed out that newsprint was a 100 percent recyclable seat guard, and in bold type it said: ''If you go bare, put 'er there.''

HEADLINE: Up From the Ashes, a Symbol That Hate Does Not Win

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
SPRINGFIELD, Mass.
In the hours after the 2008 election of the country's first African-American president, three white men crept up to a predominantly African-American church being built here in Springfield, blessed it corruptly with gasoline -- and faded into the fresh November night.
Soon the church's pastor, Bishop Bryant Robinson Jr., was at the crime scene's flickering edge, weary, saddened. Moments before, he had been anticipating a new chapter in American history, and now here was one page, stuck. He didn't need an investigation to tell him this was a racist act of arson. He is a black man with snow in his hair; he knew.
As he watched the new home for the Macedonia Church of God in Christ burn to the ground, Bishop Robinson imagined only one response: Rebuild. 
Now, nearly three years later, that election night's crisp air of possibility has all but faded in Washington, where the first African-American president, Barack Obama, struggles with grinding wars, a broken economy and spirit-killing partisanship. But here in Springfield, the smoke has lifted to reveal a new, 20,000-square-foot church standing on top of an old crime scene, its sanctuary walls painted the color of a clear blue sky.
Resting in one of its pews the other day, a silver cane by his side, Bishop Robinson, 74, said that this building on Tinkham Road reflects the ever-unfolding American story of race, in Washington, Springfield, everywhere. ''The hatred in our country,'' he said. ''And the goodness in our country.''
The election night burning of a New England church became national news. A ''This Land'' column shared how the pastor's father had left segregated Alabama, gathered together a congregation in Springfield, and bought an old downtown church to use as a house of worship; how his eldest son and successor, Bryant, worked for years to raise the money to build a new church on the city's outskirts; and how, when it burned down, he just knew that racism had fueled the fire.
Now, sitting in a pew, Bishop Robinson referred to another part of family history. How, in Emelle, Ala., on July 4, 1930, his grandfather and uncles found themselves in an argument with a white store owner over a car battery. How that dispute escalated into a violent, hate-filled mob scene that left several dead, white and black, including a pregnant black woman and the bishop's Uncle Esau -- who was lynched.
So, you see, Bishop Robinson just knew.
Two months after the fire, three white men in their 20s were charged with burning down the church to express their rage at the thought of a black president. Two pleaded guilty, and the third was convicted after trial, in a case that The Republican newspaper of Springfield described as a ''blot on the whole city.''
''Unfortunately, it was a confirmation of my experiences as an African-American,'' Bishop Robinson said, adding: ''My faith teaches me to forgive, and I forgive them. But I cannot be accepting of their behavior. I cannot be victimized by hatred. So I have to move forward.''
In moving forward, he and his congregation of a few hundred found outstretched hands. Donations arrived from around the country, while volunteers cleared the debris and carted away the ruined foundation. But the journey had its peaks and valleys.
For example, its leaders applied for federal assistance under the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, which was enacted after a spate of house-of-worship burnings. They filled out a checklist that asked, with bureaucratic bluntness, what the arson had destroyed:
Sanctuary (yes). Choir seating (yes). Fellowship hall (yes). Pastor's office (yes).
The Macedonia church eventually won the very last government loan guarantee available under the law, which was good. But it had trouble securing a loan for the government to back, which was bad.
That is, until Gov. Deval Patrick addressed the Urban League of Springfield in February 2010. He explained that the church had just learned that day that its bank was not inclined to provide a vital construction loan, even though the church had already paid off the loan related to its first attempt at a new home.
''I know that in this audience tonight are people who care about Macedonia,'' Mr. Patrick had said. ''Are people who understand we need this church to rise as a symbol that hate doesn't win. And I know that there are people here who are in the finance field or know people who are, who can rally to help this very, very worthy cause.''
Soon the church had the $1.8 million bank loan it needed. And construction began in earnest.
Along the way, a group called the National Coalition for Burned Churches offered rotating teams of volunteers. Here came some Catholics from suburban Chicago. Here came some Methodists and Jews from Northern California. Here came some students from Harvard, and some Congregationalists from the town of Millbury.
A few of these volunteers left behind handwritten messages on the walls concealed by the church hallway's dropped ceiling -- a form of spiritual graffiti, you might say. ''His love endures forever.'' ''May God dwell in this house forever.''
There is still work to do; the landscaping, for example, will have to wait until spring. And the need to pay for everything remains; the church, Bishop Robinson admits, is in perpetual fund-raising mode. No matter: what has risen is a large, simple structure of wonder.
A sanctuary -- yes -- with 60 wooden pews purchased from a North Carolina business called Affordable Church Furniture. Choir seating -- yes -- with many of the chairs donated by a Lutheran church. A fellowship hall -- yes -- with more than enough room for wedding receptions and funeral repasts.
And -- yes-- a pastor's office, on the very spot where gasoline was poured on that hopeful, horrible November night. ''The guys came from those woods,'' Bradford Martin Jr., the church's indefatigable lawyer, said as he led a tour through the building. ''They busted in here. They splashed it on the outside and they splashed it on the inside.''
On Saturday's misty morning, members of the Macedonia congregation gathered in their new home for a rousing dedication. Dressed in their finest, they prayed and sang and swayed.
Here was the governor of Massachusetts, and the mayor of Springfield, and a police officer who worked on the arson investigation, and, all the way from California, Charles E. Blake Sr., the presiding bishop and chief apostle of the Church of God in Christ.
And here, of course, was Bishop Robinson, steadied by his cane and giving thanks for this celebration that would not, could not, be denied.

HEADLINE: Tennessee Senator Takes a Stand for Compromise

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Insiders could spot the constraints on Lamar Alexander in the Senate at least six years ago, as the two parties fought over judicial nominations.
After a series of Democratic filibusters against the nominees of President George W. Bush, Senator Alexander helped start the bipartisan ''Gang of 14'' that worked to forestall the Republicans' ''nuclear option,'' which would have eliminated the use of filibusters to block judicial appointments. But he could not publicly join the group.
Why? He feared undercutting the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, his fellow Tennessee Republican. 
Multiply that demurral a hundredfold, and Mr. Alexander's decision last week to leave the Senate Republican leadership becomes easier to understand. So does the inability of contemporary Washington to achieve consensus on problems facing an anxious American electorate.
Congressional leaders spend more time devising rationales for permanent warfare than strategies for accommodation. Polarization by ideology as well as party, which raises the stakes in each election, permits nothing else.
It is this kind of ''political messaging'' that Mr. Alexander has abandoned. Instead he will embrace the independence enjoyed by an individual senator or a government executive, a role he has always preferred.
''What I'm best at doing is trying to set an agenda, lay out a solution and persuade at least half the people that I'm right,'' Mr. Alexander said in an interview. ''As a governor, I can do that. As a senior senator, I can do that.
''As a part of the Senate leadership, I'm restricted, because it has to reflect a consensus within the caucus.''
Party Upheavals
As governor of Tennessee, Mr. Alexander helped change the face of the state. He recruited Nissan to build an auto assembly plant employing 4,000 workers and worked with Democratic legislators to overhaul public education.
But changes in the two parties during his career have diminished openings for deal-making pragmatism.
In 1979, when Mr. Alexander became governor, self-described conservatives (31 percent) outnumbered liberals (21 percent) in the Democratic rank and file nationwide, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. Among Democrats today, the number of liberals (38 percent) dwarfs self-identified conservatives (18 percent), and moderates represent 40 percent of the members.
At the same time, the Republican base has grown more ideologically pure.
In 1979, 42 percent of Republicans said they were conservatives, outpacing moderates (35 percent) and liberals (15 percent). Today, conservatives represent 63 percent of the party's members, moderates 28 percent and liberals 6 percent.
The result is a bottom-up drive for ideological conformity. Elected officials fear primaries as much or more than general elections, increasing the risks of defying orthodoxy.
''If the voters wanted politicians with courage, they'd reward them,'' said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who has advised Mr. Alexander. ''Voters punish people who behave like that.''
So do Congressional leaders. Instead of mavericks ''out there on the edge trying to solve problems,'' said Tennessee's other Republican senator, Bob Corker, leaders prefer a ''lowest-common-denominator approach'' that preserves party unity.
No surprise, then, that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, discouraged attempts by the bipartisan ''Gang of Six'' to resolve the debt-limit crisis. That would have required Democrats to accept cuts in entitlement benefits and Republicans to accept some tax increases.
Crossing Boundaries
What was surprising was the way Mr. Alexander quietly made his way to a critical meeting and embraced the effort to find common ground.
''The whole character of that room changed when Lamar stood up and, without a lot of qualification, said, 'I'm in,' '' recalled Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia.
Mr. Alexander had warned Mr. McConnell, whom he has known for four decades, since both were young Senate aides. He would not discuss Mr. McConnell's reaction.
''I don't have to agree with him all the time,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''I just have to not surprise him.''
Of course, Mr. McConnell's resistance prevailed. Soon Mr. Alexander was on a fishing trip drafting his departure statement.
He is, to be sure, avoiding a contest for the position of Republican whip, which he might have lost to Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who leads the party's campaign arm. Some distance from leadership might help him win a third term from Tennessee voters in 2014.
But it also frees him to work across party lines on deficit reduction, the storage of nuclear waste and ideas for economic growth that some Republicans disdain.
''Roads and bridges and national laboratories and college scholarships all ought to be part of our jobs program,'' Mr. Alexander said.
In a Senate requiring 60 votes to overcome perpetual filibusters, he added, Democrats shoulder the same responsibility for crossing boundaries.
''We could be more constructive on both sides,'' he said. ''I'm not interested in bipartisanship as a goal. I'm interested in it as a tactic to solve problems.''
That sounds like the sort of unifying message that presidential candidates take to the nation, as Barack Obama did in 2008, when he was a senator, and that Mr. Alexander attempted in unsuccessful races for the Republican nomination in 1996 and 2000. At 71, he will not be trying again.
''That wouldn't be a risk,'' Mr. Alexander concluded, laughing. ''That'd just be stupid.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Sides Dig In, Congressional Deficit-Reduction Panel Has an Uphill Fight

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As if expectations were not low enough for the special Congressional committee charged with writing a deficit-reduction deal, they seem to be falling by the day as the two parties harden their positions on spending and taxes.
Last week began with contradictory markers from President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner. Mr. Boehner reiterated that Republicans would oppose any tax increases, and then Mr. Obama, newly aggressive, warned that he would veto any measure that would trim Medicare benefits without also raising taxes on the wealthy.
Each man was reinforcing a stand that most lawmakers in their respective parties had already taken, which is why talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner broke down twice in July.
The week ended with the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate at an impasse over a routine but essential measure for financing government operations for the new fiscal year (which will start on Saturday), with Republicans demanding more spending cuts to offset domestic disaster aid. Some Republicans have pushed for even deeper short-term cuts than were agreed to in August in the deal to raise the federal debt ceiling. 
Against that backdrop, few in Washington see a politically realistic way for the 12 members of the joint House-Senate deficit committee, six from each party, to meet their mandate to identify at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions over 10 years. People in both parties worry that the panel, which plans to meet privately this week, could fall far short of that goal or deadlock altogether, with potentially damaging economic consequences.
''Democrats cannot accept another 'spending cuts only' bill that makes them look like they got rolled,'' said Maya MacGuineas, fiscal policy director at the New America Foundation, a centrist research group. ''And Republicans will not accept new revenues. So I just can't envision how they get to $1.2 trillion.''
The result would be $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts in January 2013 -- half from Pentagon programs, a prospect that is raising alarms in the military and among defense contractors. More immediately, another episode of political dysfunction like the one that preceded the parties' last-minute deal to raise the debt limit last month could risk another downgrade of the nation's credit rating, representatives of the rating firms privately warned senators last week.
Under the debt limit deal, the White House and Congress set spending caps that already cut nearly $1 trillion in projected spending over 10 years. So budget analysts point out that the committee could not get an additional $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions solely through spending cuts without slicing more deeply into programs than some Republicans could support.
''Wringing all of the required deficit reduction out on the spending side would represent a very unbalanced and unhealthy diet,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The committee, created by the debt deal, only recently began work to meet its Nov. 23 deadline. If a majority of its members reach agreement, Congress must vote on their plan by Dec. 23 without filibusters or amendments -- a rare legislative fast track.
For the first time since Republicans won control of the House nearly a year ago, Democrats believe that they have the advantage -- a result, administration officials say, of terms they negotiated in the August compromise that many liberals denounced as a sell-out.
Under those terms, Republicans cannot threaten a default again to get their way, because the deal increased the debt limit enough to cover borrowing through 2012. Also, the automatic cuts in 2013 would hit military programs hard -- an outcome Republicans are more eager than Democrats to avoid -- while Medicaid and Medicare benefits are exempt.
Another factor increasing Democrats' leverage: the Bush-era tax cuts expire after 2012. Mr. Obama vows to sign an extension only for households with taxable income under $250,000; not extending the Bush rates for higher incomes would raise about $1 trillion over a decade -- though, of course, if Republicans control the White House and Congress in 2013, they could try to renew the cuts for the wealthy.
So, while they could be bluffing, some Democrats say a deadlock might be fine with them. The automatic spending cuts and the higher revenues would reduce annual deficits enough to stabilize the federal debt in this decade, without hitting entitlement benefits for Medicare and Medicaid. (Those programs' growth after this decade, however, is projected to drive deficits up again to unsustainable levels.)
A partisan impasse does hold risks for Mr. Obama. His job-creation plan would probably be a casualty. And a negative reaction in financial markets would further weaken economic growth heading into his re-election bid.
Some economists and Democrats on Wall Street say a financial crisis is not a risk because there is no threat of default this time, and because the markets have such low expectations for the panel. But other forecasters are sounding a different note.
''If we were to pick the issue that stands out most at the moment, it is the failure of governing in Washington at a time when many Americans are hurting,'' Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group of Princeton, N.J., wrote to clients last week. He cited ''a real fear that the gap between the two sides is unbridgeable.''
Should the parties stand their ground on taxes and entitlement programs, the committee could avert total failure with a package of several hundred billions of dollars in spending cuts identified in past bipartisan negotiations, including reductions in farm subsidies and federal employee retirement programs.
But many Democrats would resist. ''I don't like that because it suggests all spending cuts,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat on the panel. ''I also think we need to come up with something serious.''
Mr. Obama's preference remains the ''grand bargain'' that eluded him with Mr. Boehner -- with short-term stimulus measures and long-term deficit reduction greater than mandated for the committee, including higher revenues and savings from entitlement programs.
Last week, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Ms. MacGuineas of the New America Foundation hosted a dinner for about 60 people -- equal numbers of Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with corporate executives and economists -- to discuss how to build pressure for such a compromise. Among the guests were two members of the deficit panel, Mr. Van Hollen and Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.
The slim hopes for a grand bargain rest on the parties' mutual interest in overhauling the tax code to rein in tax breaks and using the new revenues to lower taxpayers' rates.
''Tax reform is the door opener,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''It is a way to generate revenue that both Democrats and Republicans can support.''
Several conservatives, even those who are strongly antitax, agree. ''That's the best chance we have of a big deal,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona.
But Democrats and many budget groups say some of the new revenues should go to reduce deficits, while many Republicans insist that all must go to cutting tax rates.
The chairmen of the Congressional tax committees -- Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana -- are on the deficit committee and have been discussing the issue, aides say. Their committees also have jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid.
The deficit panel would not have time to negotiate the details for changing the tax code and entitlement programs. Instead it could set deficit-reduction goals for revenues and spending and let the committees with jurisdiction fill in the details -- if Republicans and Democrats can first agree on the goals.

HEADLINE: Why the Antichrist Matters in Politics

BYLINE: By MATTHEW AVERY SUTTON. 
Matthew Avery Sutton, an associate professor of history at Washington State University, is the author of ''Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America.''

 BODY:
Pullman, Wash.
THE end is near -- or so it seems to a segment of Christians aligned with the religious right. The global economic meltdown, numerous natural disasters and the threat of radical Islam have fueled a conviction among some evangelicals that these are the last days. While such beliefs might be dismissed as the rantings of a small but vocal minority, apocalyptic fears helped drive the antigovernment movements of the 1930s and '40s and could help define the 2012 presidential campaign as well.
Christian apocalypticism has a long and varied history. Its most prevalent modern incarnation took shape a century ago, among the vast network of preachers, evangelists, Bible-college professors and publishers who established the fundamentalist movement. Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals and independents, they shared a commitment to returning the Christian faith to its ''fundamentals.'' 
Biblical criticism, the return of Jews to the Holy Land, evolutionary science and World War I convinced them that the second coming of Jesus was imminent. Basing their predictions on biblical prophecy, they identified signs, drawn especially from the books of Daniel, Ezekiel and Revelation, that would foreshadow the arrival of the last days: the growth of strong central governments and the consolidation of independent nations into one superstate led by a seemingly benevolent leader promising world peace.
This leader would ultimately prove to be the Antichrist, who, after the so-called rapture of true saints to heaven, would lead humanity through a great tribulation culminating in the second coming and Armageddon. Conservative preachers, evangelists and media personalities of the 20th century, like Billy Sunday, Aimee Semple McPherson, Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, shared these beliefs.
Fundamentalists' anticipation of a coming superstate pushed them to the political right. As the government grew in response to industrialization, fundamentalists concluded that the rapture was approaching. Their anxieties worsened in the 1930s with the rise of fascism. Obsessed with matching biblical prophecy with current events, they studied Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin, each of whom seemed to foreshadow the Antichrist.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt troubled them as well. His consolidation of power across more than three terms in the White House, his efforts to undermine the autonomy of the Supreme Court, his dream of a global United Nations and especially his rapid expansion of the government confirmed what many fundamentalists had feared: the United States was lining up with Europe in preparation for a new world dictator.
As a result, prominent fundamentalists joined right-wing libertarians in their effort to undermine Roosevelt. That this mix of millennialism and activism seemed inconsistent -- why work for reform if the world is destined for Armageddon? -- never troubled them. They simply asserted that Jesus had called them to ''occupy'' until he returned (Luke 19:13). Like orthodox Marxists who challenge capitalism even though they say they believe it represents an inevitable step on the road to the socialist paradise, conservative Christians never let their conviction that the future is already written lead them to passivity.
The world in 2011 resembles the world of the 1930s in many respects. International turmoil and a prolonged economic downturn have fueled distrust of government, as has the rise of a new libertarianism represented in the explosive growth of the Tea Party.
For some evangelicals, President Obama is troubling. The specious theories about his place of birth, his internationalist tendencies, his measured support for Israel and his Nobel Peace Prize fit their long-held expectations about the Antichrist. So does his commitment to expanding the reach of government in areas like health care.
In 2008, the campaign of Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, presciently tapped into evangelicals' apocalyptic fears by producing an ad, ''The One,'' that sarcastically heralded Mr. Obama as a messiah. Mr. McCain was onto something. Not since Roosevelt have we had a president of charisma and global popularity, who so perfectly fits the evangelicals' Antichrist mold.
While Depression-era fundamentalists represented only a small voice among the anti-Roosevelt forces of the 1930s, evangelicals have grown ever savvier and now constitute one of the largest interest groups in the Republican Party. In the past, relatively responsible leaders like Mr. Graham, who worked with Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, and even Mr. Falwell, who reined in evangelical excess in exchange for access to the Reagan White House, channeled their evangelical energy.
Not now. A leadership vacuum exists on the evangelical right that some Republicans -- Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and even Ron Paul -- are exploiting. How tightly their strident anti-statism will connect with evangelical apocalypticism remains to be seen.
The left is in disarray while libertarianism is on the ascent. A new generation of evangelicals -- well-versed in organizing but lacking moderating influences -- is lining up behind hard-right anti-statists. While few of the faithful truly think that the president is the Antichrist, millions of voters, like their Depression-era predecessors, fear that the time is short. The sentiment that Mr. Obama is preparing the United States, as Roosevelt did, for the Antichrist's global coalition is likely to grow.
Barring the rapture, Mrs. Bachmann or Mr. Perry could well ride the apocalyptic anti-statism of conservative Christians into the Oval Office. Indeed, the tribulation may be upon us.

HEADLINE: A Campaign Finance Ruling Turned to Labor's Advantage

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Labor unions are seizing on last year's landmark Supreme Court campaign finance ruling to change how they engage in politics, developing ambitious plans to influence nonunion households in the 2012 election and counter corporate money flowing into outside conservative groups.
Labor unions had initially assailed the ruling, known as Citizens United, for allowing corporations and wealthy donors to vastly expand their spending on campaigns. That has indeed happened, with the proliferation of a new generation of political action committees, known as Super PACs, that can accept unlimited donations.
But the ruling also changed the rules for unions, effectively ending a prohibition on outreach to nonunion households. Now, unions can use their formidable numbers to reach out to sympathetic nonunion voters by knocking on doors, calling them at home and trying to get them to polling places. They can also create their own Super PACs to underwrite bigger voter identification and get-out-the-vote operations than ever before.
As part of this overhaul, Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., has said organized labor will be more independent of the Democratic Party, sitting out races where unions are disappointed with the Democratic candidate's positions on issues important to them and occasionally financing primary challengers to Democratic incumbents. 
The unions said they even intended to back a few Republicans they judge to have been generally supportive of their agenda, like Representative Steven C. LaTourette of Ohio.
Mr. Trumka said unions were tired of Democratic politicians taking them for granted after labor shoveled millions of dollars into Democratic campaigns. In distancing themselves, at least a bit, from the Democrats, unions are becoming part of a trend in which newly empowered outside groups build what are essentially party structures of their own -- in this case, to somewhat offset the money flowing into conservative groups that are doing the same thing.
Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, voiced skepticism about labor's declaration of political independence, noting that union leaders have often said similar things in the past, before returning to the Democratic fold.
Labor leaders complain that after unions spent more than $200 million to help elect President Obama and Congressional Democrats in 2008, the Democrats did not deliver on labor's priorities, including a stimulus plan large enough to reinvigorate the economy and legislation that would make it far easier to unionize workers, central to labor's hopes of reversing its decline.
In an interview, Mr. Trumka said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would initially inject $10 million into its still unnamed Super PAC -- far less than the $100 million that some conservative Super PACs have -- in large part to build a year-round political structure for labor.
''The way we used to do politics is we'd set up a structure six months before the election, and after Election Day we'd dismantle it,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''Now we're going to have a full-time campaign, and that campaign will be able to move, hopefully, from electoral politics to issue advocacy and accountability,'' meaning holding union-backed lawmakers accountable.
Unions are recasting how they do politics after labor leaders reluctantly recognized their political predicament: as union membership has shrunk in recent years, it has become harder for unions -- perhaps the Democrats' most powerful ally -- to elect the candidates they support.
Michael A. Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director, said the need for a new strategy became evident last November. He said that even though unions conducted a huge campaign operation in Ohio, the labor-backed candidate for governor, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, lost to the Republican, John R. Kasich.
''It became apparent that even in races where union members voted overwhelmingly in support of a pro-worker candidate, we could still lose,'' Mr. Podhorzer said. ''President Trumka asked, 'How do we get programs that win elections and not just put up a good fight?' ''
Before the Citizens United ruling, unions were banned from using dues money to reach out to nonmembers in political campaigns, but now unions plan to campaign among the 89 percent of Americans who do not belong to unions. Union officials have long complained that when their foot soldiers knocked on doors in, say, Milwaukee or Columbus, Ohio, they wasted huge amounts of time because they could visit only union members' homes and often had to skip 90 percent of the houses. Now they can knock on every door on a block.
Many Democrats wish that money would go directly to party building or individual campaigns. Moreover, many national Democrats fear that labor will focus on state and local races -- at the expense of presidential, Senate and House races -- to help assure union survival after Republicans in Wisconsin and Ohio enacted legislation sharply limiting the power of public-sector unions.
Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said labor's political overhaul had many national Democrats worrying that unions would not be as generous and active on their behalf.
''Labor just seems to think that their challenge of survival is so great that state-by-state and ground-level fighting is more important than fighting in U.S. House and Senate races and plowing a lot of money into the presidential race,'' Mr. Cook said. ''But if we're looking at a situation where the Republicans are going to hold the House and perhaps pick up a majority of the Senate and have at least a 50-50 chance of winning the presidency, I wonder whether labor will have to re-engage at the national level.''
One example of labor's more independent approach came two weeks before Mr. Obama's jobs speech before a joint session of Congress. At a breakfast with reporters, Mr. Trumka criticized Mr. Obama as doing too little on jobs and becoming a follower, not a leader, by letting Congressional Republicans set the agenda.
He also warned that union members, dismayed with the 9.1 percent jobless rate and Mr. Obama's failure to do more about it, might not be energized enough to vote for him as many did in 2008. Union leaders like to think such words helped persuade Mr. Obama to push for a robust, $440 billion jobs program that is now before Congress.
''He's leading, and that's exactly what we asked,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''I think everyone will rally around this.''
The Service Employees International Union, often called the nation's most politically potent labor group, has also revamped its political strategy in response to Citizens United. This summer it dispatched thousands of members to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors in blue-collar neighborhoods in Cleveland, Milwaukee and a dozen other cities, aiming to educate and mobilize union and nonunion workers on economic issues.
It also helped organize a sit-in at the office of Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, to protest his plan to make sizable cuts in Medicare spending.
''We're solely focused right now on trying to get the national debate focused on jobs and everybody paying their fair share,'' said Mary Kay Henry, the S.E.I.U. president.
''It's important for us to keep our eyes on who's standing in the way of working people,'' she added. ''It's not President Obama. It's the corporations and the wealthy and the politicians they back who aren't willing to pay their fair share and are applauding efforts to dismantle government.''
Like many union leaders, she said Citizens United was far more advantageous to corporations than unions because corporations have trillions of dollars in assets at their disposal.

HEADLINE: Hearst and HGTV in a Rare Entry at the Newsstand

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
With the economy sputtering, throw pillows and wicker baskets may not be at the top of many Americans' shopping lists. Nor perhaps is a glossy magazine about where to buy them and how to make them pop against your freshly painted pale avocado walls.
Yet Hearst Magazines is betting that there are enough people out there looking for just that kind of advice, presented in a sensible and recession-friendly manner. 
Hearst and HGTV have become partners in a new magazine -- called simply enough, HGTV Magazine -- that will make its debut on newsstands at the beginning of October. It is one of the only major consumer magazines brought to market in the last few years, and the first since 2008 from one of the country's top three magazine publishers, which all shed jobs and closed publications during the last recession.
''If you try to time the market, maybe on occasion you'll get lucky,'' said David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines. ''But that's a very difficult thing to do. We operate our business in good times and bad.''
In fact, when it comes to starting a magazine, you might say Hearst has a knack for pretty lousy timing.
SmartMoney, which it started with Dow Jones in 1992, hit newsstands in the thick of the early 1990s economic slump. The Food Network Magazine was introduced at the end of 2008, when the economy and stock market were in free fall, and the publishing world was in retreat.
For the record, both are still in business and doing quite well. Dow Jones bought out Hearst's half of SmartMoney last year.
And the Food Network Magazine is one of the strongest-performing magazines in the business today, with ad pages and newsstand sales on the rise. It is now the third best-selling magazine by single copies for Hearst, behind only Cosmopolitan and O, The Oprah Magazine. Hearst will raise the magazine's rate base, the circulation publishers guarantee to advertisers, next year to 1.4 million from 1.3 million.
Very much mindful that lightning may not strike twice, Hearst is forgoing the route of a traditional introduction for HGTV Magazine. Instead, it is careful to describe the rollout as a test -- not an official debut -- and has committed to only two issues.
The company said it was seeing encouraging signs. About 24,000 people have subscribed at a price of $15 for 10 issues. And while advertisers in the first issue were given space free, some appear to be on board with Hearst's pitch that it has identified a new magazine category -- something that offers tips for both home and lifestyle and is not so aspirational that it is out of reach.
''Despite economic pressure, I think there's great advertising and marketing opportunities for many clients,'' said Robin Steinberg, an executive vice president for MediaVest, a leading ad buyer.
Hearst has been successful before in taking a popular television brand like Oprah and Food Network and translating it into a magazine. Such joint ventures are a staple of the company's growth strategy, allowing it to split costs and share in the profits. But whether that success can be replicated with HGTV, Ms. Steinberg said, remains to be seen.
''The challenge is benchmarking success against properties like Oprah and the Food Network,'' she added. ''Is HGTV popular enough to deliver the same consumer demand and scale? Scale isn't necessarily everything, but it's something.''
The challenge in convincing advertisers to sign on once the test phase is complete is something Hearst acknowledges will take some doing.
''I think advertisers want a little more facts behind things before you launch,'' said Michael Clinton, Hearst's marketing president and publishing director. ''I think that's changed over the last few years. In the go-go years of the early 2000s, a lot of advertisers would take a lot of fliers on a lot of new things. Now in a post-recessionary world, they scrutinize their budgets a lot more.''
Television ratings suggest that HGTV's scale could work in the new magazine's favor. When the Food Network Magazine came out in November 2008, an average of 930,000 viewers were tuning in to the channel each night during prime time, according to Nielsen. HGTV draws an average of 1.3 million viewers now, many of whom have probably seen HGTV Magazine promotions during programs like ''House Hunters'' and ''Design Star.''
Though the magazine contains many elements of HGTV programming, it consists primarily of original features that span the entirety of domestic life -- from fruit-washing to family feuds.
Ellen Levine, Hearst's editorial director, said the point is to get readers to think, ''This is how I live, only a little better.''
The magazine includes plenty of budget friendly home decor tips like where to find less expensive versions of high-end home products. That $4,800 mahogany and leather nightstand? A similar one can be yours for just $499.
Can't afford to redecorate your living room? Try changing your lampshades. Is that new Louis XV-style wing chair out of your budget? Reupholster the one you have for a fraction of the cost.
''This is not a magazine that wants to lecture you on how to have a perfect home or a perfect life, because there is no such thing,'' said Sara Peterson, editor in chief of HGTV Magazine. ''It doesn't feel intimidating and off-limits. This is an accessible and relatable 'you can live like this' magazine.''
In that sense, the magazine will not compete directly with the traditional shelter books like Architectural Digest or Veranda, with their elegantly staged photographs. Nor will it compete directly with Martha Stewart Living or Real Simple, with their almost too-beautiful-to-eat meal spreads.
The shelves pictured in HGTV Magazine can be cluttered, the floors strewn with children's toys. Before joining the HGTV Magazine, Ms. Peterson was editor of Coastal Living.
Mr. Carey, with his experience in Portfolio, a Conde Nast publication that arrived in 2007, at the height of a stock bubble, and folded in less than two years, is mindful of the high expectations a new magazine carries.
''If you got to pick a time to roll out a product,'' he said, ''I'd take the tougher time because success will mean a lot more.''

HEADLINE: In a Bronx Complex, Doing Good Mixes With Looking Good

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Sometime late this winter people will start moving into Via Verde, the subsidized housing development now rising on a long, narrow slice of formerly contaminated city property in what used to be one of the worst stretches of the South Bronx.
The co-ops and rentals for low- and moderate-income residents spiral around what will be a leafy, semi-enclosed court. Single-family town houses are taking shape alongside a 20-story apartment tower overlooking the sea of housing complexes that have transformed the neighborhood in recent years.
The rebirth of the South Bronx isn't news. But Via Verde is. And it makes as good an argument as any new building in the city for the cultural and civic value of architecture. The profession, or in any case much talk about it, has been fixated for too long on brand-name luxury objects and buildings as sculptures instead of attending to the richer, broader, more urgent vein of public policy and community engagement, in which aesthetics play a part. 
Via Verde helps shift the conversation. Like all good architecture, it is handsome. Unlike too much, it goes out of its way to be healthy. It evolved out of a competition five years ago, organized by Shaun Donovan, then commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, now President Obama's secretary of housing and urban development. The idea was to spur developers to team with architects in combining the latest green concepts with high-quality architecture for a public-housing project, a ''beacon,'' as Mr. Donovan put it to me the other day, that would ''re-engage design with the issue of affordable housing.''
By this Mr. Donovan meant that the historic calamities of urban renewal, which compounded the despair after the burning of the Bronx years ago, had caused many architects to shy away from the community sphere. Timidity has combined with what Robert Ivy, chief executive of the American Institute of Architects, lamented recently as ''the binge culture'' of the last decade or so: advances in new digital technologies and materials coincided with unprecedented private wealth to cause architecture to join the conga line of fashion and art.
The competition for Via Verde, at Brook Avenue and East 156th Street, emerged from a different ethos. The winning team paired Jonathan Rose, a for-profit developer known for social engagement, and Phipps Houses Group, a nonprofit outfit with a long history in subsidized housing. They enlisted two architectural firms, the glamorous, high-profile London-based Grimshaw Architects, for whom this was an unusual project, and Dattner Architects, from New York, for whom it wasn't.
The four players began the right way, by asking people in the neighborhood what kind of building they wanted.
The answer: they wanted a healthy place to live.
Green design, when it hasn't been turned into a gimmick and marketing device, has mostly been pushed publicly for its environmental benefits and lower energy costs. But the promotion of health is green's other, less trumpeted side. What is a healthy building?
Asthma rates are high in the South Bronx, obesity commonplace, access to fruits and vegetables limited because supermarkets are, as always in poor neighborhoods, scarce, and the city's population of Korean grocers is dwindling. In an ideal world new housing would be developed hand in hand with new schools and supermarkets that sell fresh produce. But for Via Verde the question was what a housing development on its own could do to shape and change behavior.
The developers and architects came up with some simple answers -- usually the best kind.
A medical clinic was enlisted to occupy the retail space on the ground floor of the tower. The footprints of the buildings were made narrower than usual to allow apartments to wrap around the central courtyard and give them two outside exposures for cross ventilation, along with ceiling fans to discourage the use of air-conditioners. The buildings were also massed to peak along the lot's long north-south axis to take maximum advantage of natural light. Staircases were placed before the elevators in the hallways and the stairwells were given windows, to nudge people to walk.
A fitness center was devised not for the basement but for the prime spot, with a load of light and great views on Via Verde's signature feature: 40,000-square-feet of terraced roof atop the town houses planted with garden plots and fruit trees. Communal garden plots on the roof will let tenants grow their own fruits and vegetables and provide a destination for walkers who can either climb up to them from the courtyard or step down to them after a workout.
Unlike so many public-housing projects, Via Verde rethinks the mix of private and public spaces to encourage residents to spend time outside, in the fresh air. It breaks the mold of subsidized housing whereby clinics, low-income rentals and home ownership are all conceived, financed and regulated separately. Piecing them together, it takes the healthier, holistic tack. Healthy design comes down to fundamentals in this case: air, light, places to stroll, things to look at.
Which is Via Verde's other distinction: its premium on looks.
This is a fairly radical proposition in the universe of subsidized housing. Many advocates for the homeless demand that every penny spent on public housing be squeezed to construct the maximum number of new apartments. No wonder. Thousands of homeless families and others waiting for decent homes need those apartments. Higher costs for green construction have, over recent years, come to be accepted as investments in long-term savings. But spending extra for anything as intangible as elegance or architectural distinction? In Via Verde's case maybe 5 percent more, by Mr. Rose's estimate, went into the project's roof and its fine, multipanel, multicolor facade, with big windows, sunshades and balconies. What is the value of architectural distinction? How, morally speaking, can it be weighed against the need for homes?
In terms of equitability and self-worth Via Verde does more than just aim to provide decent housing that fits noiselessly into its neighborhood. It aims to stand out, aesthetically, formally, as a foreground building, not another background one: to anchor the urban hodgepodge around it and make the area look more coherent, which in this case entails not echoing its context but redefining it. What is that worth?
I watched the other day, from the end of the long line waiting for $1 slices at the pizza place that I have come to like a few blocks away, as a young mother pushing a stroller laden with Duane Reade shopping bags, her small children devouring grape snow cones from a shaved-ice pushcart vendor, stopped to gaze and point at Via Verde's shiny facade when it suddenly appeared around a corner.
After polishing off my slice, I passed a young couple inside an office at Via Verde, prospective residents, sitting rigid and eager beneath one of the whirling ceiling fans before a woman shuffling papers at a desk. The complex, with 71 co-ops and 151 rental apartments, is harder to get into than some of the toughest colleges. Some 800 families have applied for the co-ops alone.
There is the usual bureaucratic calculus at work in determining the mix of incomes and tenants, the goal being to bring together renters and owners, poor and middle-class residents who, by virtue of the pride and pleasure they share in Via Verde, will want to take care of the building and contribute to the long-term welfare of the neighborhood.
That's the delight part of Via Verde. At the groundbreaking ceremony Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, recalled the bad old days. ''Let it be known,'' he said, ''that where the Bronx once burned we are building gardens in the sky.'' Put differently, architecture doesn't solve unemployment or poverty, and neighborhoods rise or fall as decent places to live on the quality of their background buildings, which do and should predominate. But they're distinguished by their landmarks, by the buildings and places that people come to love.
The greenest and most economical architecture is ultimately the architecture that is preserved because it's cherished. Bad designs, demolished after 20 years, as so many ill-conceived housing projects have been, are the costliest propositions in the end.
Of course a building consists of more than its skin and the claims of its makers. Its aesthetics remain inseparable from its function. It has to work, for the people who use it and live with it, not just see it. The real test for Via Verde -- watch this space -- will be once its residents have settled in, to see how green and healthy and gracious they actually find it.
Meanwhile one thing's already certain. With the economy struggling and poverty rising, the project points architecture, and the architectural conversation, in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Pennies From Many

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE. 
Amy Cortese is the author of ''Locavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How to Profit From It.''

 BODY:
AS Congress considers President Obama's job package, one measure seems to have rare bipartisan support: a proposal to loosen some of the outdated securities regulations that hamper small businesses in raising capital.
The Obama administration, not surprisingly considering its own success in gathering small donations during his campaign for the presidency, is supporting crowdfunding, a financing model that relies on collecting small sums of money from many people over the Internet.
Crowdfunding has the sort of populist, common-sense appeal that resonates with free-market libertarians and champions of the working class. By marrying online social networks with finance, this model offers a more democratic model of finance, in which individuals can directly fund other individuals or businesses that they deem worthy, without going through a bank or Wall Street middleman. 
It's the sort of person-to-person (or P2P, in industry jargon) funding that characterized financial transactions for millennia, before our mediated, securitized financial system took hold. The popular appeal of crowdfunding can be seen in the success of sites like Kiva, a microlender, and Kickstarter, which lets people donate money to artistic ventures. In its first six years, Kiva has arranged nearly $250 million in loans from more than 600,000 individuals to microentrepreneurs around the globe. Kickstarter users are pledging funds at a rate of $2 million a week.
But let's be clear: this is philanthropy. In the case of Kiva, lenders get their money back (assuming there is no default), but earn no interest. And beyond a few tokens of appreciation, Kickstarter members get only the satisfaction of seeing an undertaking they support come to life. That's because if either site were to allow members to earn a return on their money, they would be subject to federal and state laws governing the sale of securities.
Under those laws, crafted largely in the 1930s, the sites would have to either limit the fund-raising to wealthy investors, who the S.E.C. deems sophisticated, or go through a registration process that would prove too costly given the small sums being sought.
For a glimpse of what is possible, look at Britain, where securities laws are helpful to crowdfunding and several start-ups are vying to be the Facebook of finance. The year-old Funding Circle, a business-lending site based in London, raises more than $2.3 million each month for small businesses from individuals who can invest as little as $30 and earn an average yield of roughly 7.3 percent after fees. Those are loans; two other start-ups are applying the model to equity shares in small companies.
In the United States, these outdated laws are cutting off a huge pool of potential capital for small, private businesses that have been all but abandoned by banks and Wall Street. The proposed crowdfunding changes would make it easier for entrepreneurs to tap ordinary investors -- often customers or people in their social networks -- for funds, with the promise of a return.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering proposals to ease restrictions on crowdfunding. One petition, prepared in 2010 by the Sustainable Economies Law Center and, fittingly, paid for by a grass-roots crowdfunding effort, asks the S.E.C. to permit entrepreneurs to raise up to $100 per individual and an aggregate of up to $100,000 without requiring expensive registration and disclosure.
President Obama, as part of his jobs act, advocates an exemption for sums totaling up to $1 million. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, has drafted legislation that would allow companies to obtain up to $5 million from individuals through crowdfunded ventures, with a cap of $10,000 per investor, or 10 percent of their annual incomes, whichever is smaller.
There are real concerns. The S.E.C. must balance its dual mission of facilitating investment and protecting investors, and as we all know, snake-oil salesmen are alive and well on the Internet. Furthermore, Wall Street banks are likely to fight any efforts to encourage crowdfunding because it cuts them out of the equation. But the potential rewards outweigh the risks. With such sums, the hazard to any single investor is limited. And information is more freely available today than in the 1930s, when the regulations were written.
Besides, isn't this the type of innovation we should be encouraging? Unlike exotic derivatives and super-fast trading algorithms, crowdfunding generates capital for job-creating small businesses. As Congress debates the merits of the president's jobs plan, a crowdfunding exemption should be given a serious hearing -- and the slow-moving S.E.C. a serious prod.

HEADLINE: The Best Countries for Non-Mothers

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Rankings of the best countries for women do not incorporate the right data and fail to acknowledge the importance of child care, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
It's so great to live in a country where women are allowed to drive! It would be so much fun to visit Iceland, where the prime minister is a woman who is cleaning up the financial mess!
The recently released Newsweek/Daily Beast list of the top-ranked countries for women shows the United States in the respectable, though certainly not superlative, eighth position.
Good to celebrate. But before getting too chipper, consider the methodology used to rank 165 countries on "expansive rights and quality of life." It assesses women's economic success in terms of their ability to emulate men's traditional gender roles, with no consideration of support for raising children or caring for other dependent family members.

The economics domain, one of five quantitative clusters used to construct the index, includes four components:
 Whether women can work in all industries
 Percentage of women in the labor force
 Women's wages as a percentage of men's
 Ability of women to rise to positions of enterprise leadership
These measures are especially important for assessing women's earnings, but they say little about family income or vulnerability to poverty.
Single women without children rely largely on their own earnings. But the economic well-being of mothers is heavily influenced by assistance (both financial and direct) from fathers and by publicly provided family allowances or tax subsidies for child rearing. Further, mothers' ability to find and keep decent jobs is shaped by public policies such as paid family leaves from work.
As I pointed out in a previous post about best-country-for-women rankings, it's easier to measure rights and achievements than obligations and commitments. Still, there's plenty of international data available on percentages of families maintained by mothers alone, mothers living in poverty and differences in support for employed parents.
Jody Heymann, founding director of the Institute for Health and Social Policy at McGill University, offers an excellent overview of policy issues in her book "Forgotten Families."
Public support for family care, particularly generous in Nordic countries, tends to improve women's ability to combine paid and unpaid work, explaining why Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland are each ranked higher than the United States on the Newsweek/Daily Beast list.
But the rankings would change considerably if policies relevant to mothers were factored in. For instance, consideration of early childhood education and paid leaves from work would move France up from its 12th position on the list and move the United States way down.
The underlying problem is that most journalists, like most economists, define work as a paid activity and consider family care a form of leisure - a lifestyle choice.
But consider what happens when caregivers reduce their supply of unpaid labor and we must purchase substitutes for the services they provide. Our cost of living goes up.
Our future economic prospects also go down. Family care has huge consequences for the composition and capabilities of our national labor force, as well as the quality of our daily lives.
Family care requires money as well as time, and high unemployment rates in this country have hit young mothers particularly hard. More than 40 percent of households headed by women now live in poverty. Among children, poverty rates have reached 22 percent.
Reduced public commitments to safety net programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families have increased economic vulnerability. The share of single mothers who have become "disconnected," reporting no income and no welfare assistance, increased to one in five in 2009 from one in eight in 1996.
A recent Urban Institute report estimates that more than 10 percent of mothers living in poverty are experiencing severe depression, posing risks to the healthy development of their infants or toddlers.
Just how much would it cheer these mothers up to learn that a woman holds a position of enterprise leadership at Newsweek/The Daily Beast?
Next time you see a ranking of countries best for women, ask which women, exactly, are being ranked.

HEADLINE: Police Badges Lose a Bit More of Their Luster

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Even among those of us who normally give the police a benefit of the doubt, heads are shaking over recent behavior. Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs. 

 BODY:
These are not the finest days for the crew that calls itself New York's Finest.
Over the weekend, a grand jury in the Bronx was reported to have indicted 17 police officers for having performed a special form of magic: making traffic summonses disappear for the benefit of the overprivileged. The accused officers, among them a raft of police union delegates, are supposed to turn themselves in this week, perhaps as early as Monday, to be charged formally with bribery, perjury, official misconduct and other crimes. No "perp walks" for them, apparently.
As police scandals go, the ticket-fixing business seems relatively small bore compared with gothic tales from the past. 
It lacks the cinematic sweep of the departmentwide corruption exposed four decades ago by Detectives Frank Serpico and David Durk. It is not as appalling as the outrages of the "Dirty 30," officers in the 30th Precinct in Harlem charged two decades ago with stealing guns, drugs and cash. It is certainly not as horrifying as the depravity of the "Mafia cops," Stephen Caracappa and Louis J. Eppolito, who are spending the rest of their days in prison for having served as assassins for the mob.
Still, when it comes to tarnishing the Police Department, the latest indictments will do. Hundreds of officers have been linked to the scandal. Many are expected to face departmental discipline even if they escaped criminal charges.
Naturally, if someone took a bribe, someone else had to have offered it. It would do us all good to learn who in the upper tiers of New York political and social circles may have weaseled their way out of fines after behaving badly behind the wheel.
Even among those of us whose normal default position is to give the police a benefit of the doubt, heads are shaking over recent behavior by those we entrust with a uniform, a badge and a gun.
Last month, Officer Michael Pena was charged with grabbing a woman off the street in Inwood, in northern Manhattan, and raping her at gunpoint. The police are investigating whether Officer Pena was involved in other rape cases. 
 Also last month, two certified Police Department bozos received jail sentences in the infamous case of a young woman who accused them of having raped her in her apartment while she was in a drunken stupor. A jury had acquitted the officers of rape but found them guilty of misdemeanor official misconduct. That the two men, Kenneth Moreno and Franklin L. Mata, disgraced the uniform is incontestable. Mr. Moreno was sentenced to a year in jail, Mr. Matato two months.
Now we have questions about whether some officers can control themselves when dealing with political protesters they may dislike.
Similar questions were raised in the mass arrests of demonstrators - and some bystanders - during the 2004 Republican National Convention. Hundreds upon hundreds of people were rounded up then in the course of expressing their views about the state of the country. Charges were later dropped in nearly all cases.
The latest episode turns on the arrests of dozens of men and women who have been protesting an American economic system they deem unjust. On Saturday, they marched to Union Square from an encampment that they had set up a week earlier near Wall Street. Some of them seemed primed for confrontation with the police. But others merely voiced their grievances.
A few young women were stopped by the police just south of Union Square and corralled on a stretch of sidewalk with plastic netting held by officers. An amateur video posted on the Internet shows an officer in a white shirt - signifying fairly high rank - walking up to the women and dousing them with pepper spray. The officer then walks away, disappearing behind a wall of blue uniforms. The women fall to the sidewalk, crying in pain. 
In the video, there is no sign of their having been violent or posing a threat. A police spokesman, in defending use of the spray, offered a veiled suggestion that the video might have been edited to make the officer look bad. 
No such doctoring was evident, though. There was also no indication that the department intended to investigate this event.
But in an age of ever-present cameras, smartphones and other recording devices, the police are surely aware that their behavior is subject to scrutiny as much as anyone else's. In a sense, they, too, have been Mirandized.
There are situations in which anything they say - or do - can and sometimes will be used against them.

HEADLINE: Do ALL Parents Love One Child More?

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A Time magazine cover lets the chance for a more nuanced conversation slip by. 

 BODY:
If you aren't talking about this already, you will be soon. The cover of the latest issue of Time magazine carries the title "Why Mom Liked You Best: The Science of Favoritism." The article is by Jeffrey Kluger, who is as good a journalist as I've ever read, but on this one I think he got it wrong.
He writes: "It's one of the worst-kept secrets of family life that ALL parents have a preferred son or daughter."
The capital letters are mine -- and that word, , is what got me riled up reading the article. It is a sensational approach to the reality that parents certainly have different relationships with their children, and often have unequal relationships with those children. But it is so much more nuanced than Mr. Kluger suggests, making his article a lost opportunity for a more complex conversation. 
Let's start with the second part of the Time headline: The SCIENCE of Favoritism. Those capital letters are mine, too, because I read the article looking for the I expected a new study, and when I found it, I planned to pounce and write an entire post on it. But it just wasn't there.
There was one 2005 study, by Katherine Conger at the University of California, Davis (whose name Mr. Kluger appears to have misspelled), who visited nearly 400 sets of parents and their children three times over three years. She asked them questions and videotaped their interactions, then concluded that "65 percent of mothers and 70 percent of fathers exhibited a preference for once child, usually the older one."
Sixty-five, even 70 percent, is not ALL.
Mr. Kluger then goes on to look at the animal kingdom, and from that concludes that we are biologically programmed to prefer one child over the others.
He writes:
As with so much else in child-rearing behavior, it begins with the parents' survival needs: the biologically narcissistic act of replicating themselves through succeeding generations. This impels Mom and Dad to tilt in favor of their biggest, healthiest offspring, since those kids will be more reproductively successful and get more of the family's genes into the next generation.
That kind of reductionist, bottom-line behavior is something we share with creatures throughout the animal kingdom. A crested-penguin mother will kick the smaller of her two eggs out of the nest, the better to focus on the presumably heartier chick in the bigger shell. A black-eagle mother will watch idly while her bigger chick rips her smaller one to ribbons.
Okaaaaay. So this is part of survival of the fittest, and we are programmed (all of us) to act this way, which means all of us prefer our first born, right?
No, Mr. Kluger writes. Because sometimes it's the youngest.
That's not the only contradiction in the argument. There are dads who prefer daughters, and dads who prefer sons; mothers are equally unpredictable. There is evidence that parents prefer the biggest, strongest, most charismatic child, and evidence that they prefer the smallest and weakest, the one who needs them most. Some parents prefer the child most like them, while others clash most with that child. The only son or only daughter gets singled out -- for special treatment, or higher expectations.
In other words, all parents' relationships with all their children are all different. And all parents already know that.
Do I believe that some parents have a favorite? Absolutely. I also agree that consistent favoritism is scarring for children, and in the video below, from this morning's "Today" show (I make a fleeting appearance), Dr. Gail Saltz gives excellent tips about how to make sure your children all feel secure in your love.

By framing the subject as it does, however, the Time article will start a hot debate over the wrong question. It's easy to take sides and announce "I love my children equally" or confess "I think I love one more." What's hard is accepting that relationships are fluid, determined by the ever-changing variables that make a child (and a parent) who they are at any given moment. Those ups and downs, imbalances and inequities, are not something to overcome, but rather realities to be accepted. We treat them differently because they ARE different. Navigating that reality is the key to being a parent.

HEADLINE: Our New Architecture Critic Talks About His Mission. It Starts in the Bronx.

BYLINE: MICHAEL KIMMELMAN


HIGHLIGHT: I start covering the architecture beat today with a review of Via Verde, a housing project now rising in the South Bronx. 

 BODY:
I start covering the architecture beat today with areview of Via Verde, a housing project now rising in the South Bronx. It provides an occasion to start a conversation, to give you a place to respond to what's written and post your own news about what you think is most important in terms of architecture and the built environment.
A few of my own concerns are laid out in the review. I'm interested in urbanism, city planning, housing and social affairs, the environment and health, politics and culture -- in all the ways we live, in other words, and not just in how buildings look or who designs them, although those things are inseparable from the rest. The influence on architecture of social scientists and medical experts now investigating how actually to quantify the success and failure of buildings, to establish criteria of proof, an increasingly important word, in terms of, say, the claims of green and healthy sites, seems no less urgent than Zaha Hadid's or Norman Foster's latest undertaking. Who uses works of architecture, and how, and who benefits from them and who doesn't, also matters, obviously, and from Colombia to Coney Island, Dubai to Detroit, ways of rethinking these issues have already begun to reshape thinking in architecture schools and offices and beyond.
The idea here is to help bring the conversation to a broad public. I will add my 2 cents to the forum occasionally, but hope the site will develop a life of its own. Selfishly, I'm also figuring to learn about what's going on from you.
To get the ball rolling, I wonder what thoughts anybody might have about the relationship between aesthetics and public service as in the case of subsidized housing, and, in terms of urban renewal and social equity, what's the difference between situating projects like Via Verde in poor neighborhoods and rich ones?
The floor is open. I've just joined Twitter @kimmelman.

HEADLINE: Peace, Quiet and Solitude for Sale

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's Appraisal: Rat Island, near City Island in Long Island Sound, is for sale. If you owned a private island in New York City, what would you do with it? 

 BODY:
Ever dream of owning your own island in New York City? Now's your chance. 
This week, the Appraisal takes a boat ride to Rat Island, a privately owned patch of vacant land that will be auctioned on Sunday. Granted, it is on the small side (2.5 acres), and it lacks electricity, running water and the usual residential amenities. But it does offer privacy, quiet and marine views from a rocky outcropping near City Island in the Long Island Sound. 
Offered for sale in 2009 for $300,000, it could end up going for less. If you held the winning bid for Rat Island, what would you do with it?

HEADLINE: For Bills Fans, Now More Than a Glimmer of Hope

BYLINE: DAVE SEMINARA


HIGHLIGHT: A victory over the Patriots has raised hopes in Buffalo and beyond. 

 BODY:
Bills fans didn't make off with the goal posts at Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday but after the stunning come-from-behind, 34-31 win over the Patriots, beleaguered Bills backers everywhere are feeling strangely optimistic about a team few believed in prior to the start of the season. 
One fan texted the team's flagship radio station that he "cried in his mother's arms" after the win. Hundreds of Bills backers sang the team's fight song--"Shout"--outside the Laughing Man bar in Washington, D.C., after the game to the bewilderment of passersby on the street. A high school friend who loves the Bills wrote on Facebook: "I feel like its 1987 and the Bills are at the dawn of the Kelly/Reed/Smith/Thomas/Talley era and this team is on the verge of something great." 
My cousin colored her Facebook profile with a photo of a t-shirt emblazoned with Tom Brady's face with a word that is not printable in a family newspaper's website beneath it. A fan from Boone, N.C., posting on the Buffalo News' site, compared the win to the 1980 U.S. Hockey team's triumph over the Soviets at Lake Placid. 
Perhaps the Bills didn't help end the Cold War, but they did finally manage to slay Buffalo's equivalent of an evil empire: Tom Brady and the Patriots. Brady seemed to represent everything that Bills' fans hate--the kind of good-looking, wealthy, successful elite who looks down his nose at places like Buffalo. In truth, he's never uttered a bad word about the city or its fans, but somehow we're sure he looks down on us. But on Sunday, Bills' fans could finally rejoice, as Brady was humbled to the tune of four interceptions and was reduced to standing idly on the sideline as Buffalo ran out the clock before banging home the winning kick with just three seconds left in the game.
Are Bills fans like me getting carried away? Of course we are. But let's take stock of the situation. A team that started the season ranked #31 in ESPN's power rankings, and #30 on Fox Sports' list, is 3-0 and in sole possession of first place in the A.F.C East. No N.F.L. team has come back from deficits of 18 points or more to win two weeks in a row in at least 60 years. With 113 points scored, they lead the N.F.L. with an average of nearly 38 points per game. 
Heady stuff for a fan base that has been more preoccupied with Ralph Wilson's mortality and the nightmare of the team potentially leaving town than any realistic playoff dreams for the last decade. Realists have brought some us back down to earth with a reminder that in 2008 the team started out 4-0, but finished the season 7-9. A cautionary note to be sure, but a look at the teams the Bills beat to start that season reveals that that hopeful 4-0 start was essentially a mirage. Those Bills beat Seattle, Jacksonville, Oakland and St. Louis--four teams that went a combined 16-48 that year with none winning more than five games. The Bills' first victim--the Chiefs--are obviously not a good team, but the Raiders and the Patriots look very much like playoff contenders. 
It's also worth noting that undefeated starts have also propelled the Bills deep into the playoffs in the past. The '91 and '92 teams, which made it to the Super Bowl, started 5-0 and 4-0. And in '88, a Bills squad that had missed the playoffs six times in a row started 4-0 and finished 12-4, before losing to Icky Woods and the Bengals in the A.F.C. Championship game. 
According to ESPN, 76 per cent of teams that start the season 3-0 make the playoffs and the Bills' remaining schedule appears to be favorable. If they go 3-2 in their remaining division games, which should be realistic given the fact that the Dolphins appear to be weak, the Bills would probably need just a 4-4 split against their eight remaining non-division opponents to make the postseason. The Bills are favored to win at Cincinnati next week, and home games against Tennessee, Washington and Denver look like winnable games for Buffalo, at least at this rather giddy moment. 
But of course, Bills fans know better than most that there's still plenty of time for everything to fall apart. Western New York and the Buffalo diaspora are in love with this team and at the moment, no one wants to dwell on any of the Bills' glaring weaknesses. After an 11-year playoff drought, who can blame us for seeing rainbows where others notice storm clouds off in the distance? 
Sunday was a great day for the Rust Belt, with big wins for the Lions, Browns and the Bills. Perhaps 2011 will be the year when these cities finally become associated with something more positive than gloomy economic forecasts and lame jokes from people who live in more glamorous locales. 
When Ryan Fitzpatrick's second pass of the day deflected off of Bills' wide receiver Donald Jones and right into the hands of Patriots' cornerback Kyle Arrington early in the first quarter, it looked like it was going to be yet another day where the ball simply didn't bounce the Bills' way. 
But soon thereafter, the team's luck changed, and by the end of the game, even a call that went against them--the Fred Jackson touchdown that was overturned after video review with 1:43--worked in their favor. The football gods may or may or may not be ready to smile on the Bills as the season unfolds, but for the first time in years there is justifiable hope in Buffalo.

HEADLINE: All's Fair in NYC

BYLINE: FELIX BURRICHTER


HIGHLIGHT: The Pavilion of Art &#038; Design is coming to New York for the first time from Nov. 10 to Nov. 14 at the Park Avenue Armory. 

 BODY:
First the Frieze Art Fair announced the inauguration of its New York offshoot, in May 2012. Now, another high-end fair, the Pavilion of Art & Design (or PAD) is coming to New York for the first time, from Nov. 10 to Nov. 14 at the Park Avenue Armory.
PAD started in Paris in 1997, when it was known by the slightly less catchy name Pavillon des Antiquaires et des Galeries d'Art. In 2007 it introduced its London site. "Now that we have successfully established PAD in Paris and London, it feels only natural to come to New York," says Patrick Perrin, who founded the fair with Stephane Custot.
PAD's emphasis on modern art as well as 19th-, 20th- and 21st-century decorative arts and design reflects its founders' respective areas of expertise: Custot is a partner in Hopkins-Custot gallery in Paris, which specializes in modern and contemporary art; Perrin is a design author and furniture collector and dealer. (He opened both Galerie Perrin, a Parisian gallery for 17th-to-19th-century French furniture, and the famed Salon du Dessin, a fair for Old Master drawings.)
"We love every single kind of art, every single period," Perrin exclaimed. "We're interested in everything - eclecticism is our goal." Indeed, there will be what he describes as "lots of 20th-century paintings, photographs and so-called primitive art,"at the fair's 52 galleries from France, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and the United States. In addition to 20th-century furnishings by evergreens like Jean Prouve and Charlotte Perriand, there will also be a particularly broad mix of design, from Victorian jewelry (Primavera Gallery, New York) to contemporary furniture by Nendo or Studio Job (Carpenters Workshop Gallery, London).
What led to scheduling PAD in November, outside of the regular New York art fair calendar? "It's perfect because it's during the fall auction season," Perrin explains, "and it's two weeks before Thanksgiving, so people stay in the city to work." Perrin is also confident that the fair's proximity to all the major uptown museums and cultural institutions will help weave it into the uptown cultural circuit. One thing he doesn't want to waste too much time thinking about is whether the current economic climate lends itself to starting an art fair. "Should we stop breathing?" Perrin shoots back, almost indignantly. Clearly for him, and for the sophisticated clientele PAD seeks to attract, collecting isn't only about investing - it's in the blood. For more information, go to padny.net.
An article in the Fall issue of T Design on the Pavilion of Art & Design New York show incorrectly stated the names of the designers whose work will be shown by the Carpenters Workshop Gallery. They include Sebastian Brajkovic, Mathieu Lehanneur, Robert Stadler, and Robert Charles Trevelyan, not Nendo and Studio Job.

HEADLINE: Losing Faith in Government

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Americans' confidence in their government is at record lows. And this perception matters in the effectiveness of any policies. 

 BODY:
Washington's dysfunctional political climate not only makes it harder for Congress to pass sound economic policy. It also means that whatever policies Congress manages to pass may be ineffective anyway, since Americans have lost so much confidence in their government's ability to help.
Americans' confidence in their government is at historic lows, according to Gallup's annual governance survey.
The poll of 1,017 adults, conducted in early September, found that 81 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way the country is being governed, the highest share since the question was first asked in 1972.
Additionally, 69 percent of Americans say they have little or no confidence in the legislative branch of government, also a record high, and nearly three times the share of people who said this in 1972.
Americans estimate that the federal government wastes 51 cents of every dollar it spends, the highest number on record since that question was first asked in 1979. (Because the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points, however, that is not a statistically significant difference from last year's poll, when Americans said 50 cents of every dollar the government spent was wasted.)
Almost half of Americans (49 percent) believe the federal government "poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens." In 2003, less than a third of Americans said they believed this.
Perhaps most worrisome, Americans' trust and confidence in the government's ability to handle policy problems has plummeted.
The light green line above shows that just 43 percent of Americans say they have "a great deal or fair amount" of trust in the federal government to handle domestic problems. That is lower than it was at any time in the past four decades.
If we have another federal government shutdown in the next few days, which is entirely possible, these sentiments will only get worse.
My concern about these survey responses isn't that they might hurt politician's feelings. It's that, in order for government policy to be effective, people must it will be effective. This is as true for economic policy as it is for anything else.
In particular, part of the reason that economic stimulus works is that it gives consumers and businesses confidence that the economy will improve. That belief becomes self-fulfilling as they feel more comfortable increasing their purchases and investments.
Likewise, if Americans believe that Congress cannot be counted upon to do anything that will help the economy, nothing that Congress does -- no matter how well designed and well executed -- will succeed in helping the economy. Perception matters.

HEADLINE: Malawi's Man at the U.N.

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: He may be somebody back home, but in New York he's just another diplomat. 

 BODY:
On Sept. 15, just in time for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, City Room asked a question: What nation that you probably wouldn't hear about would you like to hear about? Or, more precisely, what nation's diplomats would you like to find out about?
One nation that came to mind was Malawi,one of the world's poorest countries. It was last in the news in July when antigovernment protests left at least 19 people dead. The president, Bingu wa Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who had been credited with reducing hunger in his country of 16 million, tired of dissent and demonstrations and warned that he did not want protesters returning to the streets. "I'll go after you," he was quoted as saying. "Even if you hide in holes, I'll smoke you out."
Britain suspended aid to the Malawi government, and a United States foreign aid agency put a $350 million grant on hold, where it remains. 
Malawi's representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Brian G. Bowler, 46, arrived in June 2010 after postings in India, Belgium, the European Union, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Holland. He said that during the General Assembly, he had been focused on Malawi's role as one of 19 vice presidents, a role that put him in charge of the session on Friday afternoon when the president of the newest member nation, South Sudan, took the floor for the first time.
"That was moving for me personally," Mr. Bowler said. "It was a great moment to welcome South Sudan."
He said diplomats from small nations go almost unnoticed in New York. And there is no special notice for them when they arrive: no expedited process to whisk them through immigrations and customs. Nor is there a security detail once they take up their routine in Manhattan.
"When it comes to entering J.F.K., the rigamarole you have to go through," Ambassador Bowler said. "The visa says 'foreign minister of a foreign country.' It doesn't take the archbishop of Canterbury to work it out, but they don't get it. I'm not knocking the system. I think they're doing it for a very good reason. They have experience that's shown it's necessary. It's the way they're doing it. It's a style."
Mr. Bowler, who said Malawi was a major producer of burley tobacco -a light-colored variety also grown in parts of the United States- said that he had not met Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who addressed the General Assembly last week and mentioned, among other things, the city's efforts to fight smoking. The city says 14 percent of New Yorkers smoke now, compared with nearly 22 percent in 2002.
"We support the drive to fight cancer," Mr. Bowler said, "but we've got a double whammy. Our main foreign currency earner is tobacco. Having to come up with an alternate crop, it's like going to the Caribbean and telling people, 'Don't fish.' But the warning shots have been fired. Tobacco is on the way out."
As long as tobacco is still being grown, however, the West should consider its effects on people who handle it, Mr. Bowler said.
"In Africa, children handle tobacco from 5 years old on," he said, "but we didn't know this when the white man brought the crop across. Very few Africans smoke. We know to grow the tobacco and send it. They've created the patch, which is nicotine absorbed through the skin. The leaf is pure, straight, hard-core nicotine. A child by the time he's 10 could have as much nicotine as a 40- or 50-year-old smoker. One of my pleas would be to put money into research to come up with tangible statistics and some kind of program to address Malawians and Zimbabweans with young cancers."
His days have been a whirl of meetings and receptions. One night last week, Mr. Bowler was invited to five social events in five different places around the city. "It's glamorous because there are all the dinners with all the right people," he said, "but you have to leverage it. There are opportunities for networking and strategizing."

HEADLINE: Leyland Reveals What's Beneath Crusty Exterior

BYLINE: JOANNE C. GERSTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Detroit Tigers Manager Jim Leyland explained in an interview with the Detroit News why the Tigers' success has been emotional for him. 

 BODY:
Detroit Tigers manager Jim Leyland's reputation as a rough hewn baseball character comes from his sometimes testy exchanges with the news media, umpires and his own players. It doesn't help that some of these exchanges occur when he has his mouth full of food during postgame news conferences in his office.
But an emotional, reflective softie poked out from beneath that exterior with his emotional reaction to the Tigers clinching their first American League Central title since 1987 on Sept. 16. On Monday, Leyland, 66, talked about his life, his ways, and his image during a wide-ranging interview with the Detroit News.
"When you have this position, you have to be a little crusty," Leyland said. "If you don't, you're going to get eaten alive - by players, by media, by the fans .Is some of it planned? Absolutely. You have to be that way sometimes or you're going to get chewed up. But my dad was one of 16 kids. My wife was one of 11. I'm one of seven, so I know what it's all about. I've worn my brothers' shoes and vice versa. And I'm proud of that. To me, that's America."
Leyland, a native of Perrysburg, Ohio, and not far from Detroit, understands the economic pain the area has gone through. The Tigers' success has brought a festive atmosphere to Comerica Park, and fans are gobbling up playoff tickets. He said he sees the enthusiasm around baseball and is grateful for the fans' support.
" My dad was a factory worker. I worked in a factory," Leyland said. "I know what it's like for my dad trying to feed seven kids and worrying if the plant was going to shut down, or move to another place. Is there going to be a strike, are there going to be layoffs? I know what that's about.
"And these people (Tigers fans), what they've gone through to keep coming out here, that's unbelieveable. I was totally being sincere. And it is emotional for me."
Leyland continued, "I'm not ashamed to say I had brothers who worked in the factory and I had to borrow money from them to have enough gas money to get to spring training when I was in the minor leagues some years .That's just the way it was. You know, I know what it's all about I don't know all the technicalities of the auto industry, but I do know people are getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and sweating their tails off, hoping they don't lose their jobs next week or have to live off unemployment. That's not easy."
Leyland and General Manager Dave Dombrowski took daily fire from fans and pundits early in the season when it seemed the Tigers were doomed to another lackluster year. Leyland received a one-year contract extension in August and Dombrowski made a few key trades for outfielder Delmon Young, starter Doug Fister and infielder Wilson Betemit.
The Tigers have had six managers, including Leyland, since the late Sparky Anderson left in 1995. Leyland was hired in 2006, and took the Tigers to the World Series that same season. He was asked if he worried about being fired this season.
" The Tigers hadn't had a real good track record about changing managers for a lot of years. And it didn't work too good," Leyland said. "So, all of a sudden, it doesn't matter that it was me. Doesn't matter who's in this chair. But it looked as if their answer for a lot of years was to just change managers. It doesn't work that way. You have to be solid in an organization. And you have to believe in your guy. And if the time comes when you don't, obviously, you should make a change.
"But just to make a change to appease the media and the talk shows isn't always the answer. And I think they found that out. And it has nothing to do with Jim Leyland. I mean, before they had Buddy Bell, Larry Parrish, Phil Garner, Luis Pujols, Alan Trammell - all these guys, and it wasn't that they were bad guys or bad managers. They weren't. But it's not the answer every time something goes wrong. The easy thing to do is get rid of the manager and say, "We need a change." It doesn't work that way."

HEADLINE: What We Eat, Where We Sleep: Documenting Daily Life to Tell Stories

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ideas for using two photo slide shows, each focusing on one aspect of the daily lives of people around the world, to have students explore what the way we eat and where we sleep say about who we are. 

 BODY:
In August, two slide shows were published on NYTimes.com that both seemed so useful for classrooms that we saved them until the school year began to present together in a lesson.
On the Well blog, Tara Parker-Pope featured 15 photos from a book called "What I Eat: Around the World in 80 Diets" that has become an exhibit at the Museum of Science in Boston. Here's how she described it:
In an unusual project, Peter Menzel and Faith D'Alusio, a photographer and writer, traveled the world collecting photos and stories about what people eat in a day. They documented the meager meals of a Masai goat herder during a drought, the fast-food diet of an American long-haul trucker and a veritable feast of lamb kebabs and other foods set out by an Iranian bread baker.
Meanwhile, the Lens blog introduced 20 photos from a book called "Where Children Sleep":
Mr. Mollison's new book, "Where Children Sleep," had its origins in a project undertaken for a children's charity several years ago. As he considered how to represent needy children around the world, he wanted to avoid the common devices: pleading eyes, toothless smiles. When he visualized his own childhood, he realized that his bedroom said a lot about what sort of life he led. So he set out to find others.
Here are some ideas for using these extraordinary photos across the curriculum - and some suggestions for including other Times features in which the details of everyday life become an anthropological lens.
Before Viewing
What do the ordinary details of our daily lives say about who we are, where we're from and what we care about?
Have students create two lists: on one side of the page, a list of 10 things they remember eating the day before; on the other, a list of 10 things people would see if they walked into that student's bedroom. (If you're only working with one slide show, have students compile only the list that corresponds to it.)
Next, have students work with a partner to compare their lists. Ask partners to discuss these questions: 1) What do you think these lists say about who you are, where you live and what you care about? 2) If, one hundred years from now, a historian or anthropologist was to come upon your lists, what might he or she conclude about you, your life and where you're from? What questions might he or she have?
Have the whole class share observations, then show one or both slide shows, using the questions below.
Questions
What photographs interested or surprised you most? Why? What questions did those photos raise for you?What can these photos tell you about the lives of the people pictured? What do you think they can't tell you?What does the photographer for the food series, Peter Menzel, mean when he says, "We present information to people rather than drawing conclusions ... we're trying to educate readers by show and tell"? Could that apply to both sets of photos?In her post about the children's bedrooms series, Kerri Macdonald writes, "As much as the project is about the quirkiness of childhood, it is, more strikingly, a commentary on class and on poverty. But the diversity also provides a sense of togetherness." Where can you see examples of both the social commentary and the "sense of togetherness" in both series?How would you contrast the two series? To what extent are they trying to do the same thing? How do they differ?
Activity Ideas
"Imagine gathering all the food you plan to eat today. Now take a picture of it." So begins Tara Parker-Pope's post about the photographs of food. You might be inspired by the simplicity of this description to take photos of your own bedroom or the food you'll eat in a day, or you might go out into your community and, using these photos as a model, create a similar series featuring people you know.
Or, you could choose another lens through which to depict the universal. Another project the Well blog post describes, for instance, is "Material World," in which families are pictured with their most precious possessions. You could photograph children with their favorite toys; teenagers in their most-loved t-shirts; people with the cars, bikes, skateboards, buss passes or other means of transportation they use every day; or people with their pets. Students might work in pairs to interview each subject as well and write up a short piece to accompany each photo.
As a class, establish a theme, whether "eating," "holidays," "identity," "family" or anything else, and invite everyone to bring in one or more photos from their own or their family's photo albums that illustrate it. Mount them all, then, as a class, write up an introduction that highlights some of the interesting connections you see between the photos. Invite others to view your photo gallery and leave comments - or even contribute their own photographs!
We have published many lessons in the past that invite students to analyze photographs. Adapt the guiding questions and worksheets from Who Is Family? Analyzing Family Photos or from Critical Lenses to find ways to consider the technical and artistic aspects of these photographs.
In both series, there are photos of people who live in the same place but represent different ways of living there. Choose two photos to compare - either from the same series or, perhaps, one from each series. What do the differences tell you? What questions about class, poverty, gender or other issues does the comparison raise? How might you represent differences like this in your own community through two photographs?
Is there a place or way of life depicted in these photos that especially intrigues you? Use online and library resources to explore that place, using the details depicted in the photo to generate research questions. As you go, make a list of questions you'd like to ask a real person from that area, then attempt to connect with someone your age who lives there via a site like e-pals. (In a recent edutopia post "World Without Walls: Learning Well With Others," Will Richardson offers other suggestions for connection classrooms and students.)
David Rabkin, director of current science and technology at the Boston Museum of Science, explains why the photo series about food has been popular at his museum:
"Food is a hot topic - people are interested in it and its many dimensions, from its health impact, to the experience of great food, to the bigger picture of our global food system and issues of social justice...Food is personal. It's a great topic for our museum because it's so compelling to so many of our visitors and so rich in terms of the educational directions in which we can go with them."
Using these photos as inspiration, brainstorm as many "dimensions" of the overall topic "food" as you can, then choose one you'd like to learn more about.
For almost any aspect you can think of, Times Topics pages will be a good place to start. For instance, if you're investigating the question of whether junk food is really cheaper to eat than healthy food, you might start with the recent graphic accompanying Mark Bittman's column on that question that visually compares prices for different meals.
Create an infographic depicting what you find.
In an interactive feature that accompanies the article "Three Generations Under One Roof," Sarah Kramer explores the lives of an extended family of Chinese-Americans living together in a house in New York City. Here is a quote from the article that vividly lists the details of this family's everyday life:
Life happens here on Forsyth Street: drum lessons for the teenagers on Thursday nights; religious school for Warren and Jen's boys on Sunday mornings; grilling on the roof deck in summer; and hip-hop, swimming, tutoring, soccer games, piano and guitar lessons and the occasional rooftop water fight sprinkled in. Food is bought in bulk: 25-pound bags of rice, 15 pounds of beef. It takes three gallons of milk, more than five pounds of salad greens and up to a dozen loads of laundry to keep the household running each week. Filling the home are seven children, ages 4 through 17; three iPads; 10 computers; 14 bicycles; two Cantonese-speaking baby sitters and a home aide; three languages (English, Spanish, Cantonese); one cat (another was recently euthanized); and a revolving door of friends.
Using just this paragraph as a model - and perhaps using "Life happens here on [name of street]" as a "sentence starter" - write your own short description of how "life happens" at your house. Then, use a video camera as Ms. Kramer does to capture a span of time (perhaps 15 minutes of your breakfast or dinner routine) in your home. What does the footage show that surprises you? Why?
In 2010, the Magazine published "The Shrine Down the Hall," a series of photos of the bedrooms of American soldiers lost in war. We created a lesson plan around that series that might be used with the "Where Children Sleep" series. Students might also consider memorializing a loss of their own by photographing or writing about how daily life is affected by the change they have experienced.
Many teachers will already know the George Ella Lyon list-form poem "Where I'm From." As Mr. Lyon writes, "People have used it at their family reunions, teachers have used it with kids all over the United States, in Ecuador and China; they have taken it to girls in juvenile detention, to men in prison for life, and to refugees in a camp in the Sudan." On his Web site, he features the poem along with ideas for writing from it. A "Where I'm From" poem could easily be a companion or extension to the photography, writing or video projects suggested above.

Here are some ideas for using these extraordinary photos across the curriculum - and some suggestions for including other Times features in which the details of everyday life become an anthropological lens.
Before Viewing
What do the ordinary details of our daily lives say about who we are, where we're from and what we care about?
Have students create two lists: on one side of the page, a list of 10 things they remember eating the day before; on the other, a list of 10 things people would see if they walked into that student's bedroom. (If you're only working with one slide show, have students compile only the list that corresponds to it.)
Next, have students work with a partner to compare their lists. Ask partners to discuss these questions: 1) What do you think these lists say about who you are, where you live and what you care about? 2) If, one hundred years from now, a historian or anthropologist was to come upon your lists, what might he or she conclude about you, your life and where you're from? What questions might he or she have?
Have the whole class share observations, then show one or both slide shows, using the questions below.
Questions

        
What photographs interested or surprised you most? Why? What questions did those photos raise for you?

        
What can these photos tell you about the lives of the people pictured? What do you think they tell you?

        
What does the photographer for the food series, Peter Menzel, mean when he says, "We present information to people rather than drawing conclusions ... we're trying to educate readers by show and tell"? Could that apply to both sets of photos?

        
In her post about the children's bedrooms series, Kerri Macdonald writes, "As much as the project is about the quirkiness of childhood, it is, more strikingly, a commentary on class and on poverty. But the diversity also provides a sense of togetherness." Where can you see examples of both the social commentary and the "sense of togetherness" in both series?

        
How would you contrast the two series? To what extent are they trying to do the same thing? How do they differ?
Activity Ideas
"Imagine gathering all the food you plan to eat today. Now take a picture of it." So begins Tara Parker-Pope's post about the photographs of food. You might be inspired by the simplicity of this description to take photos of your own bedroom or the food you'll eat in a day, or you might go out into your community and, using these photos as a model, create a similar series featuring people you know.
Or, you could choose another lens through which to depict the universal. Another project the Well blog post describes, for instance, is "Material World," in which families are pictured with their most precious possessions. You could photograph children with their favorite toys; teenagers in their most-loved t-shirts; people with the cars, bikes, skateboards, buss passes or other means of transportation they use every day; or people with their pets. Students might work in pairs to interview each subject as well and write up a short piece to accompany each photo.
As a class, establish a theme, whether "eating," "holidays," "identity," "family" or anything else, and invite everyone to bring in one or more photos from their own or their family's photo albums that illustrate it. Mount them all, then, as a class, write up an introduction that highlights some of the interesting connections you see between the photos. Invite others to view your photo gallery and leave comments - or even contribute their own photographs!
We have published many lessons in the past that invite students to analyze photographs. Adapt the guiding questions and worksheets from Who Is Family? Analyzing Family Photos or from Critical Lenses to find ways to consider the technical and artistic aspects of these photographs.
In both series, there are photos of people who live in the same place but represent different ways of living there. Choose two photos to compare - either from the same series or, perhaps, one from each series. What do the differences tell you? What questions about class, poverty, gender or other issues does the comparison raise? How might you represent differences like this in your own community through two photographs?
Is there a place or way of life depicted in these photos that especially intrigues you? Use online and library resources to explore that place, using the details depicted in the photo to generate research questions. As you go, make a list of questions you'd like to ask a real person from that area, then attempt to connect with someone your age who lives there via a site like e-pals. (In a recent edutopia post "World Without Walls: Learning Well With Others," Will Richardson offers other suggestions for connection classrooms and students.)
David Rabkin, director of current science and technology at the Boston Museum of Science, explains why the photo series about food has been popular at his museum:
"Food is a hot topic - people are interested in it and its many dimensions, from its health impact, to the experience of great food, to the bigger picture of our global food system and issues of social justice...Food is personal. It's a great topic for our museum because it's so compelling to so many of our visitors and so rich in terms of the educational directions in which we can go with them."
Using these photos as inspiration, brainstorm as many "dimensions" of the overall topic "food" as you can, then choose one you'd like to learn more about.
For almost any aspect you can think of, Times Topics pages will be a good place to start. For instance, if you're investigating the question of whether junk food is really cheaper to eat than healthy food, you might start with the recent graphic accompanying Mark Bittman's column on that question that visually compares prices for different meals.
Create an infographic depicting what you find.
In an interactive feature that accompanies the article "Three Generations Under One Roof," Sarah Kramer explores the lives of an extended family of Chinese-Americans living together in a house in New York City. Here is a quote from the article that vividly lists the details of this family's everyday life:
Life happens here on Forsyth Street: drum lessons for the teenagers on Thursday nights; religious school for Warren and Jen's boys on Sunday mornings; grilling on the roof deck in summer; and hip-hop, swimming, tutoring, soccer games, piano and guitar lessons and the occasional rooftop water fight sprinkled in. Food is bought in bulk: 25-pound bags of rice, 15 pounds of beef. It takes three gallons of milk, more than five pounds of salad greens and up to a dozen loads of laundry to keep the household running each week. Filling the home are seven children, ages 4 through 17; three iPads; 10 computers; 14 bicycles; two Cantonese-speaking baby sitters and a home aide; three languages (English, Spanish, Cantonese); one cat (another was recently euthanized); and a revolving door of friends.
Using just this paragraph as a model - and perhaps using "Life happens here on [name of street]" as a "sentence starter" - write your own short description of how "life happens" at your house. Then, use a video camera as Ms. Kramer does to capture a span of time (perhaps 15 minutes of your breakfast or dinner routine) in your home. What does the footage show that surprises you? Why?
In 2010, the Magazine published "The Shrine Down the Hall," a series of photos of the bedrooms of American soldiers lost in war. We created a lesson plan around that series that might be used with the "Where Children Sleep" series. Students might also consider memorializing a loss of their own by photographing or writing about how daily life is affected by the change they have experienced.
Many teachers will already know the George Ella Lyon list-form poem "Where I'm From." As Mr. Lyon writes, "People have used it at their family reunions, teachers have used it with kids all over the United States, in Ecuador and China; they have taken it to girls in juvenile detention, to men in prison for life, and to refugees in a camp in the Sudan." On his Web site, he features the poem along with ideas for writing from it. A "Where I'm From" poem could easily be a companion or extension to the photography, writing or video projects suggested above.

HEADLINE: What We Eat, Where We Sleep: Documenting Daily Life to Tell Stories

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ideas for using two photo slide shows, each focusing on one aspect of the daily lives of people around the world, to have students explore what the way we eat and where we sleep say about who we are. 

 BODY:
In August, two slide shows were published on NYTimes.com that both seemed so useful for classrooms that we saved them until the school year began to present together in a lesson.
On the Well blog, Tara Parker-Pope featured 15 photos from a book called "What I Eat: Around the World in 80 Diets" that has become an exhibit at the Museum of Science in Boston. Here's how she described it:
In an unusual project, Peter Menzel and Faith D'Alusio, a photographer and writer, traveled the world collecting photos and stories about what people eat in a day. They documented the meager meals of a Masai goat herder during a drought, the fast-food diet of an American long-haul trucker and a veritable feast of lamb kebabs and other foods set out by an Iranian bread baker.
Meanwhile, the Lens blog introduced 20 photos from a book called "Where Children Sleep":
Mr. Mollison's new book, "Where Children Sleep," had its origins in a project undertaken for a children's charity several years ago. As he considered how to represent needy children around the world, he wanted to avoid the common devices: pleading eyes, toothless smiles. When he visualized his own childhood, he realized that his bedroom said a lot about what sort of life he led. So he set out to find others.
Here are some ideas for using these extraordinary photos across the curriculum - and some suggestions for including other Times features in which the details of everyday life become an anthropological lens.

HEADLINE: Illinois Halts Inquiries of Nonprofit Hospitals

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The state Revenue Department, acceding to a request from the governor, said it would refrain from challenging property tax exemptions for more hospitals until recommendations can be made. 

 BODY:
The Illinois Revenue Department said on Monday that it had agreed to hold off on challenging any more hospital tax exemptions after Gov. Pat Quinn said he wanted a reprieve to allow the industry and state officials to come up with recommendations outlining how much charity care hospitals should provide to justify not paying property taxes.
The postponement comes after the department last month moved to strip property tax exemptions from three of the state's better known hospitals, saying they did not provide enough charity care. The state said Northwestern Memorial HealthCare's Prentice Women's Hospital in Chicago, Edward Hospital Naperville and Decatur (Ill.) Memorial Hospital were providing free and discounted medical care that ranged from 0.96 percent to 1.85 percent of their patient-care revenue.
"The department's recent decisions have created great concern and uncertainty among the hospital community," the governor wrote in a letter last week to MaryJane Wurth, the hospital association president.
Mr. Quinn set a March 1, 2012, deadline for recommendations on what the parties, including the state Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Brian Hamer, director of the Revenue Department, should allow for nonprofit hospitals to justify their tax exemptions.
That means about 15 hospital systems that await rulings on their tax exemptions can rest easy for now that they won't have their tax status challenged.
"We are willing to pause issuing these orders while talks are productive and moving forward," Sue Hofer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Hamer, said Monday.
The Revenue Department acted to strip the exemptions following a ruling last year by the State Supreme Court upholding the revocation of the property tax exemption for Catholic-owned Provena Covenant Medical Center in downstate Urbana. For that hospital, the value of charity care provided to indigent patients amounted to less than 1 percent of its revenue in 2002.
Though the Illinois Supreme Court ruled Provena's charity care level was not enough, it did not establish a specific threshold.
The hospitals argue that their contributions are significant, even though charity care is a small percentage of their business. Hospitals seek a broader definition of charity care that goes beyond just charity care and expand to include patients' unpaid debts, costs of medical care not covered by Medicare or Medicaid and direct costs that teaching hospitals pay to train doctors and conduct research.
The battle comes during a period of high unemployment and related loss in health benefits by millions of Americans that analysts say are in greater need for discounted and free medical care. Meanwhile, hospitals could face a different problem in 2014 when federal health care legislation, if it becomes fully effective, covers 30 million more Americans and therefore would make it difficult for some hospitals to provide higher levels of charity care.
The issue has also been important on the federal level where Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has for years criticized charity care levels at hospitals and pushed for higher percentages to justify tax exemptions.
Mr. Quinn said he was not attempting to thwart the work of the Revenue Department in its challenge of tax exemptions for the Northwestern, Decatur or Edward hospitals. Those cases, which are expected to be appealed in the next month, are moving ahead, the department said.
If talks between state officials and hospitals fail to come up with satisfactory recommendations by March 1, Mr. Quinn's office said it expected the Revenue Department to proceed with its reviews. "This is not an open-ended hold," said Brie Callahan, a spokeswoman for the governor.

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs Draws Up Deeper Cuts

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs is preparing to significantly expand its cost-cutting initiative, a move that could lead to additional job losses at the bank. 

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs, bracing for what could be one of its worst quarters since it went public 12 years ago, is preparing to expand its cost-cutting initiative by hundreds of millions of dollars, a move that could lead to additional job losses at the Wall Street bank.
 This summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012 and cut roughly 1,000 jobs, about 3 percent of its work force. But as the market turmoil has weighed on trading and other businesses in recent weeks, senior executives have been debating even deeper reductions, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
 With the company's third quarter closing on Friday, Goldman has been revising its plans, potentially raising the cuts by as much as $250 million, to $1.45 billion. Based on its 2010 spending, such reductions would amount to 5 percent of the firm's expenses.
Along with the possibility of additional layoffs, the firm is expected to reduce employee pay, much of which is handed out later in the year. It is also sharpening its focus on noncompensation expenses, like real estate and travel, according to one of the executives with knowledge of the discussions.
The executive warned that no final decision had been made on size of the cuts, and that the numbers could change quickly if the market improved or weakened. The financial firm may address the matter when it releases its earnings on Oct. 18, he added.
Goldman's move underscores the broader problems on Wall Street. Financial firms have been under pressure for months, amid the European debt crisis and an economic slowdown in the United States, and a raft of regulatory changes is expected to crimp future profits. But the financial situation has deteriorated in recent weeks, as the market rout has ravaged revenue across Wall Street.
 With the stock market slumping, analysts are quickly revising their estimates for third quarter earnings, which the banks are set to report in mid-October. Analysts are tempering their predictions for JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America and others. Goldman is now expected to earn $1.35 a share in the third quarter, less than half what the firm earned in the same period of 2010, according to consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. A month ago, analysts predicted the bank would make $2.65 a share.
 The financial picture could be even more bleak, as analysts at both Barclays Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have predicted a loss for Goldman. The company has reported a quarterly loss only once since going public in 1999; it lost $2.12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, months after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.
"This is an extremely challenging environment, and I am sure every bank will be taking another hard look at expenses after the recent market downturn," said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura, the Japanese bank. 
In anticipation of a slowdown, banks began trimming their budgets earlier this year and took aim at the biggest expense: compensation. Bank of America, which continues to have losses from the mortgage crisis, has had some of the most severe cuts. It has announced that it would eliminate 30,000 jobs, nearly 10 percent of its total work force, over the next few years. Over all, the bank is looking to cut $5 billion in annual expenses.
JPMorgan Chase is in the midst of a five-year, $1.3 billion cost-cutting plan that will eliminate roughly 3,000 jobs. Morgan Stanley cut some low-producing brokers in its wealth management division, and Credit Suisse laid off administrative assistants in its investment banking unit last week as part of a larger reduction of 2,000 employees. 
Wall Street executives are also preparing their staffs for smaller year-end bonuses, although the change is not yet reflected in the expenses. During the first six months of the year Citigroup, JPMorgan, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America set aside $65.69 billion to cover compensation and benefits, up 8 percent from a year ago, according to data provided by Nomura. But financial firms tend to wait until the fourth quarter to make the call on the annual payouts.
"The third quarter was rough and revenue is sure to be down, so compensation levels will follow," said Mr. Schorr.
As Wall Street looks to drive down costs in a bid to protect profits, no expense has been overlooked. Goldman Sachs recently downsized the drinking cups in its New York headquarters to 10 ounces from 12 ounces, saving thousands of dollars. It has also gone mostly cashless in the cafeteria and other areas, eliminating the need to pay armored truck companies to haul away the money.
Barclays, which has said it plans to cut 3,000 jobs this year, recently issued a memo reminding employees that work-issued cellphones are to be used "for valid business purposes only." In addition to closing two-thirds of its 63 data centers, Bank of America did not host an annual field day for its municipal bond department, a country club affair in New Jersey that in past years included sport stations outfitted with beer kegs.
 Even foliage is not safe from the chopping block. James P. Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, faced questions about plants at a town hall meeting this summer. An employee told Mr. Gorman that he had noticed decidedly less greenery around the office.
"Every dollar we don't spent is a dollar available for the bottom line," Mr. Gorman responded.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Twisting Our Wealth Away

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Does your business keep you up at night? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week. 
The Fed: Let's Do the Twist
The Fed considers "Operation Twist." Paul A. Volcker warns to beware of inflation. Republican leaders plead with the Fed not to make any more moves. The Fed gets pessimistic and makes the move - and the markets plunge (and plunge again).
The Deficit 1: Obama Reveals His Plan
President Obama proposes a $3 trillion deficit-cutting plan, asking for a $3 tax increase for every $1 in cost cuts. The Brookings Institution's William Gale summarizes here. Rick Newman lists the plan's biggest losers. Keith Hennessey thinks it contains a lot of gimmicks. The Economist says it's all politics: "Even if the plan offered today goes nowhere, it is a document he can carry proudly into the election to portray Republicans as unrepentant friends of the rich, a message that, judging from recent polls, resonates with the public." David Brooks says he's an Obama sap. Kel Munger says "things aren't going to get better without jobs, and if our corporate overlords are not going to pull their own economic weight by putting their profits back into the economy, the only other option is to tax the incredibly wealthy." Margaret Thatcher weighs in. House Democrats introduce a bill to eliminate the debt ceiling. At least this congressman's around in case anyone has a heart attack.
The Deficit 2: The Tax Effects
Ezra Klein thinks antitax supporters should be happy with the president's plan: "There's no doubt that the antitax types aren't happy with Obama's proposal but they have a lot to be happy with given the direction of the general debate." Steve Benen says that President Obama has cut more taxes than President George W. Bush. The plan includes a provision for back taxes owed by contractors to be deducted from federal contract payments. Loren Steffy wants broader-based tax reform. And (of course) Robert Reich wants to raise the top tax rate to 70 percent.
The Deficit 3: Oh No, Not Again
Another government shutdown looms (but this will make you smile).
The Economy: Squeegees Return
Eswar Prasad worries that the global economic recovery is in real danger of skidding off course. John Judis says our economic nightmare is just beginning. Another ominous sign: the return of squeegees to New York. American firms continue to hoard cash and overall bank deposits soar despiterock-bottom interest rates. A Gallup poll finds that 60 percent of Americans don't expect the economy to improve soon. Most Americans feel they'll never be millionaires. Phil Gyford asks why we even bother to make economic forecasts. The International Monetary Fund, he says, "has issued four different forecasts about growth for 2011. It has changed its mind three times in nine months. Its most recent forecast is half its original one."
Finance: Will We See Those Billions?
Thirteen banks, including Citigroup and Regions Financial, pledge billions for small businesses. That's nice, but a new report says banks are largely passing over small businesses. Miranda Marquit explains how to choose the right credit card for your business. Manchester Unitedholds up its initial public offering. This guy has been holding up his arm for the past 38 years. American Express offers a new plan for merchants toreceive access to up to $750,000 in financing.
Data: It's Good to Be the Professor
More goods are leaving West Coast ports. Corporate officers are making less but Ph.D.'s are making more (anyone have kids in college?). Builder confidence declines slightly. Housing starts fall again, but architectural billings gain the most in four years. And real estate prices rise. Oracle's profit is up 36 percent. The commercial printing industry has risen seven quarters in a row. The Philadelphia Fed reports continued weakness. August economic indicators signal weak growth. Unemployment claims stay above 400,000.
Marketing: And the Most Important Question Is ?
After a study says its "App Economy" contributes more than $15 billion to the American economy, Facebook offers new incentives for small business. But Gawker says Facebook is driving us to drink. A social media strategist explains why small businesses worry about social media. Jeremy Epstein explains how invoices can go viral. A start-up introduces an app to identify how many customers are installing apps and what advertising channel influenced the user. Christopher Mims says negative reviews can increase your online sales. Patrick Garmoe offers 14 ways to build an army of adoring journalists via Twitter. Here's how you can get noticed this holiday shopping season. Amanda DiSilvestro explains how e-books canhelp us market.
Technology 1: Google Wallet Arrives
Google Wallet is here. Visa, American Express and Discover join up. Katie reviews. The bloggers at allbusiness.com aren't sure it's worth it yet.
Technology 2: Netflix Exercises "Management"
Nielsen ranks the top 20 Android apps. And here are the five best online backup applicationsfor small businesses. Ever wonder how people use their smartphones? Jason Keith says QR codes aren't ready for prime time: "Big retailers like Macy's, Tommy Hilfiger and the Gap have used them successfully, but the time and effort that it takes to ensure you get a good return on investment is big." Netflix's Reed Hastings exercises what some call management. Tim Carmody says Google+ suddenly looks pretty busy for a ghost town. Dell introduces a preconfigured virtualization solution for smaller companies.
Your People: Rise Early, Avoid Dumplings
Andy gets promoted. A new report finds that "63 percent of those who are self-employed would not consider changing jobs in the next 12 months, but less than half (48 percent) are actually satisfied with their job, and only 28 percent would recommend self-employment to others." Harvey Schachter reveals six rules for keeping employees engaged. Early risers may be thinner and happier. In a related story a man wins a dumpling-eating contest, then dies. Here are 10 crazy rules that could get you fired from Amazon's warehouse.
Around the States: California Loses Again
Batman increases Pennsylvania's employment. A micro documentary looks at the start-up community in D.C. Some Orlando-area small companies find ways to survive the shuttle's demise. Joel Kotkin sees the demise of the "luxury city" of New York. Unemployment rates rise most in Nevada, California and Florida. Another report finds California is the worst for business. Giant snails invade a Miami neighborhood. A congressman hosts a small-business summit in Louisiana.
Start-Up: Sun, Grub and $50 Million
A solar start-up and a food delivery search engine each raise $50 million. An entrepreneur explains why he moved to Hong Kong to start his business and another is convinced that his start-up has the potential toremake the national economy. Rich Aberman explains how not to recruit for a start-up.
Ideas: Apps of Prosperity
A toilet paper roll the Beatles refused to use while recording could sell for 1,000 per sheet. Seven are inducted into the entrepreneur's walk of fame. Niall Ferguson gives a TED talk on the six killer apps of prosperity. Annie Lowrey explains why small businesses aren't innovative: "Few spend any money on research or development, getting a patent, or otherwise trademarking a new idea. Most simply help provide already-crowded markets with familiar goods such as legal work or gas or nearby groceries." Mark Cuban says the most patriotic thing you can do is to go out there and get rich (and pay taxes). Here are some of the best undergrad and graduate entrepreneurial studies programs.
Around the World: Russians Duke It Out
American dependence on foreign oil is the lowestsince 1996. A couple of Russian C.E.O.'s duke it out. Confucius would be 2,562 years old this week. In his honor, 66 Chinese kidsstuff themselves into a minivan, the United States files a trade complaint and President Obama commits a photo faux pas. Italy earns a downgrade. Oh, and in case you're interested, here's how to do business in Libya.
Red Tape Update: How Does Big Sugar Get Its Way?
This journeymay have had a happy ending, but here's the warning: "a small-business owner should not have to rely upon the chance encounter, or divine intervention, of an empathetic officer in dealing with the I.R.S." Virginia Chamlee explains how Big Sugargets its way: "The majority of sugar cane might be grown in South Florida, but the industry's political reach extends far beyond the state." Robert Wood is concerned that the I.R.S. is making independent contractor reporting rules even harder.
The Week Ahead
Data this week should be interesting: we'll get reports on new and pending home sales, durable goods orders and personal spending and income. Also, both the Conference Board and the University of Michigan will release consumer-confidence information.
This Week's Bests
Things to Do When Business Is Slow. Debra Ellis offers five suggestions, including "Clean house": "The roll-up-your-sleeves deep cleaning that brightens a room, clears out in-boxes, and organizes files is best done by the people using the space. Make it a fun project by having a friendly competition where the best job wins a prize (gift cards, dinner out, extra vacation day, etc.)."
Reason We're Not Sleeping. Jason Freedman explains why entrepreneurs can't sleep. One theory is "Entrepreneurs need to focus. Night is simply more productive.": "At night, no one bothers you and you can focus for eight-hour chunks. One of the reasons I didn't care about the morning start time was that our guys were being so damn productive at night. And more productive than normal people. In fact, for a period we tried a normal schedule and it destroyed our productivity."
Way to Use Payments to Drive Revenue. A pricing strategist, Rafi Mohammed, suggests new options: "The resurrection of layaway by Wal-Mart and other retailers is simply an attempt to meet the pricing needs of customers. By the way, notice how this pricing plan does not involve margin-lowering discounts? Instead, it increases profits by charging additional premiums or fees, as well as better serving and attracting new customers. Now that's win-win."

HEADLINE: At Fund-Raisers, Obama Refers to Audiences at G.O.P. Debates

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: In a series of West Coast fund-raising events on Sunday, President Obama criticized views held by the Republican Party's conservative base, and stressed that the coming election would be "a contest of values." 

 BODY:
President Obama on Sunday criticized not only the Republicans vying to defeat him but also their party's conservative base - symbolized by the audiences at recent candidate debates -- in a busy day of four West Coast fund-raisers to collect money and rally dispirited Democratic donors.
In Woodside, Calif., an affluent community between San Francisco and San Jose, Mr. Obama hit his stump-speech theme that the 2012 election will be "a contest of values," and then suggested that some in his audience might well be former Republicans "puzzled by what's happening to that party."
"I mean, has anybody been watching the debates lately?" he asked. Referring to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has sought federal aid to fight wildfires caused by a prolonged drought, Mr. Obama said: "You've got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change. It's true. You've got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don't have health care and booing a service member in Iraq because they're gay."
"That's not reflective of who we are," Mr. Obama said. "This is a choice about the fundamental direction of our country." Obama advisers in the past have said he does not watch Republicans' debates. But by his remarks, Mr. Obama showed he is well aware that a recent string of debates produced moments in which reactions from audiences of Tea Party sympathizers became as widely discussed afterward as anything the candidates said - prompting some of the candidates to distance themselves later from the expressions of intolerance or hardheartedness. Besides the episodes Mr. Obama cited, at another debate the loudest applause came at the mention of the numerous executions Mr. Perry has sanctioned.
To the relief of many Democrats, Mr. Obama has become more assertive lately in attacking Republicans and drawing contrasts with them. At Sunday's first fund-raiser, one of two in the Seattle area, he said a Republican president would institute "an approach to government that would fundamentally cripple America in meeting the challenges of the 21st century."
Depending on the event, donors gave from $100 to $35,800. Those in Woodside, on the expansive and sumptuously landscaped lawn of John W. Thompson, chairman of Symantec, gave the maximum amount, to be split between the Democratic Party and Mr. Obama's reelection campaign. He addressed them as "my stockholders."
There and elsewhere, Mr. Obama acknowledged that many of the donors would probably pay higher taxes after 2012 under his proposals to raise taxes on high-income households, both to offset the short-term costs of his job-creation plan in Congress and to reduce future annual budget deficits. Citing Republicans' criticism that his proposals amount to "class warfare," Mr. Obama delivered what has become his standard response - he is a proud warrior for the middle class - and drew applause.
Celebrities made appearances at several events. Lady Gaga was at the final function, held at the Atherton, Calif., home of Sheryl Sandberg, an executive of Facebook who was a Treasury official in the Clinton administration. The singer, extravagantly attired as usual, was about two feet taller than Mr. Obama thanks to her towering heels and upswept hair.
The musician Bruce Hornsby performed at the Woodside fund-raiser. And the former pro basketball players Bill Russell and Lenny Wilkens introduced Mr. Obama at Seattle's Paramount Theater. At each stop, Mr. Obama gave a rundown of his administration's record, including taking credit for rescuing the economy, decimating Al Qaeda and killing Osama bin Laden, ending the "don't ask, don't tell" policy against openly gay service members, tightening financial industry regulations and - "as long as I get a second term" - implementation of the law expanding health insurance.
But Mr. Obama acknowledged that many Democrats, especially liberals, are disheartened that he has not been more successful in overcoming the obstructions of Congressional Republicans. "Shake off any doldrums," he told supporters at the Seattle theater, and "get to work."
In Woodside, he urged donors to "push back" against friends and neighbors whose criticisms are based on "inadequate information" from Fox News or Wall Street Journal editorials. "And in some cases," he told them, "I may need you to have some arguments with our progressive friends."
"We're going to have a stark choice in this election," Mr. Obama added. "But I have to make sure that our side is as passionate and as motivated and is working just as hard as the folks on the other side because this is a contest of values."
Quoting his vice president, "my friend Joe Biden," Mr. Obama said, "Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative."

HIGHLIGHT: About that currency debasement ... 

 BODY:
What you missed if you believed that the bond vigilantes were coming any day now, that rates would soar as soon as Bernanke ended QE2, and all that: Betting on Bernanke Returns 28% for Treasuries.
Betting on Ben S. Bernanke has been the most profitable trade for government bond investors in 16 years, defying lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad who said the Federal Reserve chairman's policies would lead to runaway inflation and the dollar's debasement.
Treasuries due in 10 or more years have returned 28 percent in 2011, exceeding the 24.4 percent gain in all of 2008 during worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Not since 1995, when the securities soared 30.7 percent, have investors done so well owning longer-dated U.S. government debt.

HEADLINE: Monday Motorsports: Win at Singapore Puts Sebastian Vettel Within One Point of Formula One Championship

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: The Red Bull racer's latest achievement made a back-to-back championship appear imminent. 

 BODY:
With floodlights illuminating a course that his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber called "probably the toughest of all for drivers," Sebastian Vettel continued his second-half resurgence, winning the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday night. It was his third consecutive victory, having logged wins at Monza in Italy, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and the Hungaroring in Hungary, and his ninth over all in 2011.
Vettel, the pole sitter for Sunday's race, used his optimal track position to beat his competitors off the line and surged ahead to open as much as a 12-second gap between his car and that of Jenson Button, the McLaren-Mercedes driver, before the leaders made their first pit stops on lap No. 14. A drive-through penalty was levied against Lewis Hamilton, Button's teammate, after he clipped Felipe Massa, Ferrari's No. 2 driver. The penalty dropped Hamilton back as far as 15th, but he recovered to finish fifth.
Michael Schumacher, the seven-time Formula One champion, collided with the rear of Sergio Perez's Sauber car on lap No. 30, sending Schumacher's racer airborne. Neither driver was injured, but it caused a restart. Upon the restart, Button's progress was impeded by a number of backmarkers -- cars that could be lapped -- yet Button broke free and kept closing on Vettel, but finished more than a second behind. He was followed on the podium by Webber, who passed Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who won the Singapore GP last year, in the waning laps.
As Brad Spurgeon at the Formula One blog notes, barring a catastrophe, Vettel's 2011 championship appears to be a foregone conclusion:
"Vettel has 124 points more than Button, with five races left and 25 points awarded for a victory. Vettel leads the series with 309 points to 185 for Button. He needs only one point to take the title, and that, of course, will be merely a formality for the German driver, 24."
In other motorsports news:
Tony Stewart, who only qualified for the Nascar Chase for the Sprint Cup in the final race of the regular season, secured his second victory of the series' de facto playoffs, winning handily at New Hampshire Motor Speedway on Sunday. Stewart passed Clint Bowyer with three laps remaining as Bowyer began to run out of fuel and maintained his lead to the finish. Stewart pressed his fuel advantage at Chicagoland on Sept. 19, as well. Frontrunners from the regular season, including Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch and Matt Kenseth, continue to struggle to find their chase footing.
 Last week, Group Lotus announced that Jean Alesi, who competed in Formula One from 1989 to 2001, as well as the DTM series in Germany and Le Mans in France, would drive in the 2012 Indianapolis 500. Alesi, 47, has acted as a brand ambassador for the group and its niche sports-car holding, Lotus Cars, since January, and has consulted on the development of the $1 million Exos Type 125 track-day racecar.
 The Detroit Grand Prix may run again at Belle Isle, according to a report by the Associated Press. The Detroit City Council approved an application submitted by organizers, including the Penske Corporation, the automotive retail and racing conglomerate, to lease the circuit for undisclosed competitions. The grand prix, which briefly returned in 2007 after a six-year hiatus, consisted of a weekend of IndyCar, American Le Mans and GT-class racing. It was canceled after its 2008 edition amid a weakening economy.

HEADLINE: Trump Meets With Romney in New York

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney will meet with the real estate mogul and television personality Donald Trump, following the example of other Republican candidates. 

 BODY:
3:05 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney followed the well-trod path of other Republican presidential hopefuls on Monday with a trip to New York to kiss the ring of the real estate mogul and television personality Donald Trump.
The meeting between the two men, set up at Mr. Romney's request, took place at 2 p.m. Monday at Trump Towers on Fifth Avenue, and was the first time the two men chatted face-to-face since Mr. Romney declared his candidacy several months ago.
Mr. Romney managed to evade the press and neither man came out after the meeting to comment on what was discussed. But that obscured the fact that Mr. Trump, who flirted with a presidential run earlier this year and still likes to hint that he's keeping his options open, hasn't already had some things to say about Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. 
In an interview in April with Meghan McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain of Arizona, for The Daily Beast, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Romney was "going to lose."
"He doesn't resonate, you know, or he would have won last time, in all fairness to your father!" he told Ms. McCain. Mr. Trump said he watched Mr. Romney give a speech, "and it was all these little trivial statements."
The same month, he also bragged that he was a "much bigger businessman" than Mr. Romney.
"I mean, my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney," Mr. Trump told CNN's Candy Crowley.
Mr. Romney has centered his campaign on jobs and the economy, promoting his years in the private sector, but Mr. Trump has also questioned whether Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital actually helped create jobs.
"Well, Mitt Romney is a basically small-business guy, if you really think about it," Mr. Trump said in April. "He was a hedge fund. He was a funds guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it."
Despite Mr. Trump's less-than-laudatory comments, the Democratic National Committee released a Web video on Monday morning linking Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump.
"Both support an economic plan that would help out the richest and the big corporations, but not the middle class," says the narrator, who also says the two men would "slash Social Security" and "end Medicare as we know it."
The video ends with a montage of Mr. Trump offering up his trademark "You're fired" to the pair.
Mr. Trump has become a must-stop for Republican candidates seeking their party's 2012 nomination. Mr. Trump had dinner at the upscale Jean Georges restaurant in New York last week with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, and he has a second meeting scheduled next week with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.
He also met withSarah Palin in May. The two went to the chain Famous Famiglia in Time Square, where they were roundly mocked for eating their pizza with knives and forks.

HEADLINE: Ford Mulling E.V.'s and Lincolns for China

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Alan R. Mulally, the automaker's chief executive, said that E.V.'s and the introduction of the Lincoln brand figured in Ford's China strategy. 

 BODY:
China does not lack for local manufacturers eager to collaborate with Western automakers, particularly in the development of electric vehicles. Alan R. Mulally threw Ford's hat in the ring on Saturday in an interview with Bloomberg Television, during which the chief executive gave indications that Ford may build E.V.'s there.
The automaker, which displayed its Focus Electric model at the Shanghai auto show in April, would follow General Motors and Daimler AG among major brands to announce their E.V. intent in China. Just last week, G.M. said it would develop E.V. architecture with S.A.I.C., its partner in China, at a jointly administered engineering center in Shanghai, while Daimler announced a joint venture with BYD in May of last year.
Ford, like its chief executive, is not talking specifics yet about an E.V. joint venture. Daniel Pierce, a Ford spokesman, related the following message from his colleagues in China when asked about the brand's E.V. plans:
"We have a fleet of electric demonstration vehicles in China, but have not announced any plans to sell or produce electric vehicles in China. If we decide to produce electric vehicles in China, we would then determine what technologies would be appropriate to share with our joint venture and also what terms would accompany such an arrangement."
According to China's Ministry of Science, the government hopes to have one million electric-powered vehicles on the road by 2015, which also happens to be aligned with the ambitions of the Obama administration for the United States. Mr. Mulally said that the introduction of electric vehicles in China would be dependent on the development of charging infrastructure and advances in battery technology.
To Bloomberg, Mr. Mulally said that Ford may also introduce the Lincoln brand in China, which has demonstrated demand for American luxury sedans. J.D. Power & Associates, the marketing information service, forecasts that China's luxury automobile market may grow by about 35 percent this year.
"We have a great luxury brand in Lincoln, which we have recommitted ourselves to," Mr. Mulally said in the television interview. "There's going to be tremendous pull from China to have access to these great vehicles."
Mr. Pierce, meanwhile, said that Ford has not announced plans to launch Lincoln in China.
While the automaker ponders its options in the world's largest automotive market, other Ford models, including the Transit Connect, Edge, Focus, Fiesta and the Mondeo and S-Max, two models unavailable in the United States, are being sold in China.
Ford has invested heavily in joint-venture engine, transmission and vehicle production plants in the country. In April at the Shanghai auto show, Joe Hinrichs, an executive for Ford Asia Pacific and Africa, said the brand would introduce 15 new vehicles in China by 2015. Announcing the appointment of David L. Schoch as chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor China, Mr. Hinrichs noted that the automaker had "put in place aggressive expansive plans" in the country.

HEADLINE: Delegating Economic Policy to the Technocrats, and Away from Democracy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Peter Orszag suggests delegating more authority to "depoliticized" expert panels. But many economic decisions involve subjective value judgments, not sheer expertise. 

 BODY:
In a column in The New Republic, Peter Orzsag, President Obama's former budget director, argues for making the country's policy-setting less dysfunctional by making it "less democratic." One means for reducing politicized gridlock, he says, is to delegate more authority to "depoliticized commissions" of experts.
This is similar to the rationale behind establishing the Federal Reserve as an independent body: The Fed, at least theoretically, is shielded from short-term political interests. It can instead make decisions based what is good for the long-term interest of the economy, as determined by immutable economic laws and objective academic research. (In reality, of course, there have been many attempts to put political pressure on the Fed over the years, and within the central bank there is still broad disagreement about what's best for the long-term interest of the economy.)
Mr. Orszag also notes some other expert commissions, such as the military-base closing commissions, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), created by last year's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to make changes to the Medicare payment system. The military-base closing commissions have generally been effective, and the jury is still out on the nascent IPAB.
On narrowly defined (and often technical) policy issues, expert panels can be useful. But as I wrote in an article last year about politicians' poor incentives, delegating policy authority to technocratic panels is more problematic when dealing with larger economic matters that involve social value judgments, like austerity measures and tax reform.
These policy areas may sound like dry academic subjects. But they are thoroughly infused with, and ultimately shaped by, moral beliefs.
There are, after all, infinite combinations of spending cuts and tax increases that can add up to the same bottom line. Deciding what should get trimmed and what taxes should be increased or decreased involves questions of favoritism, welfare, compassion, fairness and all sorts of other subjective judgments not answerable by the "laws" of economics.
It's not clear that a doctorate in economics (or, for that matter, in theology) gives a person any more moral authority than anyone else. That's why such decisions are decided through a republican democracy -- both lower case -- and not by genius academics, however messy and dysfunctional the resulting process may be.

HEADLINE: Obama and 'Young Guns' Make Silicon Valley Pitches

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON and SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Republican leaders go further in using social media to get their messages across. 

 BODY:
8:15 p.m. | Updated Six miles from where President Obama held a Town Hall on Monday with LinkedIn's executives in Mountain View, Calif., to discuss his jobs plan, the House Republican leaders who describe themselves as "The Young Guns" gathered atFacebook's headquarters for a 6 p.m. ET live discussionon their vision of what needs to be done to jumpstart the economy.
It is the latest example of how President Obama - and Republican Congressional leaders - are using social media platforms to engage in discussions directly with people about their approaches to solve the nation's economic woes.
At Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer who worked as the chief of staff to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, led the discussion with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House Majority leader, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin who is chairman of the budget committee and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. They published a book last year called "Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders."
Questions for the three House Republican leaders are posted here on this Facebook page. The live event from Facebook's headquarters, where Facebook employees will also pose questions, can be watched here.
By late afternoon, there were questions posted on the Facebook wall about the future of Social Security, the threat of a government shutdown and the debate over extending the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy. "What justifiable reason is there for the mega rich paying a lesser percentage of wages and earnings than the middle class?" wrote Linda Mussaw.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama appeared at the Computer History museum, where he answered questions curated by LinkedIn employees from thousands posted by people who belong to LinkedIn's network.
"The LinkedIn town hall was a great chance for the President to hear directly from LinkedIn members across the country, to answer their questions and to discuss with them how his jobs plan will impact the economy and put Americans back to work," a White House spokesman said.
Mr. Obama appeared with Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for a similar Facebook live chat earlier this year.
As the House leaders spoke at the Facebook event, the Senatewas voting on yet another version of a stopgap spending bill in an effort to keep the government from shutting down over a dispute over disaster aid funding. Mr. Cantor was at the center of that dispute earlier this month, when he suggested that government should find savings equal to the extra money allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
But on Monday afternoon, Mr. Cantor said the spending debate is subject of "a lot of hyperbole in the press."
"I'm positive we'll get this thing done," he added.
The "Young Guns" held their fire at Democrats - perhaps aware of the youthful, left-coast audience, and instead focused on their own policy prescriptions, such as using social media like Facebook to better connect people to their government and reducing the government regulatory structure to encourage small businesses.
"It took more hours to go through Dodd-Frank than it did to build the Empire State Building," said Mr. McCarthy, using an analogy that might have been somewhat intangible to an audience that sees through lines of code rather than scaffolding.
The mainstream media were also a frequent target. The House Republicans criticized the conventional press for neglecting to cover certain stories and for separating officeholders from their constituents.
Electronic communication "strips away the intermediary between the people and their government," said Mr. Ryan, and Mr. McCarthy added, "I think it takes the spin out, too."
That attitude represents an approach the "Young Guns" share with Mr. Obama, whose administration has used almost every type of social media, from Flickr to Monday's LinkedIn event, to bypass the press.

HEADLINE: Facebook Forms a PAC

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: In forming a political action committee, Facebook is joining other social media companies in efforts to integrate with the political landscape. 

 BODY:
Facebook wants more friends. And it's willing to pay for them.
The Silicon Valley social media company has for the first time formed an old-fashioned political action committee and will use it to distribute cash to candidates in the coming elections. It is just one indication of how social media companies are integrating with the political landscape in a season in which these businesses are growing presences in the campaign conversation.
"FB PAC will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected," a company spokesman said.
The move comes as technology companies like Facebook are moving quickly to increase their influence in Washington amid increasingly complex legislative debates about patents, monopoly status and concerns about the privacy of users.
And it reflects a new desire among the senior executives at Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and other companies to use their novel technologies to be part of the political process in ways that they haven't before.
Google co-sponsored a Republican presidential debate with Fox News last week. On Monday, Facebook held a town hall meeting featuring top House Republicans just hours after LinkedIn held a similar town hall with President Obama.

Executives at Facebook declined to offer more details about their political action committee or say which races it would make contributions to. The company confirmed the group was incorporated on Monday after it was reported that it had registered the Internet domains for FBPAC.org and FBPAC.us.
Facebook has steadily increased its presence in Washington as it has grown. In 2007 it hired its first employee in the District of Columbia, and the office now has more than a dozen, including four federally registered lobbyists. The amount they have spent lobbying Congress has grown as well.
"The increase represents a continuation of our efforts to explain how our service works as well as the important actions we take to protect people who use our service and promote the value of innovation to our economy," said Andrew Noyes, a Facebook spokesman.
The company's competitors are also increasing their presence in the nation's capital as the competition for market dominance increasingly turns to legislative and regulatory fights.
According to disclosure documents filed in July, both Facebook and Google spent more money on lobbyists in the second quarter than ever before in yet another sign that the two technology giants are concerned about getting attention in Washington. Google increased its spending on lobbyists to $2.06 million in the second quarter, up from $1.48 million in the first quarter.
Facebook's spending on lobbying, while significantly less, increased to $320,000 in the second quarter, up from $230,000 in the first, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Google opened its Washington office in 2006, the same year it started its own political action committee. In that year, the company's committee distributed $36,984, according to OpenSecrets.Org, which tracks campaign spending. By 2010, the committee had distributed $345,000, all for congressional campaigns.
Google's office in Washington has grown as well. It now has 11 registered lobbyists as well as engineers, sales representatives and employees who work with enterprise clients, according to a company spokeswoman.
Last week, Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's board and the former chief executive, testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the issue of competition.
Mr. Schmidt told the committee that Google is in "the area" of a monopoly but is engaged in fierce competition with other companies.
Like Google, Facebook is facing increasing questions from lawmakers about the impact of its practices on its customers.
In May of 2010, the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post to respond to charges that it had acted cavalierly with user data and had made it too complicated for people to protect their privacy.
"The biggest message we have heard recently is that people want easier control over their information," Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. "Simply put, many of you thought our controls were too complex."
Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a nonpartisan group that focuses on privacy issues, said that it is not surprising that Facebook is looking to step up its lobbying efforts, particularly given new concerns about privacy issues since Facebook announced major changes to its platform last week.
"Facebook is monetizing its platform," Mr. Court said. "This is all about how much it is going to be able to push the envelope with consumers and not have the government require it to change."
Last week, when Mr. Schmidt was testifying before the Senate subcommittee, he was followed by three professional mimes who were working with the Consumer Watchdog group as part of an effort to show what it is like "to be tracked." The group supports legislation that would allow consumers to put themselves on a "do not track list" that would be similar to the "do not call list."
Mr. Court said having the mimes follow Mr. Schmidt in Washington was intended to demonstrate "how annoying it is to be tracked in the real world and not just online."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ties Bring Peril for Democratic Lawmaker

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: A former Goldman Sachs banker, Jim Himes understands the world of high finance better than most of his Congressional peers, and that is less of an asset than it once was. 

 BODY:
Jim Himes, a second-term congressman from Connecticut, is a surviving member of one of Washington's most endangered species: a Democrat with Wall Street ties.
A former Goldman Sachs banker whose district includes the hedge fund capitals of Greenwich and Stamford, Conn., Mr. Himes understands the world of high finance better than most of his Congressional peers. And lately, as a series of contentious regulatory and tax proposals has brought the moneyed class under fire, he has been playing the part of a Wall Street whisperer, trying to bring well-heeled Democrats in the financial industry back to the party that has made villains of them.
"I do hear anger," Mr. Himes said in a recent interview. "Many of them know me from my previous life, and they do call me and say, 'What the hell is going on?' "
Mr. Himes, 45, once benefited from his Wall Street past. His 12-year career at Goldman played well with voters near his Greenwich home during his first campaign in 2008, and he brought in more than $500,000 in donations from the securities and investments industry, nearly $150,000 of which came from individuals at Goldman.
Shortly after he beat out the incumbent, Christopher Shays, to win the seat, his expertise landed him a plum assignment on the House Financial Services Committee, where he helped write the House version of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul. Christopher S. Murphy, a fellow Connecticut Democrat, recalled seeing Mr. Himes giving impromptu economics lessons on the House floor during debates over the contentious bill. 
"There was always a crowd around Jim," Mr. Murphy recalled. "He very quickly became a safe harbor for moderate members who wanted to make sure we corrected the abuses of Wall Street without killing the markets."
But this year, Mr. Himes's financial background went from asset to liability. During the debt ceiling debate this summer, President Obama took aim at bankers and hedge fund managers, characterizing their tax rates as unfairly low and calling for an end to corporate tax loopholes. Mr. Obama repeated those calls in the budget debate this month, and recently proposed a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million a year, a provision he called the Buffett Rule, after the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.
For Mr. Himes, whose district has one of the highest concentrations of millionaires in the country, each new instance of fiery rhetoric meant more phone calls and e-mails from financiers angry about their status as left-wing punching bags.
"I like Jim, but I feel sorry for the guy," said one hedge fund manager in Mr. Himes's district, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid damaging his relationship with the congressman. "Every time Obama says 'fat cat banker' and 'greedy hedge fund manager,' I'm sure he cringes."
With a neat side part, a sharp jaw and the trim physique of a former Harvard lightweight crew captain, Mr. Himes, a Rhodes Scholar who once modeled for Ralph Lauren, still looks every bit the financial executive. In 2002, he left Goldman to take a job at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing nonprofit, where he stayed until running for office in 2008.
Asked about his time at Goldman, Mr. Himes said he thought the company's culture had changed between 1990, when he joined it as a junior banker in its Latin American division, and when he left it nearly a decade ago.
"When I joined it was a firm of 4,000 people, and when I left it was a firm of 22,000," he said. "When it was a firm of 4,000, all the partners knew each other, and if somebody screwed up, it meant you were going to hurt your friends. Now that it's a corporation, you've lost that sense of family."
Mr. Himes, who was born in Peru during one of his father's stints abroad as an executive with the Ford Foundation, is not eager to become known as the big-bank congressman, despite his fond memories of working at Goldman. He has fanned out his political interests in recent years, working on legislation on energy-efficient housing and early childhood education. And last week, he held a rally in Norwalk to celebrate the repeal of the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy for openly gay service members.
As Mr. Himes prepares to run for a third term, his focus on issues beyond Wall Street may be a nod to the current mood toward the financial services sector.
"I don't know that any politician, let alone a Democratic politician, is going to score points with his constituents by talking about his connections to the hedge fund industry," said Bruce McGuire, the president of the Connecticut Hedge Fund Association.
But Mr. Himes also said that the emotions stirred up by the financial crisis had made reforming Wall Street using his preferred method - logical, Spock-like analysis - nearly impossible.
"You don't always feel it in Greenwich or the Upper East Side, but there's a huge emotional dislocation out there," he said. "Americans think this is an unproductive sector, and it's a little hard to talk about capital formation in the context of the emotion."
Mr. Himes, who wears a blue woven bead bracelet given to him by a Zen master, has been trying to calm the furor surrounding Wall Street by staking out middle ground in many of the financial issues facing legislators. He favors regulating some kinds of derivatives, the exotic instruments that Mr. Buffett once called "financial weapons of mass destruction," while leaving others intact, like crop futures used by farmers to hedge against price swings. 
He also has a tempered view on the issue of carried interest, the type of income earned by some hedge fund and private equity managers that is taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Mr. Himes favors a blended rate that would tax carried interest above the lower capital gains rate but below the rate paid on ordinary income, to accommodate the different kinds of risk taken on by investors.
"The good news is, I can talk about alternate swap-execution facilities," Mr. Himes said of his approach to legislating. "The bad news is, my whole being is about having a fairly cool conversation about what's happening. I don't throw bombs. Michele Bachmann is a lot more fun than I am."
But if Mr. Himes's conciliatory streak has hurt his image, it has also made him an asset to moderate Democrats who are looking to reform the markets without resorting to vitriol. And as 2012 approaches, his ability to speak the language of the ultra-rich may come in handy for Democratic politicians - the president included - who have seen their Wall Street campaign donations dry up. 
"Look, there are some Wall Street guys who are never coming back to the Democratic Party," said Mr. Murphy, Mr. Himes's colleague in Congress. "But Jim is a committed Democrat who can also show the financial world that not all of us have two horns."

HEADLINE: Obama Talks About Jobs Amid Silicon Valley Talent Wars

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama is talking about job creation in Silicon Valley Monday, but for high-growth tech start-ups, the shortage is employees, not jobs. 

 BODY:
President Obama is in Silicon Valley Monday talking about job creation and promoting his jobs bill at a town hall meeting hosted by LinkedIn. But many people in the tech capital of the world say that Silicon Valley is in its own little bubble, where the shortage is not jobs, but employees.
"There is a wall of applications," Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer, said in July. "Now it's about stepping on the gas pedal."
"It's extreme rapid growth," said Keith Rabois, chief operating officer at Square, the mobile payments start-up founded in November 2009. "Basically all year long, almost without fail, we added two employees or more a week."
The president, speaking at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., from LinkedIn employees and members nationwide, including small business owners and community college students, who are struggling with unemployment.
There is certainly unemployment in Silicon Valley, including in tech, especially for engineers without experience in the programming languages in vogue and skills like managing large sets of data. Big tech companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard have recently announced lay offs.
But among high-growth tech start-ups, there is a war for talent, as companies fight with one another to hire a finite number of talented engineers to work at an ever-growing number of tech companies. They dangle perks like six-figure salaries and free iPads and haircuts. 
Google added 2,452 employees in the three months through June, bringing its headcount to 28,768. That is 4,368 more employees than six months ago and 6,963 more than a year ago. And it plans to keep hiring. Google has said that 2011 will be its biggest hiring year in company history. It plans to add more than 6,000 employees.
"Great companies are no greater than their people," Larry Page, Google's chief executive, said in July. "We are continuing to hire and make sure our employees are happy and well-rewarded. It's crucial to our future."
Google's biggest limit to hiring is the speed at which it can absorb new employees, Mr. Pichette said. Its most pressing personnel challenge has been retaining employees who are lured away by other tech companies competing for engineers. Google gave everyone at the company a 10 percent raise last year to convince them to stay.
The raises had "a good impact on hiring and retention," Mr. Page said. "Over all, there's more excited people who want to work at Google and want to stay working at Google than we expected."
Twitter, meanwhile, has 600 employees, up from 250 a year ago, and is rapidly hiring. "Our business is growing robustly by all measures, so we are aggressively hiring and will continue to build the team as business grows," said Lynn Fox, a spokeswoman.
Square, which makes a mobile payment system, hopes to double in the next six months. It has 152 full-time employees, up from 57 six months ago and 30 a year ago. Most of the employees who Square is hiring are in engineering or design. Square is also hiring selectively in business roles like risk reduction, marketing and legal.
"We want to double or triple our engineering and design teams in the next six months," Mr. Rabois said.
Asked about the tax incentives that Mr. Obama is proposing for job creation, Mr. Rabois said Square hires solely on the basis of the company's needs and the talent it can find.
"We look at people on the basis of their abilities, passion and skill set, and 50 percent of the people we hire are through employee referrals," he said. "We hire people because of our needs, building amazing products for our users - that's the only calculation that's helpful."

HEADLINE: Demonstrations Test Police Trained for Bigger Threats

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
When members of the loose protest movement known as Occupy Wall Street began a march from the financial district to Union Square on Saturday, the participants seemed relatively harmless, even as they were breaking the law by marching in the street without a permit.
But to the New York Police Department, the protesters represented something else: a visible example of lawlessness akin to that which had resulted in destruction and violence at other anticapitalist demonstrations, like the Group of 20 economic summit meeting in London in 2009 and the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999. 
The Police Department's concerns came up against a perhaps milder reality on Saturday, when their efforts to maintain crowd control suddenly escalated: protesters were corralled by police officers who put up orange mesh netting; the police forcibly arrested some participants; and a deputy inspector used pepper spray on four women who were on the sidewalk, behind the orange netting.
The police's actions suggested the flip side of a force trained to fight terrorism, in a city whose police commissioner acknowledges the ownership of a gun big enough to take down a plane, but that may appear less nimble in dealing with the likes of the Wall Street protesters. So even as the members of Occupy Wall Street seem unorganized and, at times, uninformed, their continued presence creates a vexing problem for the Police Department.
In recent weeks, police commanders have been discussing the riots in London this summer, and strategizing how they would stop a similar situation in New York, said Roy Richter, the president of the union in New York that represents officers of captain and higher rank. And since August, investigators with the Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have monitored the online efforts of activists to bring demonstrations to Wall Street, people briefed on the matter said.
The Police Department conducts an internal review of its response to every large-scale demonstration, and the protest on Saturday appeared to have resulted in the largest number of arrests since the demonstrations surrounding the Republican National Convention in 2004. The events of Saturday are certain to be examined, especially since so many protesters were recording the events with cameras; videos of the pepper spray episode, for example, offered views from several angles.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, defended the use of pepper spray as appropriate and added that it was ''used sparingly.''
But Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, said that in the video clips he had seen, the use of pepper spray ''didn't look good,'' although Mr. Vallone cautioned that he wanted to know if any interactions had occurred between the officers and the women in the minutes before pepper spray was used.
''If no prior verbal command was given and disobeyed, then the use of spray in that instance is completely inappropriate,'' Mr. Vallone said. On Monday, several Web sites identified the supervising officer who used the pepper spray as Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna, a longtime commander in Manhattan. Like a number of other officers, Inspector Bologna is a defendant in lawsuits claiming wrongful arrests at protests staged during the Republican National Convention in 2004..
A police official who had spoken to Inspector Bologna following the incident confirmed that the inspector had used the spray. ''He did his job and now he's concerned for the safety of his family,'' said the official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to confirm the inspector's name.
According to the Police Department's patrol guide, officers may use pepper spray under certain conditions, including ''when a member reasonably believes it is necessary to effect an arrest of a resisting suspect.'' The guide also advises that the spray should ''not be used in situations that do not require the use of physical force.''
The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct, received 328 complaints in 2010 relating to the use of pepper spray, accounting for about 5.5 percent of the total number of complaints citing improper use of force.
In the past week, the review board has received more than a dozen complaints relating to officers' interactions with protesters, said a spokeswoman for the board, Linda Sachs.
Although the Police Department has closely monitored the encampment of protesters in the Financial District and stationed officers there, there appears to have been little discussion between the police and the protesters.
Mr. Browne, the police spokesman said that the protesters never sought a permit for Saturday's march.
The lack of communication between the two sides may have set the stage for the confrontation on Saturday near Union Square.
When groups have permits, ''the department is pretty accommodating when it comes to street marches,'' said Christopher T. Dunn, associate legal director for the New York Civil Liberties Union. He added that some groups had perfectly good reasons for not wanting to engage with the police, and ''that's certainly their prerogative.''
In interviews, police officials described the lack of a permit and the fact that protesters were obstructing traffic as key factors in the arrests and the department's decision to end the march.
''If you have a permit, the police will accommodate for things like diverting traffic,'' Mr. Browne said. ''If you take a street for a parade or protest without a permit, you are subject to arrest.''
Mr. Richter, of the police union, said that from the perspective of the protesters, the Police Department's decision to suddenly end the demonstration might have appeared arbitrary.
''I can see it from a demonstrator's view, asking, 'What changed?' '' Mr. Richter said. ''But there comes a point when the command staff makes a decision that the crowd is too big, and we're at a breaking point, and we have to take back the street.''

HEADLINE: Hotel Rates, in Some Cities, Seem Fully Recovered

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MONDAY morning, I was looking out my home office window in Tucson at Big Red, parked beside a 25-foot saguaro. Big Red is my beloved 1994 Ford F-150 pickup truck, purchased last winter for $500 from friends who were no longer using it. It has 298,818 miles on the odometer, and it still runs beautifully -- like any good old F-150.
Ah, yes. Puts in perspective the hotel room prices in New York City I found on Sunday as I started making plans for a four-night trip in mid-October. Is it really true that four nights at even a midlevel hotel in Manhattan will end up costing more than three Big Reds? 
It is. On Expedia, the total for a Hampton Inn in Manhattan for those four nights, taxes included, was $1,620.96. Don't even ask about a four-star or higher hotel.
There are two lessons here, the obvious one being that moving away from New York gives you a good appreciation of just how expensive New York is to stay in. The other lesson is that hotel prices in major markets -- the markets most frequented by business travelers -- are way up.
In fact, hotel rates are up across the board in the United States, as growing demand improves fortunes for the lodgings industry. PKF Hospitality Research recently revised its 2011 forecast for domestic revenue growth for the industry, saying that ''it's tough not to be optimistic'' about future growth, despite a stalled economy.
PKF Hospitality Research says that it now expects average room rates in the country to rise 3.2 percent this year. Last year, the other two top industry measures, occupancy rates and revenue per available room, also increased after declines in 2008 and 2009.
In Manhattan, the news has been especially good for the industry, if not for those of us booking a room. In the second quarter, for example, the average daily rate for rooms increased 9.2 percent, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the research firm, found. The upscale hotel segment, by the way, had the biggest increase in revenue per room, up 9.1 percent. (My four-day stay in Manhattan would cost $4,833.52 if I booked the cheapest room listed by Expedia.com for those dates at the Four Seasons New York.)
Naturally, hotels could not be raising prices if demand were not solid. In past recoveries, hotels have typically lagged the rest of the economy. If that's different this time, perhaps we need to examine what I'll call the Junior's Cheesecake paradox.
As reported last week in The New York Times, sales of various nonessential goods are rising as people opt for small indulgences even as the economy languishes. Cheesecake sales are up 22 percent over all. At the Brooklyn landmark Junior's Cheesecake ($43.95 for the basic cheesecake, with shipping), sales are up again after dropping for the first time ever during a recession.
Cheesecake aside, Robert Mandelbaum, the director of research information at PKF Hospitality, said that the firm's forecasters were ''caught by surprise'' by the apparently growing strength of the hotel market, which started a recovery last year. ''With high unemployment, incomes going nowhere, low consumer confidence and yet two consecutive years of 7 percent increases in demand, we were like, wow,'' he said. ''So we spent a lot of time trying to look under this economic disconnect.''
Besides employment, other economic indicators had soured in the three months between PKF's earlier forecast in June and the current more bullish revision. The nation's debt was downgraded, the stock market sank and unemployment remained high.
But researchers pried out some other factors related to business travel demand. Keep in mind that the supply of rooms has remained generally in check because of weak investment in new construction.
''You feel sort of awkward using a phrase like 'have and have-not,' but it's the case that while companies may not be hiring new people, they're spending more on business travel,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said.
''Business travelers supported by a corporate budget, or well-off individuals traveling for leisure purposes, were simply not as affected by the recession,'' he added.
Of course, there is no guarantee that the hotel recovery is sustainable if the economy takes another downturn. Yes, demand and revenue are increasing, but ''whether that translates into capital spending for new construction or significant renovation is the outstanding question,'' said Maryam Wehe, the senior vice president for hospitality at the industry analysis firm Applied Predictive Technologies.
Still, there are some tentative signs of new spending. The 2,000-room Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, for example, is undergoing a $39 million renovation that's scheduled for completion next spring.
On Expedia, incidentally, the cheapest rate at the Marriott Marquis for my four nights in October was $2,533.96. Valet parking for Big Red extra.

HEADLINE: History That's Written in Beads as Well as in Words

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Distressed by most historians' overwhelming preoccupation with the modern world, an unusual coalition of scholars is trying to stage an intellectual coup, urging their colleagues to look up from the relatively recent swirl of bloody conflicts, global financial exchanges and technological wonders and gaze further back, toward humanity's origins.
The up-close and personal accounts that have won professional praise and rewards in recent years are worthy, said Daniel Lord Smail, a medieval historian at Harvard, but he says the ''microhistory'' trend has stunted the ambition to think big.
''In the last two or three decades, historians have found it hard to think across large time spans,'' he contends; gone are the sweeping narratives of humanity's advance. The antidote to this ''shallow history,'' he said, is ''deep history,'' stretching back 50,000, 500,000, even 2.6 million years to the earliest humans. Recent advances in archaeological analysis, gene mapping and evolutionary ecology have led to an astonishing expansion in our knowledge of the distant past, despite the lack of written records, the historian's traditional sidearm. 
Yet at the same time, historians and other humanities scholars have increasingly restricted their sights to the near present. Three out of four historians, for example, specialize in the post-industrial era or the 20th century, the American Historical Association reports.
After reviewing the roster of professorships, course offerings, dissertation topics and publications in recent decades, Mr. Smail and Andrew Shryock, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Michigan, concluded that both of their disciplines rarely venture beyond the last 250 years. Most of the long march of human existence is being ignored, they complain.
To point the way toward what Mr. Smail calls the ''new intellectual frontier,'' a small cadre of diverse collaborators in anthropology, archaeology, primatology, genetics and linguistics have spent the last two and half years working on a forthcoming book, ''Deep History: The Architecture of Past and Present'' (University of California Press) that serves as a kind of manifesto for their cause.
As the authors explain, deep history emphasizes trends and processes rather than individuals and events, paying more attention to kinship, genealogy and developing traditions, like hospitality, for example. What historians and other humanists do best is tell stories, Mr. Shryock said. They can help lift the fog that has surrounded our ancestors and bring them to life. In these ancient, shadowy figures, people today can recognize the family ties, food, religious fervor, sexual passions, conflicts and artistic impulses that shape their own lives.
Dipesh Chakrabarty, a historian at the University of Chicago, who has seen the book, said that since historians are not those who do the radiocarbon dating or the genetic analysis, they won't be making discoveries. Rather, they have a role ''in retelling the human story,'' he said, adding, ''They bring to the table a sense of contingency in human affairs,'' of the unpredictable mix of individual actions and social and environmental forces.
Mr. Chakrabarty added that deep history was appealing because it enabled you to take a step back. ''The more contemporary history gets, the more politicized it gets,'' he said.
Some in the field challenge the contention that historians have abandoned the long view. Anthony Grafton, president of the American Historical Association, appreciates that deep history can encourage scholars to look further back. But he disputes the claim that comprehensive histories are in short supply.
''I think that whole thing about the grand narrative is a cliche that gets thrown around a lot,'' he said.
The proponents of ''deep history'' seek to upend the discipline's most precious precept and method: the reliance on the written record of the past. ''No documents, no history,'' a manual of historical study commanded in 1898. Everything that came before is shunted into the category of prehistory.
The 10 authors of ''Deep History'' want to eliminate prehistory as a category and unchain historians from the word. ''We want to change what counts as evidence,'' Mr. Shryock said. ''There are all kinds of materials that leave traces and can serve as evidence,'' he added, naming fossils, tools, household items, pictures, structures, ecological changes and genetic variations.
As an example, Mr. Shryock and Mr. Smail point to an object as common and unremarkable as the bead. In a new paper submitted to The American Historical Review that they said they hoped would stir debate, they write that archaeologists now know that an explosion of bead making, using shells and pearl teeth from red deer, occurred in the Mediterranean region about 43,000 years ago. While Neanderthals did not create beads, our human ancestors did, using them to extend social relationships, signal status or loyalties, adorn the body and exchange for goods, as an early form of currency.
Connect the dots, and beads can also be seen as the precursors of mass-produced items.
''Relative to population size, after all, shell beads were perhaps being produced in the Upper Paleolithic at the rate iPhones are being manufactured today,'' they declare, adding that gold beads -- ''expensive copies of inexpensive objects'' -- are linked with the emergence of different classes, ''a strange inversion of the pattern of luxury knockoffs.''
The proliferation of beads, they argue, was used to form political alliances and economic networks that were, in turn, reinforced by the exchange of beads and their offspring, coins. Later, beads allowed ancient people to transform food surpluses, created by shifts in production, into commerce and political power.
The authors continue the tale to the present, maintaining that credit cards, bank notes, gold coins and shell bead necklaces all share a single genealogy. ''You can't fully understand how money functions today without beads,'' Mr. Shryock said.
The same sort of analysis can be applied in other realms. Climate change did not begin with the industrial revolution, Mary C. Stiner, an archaeology professor at the University of Arizona, and Gillian Feeley-Harnik, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, argue in ''Deep History: The Architecture of Past and Present,'' which is due out in November.
Though the scale is of a different magnitude, human beings have left their footprints on the environment for 50,000 years through hunting, fishing, domesticating animals and agricultural burn-offs. American Indians in the Eastern woodlands managed their environment, Mr. Smail added, cutting down trees to create a habitat for deer.
The desire to take the long view is not new. Nineteenth-century thinkers like Auguste Comte, Karl Marx and Herbert Spencer chronicled humanity's fortunes with great ambition and scarce hard evidence. In the 1920s and '30s, French historians of the Annales School combined history, geography and sociology to explore the evolution of civilizations. And for the last 20 years or so, the historians David Christian and Fred Spier have championed big history, urging their colleagues to begin their once-upon-a-time accounts billions of years ago, with the big bang.
With the rise of postmodernism in the academy in the 1970s and '80s, scholars tended to retreat from grand narratives, which were criticized for presenting European domination as both inevitable and desirable. Deep history advocates say they want to resuscitate the scale without the bias.
William Cronon, an environmental historian at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said he was sympathetic to the aims of deep history and that it meshed well with his own work, but ''what matters in the end are what questions you ask.''
You can say, he offered, that Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of President John F. Kennedy depended on the discovery of iron, but so what? ''The questions shape the evidence,'' he said.
Advocates like Mr. Smail and Mr. Shryock don't disagree; they just want to provoke different questions. Some historians and other humanists treat the modern era as if it suddenly popped out of a chicken, ''like an unfertilized egg,'' Mr. Smail said. ''Historians need to develop the habit of looking backward,'' he said, '' to see how their own period is in a dialogue with what came before.''

HEADLINE: Europe Gives Airlines Room On Emissions

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS (AP) -- A European Union program aimed at slowing climate change will allow airlines to emit 85 percent of their carbon dioxide limits free in the hope they will use the money to modernize their fleets, an official said Monday. 
The European Union's existing cap-and-trade system limits the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants and big factories in the bloc by issuing permits for each ton of carbon they can emit. Each company is allocated permits to emit a set amount of carbon dioxide. They can buy extra credits if they exceed that limit; if they emit less, they can sell credits.
Next year, all airlines flying to and from Europe will be brought into the program, which is currently being challenged in court by some American carriers.
Jos Delbeke, the European Union's director general for climate action, said Monday that carriers would be allowed to emit 85 percent of their limit -- or cap -- free for the first year to ease the economic impact on the industry. The cap is set at 97 percent of the average aviation emissions from 2004 to 2006.
For the 2013-20 period, the cap will fall to 95 percent of that number, and the free allowances will decline to 82 percent.
Mr. Delbeke said airlines would be allowed to pass on to travelers the additional cost of those permits. He estimated the per ticket cost would be 2 to 12 euros ($2.70 to $16.20).
The European Union's climate action commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said the free allowances would save the aviation industry more than 20 billion euros over the next decade.
''With these potential revenues, airlines could invest in modernizing their fleets, improving fuel efficiency and using non-fossil aviation fuel,'' she said.
The Air Transport Association of America, which represents airlines based in the United States, together with United Continental and American Airlines, have taken the European Union to court, arguing that imposing emission caps on non-European carriers breaches international law.

HEADLINE: In Defense of Pakistan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 24 editorial ''The Latest Ugly Truth About Pakistan'' is disappointing, to say the least. You accepted as ''hard truth'' the unsubstantiated claim by Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about Pakistan's collusion with Afghan militants. 
To this day, no evidence of the Pakistani intelligence agency's support to the militants of the Haqqani network or any other group has been provided to the government of Pakistan, and the agency has categorically denied having any links to them. If there is any evidence, the best course would have been to discuss it with Pakistan, an ally in the war on terrorism. Pakistan's policy has always been to seek a more intensive engagement with the United States.
The question is whether Admiral Mullen, the retiring top military officer, is trying to make Pakistan a scapegoat for the troubled war in Afghanistan. We hope not.
And we regret that you cast Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism and extremism in a negative light. As a result of Pakistan's efforts to root out terrorism, the country has lost more than 30,000 civilian men, women and children and more than 5,000 armed forces personnel, and has suffered billions of dollars in economic losses. Pakistan has thus paid a heavy price for being a front-line state against terrorism.

HEADLINE: In Riddle of Mideast Upheaval, Turkey Offers Itself as an Answer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Not so long ago, the foreign policy of Turkey revolved around a single issue: the divided island of Cyprus. These days, its prime minister may be the most popular figure in the Middle East, its foreign minister envisions a new order there and its officials have managed to do what the Obama administration has so far failed to: position themselves firmly on the side of change in the Arab revolts and revolutions.
No one is ready to declare a Pax Turkana in the Middle East, and indeed, its foreign policy is strewn this year with missteps, crises and gains that feel largely rhetorical. It even lacks enough diplomats. But in an Arab world where the United States seems in retreat, Europe ineffectual and powers like Israel and Iran unsettled and unsure, officials of an assertive, occasionally brash Turkey have offered a vision for what may emerge from turmoil across two continents that has upended decades of assumptions.
Not unexpectedly, the vision's center is Turkey. 
''Turkey is the only country that has a sense of where things are going, and it has the wind blowing on its sails,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Istanbul Bilgi University.
The country's foreign policy seized the attention of many in the Middle East and beyond after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's tour this month of three Arab countries that have witnessed revolutions: Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Even Mr. Erdogan's critics were impressed with the symbolism of the trip.
Though many criticize his streak of authoritarianism at home, the public abroad seemed taken by a prime minister who portrayed himself as the proudly Muslim leader of a democratic and prosperous country that has come out forcefully on the side of revolution and in defense of Palestinian rights.
One Turkish newspaper, supportive of Mr. Erdogan, called the visits the beginning ''of a new era in our region.'' An Egyptian columnist praised what he called Mr. Erdogan's ''leadership qualities.'' And days later, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spoke boldly of an axis between Egypt and Turkey, two of the region's most populous and militarily powerful countries, that would underpin a new order in the region, one in which Israel would stay on the margins until it made peace with its neighbors.
''What's happening in the Middle East is a big opportunity, a golden opportunity,'' a senior Turkish official said in Ankara, the capital. He called Turkey ''the new kid on the block.''
The trip marked a pivot after what many had viewed as a series of setbacks for a country that, like most of the world, utterly failed to predict the revolts in the region.
After long treating the Arab world with a measure of disdain -- Israel and Turkey were strategic allies in the 1990s -- Turkey had spent years cultivating ties with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. More than 25,000 Turks worked in Libya, and Syria was seen as the gateway to Turkey's ambitions to economically integrate part of the Middle East.
Even after the uprisings erupted, Turkey opposed NATO's intervention in Libya. Until last month, it held out hope that Mr. Assad, despite evidence to the contrary, could oversee a transition in Syria.
Though Mr. Erdogan came out early in demanding that President Hosni Mubarak step down in Egypt -- at the very time American officials were trying to devise ways for him to serve out his term -- that stance came with little cost. Mr. Mubarak and Mr. Erdogan were not fond of each other, and Egyptian officials resented Turkey's growing profile.
''The old policy collapsed, and a new policy is required now toward the Middle East,'' said Ersin Kalaycioglu, a professor of political science at Sabanci University in Istanbul.
In an interview, Mr. Davutoglu, viewed by many as the architect of Turkey's engagement with the region, laid out that new policy. In addition to a proposed alliance with Egypt, he said Turkey would position itself on the side of the revolts, especially in neighboring Syria, which represents Turkey's biggest challenge. He insisted that Turkey could help integrate the region by virtue of its economy, with its near tripling of exports since Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party took power in 2002.
The outline suggested an early version of the European Union for the Middle East -- economic integration and political coordination -- and Mr. Davutoglu said such an arrangement would eventually require at least a degree of military cooperation.
''There should be regional ownership,'' he said. ''Not Turkish, not Arab, not Iranian, but a regional ownership.''
The vision is admittedly ambitious, and Mr. Davutoglu's earlier prescription of ''zero problems'' with neighbors has run up against the hard realities of the region. Turkey faces a growing crisis over rights to gas in the sea off Cyprus, still divided between Greek and Turkish regions and still a foreign policy mess for Turkey. Relations with Israel collapsed after Israeli troops killed nine people on board a Turkish flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza last year.
Iran, Turkey's neighbor to the east and competitor in the region, is bitter over a Turkish decision to accede to American pressure and host a radar station as part of a NATO missile defense system. Syrian and Turkish leaders no longer talk with one another.
But the sense of rising Turkish power and influence is so pronounced in the country these days that it sometimes borders on jingoism. It has touched on the country's deep current of nationalism, and perhaps a hint of romanticism, harbored by the more religious, for Turkey's return to an Arab world it ruled for more than four centuries.
''We're not out there to recreate the Ottoman Empire, but we are out there to make the most of the influence we have in a region that is embracing our leadership,'' said Suat Kiniklioglu, deputy chairman of external affairs for Mr. Erdogan's party.
Even those who bristle at what they see as Mr. Erdogan's arrogance acknowledge that he represents a phenomenon, at home and abroad. He brought his populism to the Arab world, where he displayed an intuitive sense of the resonance that the Palestinian issue still commands, in contrast to American officials who have misunderstood it, failed to appreciate it or tried to wish it away. In speeches, he catered to the West and his domestic critics by embracing a secular state, even as he prayed in suit and tie in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
For a region long stirred with anger at seemingly impotent leaders, submissive to American and Israeli demands, Mr. Erdogan came across as independent and forceful.
Cengiz Candar, a Turkish columnist with a resume in the Arab world dating from the early 1970s, called it Mr. Erdogan's ''animal-like political intuitions.''
He added: ''And these intuitions tell him, apart from the emotions, that you're on the right track. As along as you take these steps, Turkey is consolidating its stature as a regional power more and more and you will be an actor on the international stage.''
There remains a debate in Turkey over the long-term aims of the engagement. No one doubts that officials with his party -- deeply pious, with roots in political Islam -- sympathize with Islamist movements seeking to enter mainstream Arab politics, namely the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and, more so, the Nahda Party in Tunisia. Mr. Candar calls them ''kinsmen.'' ''They speak a common dialect,'' he said.
But relations remain good with the United States, even if American officials accuse Mr. Erdogan of overconfidence. Some Turkish officials worry that the crisis with Israel will end up hurting the relationship with Washington; others believe that Turkey is bent on supplanting Israel as the junior partner of the United States in the Middle East.
The bigger challenges seem to be within Turkey. Although Turkey has opened new embassies across Africa and Latin America, its diplomatic staff remains small, and the Foreign Ministry is trying to hire 100 new employees per year. Mr. Kiniklioglu, the party official, estimated that no more than 20 people were devising foreign policy.
The exuberance of Turkish officials runs the risk of backlash, too. The Arab world's long-held suspicion toward Turkey has faded, helped by the soft power of popular Turkish television serials and Mr. Erdogan's appeal. Yet senior officials acknowledge the potential for an Arab backlash in a region long allergic to any hint of foreign intervention. Somewhat reflexively, Egyptian Islamists, piqued last week by Mr. Erdogan's comments about a secular state, warned him against interfering in their affairs.
And across the spectrum in Turkey, still wrestling with its own Kurdish insurgency in the southeast, critics and admirers acknowledge that the vision of a Turkish-led region, prosperous and stable, remains mostly a fleeting promise amid all the turmoil. ''The image is good,'' said Mr. Kalaycioglu, the professor. ''Whether it's bearing any fruit is anyone's guess. Nothing so far seems to be happening beyond that image.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Rebounds on Hopes for Europe

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN; Matthew Saltmarsh and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street rallied Monday as investors shrugged off some negative figures on the American economy and reacted positively to unconfirmed reports that European officials were developing plans to confront the Continent's fiscal crisis.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 2.5 percent, adding 272.38 points, to 11,043.86. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.3 percent, or 26.52 points, to 1,162.95. The Nasdaq composite index was up 1.35 percent, or 33.46 points, to 2,516.69.
A spokesman for the European Commission confirmed that discussions were under way on plans to extend the effectiveness of the euro zone's bailout fund, perhaps expanding the borrowing power of the fund but not the amount of money that nations were contributing. But as has often been the case, European leaders on Monday seemed to have different perceptions of what was being discussed and how likely it was that the proposals would find support. 
Even so, investors moved to buy stocks and drove down the prices of safe haven assets like Treasury bonds and gold. Analysts said that the markets' response showed the hunger for a political solution to Europe's sovereign debt crisis, as well as a belief that stocks might have dropped too far in recent days.
''People woke up this morning, looked at some vaguely positive news in Europe and said, you know what, I'm willing to take a shot with stocks at these levels,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
Monthly new-home sales in the United States hit a six-month low in August at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 295,000 homes, down from 302,000 in July. Prices were down 8.7 percent, the Commerce Department reported. Separately, a forecast of third-quarter earnings based on data by Thomson Reuters predicted that the earnings of S.& P. 500 companies would rise 13.7 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 17 percent.
Markets have tumbled in recent weeks on grim economic news. Wall Street suffered through one of its worst days of the year on Thursday after the Federal Reserve said it saw ''significant downside risks'' to the country's economic outlook. But analysts say that the markets have grown somewhat numb to such news.
Gold prices were down for a fifth consecutive day. They fell more than $100 before recovering to settle at $1,622 an ounce, down from a peak of nearly $1,900 on Aug. 22. Analysts attributed the drop to investors looking for cash, but some also described it as a correction for a commodity that has reached nominal record highs in recent weeks. But James Steel, an analyst at HSBC, said that the dip was an indication of volatility in an uncertain market, rather than a sign that the market for gold may be turning.
''The issues that have pushed the market up for the last three years -- the E.U. sovereign debt issues, our mounting debt issues, the structural issues in the dollar, and geopolitical risks -- none of those have been solved in the last four days,'' he said. ''That would argue that the bull market in gold is not over.''
Interest rates rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 21/32, to 102, and the yield rose to 1.90 percent, from 1.83 percent late Friday.
In Europe on Monday, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 closed up 2.8 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt closed up 2.9 percent. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5 percent.
In the Asia-Pacific region, stocks declined, compounding the sharp falls they had suffered during the previous week. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 2.2 percent, ending at 8,374.13 points. The Kospi in South Korea ended down 2.6 percent and the Taiex in Taiwan declined 2.4 percent on Monday. The Hang Seng was 1.5 percent lower.
A technical issue kept the Dow from accurately updating for 12 minutes at the beginning of trading in New York. The index opened flat as its component stocks and other indexes rose in the minutes after the opening bell. A press officer for the index said the problem had been fixed.

HEADLINE: Christie, No Fan, Blocks Tax Credit for 'Jersey Shore'

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey on Monday blocked a $420,000 tax credit that the state's Economic Development Authority had approved last week.
Was the loser a high-tech startup? An alternative energy company, perhaps? 
No. It was Snooki and the Situation.
The production company behind the reality series ''Jersey Shore'' had applied for the credit, intended to expand film and television shooting in the state, to help cover costs for its inaugural season in 2009.
Mr. Christie said he was ''duty-bound'' to see that taxpayers were ''not footing a $420,000 bill for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.''
''In this difficult fiscal climate,'' he wrote to Caren S. Franzini, the chief executive of the Economic Development Authority, ''the taxpayers of New Jersey should not be forced to subsidize projects such as 'Jersey Shore.' ''
''Jersey Shore,'' shown on MTV, is hardly the only reality program to get economic help from the state in which it sets up its cameras. One show, ''Sarah Palin's Alaska,'' generated a small tempest on blogs by claiming $1.2 million in Alaska tax credits under a plan that Ms. Palin had signed into law in 2008, when she was governor.
Mr. Christie told Ms. Franzini that he was not stopping other applications that had gotten the green light from the authority. Among them were tax credits totaling $9 million for a production company behind ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,'' the long-running television drama about detectives on the New York side of the Hudson River, and $176,900 for three films.
Jeannie Kedas, a spokeswoman for MTV, said Mr. Christie's veto of the credit ''does not affect the show.''
State Senator Joseph F. Vitale, a Democrat from Middlesex County who had opposed the tax credit for ''Jersey Shore,'' applauded Mr. Christie's action.
''It's about the words, and words matter,'' Mr. Vitale, a Democrat from Middlesex County, said. ''The words the cast members use to describe Italian-Americans, 'Guido' and others, are no different to me than words used to disparage other ethnic groups or races. It wouldn't be an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars to support that kind of language. That's my beef with the show.''
But it is not his only beef. ''It's just a bunch of deadwoods getting drunk and getting arrested,'' he said. ''I'm a big fan of turning the channel.''

HEADLINE: For a U.N. Ambassador, Rigmarole and Moving Moments

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
On Sept. 15, just in time for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, City Room asked a question: What nation that you probably wouldn't hear about would you like to hear about? Or, more precisely, what nation's diplomats would you like to find out about?
One nation that came to mind was Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries. It was last in the news in July when antigovernment protests left at least 19 people dead. The president, Bingu wa Mutharika, a former World Bank economist who had been credited with reducing hunger in his country of 16 million, tired of dissent and demonstrations and warned that he did not want protesters returning to the streets. ''I'll go after you,'' he was quoted as saying. ''Even if you hide in holes, I'll smoke you out.'' 
Britain suspended aid to the Malawi government, and a United States foreign aid agency put a $350 million grant on hold, where it remains.
Malawi's representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Brian G. Bowler, 46, arrived in June 2010 after postings in India, Belgium, the European Union, France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Holland. He said that during the General Assembly, he had been focused on Malawi's role as one of 19 vice presidents, a role that put him in charge of the session on Friday afternoon when the president of the newest member nation, South Sudan, took the floor for the first time.
''That was moving for me personally,'' Mr. Bowler said. ''It was a great moment to welcome South Sudan.''
He said diplomats from small nations go almost unnoticed in New York. And there is no special notice for them when they arrive: no expedited process to whisk them through immigrations and customs. Nor is there a security detail once they take up their routine in Manhattan.
''When it comes to entering J.F.K., the rigamarole you have to go through,'' Ambassador Bowler said. ''The visa says 'foreign minister of a foreign country.' It doesn't take the archbishop of Canterbury to work it out, but they don't get it. I'm not knocking the system. I think they're doing it for a very good reason. They have experience that's shown it's necessary. It's the way they're doing it. It's a style.''
Mr. Bowler, who said Malawi was a major producer of burley tobacco -a light-colored variety also grown in parts of the United States- said that he had not met Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who addressed the General Assembly last week and mentioned, among other things, the city's efforts to fight smoking. The city says 14 percent of New Yorkers smoke now, compared with nearly 22 percent in 2002.
''We support the drive to fight cancer,'' Mr. Bowler said, ''but we've got a double whammy. Our main foreign currency earner is tobacco. Having to come up with an alternate crop, it's like going to the Caribbean and telling people, 'Don't fish.' But the warning shots have been fired. Tobacco is on the way out.''
As long as tobacco is still being grown, however, the West should consider its effects on people who handle it, Mr. Bowler said.
''In Africa, children handle tobacco from 5 years old on,'' he said, ''but we didn't know this when the white man brought the crop across. Very few Africans smoke. We know to grow the tobacco and send it. They've created the patch, which is nicotine absorbed through the skin. The leaf is pure, straight, hard-core nicotine. A child by the time he's 10 could have as much nicotine as a 40- or 50-year-old smoker. One of my pleas would be to put money into research to come up with tangible statistics and some kind of program to address Malawians and Zimbabweans with young cancers.''
His days have been a whirl of meetings and receptions. One night last week, Mr. Bowler was invited to five social events in five different places around the city. ''It's glamorous because there are all the dinners with all the right people,'' he said, ''but you have to leverage it. There are opportunities for networking and strategizing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mixed Reaction to Europe's Talk of Bolstering a Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND STEPHEN CASTLE; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Stephen Castle from Brussels. Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris and Landon Thomas Jr. from London.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Wedged between impatient financial markets and restive voters, European political leaders struggled on Monday to formulate a bolder response to the sovereign debt crisis, including possibly expanding the firepower of the euro zone's bailout fund.
European officials said a plan was in the works that would enlarge the bailout fund's borrowing power but not the amount that countries were contributing. The proposal was met guardedly by German officials, who are already struggling to swing public opinion in favor of the more modest aid plan they agreed to in July, let alone any new initiatives.
As finance ministers and central bankers trickled back to Europe from meetings in Washington over the weekend, markets were clearly eager for a plan that would isolate Greece's problems from the rest of the Continent and ensure that Italy and Spain did not also fall victim to the debt crisis.
The main stock indexes in Europe rose Monday, in part because of expectations that a more robust response to the problem was in the works. 
A more potent bailout fund would not remove the need for other changes, like strengthening the banking system and improving decision making by the European Union, said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. But it would help, he said.
''I don't think one measure can solve it all, but it would make a significant difference in market sentiment,'' said Mr. Veron, who testified in Washington last week before the Senate Banking Committee on the debt crisis. Meanwhile, Finland appeared to be closer to resolving an impasse that had threatened to hold up deployment of the existing bailout fund. Alexander Stubb, the Finnish minister for European affairs, said the country's Parliament was likely to approve a plan agreed to by leaders in July.
Finland is also close to resolving a dispute about its demand for collateral in return for granting more aid to Greece. The dispute illustrated how political opposition in just one of the 17 European Union countries that use the euro can block initiatives.
''I'm very confident we will get the package through Parliament,'' Mr. Stubb said by phone. He declined to give details of how the collateral dispute might be resolved.
In Brussels, Amadeu Altafaj-Tardio, a spokesman for the European Commission, confirmed that discussions were under way on methods to extend the effectiveness of the bailout fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility.
Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, had made clear at meetings in Washington that the euro zone was ''contemplating further leveraging'' of the stability fund, Mr. Altafaj-Tardio said. That option has been urged by United States officials.
Separately, leaders tried to quash rumors that Greece and its creditors had discussed the possibility of banks' taking a larger cut in the value of their Greek bond holdings -- perhaps as much as 50 percent -- to reduce the government's debt burden to a more manageable level.
Such a move remained highly controversial and was opposed by the large banks as well as the European Central Bank, which owns Greek bonds with a value of as much as 60 billion euros, or $80.8 billion. Any Greek default would probably also require a coordinated bailout of banks holding large amounts of Greek debt.
As has often been the case, European leaders seemed to have different perceptions of what was being discussed and how likely it was that the proposals would find support.
Martin Kotthaus, a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, said in Berlin there was no need to expand the size of the bailout fund by giving it more money than already agreed. There is fear that pumping more money into the fund might threaten the credit rating of countries like France by increasing their liabilities.
But German officials did not appear to be opposed to increasing the rescue fund's power to leverage its government guarantees. They wanted only to avoid any discussion until Parliament votes this week on a proposal to expand the size of the fund to 780 billion euros. That plan was agreed to by European leaders on July 21. Some analysts have said that the fund needs to be two to three times as big to convince markets that it could handle a wider crisis.
On Monday, a senior official in the Greek Finance Ministry, responding to persistent default rumors, said no such event was imminent. And on Sunday, Evangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, said in Washington that the government's plan to exchange some existing bonds for new, longer-term securities remained on track.
The debt exchange would impose a relatively modest 21 percent loss on the face value of the affected bonds. It is regarded as a good deal for investors because they would receive more solid paper in exchange. Greek creditors must still indicate their willingness to participate.
Policy makers want to put Greece on a path toward reducing its debt load to just below 100 percent of its gross domestic product within this decade so that it can wean itself off taxpayer bailouts. The hope is that much of that reduction would come through revived economic growth.
But those prospects seem distant given the deep recession into which Greece has fallen and stricter belt-tightening measures being demanded by international creditors.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany rejected the idea of a Greek default, telling a television interviewer late Sunday that such an event could deliver a shock to the financial system similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
''We can only take steps that we can really control,'' she said on ARD, a public broadcaster. If Greece touched off another financial crisis, she said, ''then we politicians will be held responsible.''
Under one option being discussed, the bailout fund would be able to absorb losses sustained by the European Central Bank on its purchases of Greek and other government bonds, according to an European Union official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the delicacy of the issue.
There is, one official said, no preferred model and it remained unclear whether such moves would be possible without further legal changes. Some officials say they think such steps could be constitutionally difficult, particularly in Germany.
''Further enhancement could require treaty reform,'' said the European Union official.
Resistance to new plans to strengthen the rescue fund might also be forthcoming from the central bank, which has been trying to reduce its bond-buying program.
Attention will focus this week on Greece and negotiations on the release of the next portion of international aid, worth 8 billion euros. Without the money, Greece would default next month.
A mission by officials of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund was expected to leave for Athens this week. Mr. Altafaj-Tardio said that a decision on the release of the next aid installment was not expected by the time euro zone finance ministers meet next Monday.
Opposition to more aid to Greece remains deep in Germany among the public, mainstream economists and the president of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann.
Speaking in Washington on Monday, Mr. Weidmann said that aid had already weakened incentives for countries to behave responsibly.
''Contrary to what is actually needed in order to overcome the sovereign debt crisis, we risk seeing the propensity for excessive deficits rise even further in the future,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Goldman Draws Up Deeper Cuts

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs, bracing for what could be one of its worst quarters since it went public 12 years ago, is preparing to expand its cost-cutting initiative by hundreds of millions of dollars, a move that could lead to additional job losses at the Wall Street bank.
This summer, Goldman said that it would wring out $1.2 billion in costs from its operations by mid-2012 and cut roughly 1,000 jobs, about 3 percent of its work force. But as the market turmoil has weighed on trading and other businesses in recent weeks, senior executives have been debating even deeper reductions, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
With the company's third quarter closing on Friday, Goldman has been revising its plans, potentially raising the cuts by as much as $250 million, to $1.45 billion. Based on its 2010 spending, such reductions would amount to 5 percent of the firm's expenses.
Along with the possibility of additional layoffs, the firm is expected to reduce employee pay, much of which is handed out later in the year. It is also sharpening its focus on noncompensation expenses, like real estate and travel, according to one of the executives with knowledge of the discussions.
The executive warned that no final decision had been made on size of the cuts, and that the numbers could change quickly if the market improved or weakened. The financial firm may address the matter when it releases its earnings on Oct. 18, he added.
Goldman's move underscores the broader problems on Wall Street. Financial firms have been under pressure for months, amid the European debt crisis and an economic slowdown in the United States, and a raft of regulatory changes is expected to crimp future profits. But the financial situation has deteriorated in recent weeks, as the market rout has ravaged revenue across Wall Street.
With the stock market slumping, analysts are quickly revising their estimates for third quarter earnings, which the banks are set to report in mid-October. Analysts are tempering their predictions for JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America and others. Goldman is now expected to earn $1.35 a share in the third quarter, less than half what the firm earned in the same period of 2010, according to consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. A month ago, analysts predicted the bank would make $2.65 a share.
The financial picture could be even more bleak, as analysts at both Barclays Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have predicted a loss for Goldman. The company has reported a quarterly loss only once since going public in 1999; it lost $2.12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, months after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.
''This is an extremely challenging environment, and I am sure every bank will be taking another hard look at expenses after the recent market downturn,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura, the Japanese bank.
In anticipation of a slowdown, banks began trimming their budgets earlier this year and took aim at the biggest expense: compensation. Bank of America, which continues to have losses from the mortgage crisis, has had some of the most severe cuts. It has announced that it would eliminate 30,000 jobs, nearly 10 percent of its total work force, over the next few years. Over all, the bank is looking to cut $5 billion in annual expenses.
JPMorgan Chase is in the midst of a five-year, $1.3 billion cost-cutting plan that will eliminate roughly 3,000 jobs. Morgan Stanley cut some low-producing brokers in its wealth management division, and Credit Suisse laid off administrative assistants in its investment banking unit last week as part of a larger reduction of 2,000 employees.
Wall Street executives are also preparing their staffs for smaller year-end bonuses, although the change is not yet reflected in the expenses. During the first six months of the year Citigroup, JPMorgan, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America set aside $65.69 billion to cover compensation and benefits, up 8 percent from a year ago, according to data provided by Nomura. But financial firms tend to wait until the fourth quarter to make the call on the annual payouts.
''The third quarter was rough and revenue is sure to be down, so compensation levels will follow,'' said Mr. Schorr.
As Wall Street looks to drive down costs in a bid to protect profits, no expense has been overlooked. Goldman Sachs recently downsized the drinking cups in its New York headquarters to 10 ounces from 12 ounces, saving thousands of dollars. It has also gone mostly cashless in the cafeteria and other areas, eliminating the need to pay armored truck companies to haul away the money.
Barclays, which has said it plans to cut 3,000 jobs this year, recently issued a memo reminding employees that work-issued cellphones are to be used ''for valid business purposes only.'' In addition to closing two-thirds of its 63 data centers, Bank of America did not host an annual field day for its municipal bond department, a country club affair in New Jersey that in past years included sport stations outfitted with beer kegs.
Even foliage is not safe from the chopping block. James P. Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, faced questions about plants at a town hall meeting this summer. An employee told Mr. Gorman that he had noticed decidedly less greenery around the office.
''Every dollar we don't spent is a dollar available for the bottom line,'' Mr. Gorman responded.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Contract Negotiations With Ford Intensify as the Union Prepares for a Strike

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Contract talks between the United Automobile Workers and the Ford Motor Company intensified Monday, but the union was preparing for a strike in case a deal could not be reached.
People briefed on the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private, said that the parties were only beginning to discuss some of the most important issues and that top-level Ford executives had not joined the talks, indicating that no deal was imminent.
The U.A.W. told officials at Ford plants across the country over the weekend to begin forming strike committees and to distribute information to workers about a possible strike. 
''At this time, there is no indication that a strike will be necessary, but it is in our best interest to prepare ourselves in the event we are forced to call for a strike,'' the latest memorandum to workers said. The memo is regarded as a formality but does allow the union leverage to walk out of talks.
After taking Sunday off, union negotiators began ''high-level financial discussions'' with Ford on Monday, according to a memo they posted online. A subsequent memo said the parties had agreed to meet for ''very long negotiating sessions'' this week and that bargaining would continue around the clock when a deal was near.
Ford is the only one of the three Detroit carmakers whose workers are allowed to strike in this year's talks. Binding arbitration is the only option at G.M. and Chrysler in the event of an impasse, under the terms of their government-sponsored bankruptcies in 2009.
Analysts say they expect Ford's contract to generally follow the pattern set by the tentative agreement with 48,500 workers at G.M., reached Sept. 16. Voting on the G.M. deal is set to finish Wednesday.
Workers at large plants in Flint, Mich.; Arlington, Tex.; Parma, Ohio; and Spring Hill, Tenn., have voted for the deal, which would create or retain 6,400 jobs and move some work to the United States from Mexico. The Spring Hill plant, which was mostly idled in 2009, would reopen if the contract were ratified.
''For the most part, they feel like it was a good agreement,'' said Michael Cartwright, the president of Local 276, which represents 2,400 workers building sport utility vehicles in Arlington. ''They understand the state of the business -- that things are better but not we're totally out of the woods because of the economy.''
Workers would be guaranteed bonuses of at least $8,000 over the four years of the contract, plus larger profit-sharing checks. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, estimated in a report Monday that workers would collect a total of $40,500 in bonuses throughout the contract, based on his forecasts for G.M. profits.
The deal is receiving widespread approval from entry-level workers, who earn about half as much as longtime workers and would get raises of several dollars an hour if the contract passes. At a parts processing plant near Flint where all 450 hourly workers earn entry-level wages, 88 percent voted in favor, according to a posting by Local 651 officials on Facebook.
But the deal was rejected over the weekend at a plant near Lansing, Mich., where about 3,400 workers build crossover vehicles and few receive entry-level wages. Local 602 said on its Web site that only 34 percent of production workers and 43 percent of skilled trades workers voted yes.
Ratification of the deal would resolve some of the uncertainty that has helped drive down the value of G.M. stock. Shares fell below $20 for the first time on Friday and closed Monday at $21.08, well below the $33 public-offering price last November. By buying out highly paid skilled trades workers and replacing them with entry-level employees, G.M. can make up for the larger bonuses, Mr. Jonas, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said.
''The contract not only offers greater flexibility, it offers the potential of greater profitability for G.M.,'' he wrote.
Although the union is primarily focused on reaching a deal with Ford, negotiators have continued to meet with Chrysler. Bob King, the U.A.W. president, met with Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, on Friday, they said in a jointly released statement. The union and Chrysler agreed to extend their contract, which was set to expire Sept. 14, through Oct. 19.

HEADLINE: Upping the Ante in Europe

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, England -- While Manchester United is sometimes considered the New York Yankees of international soccer, with a championship pedigree and a global following, Manchester City is a kindred spirit of the Mets, long overshadowed by a crosstown rival.
Now, though, Manchester City's players take the field in pale blue jerseys that suggest possibility as expansive as the sky itself. Or the fossil fuels beneath it. In 2008, the club was bought for $330 million by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the royal family of the emirate of Abu Dhabi who has fueled his team with an oil and talent pipeline.
Sheik Mansour has spent hundreds of millions of dollars for the rights to a raft of top international players and sunk hundreds of millions more into paying their salaries. Ambition has gushed from that $1.5 billion layout, as evidenced by the team's first appearance in the European Champions League, the world's most prestigious club tournament. Manchester City faces Bayern Munich on Tuesday, its second match in the tournament, in which it seeks to challenge other giants like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United for supremacy of all of Europe. 
But Manchester City's rise comes as the governing body of European soccer, known as UEFA, has grown concerned about perceived attempts by deep-pocketed owners to buy trophies and alarmed about inflationary spending on salaries and transfer fees, paid when a player is sold from one team to another. Binges by Sheik Mansour and other rapacious clubs have become known as financial doping, jolting the sport on and off the field as a continental economic crisis hampers many teams.
More than half of Europe's 650 top soccer clubs are reporting operating losses, UEFA said, with more than a quarter of teams spending $16.50 for every $13.50 in income.
Cumulative losses in European soccer surpassed $1.5 billion in 2009 alone, according to news reports. The Spanish league opened a week late in August after its players went on strike, seeking to recover more than $70 million in unpaid wages. Manchester City reported losses totaling $190 million for the 2009-10 season.
As the European soccer season began recently, a new initiative called Financial Fair Play went into effect. The rules, with a two-year phase-in, are meant to rein in runaway deficit spending and foster long-term stability. Essentially, teams will be allowed to spend only the equivalent of what they generate from so-called soccer-related income: broadcast rights, ticket sales, merchandising, competition prize money and corporate sponsorships.
One goal of the fair-play initiative is to discourage the wealthiest team owners from pumping their own money into clubs to cover losses. The ultimate sanction for failure to comply could be ineligibility to play in Europe's top competitions, the Champions League and the Europa League.
For the fair-play rules to be effective, they must be enforced fairly, firmly and transparently, said Ivan Gazidis, chief executive of Arsenal, the powerful London club known for its prudent spending.
''Many first-class and reputable potential owners currently avoid football as an investment because of the instability they see,'' Gazidis said in an e-mail message.
Sheik Mansour, variously listed as age 40 or 41, clearly did not have any such trepidation. In 2009, Forbes listed him as its newest Gulf billionaire with a personal net worth of $4.9 billion and a collective family fortune estimated at $150 billion.
Abu Dhabi, part of the United Arab Emirates, sits on 9 percent of the world's oil reserves, and Sheik Mansour is chairman of its International Petroleum Investment Company, part of what Forbes estimated to be a $650 billion sovereign wealth fund.
Sheik Mansour's riches have certainly made European soccer officials suspicious.
Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, complained that Manchester City appeared to be trying to circumvent the financial fair-play rules with a 10-year sponsorship deal with Etihad Airways reportedly worth up to $633 million.
The airline is closely associated with the Abu Dhabi government, ruled by Sheik Mansour's half brother, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan. The arrangement involves stadium naming rights, sponsorship of the team's jerseys and development of the area around Etihad Stadium.
Wenger accused the deal of being far above market value and said: ''It raises the real question about the credibility of the financial fair play. They give us the message that they can get around it by doing what they want.''
Manchester City called Wenger's remarks ''unfounded and regrettable.'' It said that figures regarding the sponsorship deal were inaccurately reported and that the club was adhering to fair-play rules. UEFA has said it is investigating the arrangement.
Some supporters of Manchester City argue that soccer elites of Europe are deliberately trying to restrain the club because it threatens to upset the established order. Any attempt to nullify the sponsorship deal may fail in court, said Stefan Szymanski, a British economist and co-author of the book ''Soccernomics.''
''How do you determine what is the fair value of a corporate sponsorship? In essence, it's arbitrary,'' said Szymanski, who teaches at the University of Michigan. ''It comes down to what people are willing to pay.''
The financial fair-play rules may also face a legal challenge for arbitrarily restricting what is considered allowable income on team balance sheets, Szymanski said. ''If a wealthy owner wants to put his own money into his own business, how is that not money devoted to football?'' he said. ''When I go to a game, I take my money and buy a ticket and it becomes football income. When it transfers from the bank account of an Arab sheik, why isn't that the same thing?''
After a 1-1 tie with Napoli in its first Champions League match, on Sept. 14, Aurelio De Laurentiis, Napoli's president, called Manchester City ''money wasters.'' But City's long suffering fans hardly see it that way. In 1998, the Blues sank to the third tier of English soccer. Until Manchester City won the Football Association Cup last spring, in a tournament open to teams on various levels of English soccer, it had not won a trophy worth mentioning since 1976.
Now Manchester City is determined to challenge the European giants of soccer, and especially Manchester United.
''It's not easy being the second team in any town,'' Mike Summerbee, a Manchester City star of the 1960s and 1970s, said of Manchester United, which archly noted at its own stadium how many years City had gone without winning a significant competition (35 years until last spring). ''Now we think we are very much level.''
During the recently ended summer transfer period, Manchester City spent $120 million to acquire such stars as forward Sergio Aguero of Argentina and midfielder Samir Nasri of France. Though it has reported losses of nearly $200 million, Manchester City is one of the world's richest clubs. And as it spends more money and attracts better players, it stands to make tens of millions of dollars more competing in the Champions League.
And for a while anyway, it gets to bask in the role of underdog when compared with United, its more accomplished cross-town rival.
''Any neutral observer would choose City over United,'' said Mohammed Osman, a law student here and a Liverpool fan. ''Success breeds contempt. I guess City hopes to be in that spot one day, where people are jealous of them, too.''

HEADLINE: Reading, Pa., Knew It Was Poor. Now It Knows Just How Poor.

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
READING, Pa. -- The exhausted mothers who come to the Second Street Learning Center here -- a day care provider for mostly low-income families -- speak of low wages, hard jobs and an economy gone bad.
Ashley Kelleher supports her family on the $900 a month she earns as a waitress at an International House of Pancakes. Louri Williams packs cakes and pies all night for $8 an hour, takes morning classes, and picks up her children in the afternoon. Teresa Santiago takes complaints from building supply customers for $10 an hour, not enough to cover her $1,900 in monthly bills.
These are common stories in Reading, a struggling city of 88,000 that has earned the unwelcome distinction of having the largest share of its residents living in poverty, barely edging out Flint, Mich., according to new Census Bureau data. The count includes only cities with populations of 65,000 or more, and has a margin of error that makes it difficult to declare a winner -- or, perhaps more to the point, a loser.
Reading began the last decade at No. 32. But it broke into the top 10 in 2007, joining other places known for their high rates of poverty like Flint, Camden, N.J., and Brownsville, Tex., according to an analysis of the data for The New York Times by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College. 
Now it is No. 1, a ranking that the mothers at the day care center here say does not surprise them, given their first-hand knowledge of poverty-line wages, which for a parent and two children is now $18,530.
The city had been limping for most of the past decade, since the plants that sustained it -- including Lucent Technologies and the Dana Corporation, a car parts manufacturer -- withered. But the past few years delivered more closings and layoffs, sending the city's poverty rate up to 41.3 percent.
Jon Scott, president of the Berks Economic Partnership, which helps businesses looking to stay in the area or move here, said that some of the city's job losses were in fact furloughs, and that many businesses were considering opening in Reading, including an industrial laundry company at the former Dana site.
According to Mr. Beveridge, employment in the city dropped by about 10 percent between 2000 and 2010.
One of Reading's more entrenched problems is education. Just 8 percent of its residents have a bachelor's degree, far below the national average of 28 percent.
''Without a bachelor's degree, forget it,'' said Ms. Williams, 28, who is taking classes to earn her G.E.D.. Only about 63 percent of Reading's residents have a high school diploma, compared with more than 85 percent nationally.
Lower education generally means higher poverty. About a fifth of people ages 25 to 34 with only a high school diploma in the United States were poor last year, compared with just 5 percent of college graduates, said Yiyoon Chung, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. For those without a high school diploma, the rate was 40 percent.
Ms. Santiago, 36, has an associate's degree from a local community college, but said that employers wanted to see more from job candidates. She lost her last full-time job in 2007, and has worked in low wage jobs without benefits through a temporary agency ever since.
''They even want a degree to be a secretary,'' said Ms. Santiago, picking up her 8-year-old son at the center.
This city has had a large influx of Hispanics over the past decade. They moved from New York and other large cities, drawn by cheaper rent and the promise of a better life. That raised the flagging population, but also reinforced the city's already acute problems with education: Just 18 percent of Hispanics in Reading had some college education last year, compared with 30 percent of the city's whites. Only 44 percent of Hispanics had a high school diploma.
Young men have been particularly hard hit. Because they are having trouble competing for jobs, they are dropping out of the labor force, leaving women to support the children.
Ms. Kelleher, 23, said she had been supporting her three children as well as the father of two of them. She would not be able to survive, she said, without the $636 a month she gets in food stamps.
''For the past five years, it has been me paying the bills,'' she said at the day care center, still in her waitress uniform. She wants to get married someday, she said, but only to a partner who is financially stable.
Sixty-two percent of young fathers in the United States earned less than $20,000 in 2002, according to Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, citing the most recent data available from the National Survey of Family Growth.
Even for young people with a bachelor's degree, the economy is making life difficult. Vickie Moll, who runs the day care center, said the number of applications from teachers who have lost their jobs had grown as the waves of budget cuts washed over the state. ''We have people in here with bachelor's degrees making $8 an hour,'' she said.
Social services feel the effects, too. The Greater Berks Food Bank -- Reading is the Berks County seat -- is on track to distribute six million pounds of food this year, up from three and a half million pounds in 2007, said Doug Long, manager of marketing.
Pat Giles, a senior vice president at the United Way of Berks County, said: ''It has really started to snowball. We have a growing population of younger, less educated, less skilled people. On top of that you have the economy going upside down.''
Modesto Fiume, president of Opportunity House, the organization that runs the day care center, as well as a homeless shelter and a transitional living facility, said the number of first-time families in the shelter was up sharply: of 23 new entries in June and July, 18 were homeless for the first time.
''People are here because they honestly and truly can't find work,'' said Delia McLendon, who runs the shelters. ''It didn't used to be that way.''
In the mid-1990s, welfare reform resulted in more women joining the work force. At the time, jobs were plentiful, but now work is scarce and low-income families' lives have become hectic balancing acts to keep the few benefits they have.
Ms. Santiago loses her subsidized day care if she is out of work for more than 13 days, she said. The loss would take months to reinstate, so she hurries to find any work, whatever it pays, every time her temp job ends. Earning more than $10 an hour means losing health insurance, she said, though her children remain covered through Medicaid.
And jobs just seem to pay less. Ms. Santiago recently took a temporary job at a candy factory where she had worked more than eight years ago, when she was still in her 20s, before she had completed her associate's degree. At the time she was making $10.50 an hour. In her most recent stint, her hourly wage was $9.25.
''Eight years ago I said, 'I don't want to do this, I have to further my education,' '' she said. ''And now here I am, still packing candy, and making less.''

HEADLINE: More Gloom Lies Ahead For Cities, Report Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Nearly a third of the nation's cities are laying off workers this year. More than half have canceled or delayed infrastructure projects. And two out of five have raised their fees.
The catalog of service cuts and fee increases comes as America's cities are bracing for what they expect will be their fifth straight year of declining revenues, according to a survey of city finance officers to be released on Tuesday by the National League of Cities.
One of the main culprits is the property tax, which many cities and local governments rely on heavily. Property tax collections, which are usually quite resilient, are projected to fall by 3.7 percent this year -- their second year in a row of declines -- as tax assessments belatedly catch up with the lower property values left behind by the battered real estate market. Sales tax collections are projected to be slightly higher this year, but income tax collections are projected to be slightly lower, as unemployment and lower wages take their toll in many places. 
''For cities, the collective impact of property values continuing at levels far below their 2007 peaks, consumer spending slowing, consumer confidence eroding and markets possibly entering a double-dip recession is the worst since the Great Depression,'' according to the survey, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The report raises the possibility that ''lower property values and declining sales may portend something entirely new, a 'new normal.' ''
In what passes for a bright spot in an overwhelmingly gloomy report, the number of city finance officers who said their cities would be less able to meet their fiscal needs has dropped. This year 57 percent of the 272 finance officers surveyed said their cities would be less able to meet their needs than they were last year. In 2010, 87 percent said so. But the number was still high this year when it came to cities that rely heavily on property taxes: nearly three quarters said they were less able to meet their needs.
One of the report's authors, Christopher W. Hoene, said many cities were still unsure if the worst was over. ''The question is, are we going into the low point or are we emerging out of it?'' said Mr. Hoene, director of the Center for Research and Innovation at the league of cities. ''Right now, in the early fall of 2011, the answer to that question is unclear.''
Cities have been unable to look for help in some of the traditional places. Half of the cities reported that their state aid has been cut since 2009, as states struggled to balance their own budgets.
So many cities have resorted to service cuts. Two in five report cutting things like libraries and parks and recreation programs. Nearly a fifth are making cuts to public safety. Nearly three-quarters are cutting their personnel costs through hiring freezes, wage freezes or reductions, layoffs or reduced health benefits for their workers.
In recent days mayors from both parties have gone to Washington to speak in support of President Obama's proposal to increase infrastructure spending and give more aid to states and cities, but the proposal is still deeply unpopular with Republicans in Congress.
With cities and states required to balance their budgets, city officials see the federal government as the one entity that can spend more money now to get them through the lingering downturn. The survey finds that the outlook for cities next year was not much brighter. ''The effects of depressed real estate markets, low levels of consumer confidence and high levels of unemployment,'' the report said, ''will continue to play out in cities through 2011, 2012 and beyond.''

HEADLINE: After Feisty Fund-Raising, a More Sociable Obama

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- President Obama met his dream date on Monday at a town hall meeting in Silicon Valley: a balding, soft-spoken former Google employee who said he was so rich he did not have to work anymore and begged Mr. Obama to raise his taxes.
''I'm unemployed by choice,'' said the man, Doug Edwards, who confirmed later that he was the 59th person hired by Google and had written a book titled ''I'm Feeling Lucky.'' ''My question,'' he said, addressing the president, ''is would you please raise my taxes?'' 
Mr. Obama, who has spent much of this campaign-style trip to the West Coast inveighing against Republicans and the unfairness of the tax code, suggested he would gladly oblige.
''Right now, we've got the lowest tax rates we've had since the 1950s, and some of the Republican proposals would take it back, as a percentage of G.D.P., to where we were in the 1920s,'' Mr. Obama said at the meeting, held by the social media site LinkedIn.
That swipe at the opposition was mild compared with the acidic words the president used in a series of fund-raisers on Sunday, when he ridiculed Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for questioning the science of climate change and scolded audiences at recent Republican presidential debates for being hardhearted.
''Some of you here may actually be folks who used to be Republicans but are puzzled by what's happened to that party,'' Mr. Obama said to an affluent group at the home of a technology executive, John W. Thompson. ''I mean, has anyone been watching the debates lately?''
The president typically strikes different tones at public gatherings and at political fund-raisers. But rarely has the disparity been so stark, in part because Mr. Obama is trying to accomplish two very different things at once: stock his campaign war chest in some of the nation's wealthiest enclaves, and promote his $450 billion jobs plan.
The choice of LinkedIn, a popular service for job seekers, was clearly meant to sprinkle some digital stardust on Mr. Obama's campaign for the jobs bill. But while he got a cordial reception from the crowd of about 300, Silicon Valley was hedging its political bets.
In what might be called antisocial networking, Facebook held a town hall meeting in Palo Alto hours after Mr. Obama's appearance, with three House Republican leaders and bitter antagonists of the president: Eric Cantor of Virginia, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, author of the Republican budget plan.
Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, who introduced Mr. Obama warmly at her home on Sunday, moderated the meeting with these self-described ''Young Guns,'' who were eager to discuss technology, innovation and growth.
Mr. Obama, whose 2008 campaign used the Internet aggressively as a fund-raising tool, has already done town hall meetings at Facebook and with Twitter. These settings tend to bring out the professorial side of Mr. Obama, and Monday's gathering was no exception.
Answering questions that LinkedIn had selected from thousands of submissions, Mr. Obama reprised many of his themes about the need for better education and innovation. He offered a tutorial about the financial problems facing Social Security and Medicare.
The plea for a tax increase from Mr. Edwards allowed the president to roll out an argument he has been making almost daily since he presented the American Jobs Act early this month and adopted the much more politically combative stance that he has taken on the road.
''The income of folks at the top has gone up exponentially over the last couple of decades,'' he said, ''whereas the incomes and wages of the middle class have flat-lined over the last 15 years.''
Mr. Obama had planned a West Coast swing during the summer, campaign officials said, but it was scrapped because of the talks to raise the federal debt ceiling. Several other fund-raising trips were also canceled in the 60 days that the president was hunkered down in Washington.
That has left the campaign behind where it wanted to be in fund-raising. The campaign manager, Jim Messina, told Democratic Party officials recently that the campaign expected to raise $55 million in the third quarter, compared with $86 million in the previous quarter.
On Monday, Mr. Obama seemed eager to make up for lost time. He squeezed in three campaign events around the state, requiring him to fly from San Jose to San Diego and back to Los Angeles, where he was heckled by a protester at a boisterous fund-raiser at the House of Blues club.
In his message, too, the president was clearly pivoting to campaign mode as he sought to stoke enthusiasm for his re-election. Until Sunday, he had resisted aiming barbs at individual Republican presidential candidates. But he mocked Governor Perry for doubting climate change even as wildfires scorched Texas.
And he singled out Republican debate audiences for booing a gay soldier who had served in Iraq and for cheering the suggestion that a gravely ill man without health insurance be allowed to die.
''That's not reflective of who we are,'' Mr. Obama declared. ''At some level, we've always believed, you know what, that we're not defined by our differences. We're bound together.''

HEADLINE: Syria: Soldiers Killed While Trying to Defect

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syrian security forces killed four soldiers on Monday as they attempted to escape a military camp, and the army tightened its grip on towns across the country to quell dissent against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, activists said. 
Activists and residents said that the army sent reinforcements to the central city of Homs and to several villages on its outskirts on Monday. The deployment came after reports that soldiers who had deserted had set ambushes for the military and were attacking checkpoints run by security forces and armed men in plainclothes loyal to the Assad government.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a human rights group in London, said the four soldiers were killed in the northern province of Idlib, near the Turkish border, and that seven others were arrested as they also tried to leave the military camp. Idlib has been a center of the protests. Activists also reported the defections of dozens of soldiers in Hama, in central Syria, and in Latakia, on the Mediterranean coast.
There were conflicting reports about the number of civilians who were killed, and activists said that security forces attacked several neighborhoods in Homs, including Baba Amr, which has been under siege for more than a week and is suffering from shortages of food, water and medical equipment.
The uprising started in mid-March as a peaceful movement inspired by the street demonstrations in Egypt and Tunisia that toppled the governments there. But as the death toll from the brutal military crackdown has increased, many have warned that the movement may turn into an armed struggle.
''Protests alone are not enough,'' said a Homs resident in his 60s who asked not to be quoted by name because of fears for his safety. ''We must do something more than that, and that is the best way forward.''
The state news agency said that officials in Homs had found weapons, explosives, ammunition and stolen military uniforms in a car. Some of the weapons were Israeli, it said, without providing details. Syria remains formally at war with Israel.
The agency also reported that authorities confiscated weapons, explosives and ammunition, including 10,000 bullets, in Nasib, a village near the Jordanian border where activists said they had seen large demonstrations in the past week. Activists said at least a dozen people were arrested there on Monday.
The government blames the unrest on a foreign conspiracy to divide the country and says it is battling armed groups who have killed at least 700 police officers and soldiers in the past six months.
The United States and its allies in Europe have repeatedly called on Mr. Assad to step down and have imposed strict economic sanctions on his government.
Syria's foreign minister, Walid Mouallem, who was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, accused foreign governments of trying to create tension in his country.
''How can we otherwise explain media provocations, financing and arming religious extremism?'' Mr. Mouallem said. ''What purpose could this serve other than total chaos that would dismember Syria, and consequently adversely affect its neighbors.''

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Decline To a 6-Month Low Rate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales and prices of new single-family homes fell in August despite historically low mortgage rates, underscoring the difficulties policy makers face in trying to help the housing sector. 
A stagnant job market and a big overhang of unsold existing homes have combined to keep new-home sales low even as mortgage rates returned to lows not seen since at least the early 1970s.
New-home sales slipped 2.3 percent last month to a 295,000 annual rate, a six-month low, the Commerce Department said on Monday. That was in line with analysts' forecasts and did little to allay fears that the United States could slip back into recession.
The median sales price also moved lower from the previous month and was 7.7 percent below year-ago levels.
''There's no sign yet that low mortgage rates are helping the housing sector,'' said Gary Thayer, a strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.
The Federal Reserve last week announced new measures to ease credit further for home buyers, but analysts cautioned that the level of mortgage rates was not the main hurdle to buying.
Heavy debts taken on during the housing boom in the previous decade are also making consumers cautious to spend.
In its monthly report on single-family home sales, the government raised its estimate for July's sales pace slightly to 302,000 units. Also, the supply of homes available on the market in August dropped to a record low.
Data last week showed new construction of homes fell in August, dragging on economic growth.
''The housing sector can't get any worse,'' said Michael Englund, an economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo.

HEADLINE: Road to G.O.P. Nomination Has a Trump Tower Exit

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
3:05 p.m. Updated Mitt Romney followed the well-trod path of other Republican presidential hopefuls on Monday with a trip to New York to kiss the ring of the real estate mogul and television personality Donald Trump. 
The meeting between the two men, set up at Mr. Romney's request, took place at 2 p.m. Monday at Trump Towers on Fifth Avenue, and was the first time the two men chatted face-to-face since Mr. Romney declared his candidacy several months ago.
Mr. Romney managed to evade the press and neither man came out after the meeting to comment on what was discussed. But that obscured the fact that Mr. Trump, who flirted with a presidential run earlier this year and still likes to hint that he's keeping his options open, hasn't already had some things to say about Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
In an interview in April with Meghan McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain of Arizona, for The Daily Beast, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Romney was ''going to lose.''
''He doesn't resonate, you know, or he would have won last time, in all fairness to your father!'' he told Ms. McCain. Mr. Trump said he watched Mr. Romney give a speech, ''and it was all these little trivial statements.''
The same month, he also bragged that he was a ''much bigger businessman'' than Mr. Romney.
''I mean, my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney,'' Mr. Trump told CNN's Candy Crowley.
Mr. Romney has centered his campaign on jobs and the economy, promoting his years in the private sector, but Mr. Trump has also questioned whether Mr. Romney's time at Bain Capital actually helped create jobs.
''Well, Mitt Romney is a basically small-business guy, if you really think about it,'' Mr. Trump said in April. ''He was a hedge fund. He was a funds guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.''
Despite Mr. Trump's less-than-laudatory comments, the Democratic National Committee released a Web video on Monday morning linking Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump.
''Both support an economic plan that would help out the richest and the big corporations, but not the middle class,'' says the narrator, who also says the two men would ''slash Social Security'' and ''end Medicare as we know it.''
The video ends with a montage of Mr. Trump offering up his trademark ''You're fired'' to the pair.
Mr. Trump has become a must-stop for Republican candidates seeking their party's 2012 nomination. Mr. Trump had dinner at the upscale Jean Georges restaurant in New York last week with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, and he has a second meeting scheduled next week with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.
He also met with Sarah Palin in May. The two went to the chain Famous Famiglia in Time Square, where they were roundly mocked for eating their pizza with knives and forks.

HEADLINE: A Governing Coalition, Increasingly, of the Unwilling

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- With the leaders of both parties in the governing coalition pledged to uphold their pact until a new election in 2015, Britain, at least on the face of it, has the basis for political stability as it wrestles with the financial crisis roiling Europe and the apparent drift of Britain's own economy toward stagnation.
But as it approaches the 18th-month mark, Britain's first peacetime coalition government in nearly 70 years has come to resemble a leaky boat in heaving seas. A groundswell of unease in both parties, the Conservatives under Prime Minister David Cameron and the Liberal Democrats under the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has heightened the underlying political tensions and raised new doubts about how long the pact will last.
If most political analysts believe that the coalition will endure, their judgment rests less on inherent strength in the partnership than in the reluctance of all three major parties, including Labour, which governed for 13 years until the May 2010 election, to agree to an early election. Voters, too, seem opposed to an early election, especially at a time of deepening economic uncertainty. 
Each fall, their annual conferences provide a showcase for the parties. This week, with Labour meeting in Liverpool, marks the midpoint; the Liberal Democrats met last week in Birmingham and the Conservatives gather next week in Manchester. Exhaustive television coverage attracts mainly political wonks, but the conferences can present hazards for the party leaders, especially when powerful blocs are close to open revolt, or at least in vigorous dissent.
That is the case for all three parties this year, with the touchstones being the economy and the government's harsh program of public spending cuts, averaging close to 20 percent across the board over the government's projected four-year span. Although the cuts were announced last fall, they began to bite more deeply this summer.
In the past week, the economic news has gotten worse, emboldening the left wings of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to argue that the government's bid to cut record levels of government borrowing -- said by Mr. Cameron to be worse, proportionally, than in Greece, Italy and Spain -- has been a case of ''too far, too fast.'' Many of these critics say the government should ease the cuts and follow the Obama administration, which advocates a combination of cuts and new stimulus spending to try to reduce unemployment.
The latest figures -- more than 2.5 million people in a British work force of 30 million out of work; inflation rising to 4.5 percent, the highest in years; and limp quarterly growth, at little more than 1 percent annually -- have led some experts to predict an extended period of stagflation. With the economy weakening, monthly government borrowing, which had been falling, rose sharply again in August. This suggests that the austerity plan is, at least for now, failing either to stimulate the economy or cut the deficit, as the government had promised.
But Mr. Cameron, in New York last week for the United Nations General Assembly, said the government would hold course. ''You have got to deal with the debts,'' he told ABC News. It was, he said, ''vitally important to prove to the world that we can pay our way.'' That has been the message, too, from Mr. Clegg, who told the Liberal Democrats' conference that the historic burden of debt bequeathed by the Labour government had left Britain ''teetering on the edge of an economic precipice.''
''Burying your head in the sand, that's not liberal,'' he said. ''Saddling our children with the nation's debt, that's not fair.''
Mr. Clegg emerged from the conference with what amounted to a reluctant assent from many of the delegates to remain in the coalition. But the coalition endured a barrage of hostility.
The party's president, Tim Farron, made a speech in which he described ''divorce'' from the Conservatives after four years as inevitable. Taunting the Conservatives with words like ''wickedness,'' ''reactionary Tory drivel'' and ''witless knee-jerk populism,'' he added: ''Being in coalition with the Tories has tainted us. Our identity is blurred. Many who support us are confused.''
The barrage extended to Liberal Democrat ministers. Chris Huhne, the energy minister, compared Conservative backbenchers restless with the concessions Mr. Cameron has made to the Liberal Democrats to hold the coalition together to conservative Republicans in the United States. ''We need no Tea Party tendency in Britain,'' he said.
Recent opinion polls have shown that the Liberal Democrats have plunged in public support to as little as 11 percent, and that an early election could lead to the loss of many of the 59 seats they currently hold in the 650-seat House of Commons. Across a wide range of polls, the Conservatives have trailed Labour, though the Conservatives have narrowly outpolled Labour in polls taken among respondents who say they plan to vote.
Many commentators in Britain say that the signs point to a new era of coalition politics, and that the disillusionment for the coalition among Liberal Democrats makes an alliance with Labour beyond the next election more likely than a renewed deal with the Conservatives. That prospect appeared to be one of the few items that stirred much enthusiasm among delegates at the Birmingham conference, where Mr. Clegg, noting the ''docility'' in the conference hall, compared the gathering at one point to a party conference in North Korea.
But Labour, too, has problems. Unreconciled differences flourish between the centrist wing of the party that dominated for 10 years under Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the party's left-wing, labor union base, which has been newly assertive since the election defeat last year. Senior Labour figures, including the new leader, Ed Miliband, have said that to regain power the party must first regain the trust among voters by owning up to the mistakes it made in economic management including allowing the annual deficit to balloon.
But left-wing stalwarts, including the party's chief economic spokesman, Ed Balls, have been slow to acknowledge past errors. Though Mr. Balls did say on Monday that he regretted some of the Labour government's decisions, like instituting a tax on low earners and a slight rise in state pensions, much of the focus in Liverpool is expected to be on a new emphasis on candor about past mistakes, along with a renewed effort to boost Mr. Miliband's lagging popularity, which has trailed far behind Mr. Cameron's in many polls.
Even Mr. Balls has joined in. ''We've got to rebuild our credibility,'' he told The Sunday Telegraph in an interview. ''And that's hard.''

HEADLINE: For Democratic Congressman, Wall Street Ties Bring Peril

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Jim Himes, a second-term congressman from Connecticut, is a surviving member of one of Washington's most endangered species: a Democrat with Wall Street ties.
A former Goldman Sachs banker whose district includes the hedge fund capitals of Greenwich and Stamford, Conn., Mr. Himes understands the world of high finance better than most of his Congressional peers. And lately, as a series of contentious regulatory and tax proposals has brought the moneyed class under fire, he has been playing the part of a Wall Street whisperer, trying to bring well-heeled Democrats in the financial industry back to the party that has made villains of them.
''I do hear anger,'' Mr. Himes said in a recent interview. ''Many of them know me from my previous life, and they do call me and say, 'What the hell is going on?' ''
Mr. Himes, 45, once benefited from his Wall Street past. His 12-year career at Goldman played well with voters near his Greenwich home during his first campaign in 2008, and he brought in more than $500,000 in donations from the securities and investments industry, nearly $150,000 of which came from individuals at Goldman. 
Shortly after he beat out the incumbent, Christopher Shays, to win the seat, his expertise landed him a plum assignment on the House Financial Services Committee, where he helped write the House version of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul. Christopher S. Murphy, a fellow Connecticut Democrat, recalled seeing Mr. Himes giving impromptu economics lessons on the House floor during debates over the contentious bill.
''There was always a crowd around Jim,'' Mr. Murphy recalled. ''He very quickly became a safe harbor for moderate members who wanted to make sure we corrected the abuses of Wall Street without killing the markets.''
But this year, Mr. Himes's financial background went from asset to liability. During the debt ceiling debate this summer, President Obama took aim at bankers and hedge fund managers, characterizing their tax rates as unfairly low and calling for an end to corporate tax loopholes. Mr. Obama repeated those calls in the budget debate this month, and recently proposed a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million a year, a provision he called the Buffett Rule, after the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett.
For Mr. Himes, whose district has one of the highest concentrations of millionaires in the country, each new instance of fiery rhetoric meant more phone calls and e-mails from financiers angry about their status as left-wing punching bags.
''I like Jim, but I feel sorry for the guy,'' said one hedge fund manager in Mr. Himes's district, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid damaging his relationship with the congressman. ''Every time Obama says 'fat cat banker' and 'greedy hedge fund manager,' I'm sure he cringes.''
With a neat side part, a sharp jaw and the trim physique of a former Harvard lightweight crew captain, Mr. Himes, a Rhodes Scholar who once modeled for Ralph Lauren, still looks every bit the financial executive. In 2002, he left Goldman to take a job at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing nonprofit, where he stayed until running for office in 2008.
Asked about his time at Goldman, Mr. Himes said he thought the company's culture had changed between 1990, when he joined it as a junior banker in its Latin American division, and when he left it nearly a decade ago.
''When I joined it was a firm of 4,000 people, and when I left it was a firm of 22,000,'' he said. ''When it was a firm of 4,000, all the partners knew each other, and if somebody screwed up, it meant you were going to hurt your friends. Now that it's a corporation, you've lost that sense of family.''
Mr. Himes, who was born in Peru during one of his father's stints abroad as an executive with the Ford Foundation, is not eager to become known as the big-bank congressman, despite his fond memories of working at Goldman. He has fanned out his political interests in recent years, working on legislation on energy-efficient housing and early childhood education. And last week, he held a rally in Norwalk to celebrate the repeal of the military's ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy for openly gay service members.
As Mr. Himes prepares to run for a third term, his focus on issues beyond Wall Street may be a nod to the current mood toward the financial services sector.
''I don't know that any politician, let alone a Democratic politician, is going to score points with his constituents by talking about his connections to the hedge fund industry,'' said Bruce McGuire, the president of the Connecticut Hedge Fund Association.
But Mr. Himes also said that the emotions stirred up by the financial crisis had made reforming Wall Street using his preferred method - logical, Spock-like analysis - nearly impossible.
''You don't always feel it in Greenwich or the Upper East Side, but there's a huge emotional dislocation out there,'' he said. ''Americans think this is an unproductive sector, and it's a little hard to talk about capital formation in the context of the emotion.''
Mr. Himes, who wears a blue woven bead bracelet given to him by a Zen master, has been trying to calm the furor surrounding Wall Street by staking out middle ground in many of the financial issues facing legislators. He favors regulating some kinds of derivatives, the exotic instruments that Mr. Buffett once called ''financial weapons of mass destruction,'' while leaving others intact, like crop futures used by farmers to hedge against price swings.
He also has a tempered view on the issue of carried interest, the type of income earned by some hedge fund and private equity managers that is taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Mr. Himes favors a blended rate that would tax carried interest above the lower capital gains rate but below the rate paid on ordinary income, to accommodate the different kinds of risk taken on by investors.
''The good news is, I can talk about alternate swap-execution facilities,'' Mr. Himes said of his approach to legislating. ''The bad news is, my whole being is about having a fairly cool conversation about what's happening. I don't throw bombs. Michele Bachmann is a lot more fun than I am.''
But if Mr. Himes's conciliatory streak has hurt his image, it has also made him an asset to moderate Democrats who are looking to reform the markets without resorting to vitriol. And as 2012 approaches, his ability to speak the language of the ultra-rich may come in handy for Democratic politicians - the president included - who have seen their Wall Street campaign donations dry up.
''Look, there are some Wall Street guys who are never coming back to the Democratic Party,'' said Mr. Murphy, Mr. Himes's colleague in Congress. ''But Jim is a committed Democrat who can also show the financial world that not all of us have two horns.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks to Prohibit 'No Jobless Need Apply'

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama has not been particularly successful in fostering the creation of jobs. But he thinks he has found a way to pry open doors in the workplace for many of the unemployed, especially those who have been out of work for a long time.
Mr. Obama's jobs bill would prohibit employers from discriminating against job applicants because they are unemployed. 
Under the proposal, it would be ''an unlawful employment practice'' if a business with 15 or more employees refused to hire a person ''because of the individual's status as unemployed.''
Unsuccessful job applicants could sue and recover damages for violations, just as when an employer discriminates on the basis of a person's race, color, religion, sex or national origin.
White House officials see discrimination against the unemployed as a serious problem. In a radio interview last month, Mr. Obama said such discrimination made ''absolutely no sense,'' especially at a time when many people, through no fault of their own, had been laid off.
Mr. Obama's proposal would also prohibit employment agencies and Web sites from carrying advertisements for job openings that exclude people who are unemployed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has received reports of such advertisements but has no data to show how common they are.
Republicans and some employers criticized the White House proposal. They said that discrimination was not common and that the proposed remedy could expose employers to a barrage of lawsuits.
''We do not see a need for it,'' said Michael J. Eastman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Already, Mr. Eastman said, the Civil Rights Act outlaws employment practices that have ''a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin,'' unless an employer can show that a particular practice is ''job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.''
Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said the president's proposal would, in effect, establish the unemployed as a new ''protected class.''
Mr. Gohmert said the proposal, if passed, would encourage litigation by sending a message to millions of Americans: ''If you're unemployed and you go to apply for a job, and you're not hired for that job, see a lawyer. You may be able to file a claim because you got discriminated against because you were unemployed.''
''This will help trial lawyers who are not having enough work,'' Mr. Gohmert said.
The Labor Department reports that 14 million people are unemployed. About 43 percent of them -- six million people -- are classified as long-term unemployed, having been out of work for 27 weeks or more. Of that group, nearly 4.5 million have been unemployed for a year or more. The average duration of unemployment is 40 weeks, the longest in more than 60 years.
Charges of employment discrimination tend to increase in a sluggish economy with a high jobless rate. In the 2010 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, job bias charges filed with the employment commission reached a record of nearly 100,000, up 20 percent from 2007.
In many cases, lawyers said, it may be difficult for job applicants to show that they were turned down because they were unemployed. On the other hand, lawyers said, some employers and recruiters have posted job openings on the Web with the message that ''no unemployed candidates will be considered.''
Mr. Obama's proposal is modeled, in part, on bills introduced by two Connecticut Democrats, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Rosa DeLauro. The top Democrat on the House labor committee, Representative George Miller of California, supports the legislation.
''In a tough job market, where workers are competing against tens and sometimes hundreds of people for every available job opening, it is unjust for employers to discriminate against those who are unemployed,'' Ms. DeLauro said.
Skills often atrophy when a person is out of work, and White House officials said that discrimination could worsen the problem, creating a class of people who could be left behind as the economy recovers.
Under Mr. Obama's proposal, the employment commission would be given new power to enforce the proposed ban on discrimination against the jobless.
Chai R. Feldblum, a member of the commission, said: ''This seems like a perfectly reasonable policy step for the administration to suggest. It would allow people to bring a claim directly under this provision if they have been refused a job because of being unemployed, without having to go through the whole 'disparate impact' analysis.''
Helen L. Norton, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder, said: ''There are many reasons why one might be unemployed in a tough economy. Current employment status serves as a poor proxy for successful job performance.''
But Lawrence Z. Lorber, a labor law specialist who represents employers, said the president's proposal ''opens another avenue of employment litigation and nuisance lawsuits.''
Mr. Obama's proposal would give employers some leeway. In deciding whether to hire a person who is unemployed, they could consider the person's work history and examine why the person is unemployed if that was relevant to ability to perform a job.

HEADLINE: In Turn to Politics, Facebook Starts a PAC

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JENNIFER PRESTON

 BODY:
Facebook wants more friends. And it is willing to pay for them.
The Silicon Valley social media company has for the first time formed an old-fashioned political action committee and will use it to distribute cash to candidates in the coming elections. It is just one indication of how social media companies are integrating with the political landscape in a season in which these businesses are growing presences in the campaign conversation.
''FB PAC will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected,'' a company spokesman said. 
The move comes as technology companies like Facebook are moving quickly to increase their influence in Washington amid increasingly complex legislative debates about patents, monopoly status and concerns about the privacy of users.
And it reflects a new desire among the senior executives at Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and other companies to use their technologies to be part of the political process in ways that they have not before.
Google co-sponsored a Republican presidential debate with Fox News last week. On Monday, Facebook held a town hall-style meeting featuring top House Republicans, hours after LinkedIn held a similar meeting with President Obama.
Executives at Facebook declined to offer more details about the PAC or to say which races it would make contributions to. The company confirmed that the PAC was incorporated on Monday after it was reported that it had registered the Internet domains for Fbpac.org and Fbpac.us.
Facebook has steadily increased its presence in Washington as it has grown. It hired its first employee in the District of Columbia in 2007, and the office now has more than a dozen people, including four federally registered lobbyists. The amount the company has spent lobbying Congress has grown as well.
''The increase represents a continuation of our efforts to explain how our service works, as well as the important actions we take to protect people who use our service and promote the value of innovation to our economy,'' said Andrew Noyes, a Facebook spokesman.
The company's competitors are also increasing their presence in the capital as the competition for market dominance increasingly turns to legislative and regulatory fights.
According to disclosure documents filed in July, both Facebook and Google spent more money on lobbyists in the second quarter than ever before, another sign that the two technology giants are concerned about getting attention in Washington. Google increased its spending on lobbyists to $2.06 million in the second quarter, up from $1.48 million in the first quarter.
Facebook's spending on lobbying, while far less, increased to $320,000 in the second quarter, up from $230,000 in the first. It has spent $550,000 so far this year, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Google opened its Washington office in 2006, the same year it started its own PAC. In that year, the company's committee distributed $36,984, according to OpenSecrets.Org, which tracks campaign spending. By 2010, the PAC had distributed $345,000, all for Congressional campaigns.
Google's office in Washington has grown as well. It has 11 registered lobbyists as well as engineers, sales representatives and employees who work with enterprise clients, according to a company spokeswoman.
Last week, Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's board and the former chief executive, testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the issue of competition.
Mr. Schmidt told the committee that Google is in ''the area'' of a monopoly, but is engaged in fierce competition with other companies.
Like Google, Facebook is facing increasing questions from lawmakers about the effect of its practices on its customers.
In May of 2010, the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post to respond to charges that the company had acted cavalierly with user data and had made it too complicated for people to protect their privacy.
''The biggest message we have heard recently is that people want easier control over their information,'' Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. ''Simply put, many of you thought our controls were too complex.''

HEADLINE: Factory Field Trip

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Charlotte, N.C.
If you want to feel optimistic about the state of manufacturing in America, you ought to spend a day with Stephen Gray. Then again, if you want to feel depressed about the state of manufacturing in America, you ought to spend a day with -- yep -- Stephen Gray.
Gray, 46, is chief executive of Gray Construction, a family-owned company, based in Lexington, Ky., that builds factories for big firms. As a result, far more than most people, he has his finger on the pulse of manufacturing in this country. 
Not so long ago, Gray told me, the future looked grim. Manufacturing companies were canceling construction projects. The 10 or so factories Gray was building were nearing completion, yet there was nothing new in the pipeline. Gray was forced to lay off employees. The recession was taking a terrible toll.
But, in the summer of 2010, Gray Construction began to turn around because manufacturing itself began to turn around. There were six big jobs up for bid, including a Siemens factory in Charlotte, N.C., and a Caterpillar plant in Winston-Salem. Gray won them all. It now has 22 projects in various stages of development. With the two North Carolina plants nearly done, Gray asked me if I wanted to tour them. I said yes.
It is impossible not to be impressed with modern manufacturing plants like the Siemens and Caterpillar facilities. They are, first of all, immense; the Caterpillar plant in Winston-Salem, for instance, which will make gigantic axles for its mining trucks, is 850,000 square feet. Both plants use complex robotics, yet still convey the brawn we associate with manufacturing, with giant cranes that lift -- in the case of the Siemens plant -- the 280-ton gas turbines the plant will soon be making.
Secondly, these plants offer something that has become increasingly rare: middle-class jobs that don't require a college degree. The jobs pay between $20 and $30 an hour, plus benefits, allowing a skilled machinist to make a decent middle-class living.
The key word, of course, is ''skilled.'' One reason Siemens and Caterpillar chose North Carolina is that Charlotte and Winston-Salem have community colleges that stress manufacturing skills. In Winston-Salem, Forsyth Tech, a local community college, was involved in wooing Caterpillar and created a program, in cooperation with the company, to make sure its graduates have the machining skills the company needs. Job training was part of the incentives packages that were dangled in front of the companies to lure them to North Carolina.
When I asked Richard Voorberg of Siemens why the German company chose to put its new plant in Charlotte instead of, say, China, he said that for highly skilled work, the labor cost differential wasn't very big and that, in any case, factors like shipping costs and efficiency mattered more. ''For this kind of manufacturing,'' he said, ''the U.S. can compete with China.'' Gray Construction's backlog of projects suggests that other manufacturers -- many of them foreign companies -- have come to the same conclusion.
That's the optimistic part.
Now for the depressing part. Despite the size of the factories, the tens of millions in investments the companies are making, not to mention the millions in incentives and tax abatements that Charlotte and Winston-Salem used to land them, neither Siemens nor Caterpillar is going to employ that many people. Caterpillar is getting an estimated $14 million in incentives, yet it will employ only 500 or so workers in Winston-Salem. Siemens doesn't expect to employ more than 800 people in the Charlotte facility. The same robotics technology that makes these plants so efficient also means they don't need many people on the factory floor.
At the airport, on my way back to New York, I saw a headline from that day's Winston-Salem Journal: ''Lost,'' it read, ''108,000 Jobs.'' The article was about a study, conducted by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, that claimed that North Carolina had lost that many jobs, most of them in manufacturing, ''due in part to the trade deficit with China.''
In particular, North Carolina's once thriving furniture industry has been decimated in the last decade. But I saw another example just down the street from Caterpillar: a Dell factory that had employed more than 900 people -- and had only been open four years -- shut down in late 2010. The Caterpillar factory won't even replace the lost Dell jobs next door, much less put a dent in all the jobs lost in the last decade.
Manufacturing is terribly important. ''More than any other sector, manufacturing creates additional jobs in the supply chain,'' says Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, who has been pushing for a national manufacturing strategy.
It's encouraging, for sure, that manufacturers again see America as a place where they can build things profitably. But my day in North Carolina suggests that the road back to true manufacturing prosperity is going to be a long one indeed.

HEADLINE: Doors Swinging Open

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Boca Raton, Fla.
Like many college freshmen, Energy Maburutse is adjusting to a new world. For him it's not merely strange. More like wondrous.
That ceaselessly humming appliance in his dorm-room window? In Zimbabwe he had never seen an air-conditioner. That sweet treat in the student cafeteria? Frozen yogurt is another first -- and one reason he has almost gained his freshman 15 already. He now weighs about 80 pounds.
Most amazing to him is the electric wheelchair in which he spends his waking hours. It's nicer by far than any from his past. Because of it and the ramps and automatic doors at Lynn University here, he can move his hunched, twisted body from place to place without constantly asking for help. That, too, is a revelation. 
''I can't stop smiling,'' he told me. ''I'm free.''
To meet him is to get a crucial reference point for what we in America call hardship and an example of how profoundly a life can be changed by the right intervention and the right determination. His is a miserable story that became a miraculous one.
He was born 21 years ago in a rural village in Zimbabwe that still doesn't have electricity or plumbing. Crippled, he never walked, so his mother would carry him four hours to the nearest medical clinic. It was a trip they made often, because his bones kept breaking.
The clinic's workers berated and even slapped her, certain she was being negligent. In reality Energy had osteogenesis imperfecta, known as brittle bone disease, but it wasn't diagnosed until he was 5.
He didn't know there was such a thing as a wheelchair until he got one two years later at a school for disabled children where his mother, intent on his education, managed to place him. The school was far from home. Saying goodbye, his mother told him: ''Make me proud.''
He was at another such school, King George VI, in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, when my friend Elinor Burkett, an American journalist, happened to meet him in 2006. The school's band, Liyana, caught her attention and deeply touched her, and she got to know its members, including three disabled boys who played marimba -- Energy, Goodwell and Honest.
They confessed a fantasy: college in America. It was like ''an ant dreaming of becoming King of the jungle,'' Energy wrote in a recent class assignment.
Burkett connected them with the United States Achievers Program, administered by embassies. It helps disadvantaged foreigners apply to, and get scholarships from, American universities.
Each boy was admitted to a school, and Burkett lobbied each school for as much aid as possible. She hit up friends, strangers and foundations for the additional thousands necessary for the boys' living expenses, a process she'll repeat until all three have diplomas.
People are generous when faced with concrete situations rather than abstract causes. At Lynn University faculty members and students made sure Energy got a television and a mini-fridge. One of Burkett's friends pays for his iPhone. His wheelchair was donated by UCP Wheels for Humanity; United Parcel Service delivered it free. His Kindle he won in a card game.
Around campus almost everyone greets him by name. He stands out, given the big chair and tiny body in it. His legs are stuck in a lotuslike position; he can't straighten them all the way. He has no idea how tall he is.
Over the years his spine has curved badly. Some of his vital organs are compressed. With painful corrective surgery he could live a long life, and he hopes to get an operation this summer, from a doctor at Johns Hopkins Medical Center whom Burkett took him to see. Now that he has medical insurance through school, it just might happen.
He studies hard and frets all the time. He can't fail, not if he wants to realize his goal of a job as a human rights advocate -- maybe with the United Nations, maybe with Unicef -- and of some sort of arrangement by which he can live in America or anywhere but Zimbabwe, where there are no ramps, astronomical unemployment and unfathomable poverty.
He told me that he's surprised by the casual work habits of many of his fellow students.
''Americans are so relaxed,'' he told me. ''So rich.''
He pointed to a mop leaning against his room wall. Like most mops in this country, it can be wrung by a sliding mechanism on the handle. He thinks that's hysterical -- absurd. In Zimbabwe everyone wrings mops with their hands.
He had just returned from a class in which he'd given a presentation on global warming, a phenomenon he hasn't thought much about. In Zimbabwe other issues, like hunger, crowd it out.
I asked him if anything about his new life disappointed him. He stared blankly at me. To him, the question made no sense whatsoever.

HEADLINE: Deep Recession Sharply Altered U.S. Jobless Map

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
When the unemployment rate rose in most states last month, it underscored the extent to which the deep recession, the anemic recovery and the lingering crisis of joblessness are beginning to reshape the nation's economic map.
The once-booming South, which entered the recession with the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, is now struggling with some of the highest rates, recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show.
Several Southern states -- including South Carolina, whose 11.1 percent unemployment rate is the fourth highest in the nation -- have higher unemployment rates than they did a year ago. Unemployment in the South is now higher than it is in the Northeast and the Midwest, which include Rust Belt states that were struggling even before the recession.
For decades, the nation's economic landscape consisted of a prospering Sun Belt and a struggling Rust Belt. Since the recession hit, though, that is no longer the case. Unemployment remains high across much of the country -- the national rate is 9.1 percent -- but the regions have recovered at different speeds. 
Now, with the concentration of the highest unemployment rates in the South and the West, some economists wonder if it is an anomaly of the uneven recovery or a harbinger of things to come.
''Because the recovery is so painfully slow, people may begin to think of the trends established during the recovery as normal,'' said Howard Wial, a fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program who recently co-wrote an economic analysis of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas. ''Will people think of Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona as more or less permanently depressed? Think of the Great Lakes as being a renaissance region? I don't know. It's possible.''
The West has the highest unemployment in the nation. The collapse of the housing bubble left Nevada with the highest jobless rate, 13.4 percent, followed by California with 12.1 percent. Michigan has the third-highest rate, 11.2 percent, as a result of the longstanding woes of the American auto industry.
Now, though, of the states with the 10 highest unemployment rates, six are in the South. The region, which relied heavily on manufacturing and construction, was hit hard by the downturn.
Economists offer a variety of explanations for the South's performance. ''For a long time we tended to outpace the national average with regard to economic performance, and a lot of that was driven by, for lack of a better word, development and in-migration,'' said Michael Chriszt, an assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's research department. ''That came to an abrupt halt, and it has not picked up.''
The long cycle of ''lose jobs, gain jobs, lose jobs'' that kept Georgia's unemployment rate at 10.2 percent in August -- the same as it was a year earlier -- is illustrated by Union City, a small city on the outskirts of Atlanta.
It suffered a blow when the last store in its darkened mall, Sears, announced that it would soon close. But the city had other irons in the fire: a few big companies were hiring, and earlier this year Dendreon, a biotech company that makes a cancer drug, opened a plant there, lured in part by state and local subsidies.
Then, this month, Dendreon said it would lay off more than 100 workers at the new plant as part of a national ''restructuring.''
Union City, with a population of 20,000, now calls itself the place ''Where Business Meets the World'' and has been trying to lure companies by pointing out its low business taxes, various incentive programs and proximity to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Steve Rapson, the city manager, said that the challenge there, as in much of America, has been to get employers to hire again. ''It's hard to get your mind around what can you do as a city to encourage future jobs and jobs growth,'' he said.
The reordering of the nation's economic fortunes can be seen in the Brookings analysis, which found that many auto-producing metropolitan areas in the Great Lakes states are seeing modest gains in manufacturing that are helping them recover from their deep slump, while Sun Belt and Western states with sharp drops in home values are still suffering. The areas that have been hurt the least since the recession, the study said, rely on government, education or energy production. Places that were less buoyed by the housing bubble were less harmed when it burst.
In Pennsylvania, the analysis found, the Pittsburgh area -- which is heavily reliant on education and health care -- is weathering the downturn better than the Philadelphia area. In New York, areas around long-struggling upstate cities like Buffalo and Rochester are recovering faster by some measures than the New York City metropolitan area. And the rate of recovery in Rust Belt areas around Youngstown and Akron, two Ohio cities that were hit hard, has outpaced that of former boomtowns like Colorado Springs and Tucson.
In a sign of how severe the downturn has been, the Brookings analysis found that only 16 of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas have regained more than half of the jobs they lost during the recession.
The toll on the nation's millions of unemployed people has been harsh, with the Census Bureau reporting that the United States had more people living in poverty last year than in any year since it began keeping records half a century ago.
Joblessness is taking a toll on states, too. This month, 27 states will have to pay $1.2 billion to the federal government in interest on the $37.5 billion that they borrowed in recent years to keep paying unemployment benefits.
What is most striking about the high unemployment rates, several economists said in interviews, is how they continue to afflict wide parts of the country.
''It just seems to be so pervasive across the country -- except for the breadbasket area -- that it's hard to pick out anybody who is bouncing back,'' said Randall W. Eberts, the president of the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan.
Dr. Eberts pointed to another feature of the downturn: people are much less likely to leave their jobs voluntarily. Before the recession, he said, about three million people voluntarily left their jobs each month. Now, around two million people do -- leaving fewer openings for job seekers.
So what happened in South Carolina? Richard Kaglic, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said the state's lingering troubles reflect what happened when its construction and manufacturing industries were hit hard by the recession. Mr. Kaglic, who is also a pilot, used an aviation metaphor to explain what he meant.
''If your nose is high, if you're climbing faster and your engine cuts out, you fall farther and it takes you a longer time to recover,'' he said. ''The conditions we experienced in late 2008, 2009, are as close as you come to an engine-out situation in the economy.''
But Mr. Kaglic said that the recent return of manufacturing jobs was giving him hope, and that one reason for the high unemployment rate was that more people were now seeking work.
''I would look at it as our dreams are delayed,'' he said, ''rather than our dreams being denied.''

HEADLINE: The Alcohol Experiment

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Some restaurant chains are turning to the bottle during the rough economy, but the liquoring up has produced mostly headaches, not happiness.
Outlets that specialize in quick and cheap daytime meals -- including Starbucks, Sonic and Guy & Gallard, the New York chain -- have been experimenting with adding alcohol to their menus. Pret a Manger, the British sandwich maker, is considering adding wine in its new Paris stores, and Burger King last year began selling beer at its more expensive Whopper Bars in the United States.
With alcohol one of the highest-margin items on a menu, selling beer and wine can lead to increased revenue. 
''Alcoholic beverages are highly, highly profitable,'' said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst at the market research firm the NPD Group. ''It's been such a challenging time for the restaurant industry, I think they're trying to pull out all the stops and try different ways of getting consumers to the restaurant.''
But some of the chains say that so far, the menu changes have been a lot of trouble with little reward. Customers apparently just don't think a value meal pairs well with a cabernet, and the logistics involved with selling alcohol can be daunting and expensive. The problems include obtaining permits, training a staff that has high turnover, slowing down service when IDs have to be checked, and finding a dedicated area for alcohol service.
''Fast-food restaurants aren't set up to be bars,'' said David Henkes, who advises restaurants on alcohol sales at the consulting firm Technomic. ''Based upon the amount of sales that most restaurants would get from alcohol, it's just not feasible for most restaurants to do it.''
With so many employees under the legal drinking age of 21, fast-food restaurants have a particularly hard time when it comes to alcohol service, said James M. Seff, a lawyer who advises wineries and breweries at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.
''If someone is 18 and a buddy comes in who's 18, chances are better than otherwise that the minor will serve them,'' he said. ''The regulatory authorities will murder them if there is a pattern in practice of service to minors.''
Sonic, a drive-in chain a based in Oklahoma City, added beer and wine to the menu in its new Homestead, Fla., location in July. The addition was based on nearby restaurants' menus, and it was meant to bring in customers at night, said Drew Ritger, senior vice president for business planning and purchasing at Sonic.
''When you stand on our patio and look around, you will see almost every concept that is around us has some type of patio feature, and they serve beer and wine,'' Mr. Ritger said. ''It gave us an opportunity to really drive our evening traffic.''
But the alcohol has come at a cost. In addition to the normal hurdles, like obtaining a license to sell beer and wine and training employees to serve the drinks, the restaurant had to hire security guards to keep away underage drinkers, and it expects insurance rates to increase, he said.
And for what return? ''Candidly, they're not utilizing those products very much at this point,'' he said. ''It doesn't look like it's a big deal to consumers -- it's clear they come to us to have an extra-long cheese coney or an all-beef hot dog.''
While Sonic is considering offering alcohol at a beach location opening soon in Fort Lauderdale, Mr. Ritger said he did not expect Sonic to make alcohol available at restaurants nationwide.
''Most quick-service restaurants in the country do not offer beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages,'' he said. ''Most people are probably used to that.''
The bumpy rollouts have other chains limiting their ambitions, or at least proceeding cautiously.
Pret a Manger, the London-based sandwich chain, sells alcohol in some of its airport locations and is considering selling wine in its new Paris stores. But, said Clive Schlee, the company's chief executive, it is not an important part of the business, and he does not expect it to be.
Starbucks is testing wine and beer sales in five stores in the Pacific Northwest. Three-quarters of its store traffic in the United States occurs before 2 p.m. each day, said a spokesman, Corey duBrowa, and the alcohol is meant to attract a nighttime customer. While feedback has been positive, Mr. duBrowa said, Starbucks has not announced plans to offer alcohol beyond those five stores.
Burger King has gotten a firsthand lesson in how difficult selling alcohol can be. In 2009, it began opening Whopper Bars as a more upscale complement to its fast-food locations. The Whopper Bars serve items like a Bourbon Whopper and a New York Pizza Burger, and customers choose additional toppings like pepperoni, onion rings or guacamole.
It started selling beer at Whopper Bars in the United States in 2010, but although Burger King has 10 Whopper Bars worldwide, it serves beer at only six of them, in part because of licensing issues. Last summer, for instance, it opened a New York location near Times Square and promised that it would have beer within weeks, but the store has still not received approval for a liquor license and has given up on plans to serve beer for the time being, said Michelle Miguelez, a Burger King spokeswoman.
In a sign of just how hard it is to add anything alcohol-related to a menu, Burger King last year tested a nonalcoholic breakfast mimosa, made of orange juice and Sprite, in some cities. But watchdog groups objected, saying even a virgin mimosa was inappropriate at a family restaurant. The mimosa is no longer being served at any restaurants, Ms. Miguelez said.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Target Of Inquiry In Securities

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, is under investigation for a complex mortgage security called Delphinus that was issued in 2007 just as the housing market began to collapse, according to a financial filing by the company's parent, McGraw-Hill.
The company said in its filing that it received a so-called Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday and it was cooperating with the S.E.C. in the investigation. 
If the investigation leads to a case against S.& P., it would be the first federal case against a ratings company for its work evaluating the mortgage securities that toppled the nation's financial system. Delphinus was included as an example of an egregiously bad deal in a report issued in April by the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
The S.E.C. may decide to issue a civil injunctive action against S.& P. and may demand monetary fines or disgorgement of fees, the company said.
The mere existence of an investigation does not mean that there will be a law enforcement action. There have been few cases against major institutions in the financial crisis.
''The Wells notice is neither a formal allegation nor a finding of wrongdoing,'' McGraw-Hill said in a statement.
S.& P. has been under scrutiny for months by the commission as part of its broader look at the mortgage securities that cost banks and investors hundreds of billions of dollars in losses when the housing market collapsed.
The S.E.C. has brought cases against banks -- notably Goldman Sachs -- over the marketing of such mortgage deals, but has yet to bring one involving the overwhelmingly positive mortgage ratings issued by firms like Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service or Fitch Ratings.
S.& P. is also at the center of a Justice Department investigation into whether the company put business interests ahead of its duty to accurately rate deals, according to people briefed on that investigation. Standard & Poor's has been criticized by prominent lawmakers since it downgraded its assessment of the long-term credit of the United States in August, and McGraw-Hill recently announced plans to separate the company into two parts in response to a shareholder uprising.
Spokesmen for Standard & Poor's and the S.E.C. declined to comment.
Companies have been quicker to disclose that they received Wells notices since last year, when Goldman was criticized for not having disclosed the one it received related to the S.E.C.'s mortgage security investigation.
Delphinus was just one of many ill-fated mortgage securities called collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s, that represented bundles of mortgage bonds which were themselves bundles of home loans. The securities were supposed to be diversified so that if some homeowners stopped paying their bills, others loans inside the securities would be unlikely to default at the same time. But many of those securities turned out to be full of poorly underwritten mortgages that defaulted at the same time.
In the past, when the S.E.C. has looked into mortgage cases, it has focused its investigations on one deal per company. Its case against Goldman, for instance, was centered on only one deal called Abacus, even though there were nearly 20 other similar deals at Goldman. It was unclear if Delphinus, which was arranged by a unit of Mizuho Financial Group, would be the only one the S.E.C. pursued to see if S.& P. violated federal securities laws.
There was so much demand for the Delphinus 2007-1 deal in July 2007 that Mizuho Securities increased its size from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion, according to a Mizuho news release. The bank's head of structured credit for the Americas said in that release that investors wanted ''better quality collateral.'' A spokesman for Mizuho declined to comment.
Standard & Poor's and other rating agencies were not generally the architects of deals like Delphinus, but the AAA ratings they placed on parts of those deals were critical to the banks' abilities to sell them to investors. S.& P. and other agencies made record profits placing ratings on mortgage securities like Delphinus, but they did not provide any sort of promises to investors that their ratings were accurate.
If investigators at the S.E.C. or the Justice Department find that analysts at S.& P. intentionally gave inaccurate ratings, it could be a violation of the law.
The Senate subcommittee report in April said that in 2006, S.& P. made $561 million in revenue in its structured finance group, where mortgage bonds were rated, and that the firm charged from $30,000 to $750,000 to rate each deal. In the three years before the crisis, S.& P. rated 5,500 mortgage bonds and 835 C.D.O.'s, many of them AAA, despite being aware of increasing risks, the report said.
Delphinus, like so many of those deals, soon began to struggle. The deal went into default by January 2008, some six months after it was created, S.& P. said in a 2008 client notice.
Analysts who rated the Delphinus deal, however, noticed problems sooner than that. Within weeks of the rating, S.& P. analysts e-mailed each other to say that some of the bonds that went in it were not exactly quality collateral. According to e-mails released with the Senate report, analysts saw about 25 of the assets in the deal change within one day of its closing. The creators of the deal put placeholder bonds in, as allowed, but the ones they put in were not of the appropriate quality and ''would not have been passing,'' one S.& P. analyst wrote in the summer of 2007.
The discrepancy those analysts noted was kicked upstairs to superiors, the e-mails show.

HEADLINE: In North Dakota, Flames of Wasted Natural Gas Light the Prairie

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
NEW TOWN, N.D. -- Across western North Dakota, hundreds of fires rise above fields of wheat and sunflowers and bales of hay. At night, they illuminate the prairie skies like giant fireflies.
They are not wildfires caused by lightning strikes or other acts of nature, but the deliberate burning of natural gas by oil companies rushing to extract oil from the Bakken shale field and take advantage of the high price of crude. The gas bubbles up alongside the far more valuable oil, and with less economic incentive to capture it, the drillers treat the gas as waste and simply burn it.
Every day, more than 100 million cubic feet of natural gas is flared this way -- enough energy to heat half a million homes for a day.
The flared gas also spews at least two million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, as much as 384,000 cars or a medium-size coal-fired power plant would emit, alarming some environmentalists. 
All told, 30 percent of the natural gas produced in North Dakota is burned as waste. No other major domestic oil field currently flares close to that much, though the practice is still common in countries like Russia, Nigeria and Iran.
With few government regulations that limit the flaring, more burning is also taking place in the Eagle Ford shale field in Texas, and some environmentalists and industry executives say that it could happen in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Ohio, too, as drilling expands in new fields there unlocked by techniques like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.
''North Dakota is not as bad as Kazakhstan, but this is not what you would expect a civilized, efficient society to do: to flare off a perfectly good product just because it's expensive to bring to market,'' said Michael E. Webber, associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin.
The oil companies say economic reality is driving the flaring in the Bakken, the biggest oil field discovered in the United States in four decades. They argue that they cannot afford to pay for pipelines and processing plants to capture and sell the gas until they actually drill oil wells and calculate how much gas will bubble out of the oil. And reinjection of the carbon dioxide, commonly done in conventional oil fields, is more difficult and expensive in less permeable shale fields.
''This field covers 15,000 square miles, so it takes time to go and test what's there and then build a gathering system and plant,'' said Harold G. Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, one of the biggest oil producers in the Bakken.
The widespread flaring is a step backward for a domestic energy industry. Most oil and gas fields in the United States have well-developed facilities to gather and process gas.
But the recent rise of shale drilling has changed the economic calculus. Natural gas prices have plunged since 2008 as vast shale fields laden with gas are tapped through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Meanwhile, those same techniques have opened up other shale fields rich with oil.
With oil prices high amid strong global demand and leases as short as five years for land in the Bakken, drillers have found it more profitable to just grab the oil and burn the gas. Building out the infrastructure to handle gas would substantially raise costs and slow development, and efforts so far to use the gas for electrical generation have had limited success because it contains components that burn too hot.
''I'll tell you why people flare: It's cheap,'' said Troy Anderson, lead operator of a North Dakota gas-processing plant owned by Whiting Petroleum. ''Pipelines are expensive: You have to maintain them. You need permits to build them. They are a pain.''
Although capturing the gas is the best option, scientists say that flaring is better for the environment than venting the gas into the atmosphere. Pure natural gas is mostly methane, which has far greater heat-trapping qualities than carbon dioxide.
Regulations on flaring are loose in North Dakota, as they are in most states, and there are no current federal regulations on flaring at oil and gas wells. That is largely because flaring has not been a significant concern since the 1970s, when the federal government insisted that oil companies re-inject gas into Alaska's North Slope rather than flare it.
So far, North Dakota health officials say that flaring has not produced any serious air pollution problems. But flaring could eventually become another environmental headache for an industry already under attack over concerns that hydraulic fracturing, also know as fracking, could jeopardize water quality.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recently proposed new air emissions standards for fracked wells, and it has also begun to ask oil companies to compile data on greenhouse gas emissions from drilling and other operations.
''One day a regulator is going to say, 'I'm not going to give you one more permit until you tell me what you are going to do with the gas,' '' said Charif Souki, chief executive of Cheniere Energy, who hopes to eventually export the excess gas in liquefied form.
Environmentalists are also beginning to express alarm. ''It's time for the regulators to take a hard look at the impacts of flaring and make sure that available solutions to the flaring problem are required before there is any further widespread expansion of the practice,'' said Amy Mall, senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Some of the companies working in North Dakota, including Whiting, are investing $3 billion over the next three years in pipelines and several large processing plants to deliver gas to Midwest markets rather than burn it.
Whiting, a Colorado company that was one of the early explorers in the Bakken, sees particular value in the gas found here because it contains large amounts of propane and butane that it can extract and sell at a profit in addition to the gas itself.
The company is rapidly expanding oil drilling while building and expanding two plants to process its own gas as well as gas produced by others. Whiting was flaring 80 percent of the gas in its first major Bakken field in 2007, but says it has now reduced its flaring to 20 percent across all fields, which will fall further when its second gas plant comes online.
''Our goal is to have zero emissions,'' said James T. Brown, Whiting's president and chief operating officer. ''It's a waste to be wasting all of this energy.''
While the projects by Whiting and others could reduce flaring over the next two years, some executives acknowledge that it will be a continuing problem as the industry increases the number of wells in the area from 5,000 to a projected 48,000 over the next 20 years.
Wayde Schafer, the Sierra Club's North Dakota conservation organizer, said that the industry needed to slow down development if it could not protect the air. ''You can do it fast or you can do it right,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Lost Decade?

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If you want a big swig of despair, listen to the people who know something about the global economy. Roger Altman, a former deputy Treasury secretary, is arguing that America and Europe are on the verge of a disastrous double-dip recession. Various economists say it will be at least another three years before we see serious job growth. Others say European banks are teetering -- if not now, then early next year.
Walter Russell Mead, who teaches foreign policy at Bard College, recently laid out some worst-case scenarios on his blog: ''It is about whether the international financial system will survive the next six months in the form we now know it. It is about whether the foundations of the postwar order are cracking in Europe. It is about whether a global financial crash will further destabilize the Middle East. ... It is about whether the incipient signs of a bubble burst in China signal the start of an extended economic and perhaps even political crisis there. It is about whether the American middle class is about to be knocked off its feet once again.'' 
The prognosis for the next few years is bad with a chance of worse. And the economic conditions are not even the scary part. The scary part is the political class's inability to think about the economy in a realistic way.
This crisis has many currents, which merge and feed off each other. There is the lack of consumer demand, the credit crunch, the continuing slide in housing prices, the freeze in business investment, the still hefty consumer debt levels and the skills mismatch -- not to mention regulatory burdens, the business class's utter lack of confidence in the White House, the looming explosion of entitlement costs, the public's lack of confidence in institutions across the board.
No single one of these currents prolongs the crisis. It is the product of the complex interplay between them. To put it in fancy terms, the crisis is an emergent condition -- even more terrible than the sum of its parts.
Yet the ideologues who dominate the political conversation are unable to think in holistic, emergent ways. They pick out the one factor that best conforms to their preformed prejudices and, like blind men grabbing a piece of the elephant, they persuade themselves they understand the whole thing.
Many Democrats are predisposed to want more government spending. So they pick up on the one current they think can be cured with more government spending: low consumer demand. Increase government spending and that will pump up consumer spending.
When President Obama's stimulus package produced insufficient results, they didn't concede that maybe there are other factors at play, which mitigated the effects. They just called for more government spending. To a man in love with his hammer, every problem requires a nail.
Many Republicans, meanwhile, are predisposed to want lower taxes and less regulation. So they pick up on the one current they think can be solved with tax and regulatory cuts: low business investment. Cut taxes. Reduce regulation. All will be well.
Both orthodoxies take a constricted, mechanistic view of the situation. If we're stuck with these two mentalities, we will be forever presented with proposals that are incommensurate with the problem at hand. Look at the recent Obama stimulus proposal. You may like it or not, but it's trivial. It's simply not significant enough to make a difference, given the size of the global mess.
We need an approach that is both grander and more modest. When you are confronted by a complex, emergent problem, don't try to pick out the one lever that is the key to the whole thing. There is no one lever. You wouldn't be smart enough to find it even if there was.
Instead, try to reform whole institutions and hope that by getting the long-term fundamentals right you'll set off a positive cascade to reverse the negative ones.
Simplify the tax code. End corporate taxes and create a consumption tax. Reshape the European Union to make it either more unified or less, but not halfway as it is now. Reduce the barriers to business formation. Reform Medicare so it is fiscally sustainable. Break up the banks and increase capital requirements. Lighten debt burdens even if it means hitting the institutional creditors.
There are six or seven big institutions that are fundamentally diseased, from government to banking to housing to entitlements and the tax code.
The Simpson-Bowles report on the deficit was an opportunity to begin a wave of institutional reform. But that proposal died because our political leaders are too ideologically rigid to take on big subjects like tax reform, which involve combining Republican and Democratic ideas. The failure to seize that moment was one of the Obama administration's gravest errors.
The world economy has many rigidities. The worst ones are in people's heads.

HEADLINE: Spending Deal Sidesteps Clash On Disaster Aid

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate reached a bipartisan spending agreement on Monday to avert a government shutdown, sidestepping a bitter impasse over disaster financing after federal authorities said they could most likely squeak through the rest of this week with the $114 million they had on hand.
After blocking one Democratic proposal, the Senate voted, 79 to 12, to approve a straightforward seven-week extension of financing for government agencies that were due to run out of money on Friday, simultaneously replenishing accounts at the Federal Emergency Management Agency that this summer's string of natural disasters had nearly exhausted. 
''It shows us the way out,'' said Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, who said the plan should be satisfactory to both Democrats and Republicans. ''It means we no longer have to fight.''
The discovery by FEMA that it had money for the week was the key to the breakthrough since it eliminated one of the main points of contention: whether to offset a quick infusion of funds to the agency with cuts elsewhere as House Republicans had insisted. Democrats in both the House and Senate said that approach would set a bad precedent.
While the Senate actions appeared to head off a government shutdown for a second time this year, the embarrassing fight over disaster aid pulled into sharp relief both the enduring, sinewy power of the Tea Party -- and its deep impact on fiscal policy -- and Democrats' revived pugnacity as they press President Obama's jobs plan through next year's elections.
To ease potential objections, the Senate also passed, by voice vote, a measure to extend government financing for four days to allow time to work out the longer-term agreement when the House returns next week.
The House, whose members are back in their districts for a week's recess, would have to sign off on any bill to keep the government running after the end of the fiscal year, since the Senate rejected the House Republican plan last week.
Senate officials hoped they could win quick consent on the four-day solution in a pro forma session of the House this week, calculating that House leaders would not want to be blamed for causing a shutdown by failing to consider a plan that received strong Senate support.
Democrats said they expected the House Republicans to concur with the Senate's overall solution. ''It is hard to see how House Republicans would reject this proposal,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.
Even as they approved the financing arrangement, members of both parties said the that fight had gone too far.
''In my view, this entire fire drill was completely unnecessary,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. ''But I'm glad a resolution now appears to be at hand.''
As the Senate headed for its showdown, FEMA and administration budget officials informed lawmakers that the agency would likely be able to make disaster relief payments through the rest of the week. Mr. Reid's staff then reached out to House Speaker John A. Boehner to discuss a short-term solution.
Democrats sought to frame the latest problem as one manufactured by House Republicans, who last week passed their own bill to provide $3.65 billion in disaster relief to FEMA partly paid for with cuts to loan programs to support energy-efficient cars and alternative energy.
Senate Democrats, who were displeased with the level of disaster aid as well as the cuts, rejected that bill on Friday. (Some Republicans also voted against the bill, on the ground that it did not make sufficient cuts to current-year spending.)
Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat from Louisiana and a central proponent of advancing the aid without corresponding cuts, repeatedly called the House position the ''Cantor doctrine.'' After a moderate earthquake rattled his state, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, almost immediately said any additional disaster aid spent this year would need to be offset with spending cuts.
Immediate emergency aid for natural disaster victims has historically been distributed without offsets in the budget. Congressional officials said the question of how to handle disaster aid was likely to be revisited this fall if the administration sought a special spending bill to cover disaster costs.
Mr. Reid batted away the idea that Republicans would seek offsets for disaster financing for the next fiscal year. ''If they want to go through this again, they are looking for more losses,'' he said. ''Americans are just so upset.''
Twelve Republicans opposed the seven-week bill on Monday. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican from Missouri, said he voted against both bills Monday because ''they would delay the process by punting back to the House'' and because the second bill would provide less disaster relief for his state.
House Republican leaders, who were on the phone with members of their caucus on Monday night, could not give assurances that the Senate bill would find immediate acquiescence in their chamber. But they did seek to portray the bill as their victory.
''Washington Democrats attempted to grandstand and delay needed disaster relief to score political points,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. ''Republicans stood firm, and Senate Democrats have conceded that the spending level in the House-passed bill was the most responsible solution.''
Up next, Mr. Reid said: a trade bill.

HEADLINE: The Pentagon Budget and the Deficit: Containing spiraling personnel costs has to be part of the solution

 BODY:
It was not just two mismanaged wars and trillions of dollars in misconceived and poorly supervised weapons contracts that drove Pentagon spending to unsustainable levels over the past decade -- about $700 billion for last year alone. Military pay, benefit and retirement costs rose by more than 50 percent over the same decade (accounting for inflation). Leaving aside Afghanistan and Iraq, those costs now account for nearly $1 out of every $3 the Pentagon spends.
Much of that is necessary to recruit and retain a high-quality, all-volunteer military. The men and women who risk their lives to keep us secure deserve decent pay while they serve and ample benefits once they retire. But current military pay, pension systems and retiree health care benefits are unsustainable and ripe for reform. 
President Obama has proposed two changes that would save $27 billion over 10 years: increasing co-payments for some prescription drugs for retirees and dependents of active-duty soldiers and charging a modest fee for policies supplementing Medicare coverage for retirees. That would still leave insurees paying substantially less than most other Americans.
Working-age military retirees also pay too little for basic family coverage. The current annual premium of $460 has not been increased since 1995. The Pentagon hopes to raise that to $520 for new enrollees once Congress approves financing bills for the new fiscal year that starts on Saturday. That is still barely a tenth of what federal civilian workers pay for comparable insurance.
Another $45 billion to $50 billion could be saved by adjusting the formula for pay increases to take account of special allowances and benefits worth about $5,000 a year.
The retirement system is both unfair and increasingly expensive. Most veterans, including many who have served multiple combat tours, will never qualify for even a partial military pension or retiree health benefits. These are only available to those who have served at least 20 years. Those who do qualify can start collecting their pensions as soon as they leave service, even if they are still in their late 30s, making for huge long-term costs.
Mr. Obama called for a commission to study possible reforms. But the change the Pentagon reportedly has in mind, phasing in a 401(k)-type plan for future retirees, is the wrong way to go. Military pensions should not be held hostage to stock market gyrations. Partial pensions should be made available to those serving less than 20 years. Payments should begin at normal retirement age.
The Pentagon needs to contribute at least $400 billion in 10-year budget savings if the Congressional deficit panel does reach an agreement by December and as much as $900 billion if it does not.
To find those savings, the Pentagon must also sharply prune the tens of billions it spends every year on building new versions of cold war weapons systems ill suited to America's 21st-century military needs: aircraft carriers, nuclear attack submarines, stealth destroyers and manned aerial combat fighters. The United States already has a comfortable margin of dominance in all these areas. The Pentagon's ambitions expanded without limit over the Bush era, and Congress eagerly wrote the checks. The country cannot afford to continue this way, and national security doesn't require it.
The White House and Congress must find the courage to proceed. Reforms of pay, benefits and pensions must be phased in fairly and commitments already made must be honored. But they, too, cannot be deferred any longer.

HEADLINE: Echoes Greet Tampa Bay's Historic Charge

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: Even during a remarkable run, small crowds at Tropicana Field. 

 BODY:
The idea of the Tampa Bay area as a great baseball market hasn't been in vogue for a long time, perhaps as long ago as the second game in franchise history in 1998, which didn't sell out.
Even so, the vast expanses of empty seats at Tropicana Field were notable Monday night because of the scenario: the Rays were trying to finish off a historic pursuit of a playoff spot, slicing the Red Sox's 9 1/2-game lead in the American League wild card race to zero by beating the Yankees. The attendance was announced at 18,772 but likely wasn't anywhere close to that. 
"It's very sad," said Gary Shelton, a longtime columnist for the St. Petersburg Times. "We've written it so many times. It's no longer maddening. It's no longer frustrating. It's just sad.
"It doesn't speak well of the Tampa Bay area."
Yes, the Rays have some built-in disadvantages in drawing fans. Steve Slowinski, who operates the DRaysBay blog, ran through the list, which includes playing in a dome that lack atmosphere and charm in a location -- a peninsula in downtown St. Petersburg -- that makes it a long drive for many in a sprawling metropolitan area. The local economy has been hit hard by the recession. The team angered fans by dumping some of the most popular players in an offseason sell-off and was expected to be terrible.
But even if this playoff run was unexpected, it has become riveting. Just not riveting enough to get people to the stadium in respectable numbers.
"It's pretty disappointing," Slowinski said. "People have been slow to respond now that the team is doing so well. I would think more people would come, especially with who they are playing."
The final three-game set comes all but gift-wrapped. It is against the hated Yankees, who have already clinched the American League East, and if the Rays can win, they seem almost assured of overtaking the collapsing Red Sox and making the playoffs for the third time in four years. That's almost unheard of for a franchise that wallowed in low-budget mediocrity for much of its history.
"Back in 2008, the attendance was so low because the team had been so bad for so long and it would take time to win over fans," Slowinski said. "At least, that's what I thought."
Now that the Rays have managed to build a low-budget winner, not much has changed, attendance-wise. They have averaged an announced crowd of 18,694 this season, which keeps them out of last place in the majors by 462 fans (Oakland averages 18,232).
"When I moved here, I always heard what a great baseball market this would be," Shelton said. "But it's not a great market. Their second game ever didn't sell out. That was one clue. When Wade Boggs was chasing 3,000 hits, those games didn't sell out either. That was another clue.
"The economy is bad everywhere. Last year, Detroit was having a terrible year and they were 5,000 fans ahead of the Rays, who had the best team in baseball. And I hear Detroit is having some economic trouble too."
And it's not that people don't care about the team. Shelton and Slowinski both said the city is talking non-stop about the race, on radio talk shows and on blogs; local television ratings have been high. It just doesn't translate into people coming to games. The N.F.L.'s Buccaneers have similar issues. They have a seemingly rabid fan base but all eight home games last year were blacked out on local television because they did not sell out.
The Tampa Tribune is currently running a poll asking fans, "If the Rays make the playoffs, will you attend?" Imagine that question asked in just about any other major league city.
Slowinski said his blog even participated in a ticket giveaway contest last week and response was tepid.
"That, I can't explain," he said.
In the end, there may be no explanation, just a long-dead idea of Tampa Bay as a baseball town.

HEADLINE: A Climate Analyst Analyzes His Own Approach to CO2

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A veteran analyst of the climate problem proposes that advocates create more reality-based calls for climate action. 

 BODY:
1:33 p.m. | Updated 
Robert Socolow of Princeton University has written "Wedges Reaffirmed," an essay published today by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Climate Central. The piece examines lessons he's learned since he and a colleague, Stephen Pacala, co-authored "Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies" in 2004. The influential paper, published in Science, divided the challenge of keeping emissions of greenhouse gases through mid-century at levels prevailing in the 2000s into seven "wedges" of carbon dioxide reductions -- through switching to renewable and nuclear power, ramping up energy efficiency, ending deforestation and taking action in other areas. (The new essay adds two wedges because the scope of the challenge has grown in the last seven years.)
While simply a thought experiment and novel means of breaking down the first half of a complex, century-scale problem, the original menu of emissions wedges took on a life of its own.
Climate campaigners embraced it as showing that known technologies, if deployed on a massive scale, could end growth in emissions of carbon dioxide by mid-century (an extraordinary feat given that the growth spurt in human populations and resource appetites is nowhere near done). Of course, it's fine to chart this as a technical possibility but another to weigh it against the realities of global energy trends, which remain locked tightly on the fuels of convenience, coal and oil.
Interpretations of the paper quickly devolved into caricatures. Even Princeton's press office spun the work as the "wedge solution to the carbon problem," when stabilizing was only step one on the much longer road to stabilizing the of the long-lived gas in the atmosphere.
The concept, while highlighted by climate campaigners, was challenged on two levels -- one on technical points about the number of wedges of avoided carbon dioxide that would be needed by mid-century and the other on the broader interpretation (which was never in the work originally) that this meant the challenge of limiting warming was not that hard.
The new article by Socolow is partly a defense of the paper's conclusions, but it is also (and most importantly, to my mind) a personal reflection by a seasoned climate analyst on "shortcomings in the way advocates of forceful action [he includes himself in this group] have presented their case."
Below you can read some of Socolow's central points, although I urge you to read the full essay at the links above.
Later today, I'll be posting highlights from an e-mail discussion about the essay involving Socolow and an array of researchers plowing similar terrain.
The exchange explores both the validity of the conclusions in the original 2004 paper and reactions to Socolow's proposals for gaining traction in an era of deep polarization and economic malaise.
Here's Socolow on what's been missing from advocates' messages on climate: 
Worldwide, policymakers are scuttling away from commitments to regulations and market mechanisms that are tough enough to produce the necessary streams of investments. Given that delay brings the potential for much additional damage, what is standing in the way of action?
Familiar answers include the recent recession, the political influence of the fossil fuel industries, and economic development imperatives in countries undergoing industrialization. But, I submit, advocates for prompt action, of whom I am one, also bear responsibility for the poor quality of the discussion and the lack of momentum. Over the past seven years, I wish we had been more forthcoming with three messages: We should have conceded, prominently, that the news about climate change is unwelcome, that today's climate science is incomplete, and that every "solution" carries risk. I don't know for sure that such candor would have produced a less polarized public discourse. But I bet it would have.
Global prosperity now depends on our species' success at a totally unfamiliar assignment: to "fit" our many billions of people on this small planet, with its finite resources and finite capacity to withstand pollution. The job will be very hard and will require sustained focus.
Also, acknowledging terrible outcomes of low probability requires acknowledging the other tail -- a world with rising emissions but little change for quite a while. I often hear that any concession to benign outcomes (or, more accurately, outcomes that remain benign for a relatively long time) will foster complacency. I don't understand that fear. In my experience, when I tell someone "we could be lucky," and then I pause, the listener completes the sentence for me: "or we could be unlucky." The listener does not hear a lullaby.
Arguments for action based on what we don't know reinforce those based on what we do know. To build a case on what we don't know, however, takes courage, because it requires revealing how much experts disagree. There are many contending views about sea-level rise, for example. Advocates resist calling attention to the coexistence of contending expert views -- far more certain than I am that lay audiences translate such conflicts into justifications for procrastination. I think it should be possible to convey that earth systems science is an evolving human enterprise where discordant views are the norm, and then to explain why certain issues have proved hard to resolve. My working assumption is that candor creates trust.
I wish some museum would prepare a climate exhibit with two adjacent displays that show two worlds with the same greenhouse gas concentrations at some future date (say, 50 years from now). One display would show a world in which human beings have been lucky and the worst manifestations of climate change have not yet arrived; in the other, we have been unlucky and at least a few of the more high-consequence outcomes are already on the scene. With the help of such an exhibit, the public would understand that neither those who proclaim with certainty that the world is facing imminent disaster nor those who seek to convince us that negligible suffering lies ahead can defend their case without going beyond today's climate science.
He goes on to describe how global treaty negotiations have been unproductively framed around limiting the rise in temperature in the coming decades by working backward to present-day emission targets and timetables. Socolow says this approach has a locked-in feel and presumes far more clarity from science than exists. It also creates unnecessary fights, where a learn-and-adjust plan, as he and Pacala outlined in the 2004 paper, would not. That approach, most recently stressed in the America's Climate Choices reports from the National Academies, is now called "iterative risk management."
Socolow:
Right now, especially in international politics, discussion focuses on a poorly defined, multicentury concept, the ultimate rise of the average temperature of the earth's surface. There are heated arguments about whether that rise should be capped at 1.5 or 2.0 degrees Celsius (2.7 or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), relative to its pre-industrial value. By contrast, if diplomats were debating the implementation of iterative risk assessment, negotiations would become more hardheaded. Specifically, there would be more attention to decade-scale global emissions targets.
He proposes that the 50-year policy horizon used in the 2004 paper -- holding emissions of carbon dioxide 50 years hence to current levels -- remains the strongest approach that can be possibly justified:
For the world to emit in 2061 no more than 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide is as difficult a task as I could endorse today, taking into account the salience of other objectives to which I assign comparable importance, including preventing nuclear war, alleviating global poverty, and protecting the planet's biodiversity.
Here's one snippet of the e-mail discussion related to Socolow's examination of communication issues, providing a taste of what's coming later, from David Victor, author of "Global Warming Gridlock" and a professor at the University of California, San Diego (I've added a few contextual links):
The bulk of Rob's new paper is actually about why the "community" of activist scientists has failed to push governments to do much on climate change. That's the right question (if oddly buried under the headline "wedges reaffirmed" since the simplicity of policy claims such as "wedges" is actually part of the problem). Before we do a lot of self-flagellation let's remember that this is a really hard problem to solve. When you look at real economics (as opposed to fantasy visions that deep cuts are possible just with a few mouse clicks) and real geopolitics you have a problem that is structured to fail-it requires near-term policy efforts that are costly with uncertain future benefits, it depends on sustained action when the reality is that governments waver as issues come and go, and it requires international collective action. My view is that better policy strategies can help a bit, but the fundamentals [predispose] a policy outcome that is a lot less aggressive and much slower than most people would like. Mike Levi's comments [earlier in the chat] about the 1.5 and 2 degree targets are spot on-they are code for policy actions that are amusing because they are so disconnected from any reality that exists on this planet.
Rob's diagnosis is that the community has failed on three fronts: a) we are doing badly in conveying the dangers of climate change; b) the science is incomplete; and c) every solution carries risk. I don't understand where these diagnoses come from; they might be right, but they wouldn't be at the top of my list of priorities. But I commend Rob for putting the diagnosis out there starkly because perhaps a debate leads to some practical actions.
The real question is what is our THEORY to explain why policy hasn't been forthcoming.
I think the community of policy advocates is generally doing better than Rob claims with his list of three action points. For example, the community is doing a decent job of talking about the dangers from climate change. In fact, there has been a big shift away from talking about "most likely" outcomes (which are, as Rob says, easier to discuss yet duller) and a lot more attention to possible extreme outcomes-dragons in the closet, catastrophes, etc. Nor do I think the scientific community is doing a bad job of talking about uncertainty and the incompleteness of the science. In fact, the polling data suggest that the public has over-reacted to that message. The new Stanford/Reuters poll shows that the public is more convinced than ever that climate warming is happening and LESS convinced that humans are to blame. And the new Yale/George Mason poll, which is the first I have seen to prove the views of Tea Partiers, shows that Tea Party members (12% of the public) feel they are very well informed about climate science and more than half think global warming will never hurt anyone. Just 1% of Tea Partiers think that there is a more than 80% chance that humans are primarily to blame for climate change (ie, an IPCC-like statement of attribution).
Yet the PNAS 2010 paper that Steve Schneider co-authored shows that 97-98% of the most influential climate scientists think the IPCC-like attribution statement is correct. And you witness dramas about getting attribution probabilities right-for example, the American Physical Society statement on climate change, which has a few of their members foaming-and you realize that the scientific community is full of sticklers about getting the uncertainties right (as they should). And a lot of that debate is in public view. We shouldn't hide, but we don't need to do more.
I have a different diagnosis about things we have done badly. 1) we have failed to talk about coincidence of interests; 2) we have failed to keep costs in perspective. And 3) we haven't talked enough about international strategy. A few words on each.
Interests. Outside of a few hyper green countries-like the EU15-climate change is just one of many issues. Like most environmental issues it comes and goes. You can't sustain action in these countries without either finding ways to make action costless (or at least invisible) or linking action to other things people care about. The costless/invisibility strategy is a big part of the reason why the world (notably the US) did so well in cutting ozone depleting substances.
But it won't work on climate-or at least not yet-which means plan B. Talk about how climate links to energy security and such. That's now happening and it is having an effect (across the board the polling data are much more favorable to regulation on greenhouse gases when the questions focus on other benefits). Obviously we can't over-sell this approach because it won't stop warming and it easily leads to mischievous policies that hide true intentions and lard the economy with lots of extra costs. But all else equal, the more "reluctant" a country is to do something on climate itself the more important it is to talk about other goals as well. The community of policy advocates-especially folks drawn from academic science and engineering-is shockingly naive about politics and the strategy of political action.
Costs. As should be clear from the above, I am much more with "the economists" (a group that hardly speaks with a single voice) on what things are likely to cost. (In fact, I think most of the standard economic models probably under- estimate real costs because they assume efficient policies (e.g., a carbon tax coupled with a well-designed technology investment program). Yet the real political world strongly favors policies that are inefficient yet politically convenient- for example, policies that use a lot of regulation because regulation is an easy way to hid true costs. ) But folks have gone bonkers about costs. The strongest advocates for policy action seem to think that whenever someone talks about costs they are criticizing the whole idea of policy action. That is a HUGE error that is propagated across the policy advocacy community and which the wedges paper has sustained because it (along with all the mostly baseless stuff about "free" efficiency and such) allows people to pretend that action is possible without any tears. The much better argument would focus on perspective. Deep cuts-designed well and sustained as part of an international strategy-are perhaps 1% to 2% of the economy. That's not free, but it is not out of whack with other things we spend money on. In the last decade the US has, I think, seen an increase in 3 percentage points of the total economic output that it devotes to health care. (I don't have the data on hand, but my book Global Warming Gridlock, works through the example in more detail.) Advocates do make comparisons between climate action and other areas of government policy, but usually they focus on incomparable cases-a favorite warm chestnut is comparing climate policy with spending on defense. We should stay focused on like cases and make the argument about real tradeoffs.
International Strategy. I won't say much on this since it is covered in depth in my new book, but the reality is that outside the uber-green economies no country will spend a ton of money on climate change unless it sees broadly comparable actions in other countries. Since 1990 global emissions have risen 45%--all of it in countries outside the Kyoto targets. Kyoto itself covers only 13% of world emissions. For too long, people who wanted to get serious things done on climate have all lined up around Kyoto-like mother elephants around the vulnerable young-without looking seriously at why that whole strategy was doomed to fail and practical alternatives. The more you engage with countries that are "reluctant" to spend a ton of their own money on climate change the more you need to advocate strategies that are linked internationally-so that one country's effort gets magnified by what other countries do.
My list isn't a criticism of Rob's list. It's just an argument about emphasis, priority and strategy. And it echoes what Rob has implied, which is that serious policy action won't be easy. I am optimistic about the long haul, but along the way we need to brace, possibly, for a whole lot of climate change. (That's one of the reasons I think that the talk about geoengineering is essential, and even more essential than bloviation on that front is practical research, testing and efforts to build management systems. But all that is another topic for another day.) I also share Rob's push for a serious discussion of risks and tradeoffs, though the term "iterative risk management" isn't poised to take the public by storm.
A last word-a plea really. Let's all stop evoking Galileo. Whenever someone feels under siege they look to Galileo because he was right and persistent and his critics were both wrong and egregious. But the metaphor is hard to use effectively because what really matters is ex ante. For every Galileo there were thousands of others who were hacks. Maybe the one thing that we have learned from Galileo is that it is unwise to punish dissenters, and that's a good message. But it is interesting to read the Tea Party stuff on climate and see that they use Galileo as well. Everyone is dueling over the same metaphor-they just can't agree on who is Galileo and who's the Pope.
More coming soon.

HEADLINE: Reactions to a New Plan for CO2 Progress

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Varied views on next steps for energy and greenhouse policy in a time of polarized politics and struggling economies. 

 BODY:
Earlier today I posted an essay by Robert Socolow, a seasoned energy and climate analyst at Princeton University, in which he proposes a new approach to overcoming resistance to actions that could limit emissions of greenhouse gases even as humanity's energy appetite grows in coming decades.
As promised, below you can explore an e-mail discussion on the essay involving Socolow and a variety of other researchers working hard on this issue.
I also encourage you to read the reactions posted with both Web versions of Socolow's article (at the Web sites of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Climate Central. (The latter accepts reader comments; neither site has links for individual contributors.) The voices there range from the economist Lord Nicholas Stern, who has long championed aggressive action on greenhouse gases, to Freeman Dyson, the provocative physicist who has been a prominent critic of portrayals of human-driven global warming as an urgent danger.
The e-mail discussion that follows proceeds along two tracks, one examining the validity of the conclusions in the influential "stabilization wedges" paper that Socolow co-authored with Stephen Pacala in 2004, the other offering reactions to Socolow's ideas on how to advance sustainable energy choices in an era of deep polarization and economic malaise.
Ken Caldeira, Carnegie Institution Department of Global Ecology: 
I value any contribution that helps us move towards development and deployment on low-carbon-emission energy technologies. Pacala and Socolow (2004) made many people aware of this need, and presented a vision where success appeared difficult, yet achievable. This was a valuable contribution.
However, there are basic problems with the "wedges" framing of the issue:
The big challenge of the first half of this century is preparing to meet the energy demand of the second half of this century. If energy demand grows at even 2% per year, that means the scale of our energy system must double every 35 years. Today's energy demand is something like 17 TW (17 terawatts or 17,000,000,000,000 watts) of thermal energy. So, in 70 years, we can guess that we might need to provide something like 68 TW of power. (As a quick rule of thumb, with today's technology each TW releases about half a gigaton of carbon into the atmosphere each year.) Each of Pacala and Socolow's wedges thus ramp up to about 2 TW of power. We are not going to supply the world with 68 TW of power by cobbling together a patchwork of 34 different technologies. If we are to provide 68 TW of carbon-neutral power in 70 years, we need individual technologies that can provide 10's of TW of carbon-neutral power. So, yes, Pacala and Socolow are correct in thinking that we can find existing technologies that could potentially scale up to provide 2 TW of power, but they have not shown that we have the technologies that can meet the huge demand of the second half of the century.
The interstate highway system that we are driving on today, was largely designed and built a half century ago. Power plants built today are likely to be still operating a half century from now. So, we are already building the energy infrastructure of the second half of this century. By focusing on near-term emissions reductions while defining clean energy provision in the second half of the century as outside the scope of the problem, Pacala and Socolow (2004) avoided addressing the real problem.
I do not believe that we have today carbon neutral energy technologies that can be deployed at the scale of 10's of TW. Insofar as Pacala and Socolow (2004) led people to believe that we already have all the technologies we need to solve the climate problem while fueling economic growth, their paper was misleading.
There are real potential downsides of focusing on the next 50 years. For example, if energy demand will quadruple in the next 70 years while emissions must decline to near zero, then we need to develop and deploy at scale energy technologies that have near zero emissions. Approaches such as switching from coal to natural gas lead to some near-term emissions reductions, but do not put us on a path towards the scalable carbon neutral technologies that we need. We need to get near term emissions reductions, but we need to keep our eyes on the prize. If "learning by doing" is a big part of the benefit of early deployment, then it is much more valuable to get those near-term emissions reductions with technologies that have the potential of being near-zero-emission technologies that could potentially be deployed at the scale of 10's of terawatts.
There are also some technical issues, such as miscounting the number of "wedges" we need. Pacala and Socolow (2004) assumed a baseline scenario and then characterized what we need to do in terms of departure from that baseline. A clearer analysis would simply look at how much energy needs to be provided to sustain economic growth and then look at all of the "wedges" that would be needed to provide all of this energy. This would avoid double accounting of technologies which appear both in the baseline scenario and then again as a "wedge". With this sort of accounting, the required number of "wedges" could easily double.
Some people, such as Marty Hoffert, have emphasized that we do not have the technologies we need, and thus have emphasized the need for research and development and perhaps can be seen as downplaying the need for early deployment. Pacala and Socolow (2004) have emphasized the need for early deployment, and can be seen as downplaying the need for research and development.
Wisdom, as is often the case, lies somewhere in the middle. Pacala and Socolow are right that we need to start deploying the technologies we have. We need to start reducing emissions and we will learn a lot by deploying existing technologies that have the potential to be scalable near-zero-carbon emission technologies. Hoffert and others are right that we cannot solve the real problem without developing and deploying new technologies, and that we therefore need a concerted research and development effort.
In conversations with both Rob Socolow and Marty Hoffert, I believe there is much common ground, and many apparent differences are merely differences in emphasis and framing. I think we all agree that the climate problem is a difficult problem but one worth solving. I think we all agree that we should start deploying the affordable near-zero-emissions technologies that we have. I think we all agree that we need a concerted R&D effort to develop new scalable technologies. I think we are all playing on the same team, although that might not be so apparent from reading what people write or listening to what they say.
Robert Socolow of Princeton (responding to Caldeira):
I hope my motivation for writing this short paper will not be lost. I have attempted to identify elements that could be added to current discussion to brake the current (and for most of us unanticipated) free fall regarding climate change as a public policy concern. I conjecture that three changes in the way in which the climate problem is presented by the experts to the general public would make the conversation go better: acknowledge that climate constraints are unwelcome (thereby establishing empathy with general audiences, as a doctor does when conveying bad news), present the science as unfinished (thereby taking away the surprise factor that accompanies every new wrinkle -- cf. the cosmic ray stories of a couple of weeks ago), and admit that no solution is wonderful (something hard for much of our community, which loves some strategy and hates at least one of the others).
I hope this message can be kept separate from the inside baseball that Ken revisits. He is right that there are no substantive differences between him and Hoffert on the one hand and Pacala and me on the other. The goal of the paper I have just written is to "restart" the discussion of climate change, which, as I see it, is on the verge of disappearing from view, putting into cold storage both 1) the policy initiatives like carbon prices and regulations that could have short-term impact on wedge technologies like conventional renewables, efficiency, and CCS, and 2) commitments to the advancement of a climate-change-driven research frontier. In short, I see us losing at least a decade (the minimum time for a discarded priority to make a comeback), unless we find creative ways to reengage the public.
One criticism I am getting is that my view is too America-centric. I think one of the current unknowns is whether the rest of the world can go its own way and leave us to enjoy a new form of exceptionalism, or whether we will drag others from their currently relatively durable commitments. If the rest of the world remains committed to addressing climate change, we will be lucky free-riders.
I debated using "wedges" in the title. I might have realized that doing so would bring old business forward, which is the opposite, in my view, of what is needed. We are losing the argument with the general public, big time. I am addressing the next few years, and I am asking how we can get the general public to take climate change seriously. This is not where any of us in 2004 thought the argument would be in 2011.
In a postscript Socolow also pointed to his forthcoming paper in a special October issue of the journal Climatic Change on "."
Michael Levi, Council on Foreign Relations:
It strikes me that there are two different issues here. The first is Rob's call for a more honest public conversation about what we do and don't know about climate change and climate policy. The second is the continuing matter of whether the wedges are a good way to think about climate strategy.
Rob's assessment of the climate community's missteps is excellent. I've long encouraged people to be more forthright about uncertainties - indeed it is the ugly uncertainties, not the likely outcomes, that should concern people most. (Likely outcomes are fine for explaining why 1000 ppm is unwise; they are less persuasive when it comes to deciding whether, say, 550 is too high or not.) I suspect that he is also correct to assert that the "win-win-win-win-win" formulation of recent years is counterproductive: if you insist that climate policy would be a wonderful thing even if climate change weren't real, people are going to suspect your motives for claiming to believe climate science. (It's interesting that Nick Stern at once claims to accept this critique and promotes the "innovation will propel the economy forward" meme. Nothing in economics says that innovation for its own sake is an economic boon.) It may be that embracing uncertainty and acknowledging the challenges involved in climate policy don't tip public support the way Rob would like. But there's a good case to be made that it would, and I have a hard time seeing the harm in trying.
The wedges are another matter. I agree wholeheartedly with Ken that what matters most is the second half of this century and beyond, not the next few decades. The wedges only get you purchase on that indirectly at best. That said, those indirect connections are real and significant for many of the wedges. A wedge of nuclear power it a pretty great platform upon which to develop and test innovations in that arena; ditto for, say, a wedge of wind, solar, or CCS. (I don't want to suggest that R&D isn't necessary; I'm simply noting that deployment can make a big contribution here.) A wedge of efficiency lowers the amount of zero carbon energy that's ultimately needed, and reduces the cost difference between energy services provided by traditional fuels and new sources, presumably making societies more willing to switch. (We'd be thrilled if the cost of wind power could be cut in half; we should be almost as happy to find ways to make the homes it powers twice as efficient.) Even a wedge of natural gas has some value in this view, since it displaces a huge volume of long-lived coal generation assets, which increases the odds that zero carbon sources will be able to muscle in later. (Sunk capital costs are much lower for gas than for coal; the capital costs of adding CCS are much lower for gas too.) One might even say that the wedges are partly right, but for the wrong reasons.
To be fair to Steve and Rob, they actually get at this (very) obliquely in their original paper: their case for needing to flatten emissions now is basically that if you wait until later, you'll be stuck with elevated emissions for the next hundred years. (What they miss is that you can flatten emissions now and still be stuck with elevated emissions for the next century if you don't get technological change right.) It's also worth noting that this mistaken emphasis on the next few decades is nearly universal.
In any case, if what really counts is the second half of the century, that makes the 7 vs 9 vs 20 debate somewhat marginal, since what matters most is what the wedges say about technological and infrastructure trends, not what they mean for emissions per se.
One last thought. I think that Rob has misinterpreted what's been going on in the international negotiations. Yes, as he notes, there's been an immense amount of haggling about 2C vs 1.5C (neither of which is remotely likely). He concludes from this that people are focused on the very long term. I don't think that's correct. 2C is really code for 450 ppm; 1.5C is basically code for 350ppm. 450 ppm, in turn, is code for 50% cuts by 2050, while 350ppm is code for 80% cuts. I'm not saying that any of these equivalences are correct; I am saying, however, that they're basically universal in the minds of most negotiators. When you hear "2C" from a climate diplomat, you should really think "50% cuts by 2050". They are indeed talking about the next few decades.
Roger A. Pielke, Jr., author of "The Climate Fix" and director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, focused on the technical merits of the original wedges paper and the new iteration:
Thanks for this. As you know I spent some time in "The Climate Fix" explaining how the wedges analysis dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the stabilization and the technology challenge. In the debate between Hoffert et al. and Socolow/Pacala there is no doubt that unfolding experience has come down on the side of Hoffert et al. -- far from being "affirmed" the wedges analysis has proven to dramatically underestimate the scale of the challenge.
I summarize this here.
In that post I quote Hoffert who cogently explains the problem with the wedges:"Unfortunately, the original wedges approach greatly underestimates needed reductions. In part, that is because Pacala and Socolow built their scenario on a business as usual (BAU) emissions baseline based on assumptions that do not appear to be coming true. For instance, the scenario assumes that a shift in the mix of fossil fuels will reduce the amount of carbon released per unit of energy. This carbon-to-energy ratio did decline during prior shifts from coal to oil, and then from oil to natural gas. Now, however, the ratio is increasing as natural gas and oil approach peak production, coal production rises, and new coal-fired power plants are built in China, India, and the United States."
Just this week Worldwatch released their analysis of changes in energy intensity which also shows the wedges analysis to have been completely over optimistic as to what BAU deacrbonization rates would be in the current decade.
Socolow in his current paper concludes:
"Achieving an emissions rate in 2061 no higher than today's is a goal that can be achieved by scaling up already deployed technologies."
Work by Hoffert, Caldeira, Green and others has show this to be an extremely dubious proposition, just based on simple mathematics -- the world would need to deploy in a round number one nuclear power plant worth of carbon-free energy every day for the next fifty years. Whether one expresses this magnitude in nuclear power plants, wind turbines, efficiency gains or some combination -- it should be abundantly clear that the one factor we need most is technological innovation. Today's technologies are not going to do it.
When Socolow claims "wedges reaffirmed" he assumes BAU decarbonization of 1.5% per year -- Yet reality is moving in the other direction. To suggest that we can stabilize concentrations without significant advances in energy innovation is not just misleading, it is based on a demonstrably flawed analysis.You can see data on the slowing decarbonization of the global economy (and indeed we have moved to re-carbonization) here.
This is not a nuanced debate among experts who see the data differently -- everyone should be able to agree that the BAU assumptions of Socolow and Pacala have been off target. More is here [Nature commentary].
David Victor at the University of California, San Diego, wrote a provocative, thorough and long reaction (a portion of this comment was published in this morning's post). Because of its length, I'm offering a snippet here and a link to the full essay as a standalone document:
The power of the wedge paper is inversely proportional to its practical relevance for policy. The simple geometry of wedges and the claim that we know what we need to know (at least for 50 years) was enormously influential because it simplified the problem and made real tradeoffs seem quaint. Yet in reality the economics and politics of those tradeoffs have been a lot harder to manage. My big concern about the wedges paper is that it was never clear what wedge-ophiles were arguing for and what critics should argue against. If you criticized one wedge as implausible then the claim was that you could just double other wedges. Wedges wasn't a testable theory-after all, it was just geometry and arithmetic-so much as a presentation tool. That made "wedges" vulnerable to faddism and footloose about the real economics.
Victor's piece credits Socolow on several points and offers constructive criticism and amplification on Socolow's plan for new steps on climate. Read it all here.
Roger Pielke, Jr., then reacts to Victor's comment (it's excerpted here, with a link to the full reaction set up as a standalone document):
It is important to understand the degree to which the "we can do this with existing technology" argument has taken root in both U.S. and international politics. Matt Nisbet has carefully documented how the U.S. philanthropy and environmental community coalesced around the "Design to Win" strategy focused on cap-and-trade, and justified on the "wedges" argument....
Once we understand the scale of our problem and our ignorance in dealing with it, a focus on shorter-term progress with more pragmatic justifications begin to make a lot more sense, from both policy and political perspectives. We have been so focused on the end game... that we have ignored how to get started with accelerating innovation in the real world. In this regard a 50-year focus has been a distraction from the 2-year focus. [Read the full response here.]
Christopher Green, an economist at McGill University focused on energy and climate:
I agree with you, Roger, that David Victor's response is a thoughtful---and in many resoects an insightful-- one.
I also think that you found the Achilles heel in David's discussion: his suggestion [of a cost of] 1 to 2 percent of GDP for making deep cuts in global emissions. The 1 or 2 percent is only (remotely) plausible if there is a thorough-going technological revolution--one that allows huge scale-ups of carbon-free technologies at low cost. Without such a revolution the costs of deep cuts in global emissions will be prohibitive, possibly an order of magnitude greater.
In my view the public increasingly senses the cost will be great. The response is just what one would expect. If you can't do something about a problem--or it is just to expensive to do so--you begin to deny it is such a big problem, and in some cases deny that you had anything to do with it. (A sort of cognitive disonance.) If I am right, then I would expect that if somehow another group of scientists (mainly engineering physicists) could provide us with the scalable, cost effective, and reasonably safe technologies needed for the deep cuts in emissions, there would be an overwhelming response to adopt them.
Thus climate scientists are not to blame. They have done a good job assessing and conveying the problem. Instead look to those who say we have the technologies, the costs are low and the problem is not technological but rather a matter of political will.
Socolow responds:
Gentlemen (notable absence is to be inferred):
To move the conversation forward from my side, I suggest that there be some carful writing from a few of you about "innovation." Some of you use this word in a way that makes me think it is your magic bullet. Innovation as incantation. Does "innovation" have the power you are assigning to it?
Innovation seems to mean something that happens in another field than one's own. When I think about innovation, I think about social software: new ways of organizing the construction of new buildings and cities, for example. [The Energy Department's] full court press to reduce transaction costs associated with solar rooftop power is a case in point. I infer that some of you think innovation comes out of a university laboratory.
(Incidentally, I concur on Socolow's point that too much of the energy/climate/innovation discourse is dominated by men. I'd greatly appreciate the recommendations of women who are scholars or practitioners in this area and eager to advance the public discourse.)
Christopher Green responds to Socolow:
In the case of energy technology neither innovation nor invention are incantation. A few brief points.
1. The world's energy consumption will continue to increase well into the future, the growth softened by energy efficiency improvement but not reversed.
2. Most energy consumed will have to be dispatchable. Current technologies limit that to fossil fuels, nuclear, hydro and geothermal. Maybe someday second or third generation biomass can contribute.
3. Given the various limitations to hydro (sites) geothermal (sites and potential for earthquakes), nuclear (promising but still suspect and increasingly costly), fossil fuels will continue to dominate the dispatchables; and unless the emissions can be captured (but CCS has proven difficult to scale-up, global emissions will follow energy growth on its upward trend, albeit at a somwhat slower pace.
4. If we want to reverse the upward trend in emissions, we should begin by thinking about what innovations/inventions (Schumpeter considered the latter more fundemental than the former) will allow for scale -up and cost reduction of the non-dispatchables (wind and solar) and of dispatchables (nuclear, geothermal).
5. Also of relevance is doing the life-cycle arithmetic. The failure in this respect has been most glaring with the treatment of first generation biomass and with electric vehicles in a world of fossil-generated electricity. (Glad to see that "Wedges Reaffirmed" avoids the biomass pitfall!)
6. In many cases the relevant innovation/inventions are what can be termed "enabling": that is enabling the huge scale-up required; and second and assuring that when scale-up makes long production runs possible, the technology is cost-effective when considered in per unit production, including assemblage, terms.
7. I am not a scientist (an economist, who differs from the assume-we-have a- can-opener economic theorizing variety). but from what I have gleaned, fundemental innovation/invention in the energy technology field that can really displace fossil fuels in terms of scalability and reliability)is very difficult. Solving this difficult problem deserves the focus of climate policy.
In my view this is not incantation. But repeated claims that "political will" is all that stands in the way of big reductions in global emissions seems to me both incantation and cant.
Rob Socolow, with a reply to Chris Green, gets the last word here:
Chris: No problem here for me. But I think we need to write vividly about whatever is in our heads regarding innovation or invention that enables scale-up. I am impressed that the Energy Department seems to be attacking the balance of systems and transaction costs associated with rooftop photovoltaics, where a diminishing fraction of the costs are associated with panel manufacture. Some of those Andy R. has collected here may be hoping for completely new technology, which would lead to its own priorities right now.
We need to direct much greater attention to the industrialization under way in developing countries. We can do more than count coal plants. We are all standing by while new cities are created with buildings and energy systems that are first-cost driven, exactly as ours are. Innovation in this area is first-order. We can also do more to disable the rhetoric that conflates industrialization with poverty alleviation.
We also need to learn to welcome falling populations, a subject full of land mines. The environment-population nexus needs discussion. Some enabling inventions may lie in the direction of turning retirees into productive citizens, so that the "aging" population becomes less of an economic threat.
I am not one who is calling for political good will. Politicians follow publics, and the publics are dismayed. So, I think in terms of reaching the public. I think the climate change activists, myself included, have lost the American middle, and I'm trying to say that this loss can be explained and maybe even undone. Thinking in terms of an unwelcome message, a partially understood problem where very out bad outcomes cannot be ruled out, and universally flawed solutions seems to me a grown-up way of engaging the electorate. I'd love to see my threesome critiqued and other entries proposed. The discourse won't mature unless various elites teach each other what we know and don't know and stop taking so many shortcuts, like two degrees.
But I AM worried about political ill will, notably in the U.S. Political ill will could lead, in 2013, to closing down most of current environmental science and putting all our technological effort into Generation IV nuclear reactors, with a policy overlay like Bush's Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, where there are "good guys" who can be allowed to have the technology and "bad guys" who can't. I am seeking ways of communicating honestly the current situation, with the next election in mind.
This discussion continued in the e-mail string and will, of course, continue on this blog and elsewhere. But I'm ending the post here and will add further points and counterpoints from these researchers in the comment space below.

HEADLINE: Regulators Delay Position Limits, Again

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission again delayed completing its rules to rein in speculative trading through position limits. 

 BODY:
Federal rules set to rein in speculative commodities trading face further delays, as regulators struggle to finalize the controversial proposal amid threats of legal challenges. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission decided on Tuesday to push back an Oct. 4 meeting during which the agency had been scheduled to vote on the rules. The commission's chairman, Gary Gensler, is expected to notify his fellow commissioners that the agency is likely to take up the proposal on Oct. 18. 
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency and a devoted supporter of the so-called position limits plan, lamented the delay. "I continue to be troubled by the pace of implementing position limits as Congress has directed," he said. 
The agency, which must enact some 50 new rules under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, has struggled to keep pace. It already announced plans to push some rules into 2012 -- a delay of more than six months. 
The agency's decision on Tuesday was the latest in a long line of setbacks for the position limits plan. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the limits were supposed to kick in during January. Then the commission planned to vote on the proposal in September, but delayed it to further bolster the cost-benefit section of the rule.
"I want to be sensitive to the costs," Scott O'Malia, a Republican member of the commission, said recently. 
The position limits would cap the amount of futures contracts that a single trader or firm can hold on 28 commodities like oil, wheat and corn, a response to wild price fluctuations that can hurt consumers at the gas pump and in the supermarket. Existing limits apply to only nine items.
The proposal has emerged as one of the most contentious matters stemming from Dodd-Frank. The regulator received a barrage of letters about its plan, some 13,000 comments in total, some from supporters like Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who wrote that the plan was a "critical step to stop excessive speculation."
But many responses came from unhappy Wall Street trade groups. Some industry lobbyists and lawyers note that Dodd-Frank leaves it up to the agency to enforce position limits only "as appropriate," raising the question of whether limits are at all in fact necessary. 
Other groups have even issued thinly veiled threats of legal action. In March, for instance, the Futures Industry Association urged the commission to scrap its position limits plan, saying it "may be legally infirm."
The threats have resonated at the agency in the wake of a recent court ruling that struck down another Dodd-Frank rule. In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the so-called proxy access rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission, rebuking that agency for not fully evaluating the rule's economic effects.

HEADLINE: Thinking About Sovereign Bankruptcy

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: The notion that Greece may need to impose haircuts on its creditors will revive a debate about whether there can be some sort of bankruptcy mechanism for nations. 

 BODY:
I am just back from presenting a paper at the European Law and Economics Association annual meeting, held this year in Hamburg. And of course the topic on everyone's lips at every coffee break, lunch, and paper session was the Greece-French Bank-Generalized-Euro-Zone Panic of 2011.
There was general agreement among the conference participants about what needed to be done: Creditors must take a haircut, Greece must accept some austerity, Greece must also be bailed out, because it was unreasonable to expect them to accept too much more austerity, and then some banks will also have to be bailed out. The latter might involve some partial nationalization ( or E.U.-ization?) of the subject banks, along the lines of the United States government stakes in General Motors, American International Group, etc.
There was also general agreement that the politicians would never do any of these things - save, perhaps for the more austerity thing - because they are scared. Only when they realized that the public was not fooled, and understood what needed to be done, would the politicians act. We can hope that this last step does not take too long.
 A depressing state of affairs, but at least the Europeans seem to agree on what the situation calls for. The United States has not yet reached even that degree of consensus. Of course, perhaps we have more time to dally than the Europeans do.
The notion that Greece, and maybe some other sovereign debtors, may need to impose haircuts on their creditors will inevitably surface the old debate about whether some sort of bankruptcy mechanism for nations. 
The casual reader will be surprised to learn there is no such mechanism, given the media's penchant for referring to a looming Greek "bankruptcy," or even the need for Greece to "declare" bankruptcy.
(It's worth noting that bankruptcy does not mean insolvency, at least in modern usage. Indeed, outside of the United States, bankruptcy usually refers only to personal bankruptcy.)
Although I've had my dalliances with the idea of a bankruptcy process for sovereign entities, it does need to be asked if worrying about a bankruptcy process is not simply a waste of time. Much of what can be achieved through a bankruptcy process can also be achieved in the sovereign context by a bailout that comes with conditions attached. And much of the rest - like the "automatic stay" - is simply irrelevant, because of the distinct nature of sovereign entities.
And while the European Union might like the idea of tying itself to the mast, and thus pre-announcing policy for a future debt crisis, in the sovereign context each case is new. That is, the rule the sovereign announced last time for this kind of situation can always be changed if the sovereign thinks it's the right thing to do this time around. 
So, while it is possible to spend a lot time talking about a sovereign bankruptcy system, I'm not sure it's worth the effort. As an academic, it is a conversation I'd love to have, but I suspect that real-world actors have better things to do with their time.

HEADLINE: Taking Risks to Cut Drug Costs

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Even after savings from generic drugs, strapped patients are cutting prescription costs in potentially risky ways. 

 BODY:
Americans are spending less money out of their own pockets each month on prescription drugs, probably because of greater use of lower-cost generics, the third annual drug surveyfrom Consumer Reports finds.
But even so, strapped consumers, many of whom take multiple medications, are cutting costs on pills in ways that are unsafe.
The average monthly out-of-pocket spending for people regularly taking prescription drugs is $59, down from $68 two years ago. This is likely driven by greater use of generics due to "household budget constraints," the survey found. Major chain pharmacies offer many $4 generic prescriptions, and some popular prescription drugs are losing patent protection and becoming available in generic form.
But in tough times, the savings from generics is still not enough for some patients. This year's survey found that nearly half of the people taking prescription drugs took some action to save money, compared with 39 percent last year, likely due to the tough economy. Steps included putting off a doctor's visit or ordering drugs from outside the country.
And, roughly a third failed to take their prescriptions as directed. Steps included skipping filling prescriptions (16 percent over all, and 30 percent among those whose monthly drug bill topped $50); taking an expired medication (13 percent); skipping a scheduled dose without checking with their doctor (12 percent); cutting pills in half (8 percent) and sharing a prescription with someone else to save money (4 percent).
Lower-income people, those without drug benefits and those with monthly drug costs of more than $50, were most likely to take such steps.
"We're having more people say they're struggling with drugs costs and cutting corners," said Dr. John Santa, director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center. "I think this is an interesting barometer of the economy and the recession, especially for lower- and middle-income people."
Half of adults take prescription drugs, and the average number of prescriptions they take is 4.5. But 16 percent of them take seven or more, the survey found.
And despite concerns about costs, few patients--just 5 percent--hear about a drug's cost from their doctors. Two-thirds first learn about cost when picking up their medication at the pharmacy.
The Consumer Reports National Research Center conducted the survey by telephone in June, using a nationally representative sample of 1,226 adults who currently take a prescription drug.
Do you take multiple prescriptions? What steps have you taken to cut costs?

HIGHLIGHT: The Senate prevents the elimination of $1.5 billion in Energy Department funding from a spending plan. The money is intended to help automakers retool to build fuel-efficient vehicles, from a spending plan. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 On Monday, the Senate approved a seven-week extension to finance government agencies that were due to run out of money. The vote, at 79 to 12, preserved a $1.5 billion Energy Department loan program intended to help automakers retool their manufacturing to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. Last week, automakers and suppliers successfully lobbied the House of Representatives to reject an earlier proposal that would have cut funding to the loan program. (The New York Times)
 Kia has priced its 2012 Rio subcompact hatchback from $14,350, roughly $1,400 more than the outgoing model. The redesigned Rio, which is also available as a sedan, shares much of its mechanics with the Hyundai Accent, which is built by Kia's corporate parent. The Rio, however, is also available with a stop-start system that allows the engine to shut off at idle, a $400 option. Though the Rio is expected to match the Accent's fuel-economy estimates from the E.P.A., at 30 miles per gallon in the city, 40 m.p.g. on the highway, Kia representatives say that a Rio equipped with start-stop would return better mileage around town than its window sticker would indicate. (USA Today)
 Caterham, the British sports-car manufacturer that was purchased in April by Team Lotus, announced Monday that it spun off a new brand based around advanced vehicle design and next-generation powertrain systems. Caterham Technology and Innovation intends to develop "accessible and affordable" new street vehicles based on the Caterham 7, which was designed by Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus, in the late 1950s. The new brand also anticipates taking on clients in the automotive and aerospace industries. (Edmunds Inside Line)
 To commemorate a partnership between Ford and the Legoland amusement park in Winter Haven, Fla., which is scheduled to open on Oct. 15, the automaker introduced an Explorer built from more than 380,000 Lego blocks at the S.U.V.'s factory in Chicago on Monday. The Explorer will be transported on a trailer with transparent polycarbonate sides to allow motorists to see the sculpture as it gets hauled south. (Ford)
 According to a study (PDF) by the Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove 261.8 billion miles in July, 6.7 billion fewer miles than they did in July 2010. For the seven-month period ending July 31, Americans have driven the lowest number of miles since 2003, the study said. Meanwhile, a report by MasterCard SpendingPulse, a market research company, indicated that motorists were buying less gasoline. The company said the trend may not hold, however, because gas prices fell this month. (The Detroit News)

HEADLINE: Spending Less on Entertainment and Charity

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: New numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on how American consumers spend their money. 

 BODY:
Americans ratcheted down their spending on entertainment and philanthropic donations in 2010, according to a new reportfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Every year the bureau collects data on how Americans spend their money. Here's a look at the budget of the average household:
According to these survey data, the average pretax income per consumer unit (which is, more or less, a household) fell 0.6 percent in 2010, to $62,481 from $62,857. But households disproportionately tightened their spending, which fell 2 percent in 2010, to $48,109 from $49,067. Spending had fallen 2.8 percent the previous year.
In fact, in these nominal dollars, the 2010 level of average annual consumer expenditures was lower than that for 2006.
Just about every major spending category fell last year, with two exceptions: health care (up 1 percent) and transportation (up 0.2 percent).
Percentage-wise, the biggest spending decline was in entertainment, which fell 7 percent last year, to $2,504 a household. The second biggest decline was in cash contributions -- including payments to charities and religious organizations -- which fell 5.2 percent, to $1,633 a household.
After that came spending on food away from home, which declined by 4.4 percent, to $2,505 a family.

HEADLINE: Must-Reads: Communicating Through, and About, War

BYLINE: AT WAR


HIGHLIGHT: Three must-reads from the Web on communicating the damage of war -- from the battlefield to the homefront. 

 BODY:
We've picked up on three pieces scattered throughout the Webiverse that are worth your time. All three take on the difficulties of communicating the realities of war. 
The first is from our colleague, Catrin Einhorn, a member of the Emmy-winning team behind the year-long series, "A Year at War." She tells the story of Tom Marcum, an airman who came home from two tours in Iraq with traumatic brain injury. He also struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder. 
His wife, April, has likewise struggled to keep him healthy, quitting her job as a teacher to care for him. Ms. Einhorn writes, "Ms. Marcum has joined a growing community of spouses, parents and partners who, confronted with damaged loved ones returning from war who can no longer do for themselves, drop most everything in their own lives to care for them." 
But the article also bares the problems the couple has connecting on a personal level after Mr. Marcum's injury. "His body's here, but his mind is not here anymore," Ms. Marcum said. "I see glimpses of him, but he's not who he was." 
Read the article here.
Make sure to watch the slideshow that goes with the story.
The second comes from the Lens blog, where thephotojournalist and video innovator Danfung Dennis talks about why he felt the need to switch from stills to video to produce his new documentary about the war in Afghanistan, "Hell and Back Again." 
"I was frustrated with photojournalism, and I was frustrated with society back in the U.S. being indifferent to the war," Mr. Dennis said in the post. He continued, "I moved into video and new media to try to shake people up - to show the war's brutal reality in an honest way."
Michael Kamber, who interviewed Mr. Dennis and is himself a veteran photojournalist of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, calls the film "a tour de force that breaks new ground in the documentary tradition, combining chilling reportage with sometimes dreamy or drugged-up sequences." 
Read the interview here.
The last comes from Matthew M. Burke of Stars & Stripes, who writes about how some service members are using social media to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr. Burke quotes experts, saying that "sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America's 'Community of Veterans' are providing veterans and their families an outlet for referrals, advice and helpful programs." The sites themselves are also actively searching for veterans who might be reluctant to ask for help outright. Mr. Burke quotes Jennifer Boyce, who works for the Wounded Warrior Project: "We find that many veterans are reluctant to seek help for themselves, even if they are struggling. A big part of our referrals are situations like these, where we reach out and say, 'We see you're going through a tough time, and we're here to have your back.'"

HEADLINE: Flames Light the Prairie and Warm the Planet

BYLINE: CLIFFORD KRAUSS


HIGHLIGHT: All told, 30 percent of the natural gas produced in North Dakota is burned as waste. No other major domestic oil field currently flares close to that much, though the practice is still common in countries like Russia, Nigeria and Iran. 

 BODY:
 In Tuesday's Times, I write about the flaring of natural gas from pipes, pits and hundreds of oil wells in the Bakken shale field of North Dakota and Montana, which emits a couple of million tons of carbon dioxide annually. It's a big waste and it contributes to global warming, as even oil executives concede.
 A full 30 percent of the natural gas produced in North Dakota is now being flared, compared with about 2 percent typically at other fields around the country. 
Regulations on flaring are loose in North Dakota and in most states, and there are no federal regulations governing flaring at oil and natural gas wells. That is largely because flaring has not been a significant concern since the 1970s, when the federal government insisted that oil companies reinject gas into the North Slope rather than flaring the excess.
Most oil and natural gas fields in the United States have fairly well developed gathering and processing facilities. But the Bakken is a new field that has exploded in development over the last five years, with 190 rigs now drilling 2,000 wells a year. Building out the infrastructure for gathering natural gas more quickly would substantially raise costs and slow development.
"The economics are driven for oil," said Bruce Hicks, a senior regulator at the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. "With oil worth 10 to 15 times what gas is, you are going to prioritize your oil."
The United States ranks 15th in the world in natural gas flaring, according to the World Bank. Russia, which flares nearly 5 percent more, is ranked No. 1. 
Oil and natural gas executives acknowledge the environmental problem, and some of the companies working in North Dakota plan to invest $3 billion over the next three years on pipelines and several large processing plants to deliver gas to Midwestern markets rather than flare it. 
That will help reduce the flaring in the short term, but much more infrastructure will be needed to handle new expansion: fewer than 10 percent of the oil wells that more than 25 companies plan to drill in the Bakken have been completed.
The Whiting Petroleum Company is a leader in controlling the flaring. The Colorado company has developed a business plan for rapidly expanding oil drilling while building and enlarging two plants to process its own natural gas as well as supplies produced by other companies.
As Whiting executives see it, the gas has added value because it is full of natural gas liquids like propane and butane used for cooking, heating and plastics. They say they are selling those components for a profit. 
Whiting was one of the early explorers in the Bakken, and its financial successes have encouraged it to capture and process the gas. It is the first company to contract with a venture called the Bakken Express, which is experimenting with a technique to truck compressed natural gas from wells until pipelines are built.
In its 65,000-acre Sanish field, its biggest oil-producing prospect, Whiting built a small processing plant soon after it started drilling there in 2006. It flared 80 percent of the gas it produced in 2007, but as it expanded the plant and pipeline network, the company was able to reduce its flaring to 15 percent even as it expanded production.
Whiting's executives acknowledged that reducing the flaring was important to ensuring that the Bakken is developed as an environmentally sustainable field. Altogether, Whiting still flares 20 percent of the natural gas it is producing in its Bakken fields, but that percentage should come down considerably when it completes a second processing plant later this year.
"Our goal is to have zero emissions," said James T. Brown, Whiting's president and chief operating officer. "It's a waste to be wasting all of this energy."

HEADLINE: Placing a Bet on Brazil

BYLINE: KARLA ZABRUDOVSKY


HIGHLIGHT: A report on investors' bullishness in Latin American opportunities is the latest sign that the region is a relative bright spot in the world economy. 

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY - As the United States and Europe face a bleak financial reality, Latin America hums along with continued growth and optimistic predictions for the next few years.
The latest rosy report came Tuesday from J.P. Morgan, which released a survey of 40 institutional investors in North America and Europe, finding them upbeat about investment opportunities in Latin America over the next three years and applauding improvements in investor relations.
A majority of these investors, who together hold approximately $57.3 billion of actively managed equity in Latin American companies, view Brazil as the country with the highest investor-relations standards. Mexico, along with Peru, ranked last, partly because of the disparity in investor relations standards between blue-chip companies (which make it easy to find and obtain information for investors and shareholders) and smaller companies (which tend not to be as open with their information).

Survey participants named Brazil and Colombia as the most promising countries for investment opportunities over the next three years; Brazil's rapidly expanding middle class promises to yield tremendous growth, while Colombia's pro-business government is attractive to investors. Argentina and Venezuela were viewed as the least promising, because of the perception of unstable or unpredictable governments.
The economy in Latin America is getting a fair amount of attention as a relative bright spot. 
A World Bank report published last week attributes the region's growth to its increasing economic ties to China. Ten years ago, there was almost no commerce between the two; today, China is one of the biggest trading partners for some of the region's economic powerhouses, including Brazil and Chile. 
But the commercial honeymoon between China and Latin America may be coming to an end. Francisco J. Snchez, the United States under secretary of commerce for international trade, visiting Mexico City on Tuesday to promote business, said that high transportation costs, extended delivery times and high import tariffs were reversing this trend. "We are seeing more and more businesses returning to this hemisphere," Mr. Snchez said. Investors are taking note.

HEADLINE: Six N.F.L. Contenders, and the Way They Have Disappointed

BYLINE: CHASE STUART


HIGHLIGHT: Six of the presumptive favorites to win the Super Bowl had flaws on full display on Sunday. 

 BODY:
Six of the presumptive favorites to win the Super Bowl had flaws on full display on Sunday.
For now, Green Bay looks to be the class of the league, and fans of unbeaten Buffalo and Detroit are surely proud of their teams. But four others teams -- the two franchises with the best records in 2010, the only team to make the conference championship game in each of the past two seasons, and the so-called dream team -- experienced varying degrees of distress. The defenses of Rex Ryan and Bill Belichick were punctured like never before.
No Hiding the Patriots' Defensive Woes
The Bills have now staged improbable comebacks in consecutive weeks, following up a rout of Kansas City on opening day. But the big story out of Buffalo wasn't necessarily about the Bills. It might have been about New England, whose defense may torpedo its chances.
Buffalo defeated New England despite falling into a 21-0 hole, a sentence that Bostonians probably never thought they would read. Under Belichick, the Pats had been 53-0 when leading by 21 or more points. In the Belichick era, the Patriots were 91-4 when jumping out to a 14-point lead at any point in the game. Belichick made his reputation on the defensive side of the ball, but he's never coached a team as one-sided as the 2011 Patriots appear to be.
Chad Henne threw for over 400 yards in the opener against the Patriots. In New England's game against San Diego, six of the Chargers' nine drives went for at least 50 yards, and two of the other three might have done the same if they hadn't ended in fumbles. Patriots victories allowed the team to minimize the reality of those defensive struggles, but the defense can't avoid the scrutiny now.

New England has allowed 1,406 yards in the team's first three games, the fifth-worst mark since 1970. But yardage totals aside, there's a reason this loss feels different: Tom Brady and the Patriots don't lose shootouts to anyone but the Colts. During the Brady/Belichick era, the Pats had been 61-2 when scoring at least 30 points, with both losses coming to Peyton Manning and Indianapolis. Make that 61-3. The Patriots' video-game offensive numbers had everything thinking it was 2007 all over again; the better comparison may end up being the 2000 Rams. That St. Louis squad passed for more yards than any team in league history, but the defense (ranked last in points allowed) prevented a Super Bowl repeat.
Jets Flunk First Leg of Road Trip
Rex Ryan is known for having elite defensive units. With Ryan, that starts by stopping the run. Against the Raiders, the Jets' defense looked anything but elite. In his first 34 games with the Jets, Rex Ryan's defense never allowed more than 153 rushing yards (a mark hit by the Saints in 2009). The worst the Jets had been outrushed came in Week 3 of the 2009 season, when Tennessee gained 44 more rushing yards than the Jets. The Raiders rushed for 234 yards and outrushed New York by 134 yards, margins incomprehensible before Sunday.
During Ryan's 10 seasons as an assistant in Baltimore, the high-water mark was 207 rushing yards gained by the 2008 Giants. Sunday was as unusual for New England as it was for Ryan, who has never had a worse performance against the run. An ugly interception by Mark Sanchez and an abysmal day by Antonio Cromartie were part of the problem, but inconsistent play from those two is something the Jets have endured before. The run defense had almost never been the culprit.
Unlike the Patriots, the Jets appear to have the horses on defense to earn the benefit of the doubt. The only other game under Ryan when the run defense was primarily responsible for a loss came against Miami and the Wildcat in 2009. The Jets responded in the rematch by holding Miami to 52 rushing yards. Unfortunately for the Jets, there seems to be little margin for error in the next two weeks, with games in Baltimore and New England. The Ravens gained 553 yards of offense against the Rams, the second-highest yardage total by any team this season. Numbers one, two, and four on that list came at the hands Tom Brady and the Patriots. If the Jets still have questions about their defense two weeks from now, they may be staring at a 2-3 record.
Is That a Doughnut or the Eagles' Defense?
A loss to the Giants doesn't spell doom for Philadelphia: in both 2000 and 2003, Andy Reid's Eagles made the playoffs after a 1-2 start. Philadelphia started 2-2 in 2010, and 2-2 is likely for this edition, with San Francisco on tap this weekend (after edging the Bengals, the 49ers are now 2-21 in road games against non-N.F.C. West competition since 2007). Philadelphia can still realize all of its hopes and dreams, but there is no way to hide the warts anymore. In both losses, the three biggest worries for the Birds took center stage:

        
On defense, defensive ends Trent Cole and Jason Babin are elite edge rushers while cornerbacks Asante Samuel and Nnamdi Asomugha are among the best in the league. Unfortunately, none of those players line up in the middle of the field. The Eagles are below average across the board at linebacker, and Casey Matthews has been disastrous at times. Atlanta TE Tony Gonzalez caught 7 passes for 83 yards and 2 touchdowns in Week 2, while Michael Turner rushed 21 times for 114 yards. The middle of the Eagles' defense didn't fare any better on Sunday; Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs combined for 200 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 combined touches. Asomugha had an off day, but he'll find his elite form soon. The Eagles have the corners to slow the aerial attacks in Green Bay and New Orleans, but can they contain Jermichael Finley and Jimmy Graham

        
The offensive line wasn't very good last year, but Michael Vick hid a lot of its deficiencies. The Eagles' struggles in pass protection have hampered the team's two best players: Vick has missed time because of injury in both losses while receiver DeSean Jackson has just 153 yards this season. Jackson is the best deep threat in the game, but is averaging only 15.3 yards per catch this season. Against teams with good pass rushes -- Green Bay, Detroit and New Orleans in particular -- Philadelphia will have to alter the gameplan to protect the offensive line.

        
Philadelphia has led all three games when Vick has been on the field; the Eagles lost leads late to both Atlanta and the Giants only after Vick left the game. But Vick is one of the smallest quarterbacks in the league and -- as Vick is happy to point out -- takes more hits than most other quarterbacks. That's not a good combination for staying healthy. At this point, it's hard to envision Vick staying healthy till the end of the season.
The Eagles can give any team in the league a serious challenge. But Philadelphia doesn't have the look of a dominant 13-3 team that's going to take the N.F.L. by storm. The dream is still attainable -- Philadelphia could get hot at the right moment, Vick could be healthy in December and January, and the right set of playoff opponents could find their way on the Eagles' schedule. But this is a flawed team, and its struggles in short-yardage situations against the Giants looked more like frustrating Andy Reid teams from the Donovan McNabb era than any sort of dream team.
Falcons Regress to Mean
After an opening day loss in Pittsburgh, the 2010 Falcons went on a 12-1 run in which they effectively clinched the top seed. Nine times in that 13-game stretch, the Falcons entered the fourth quarter leading or trailing by less than a touchdown; Atlanta went 9-0 in those games.
Had the team gone a more reasonable 5-4, the Falcons would have been a 9-7 team on the outside looking in. Instead, good fortune brought them the conference's best record. Through three games this season, Atlanta has been trailing by 24, 10 and 13 points entering the third quarter. If not for a Michael Vick injury in Week 2, the Falcons could be staring at an 0-3 record. Atlanta wasn't nearly as good as its record last year, but the Falcons aren't going to be trailing by double digits every weekend this year either. Expect something more in the middle, but hopes of a Super season in Atlanta have seemed too rosy from the start. Atlanta's pass defense is still the team's Achilles' heel, while the pass offense isn't nearly as good as many seem to think it is. Since the start of last season, the Falcons rank just 24th in net yards per pass attempt.
Dishonorable Mention
The Chargers at home against the Chiefs was supposed to be a blowout; instead, San Diego was holding its breath until the game's final minute. A slow September start is cliche for San Diego: the last five Septembers, the Chargers have been favored in 14 of 17 games, but have a record of 8-9 while going 5-11-1 against the spread. San Diego is 2-1 but has been underwhelming in both wins.
The big worry here isn't that "it's happening again" but rather that the malaise has spread to the passing offense. Even during ghosts of September past, Philip Rivers was fantastic. This year, Rivers has thrown a pair of interceptions each week while his big play and efficiency numbers have dropped.
Perhaps all the team needs is a healthy Antonio Gates, but the Chargers have looked more conservative on offense this season. According to Footballguys.com, San Diego has thrown 38 percent of its passes toward running backs, compared with 28 percent in 2008 to 2010. Mike Tolbert leads the team in receptions while Ryan Mathews is second in receiving yards. This may be a reflection of a small sample size rather than a shift in philosophy, but it's worth keeping an eye on how the Chargers stretch the field over the next few weeks. San Diego led the league in yards per pass completion in both 2009 and 2010, but rank in the bottom half of the league in that metric three weeks into the season.
Pittsburgh defeated the Colts, but only by kicking a field goal in the final seconds. A close victory over the lowly Colts (Pittsburgh was a 10.5 point favorite) doesn't hide the scary issues in Pittsburgh:

        
The defensive line of Aaron Smith, Casey Hampton and Brett Keisel is about 100 years old; technically, they're 102 years old. All four members of the secondary are in their thirties, and James Farrior and James Harrison add another 69 years of life experience. Injuries have begun to pile up (Keisel and CB Bryant McFadden missed the Colts game), although the bigger injury concerns might rest on...

        
Pittsburgh's offensive line has been a weak point for years. When the Steelers won the Super Bowl in 2008, the offensive line was by far the weakest link on the team. Those Steelers ranked 29th in yards per rush and 29th in sack rate (although Willie Parker and Ben Roethlisberger deserve some of the blame there, too) and the line has continued to disappoint ever since. On Sunday Night, Pittsburgh lost Marcus Gilbert, Doug Legursky and Jonathan Scott at various points in the game to injuries. The Steelers' line is neither talented nor deep, and it seems only a matter of time before Pittsburgh's offense grinds to a halt. With Roethlisberger, Mike Wallace, Antonio Brown, Hines Ward, Heath Miller and Emmanuel Sanders, Pittsburgh has abundant receiving options on offense. But none of it will matter if that offensive line can't hold up.

        
Pittsburgh's rush offense has been rendered almost useless thanks to the offensive line. Against the Ravens on opening day, six of Rashard Mendenhall's 12 carries went for two or fewer yards. Facing the Colts -- perennially terrible against the run -- 13 of his 18 carries went for fewer than three yards.
Four Super Bowl hopefuls -- the Patriots, Jets, Eagles and Falcons -- had the spotlight shine on their weaknesses this past Sunday. Two other teams escaped with wins thanks to the scheduling gods. For all six teams, this Sunday represents a chance to right the ship. New England (Oakland), the Jets (Baltimore) and Pittsburgh (Houston) will need to to fix their flaws to avoid a two-game losing streak; all go on the road against tough A.F.C. teams. The Chargers (Miami), the Eagles (San Francisco) and the Falcons (@Seattle) have a chance to show they won't play down to their level of competition. The odds say that at least a couple of the teams scratching their heads today will be pulling out their hair a week from now.

HEADLINE: Europe Readies Plan for Tax on Financial Transactions

BYLINE: STEPHEN CASTLE


HIGHLIGHT: The European measure will probably include taxes on the purchase of stocks and bonds; derivatives are likely to be taxed at a lower rate. 

 BODY:
6:09 p.m. | Updated 
BRUSSELS - The European Commission is expected to unveil a detailed plan on Wednesday to create a financial transaction tax, despite the opposition of several member countries and a formal acknowledgement that it could have a significant negative effect on the European Union's gross domestic product.
The plan, which has the strong support of France and Germany, will be discussed in a speech before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, by Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
The measure will probably include taxes on the purchase of stocks and bonds; derivatives will probably be taxed at a lower rate. Transactions on the currency markets are not expected to be included.
Critics are expected to highlight a formal study regarding the proposal's economic effects.
"With a tax rate of 0.1 percent, the model shows a drop in G.D.P. (minus 1.76 percent) in the long run," according to a draft of the plan.
One European Union official, who asked not to be identified because the proposal had not been published, said the actual effect would be less significant, because the assumptions used in the final proposal differed from those in an impact study.
He also suggested that the tax rate proposed on at least some transactions might be lower than 0.1 percent, and that the proposal would exempt the purchase of stocks and bonds when they were first issued. The impact study had assumed the tax applied to all transactions, he said.
Nevertheless, the proposal is highly divisive. France and Germany see it as a method of requiring the financial sector to provide compensation for some of the damage sustained in the economic crisis. They also think the tax can help deter more speculative transactions, which may provide little benefit to the real economy.
"The basic idea is that taxes could improve financial sector stability and the functioning of the market," the draft proposal says.
But Sweden and Britain are among those in opposition, saying that unless the levy can be adopted globally, the measure will simply drive financial institutions away from the European Union.
Prospects of a global deal were quashed earlier this month when the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told European finance ministers he would not agree to such a tax in the United States.
After Mr. Geithner's comments, Belgium's finance minister, Didier Reynders, called for Europeans to press ahead with their own proposal, perhaps including only the 17 nations that use the euro, if all 27 members of the European Union could not agree.
If a euro zone agreement is impossible, a smaller group of countries could go ahead with their own low-level tax.
The Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, explained this month the opposition of his country, which does not use the euro.
"We have substantial experience in Sweden," he said. "Basically, most of our derivative and bond trading went to London during the years we had a financial transaction tax, so if you don't get a solution that is universal, it is very likely to be detrimental for European financial markets."
The European Union official declined to say what tax rate would be proposed. In the past, the European Commission has suggested a rate of 0.1 percent for trading stocks and bonds and 0.01 percent for derivatives.

HEADLINE: How Climate Change Could Hurt Yellowstone National Park

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A report by environmental groups predicts climate change will harm the ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park and the local economy that it supports. 

 BODY:
Before the end of the century, Yellowstone National Park could experience summers that feel like Los Angeles's, according to a report released Tuesday. These warming temperatures will imperil everything from native cutthroat trout to aspen forests and the $700 million in annual economic activity that they and other gems in the park generate by attracting tourists, the report said.
The report, the first evaluation of how climate change will affect the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, is a joint project of the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon emission reductions by drawing attention to the likely consequences of climate change, and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a conservation organization concerned with the park and the land around it. 
The authors used two warming scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one based on a medium-to-high-range level of carbon emissions in the future and another one based on a lower set of carbon emissions. 
Already Yellowstone, which sits at a relatively high average elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, is warming faster than the rest of the globe, the report found. The temperature there over the last decade was 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average temperature in the region for the 20th century, the report said. The planet as a whole was 1 degree warmer in the last decade than the average for the 20th century.

The results of even this relatively small change have been noticeable in all aspects of the park, the report said, from glacial ice to reductions in the birthrates of at least one migratory elk herd, whose main food source, meadow grasslands, is drying out too quickly in the summer season. 
Most notably, warmer temperatures have allowed infestations of tree-killing beetles that previously had been held in check by the frostiest nights of the year.
But that 1.4-degree increase is just a precursor of what is to come, the report said. Taking the average of 16 computer models of climate future that were fed data from five different local weather stations, the report predicted that summer temperatures in Yellowstone could be expected to rise as much as 9.7 degrees by the end of the century. The authors considered summer particularly significant because it is the peak season for visits to the park.
"What we humans are doing to the climate isn't just melting polar ice caps, it's disrupting the places that are nearest and dearest to us," said Stephen Saunders, the climate organization's president and the lead author of the report. "Already, threads are being pulled out of the tapestries of Yellowstone and other special places, and they are losing some of their luster."

HEADLINE: Capital One Says ING Direct Deal Will Create Jobs

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: As Wall Street moves to shed jobs by the thousands, Capital One, whose planned acquisition of ING Direct USA has drawn scrutiny, trumpeted its plans to hire more than 3,600 new employees in 2011. 

 BODY:
Capital One, under fire from consumer groups and competitors for its $9 billion bid to acquire ING Direct USA, is hoping to sweeten the deal and stem the controversy with a big promise: job creation.
"In marked contrast to most bank mergers and current trends in our industry, Capital One plans to increase employment this year," John Finneran, Capital One's general counsel, told the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, which hosted the second of three planned public hearings to scrutinize the deal. 
As Wall Street moves to shed jobs by the thousands, Capital One trumpeted its plans to hire more than 3,600 new employees in 2011. By 2013, the bank promised 500 new jobs in Delaware, where ING Direct USA is based. 
Capital One might transfer some ING jobs to other offices across the country, according to a person with knowledge of with the matter, though the employees would have the option to relocate. 
 The bank drew up the new narrative after it was besieged at a Fed hearing last week, where a parade of critics warned that its takeover of the online bank would create another "too big to fail" financial giant. 
On Tuesday, the same opponents disputed Capital One's hiring pledge, dismissing it as a ploy to placate regulators. They also noted that Delaware would subsidize Capital One's hiring there. 
"Apparently the state government needs to pay Capital One to create jobs," John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in a statement.
Capital One has a mixed record when it comes to post-takeover hiring. After scooping up three regional banks before and during the credit crisis, Capital One eliminated hundreds of jobs, including at Chevy Chase Bank. The most significant cuts came at North Fork Bank's mortgage business in California. Capital One said, however, that the ranks of its retail banking business had grown since it acquired the banks. 
In June, Capital One announced plans to acquire the ING Group's online banking unit in the United States for $6.2 billion in cash. Under the terms of the deal, Capital One would also issue $2.8 billion worth of new shares to ING, giving the bank a 9.9 percent stake.
The deal would make Capital One the fifth-biggest bank in the United States, up from its current No. 8 ranking. The institutions together would have more than $200 billion in deposits, raising questions about the potential ensuing risks to the economy.
Talk of systemic risk is a pressure point for regulators. Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, the Fed must examine whether major bank mergers would endanger the economy. When the risks outweigh the rewards, the Fed must block the deal.
"The benefits of consolidation and growth in the banking industry have been thoroughly rejected," Reverend Jesse Jackson told the Fed at the hearing. Mr. Jackson also raised concerns about Capital One's relationship with low-income consumers. "Judge by promises kept, not made," Mr. Jackson told the Fed.
Mr. Finneran, of Capital One, drew distinctions between the bank and its Wall Street competitors. Unlike Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase, he said, Capital One is focused on lending and deposits rather than complex financial engineering. 
"At its core, Capital One has a very simple and traditional banking business model," Mr. Finneran said. "It is clear that this acquisition will not result in greater risk to our financial system."

HEADLINE: A Perfectly Civil Encounter Between an Activist and a Lawyer

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The activist investor Barry Rosenstein met Martin Lipton, the father of corporate defense strategies, for the first time on Tuesday and sparks definitely did not fly. 

 BODY:
Anyone expecting to see sparks fly when the activist investor Barry Rosenstein met Martin Lipton, the father of corporate defense strategies, for the first time on Tuesday might have mistaken the pair seated onstage as a jovial father-son pair. 
Mr. Lipton, whose firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz is synonymous with fighting off activist investors trying to upend companies, called his fellow panelist at the Bloomberg Dealmakers Summit "brilliant." Mr. Rosenstein, the head of Jana Partners, a hedge fund known for taking activist positions against the very companies Mr. Lipton defends, including most recently McGraw-Hill, told him that it was "an honor" to share the stage with him in Midtown Manhattan.
There was reason to think such an encounter might have gone differently. The two men are on opposing sides of nearly every professional action they take. Indeed, they even looked different. Mr. Lipton, dressed in a light gray suit with a navy-and-white-dotted tie and matching pocket square, epitomized old-school legal professional. Mr. Rosenstein, wearing a dark tailored suit with his shirt open to the third button, exuded a air of casual slickness.
 Mr. Lipton, of course, was not shy about his thoughts on activists. He asserted that the worst of them try to extract short-term wins to the detriment not only of target companies but to the economy as a whole -- particularly when companies are unable to think about long-term strategic planning because of short-term pressure to appease shareholders. 
"The difficulty with activists is not when Barry sends a letter or announces he's acquired a position," said Mr. Lipton, who spoke in a gravely voice. "It's whether activist pressure for short-term performance is desirable in our economy."
Such a laserlike focus on the short term, Mr. Lipton asserted, may have even prevented new medicines from emerging from pharmaceutical companies that slashed research and development budgets following shareholder pressure to increase stock prices.
Mr. Rosenstein, for his part, said Jana focused primarily on companies that had struggled to perform in both the short term and long term. He mentioned his most recent campaign against McGraw-Hill, which announced plans this month to break up. He said McGraw-Hill was a prime example of a company that was underperforming the market and its peers on a sustained basis.
"I felt like I was in a time warp, like Michael J. Fox in the '80s," he joked. "There were clear steps that this company needed to take."
Mr. Lipton interrupted his fellow panelist for a moment to say he could not talk about McGraw-Hill because his firm represented the company.
The two continued the back and forth in a perfectly civil way, with Mr. Lipton noting that Mr. Rosenstein's firm tended to be a more thoughtful activist investor, offering substantive suggestions that he will advise companies that hire him to hear out. Others, he said, like the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn, whom Mr. Lipton has sparred with for three decades, are merely opportunistic players looking to make a quick buck.
Mr. Rosenstein then paid Mr. Lipton the greatest compliment of the roughly half-hour panel.
"I would not be an activist on Wachtell," he said with a smile.

HEADLINE: I'd Rather Be an Unlucky Ducky

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Why would anyone want to pay taxes, an economist asks. 

 BODY:
During Thursday's Fox News debate among Republican presidential candidates, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was asked how much money people should be allowed to keep from their earnings. Here was her response, from a transcript of the event:
I think you earned every dollar. You should get to keep every dollar that you earn. That's your money. That's not the government's money. That's the whole point. Barack Obama seems to think that when we earn money, it belongs to him, and we're lucky just to keep a little bit of it. I don't think that at all. I think when people make money, it's their money.
Her response drew applause and cheers. While she acknowledged that some money needed to be given back to the government, the thrust of her comment was that taxation is essentially theft and the best government is one in which taxes are virtually nonexistent. None of the other candidates for the G.O.P. nomination disputed her view, during or after the debate.
I'm not saying that Republicans are anarchists, only that when it comes to taxes they talk as if they are. Their default position is that there is no level of taxation below which it would be unwise to go, no tax cut too large not to be taken seriously and no justification for a government any larger than one that could be drowned in a bathtub, as the Republican activist Grover Norquist once put it. The Wall Street Journal editorial page routinely refers to those who pay no taxes as "lucky duckies," as if zero taxation is the ideal state of nature.

Oddly, one never hears Republicans praise those countries where people are lucky duckies -- those where taxation is a small fraction of what it is here. Let's take a look at some of the places.
Equatorial Guinea: According to the Republican-leaning Heritage Foundation, those who live in this small country in sub-Saharan Africa are lucky duckies indeed. Because of recently discovered oil deposits, the citizens of Equatorial Guinea pay less than 1 percent of the gross domestic product in taxes. The comparable figure for the United States is 26.9 percent of G.D.P., according to Heritage.
However, Equatorial Guinea doesn't seem to be a very pleasant place to live. The people are poor and have little freedom. Heritage says that "persistent institutional weaknesses impede creation of a more vibrant private sector" and "the rule of law is weak." This sounds suspiciously as if government is too small to do its job properly. But I'm sure that the citizens of Equatorial Guinea don't mind having a dysfunctional government; after all, they're lucky duckies.
Myanmar: The people who live in this small country in Southeast Asia are also lucky duckies, if not quite as lucky as those in Equatorial Guinea. According to Heritage, taxes in Myanmar are 3 percent of G.D.P.
Oddly, this also doesn't sound like someplace one would want to live. Heritage says "longstanding structural problems include poor public finance management and undeveloped legal and regulatory frameworks." Apparently, the government doesn't protect property rights very well, the infrastructure is poor, and there is a lot of corruption. But at least the people get to keep almost all their earnings.
Libya: Why the people revolted in this North African fiscal paradise is a mystery. According to Heritage, government revenues are just 3.4 percent of G.D.P.
Chad: Heritage says the people of this African nation pay just 5.3 percent of G.D.P. in taxes. But for some reason, the nation is mired in poverty. Perhaps because, as Heritage says, "the efficiency and quality of government remain poor." I wonder why.
Republic of Congo: The people of this country in Africa also pay 5.3 percent of G.D.P. to the government. But it is also very poor. Heritage says a key reason is "the government has failed to provide basic public goods and infrastructure." This doesn't really make much sense by the logic of Republican candidates, who seem to agree that all government spending is bad unless it goes to the Defense Department and that public works are nothing but worthless pork.
I could go on, but I'm sure everyone gets the point. Low taxes and small government are not the keys to prosperity. If they were, these five countries and many others where taxes as a share of G.D.P. are in the single digits would be magnets for immigration and investment.
Of course, there are a few countries in the Middle East with lots of oil where taxes are low and the quality of life isn't so bad. But they tend to be choosy about whom they grant citizenship to, and they often enforce Islamic law. But who cares? The important thing is that you will be lucky duckies.
Personally, I would rather live in Denmark, where taxes are a confiscatory 49 percent of G.D.P., according to Heritage, but where the government works and people have considerably more business, trade, investment and financial freedom than in the United States, according to Heritage. It also says that the Danes have more secure property rights and freedom from corruption than Americans do.
For that, I think it would be worth being an unlucky ducky.

HEADLINE: The Toll of Politics on Well-Being

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Injecting politics into pollsters' questioning produces increased levels of stress and anger when respondents discuss their own lives, an economist's study finds. 

 BODY:
With Americans' confidence in government at historic lows, it may not be surprising to learn that people are so fed up with politicians and politics that even talking about them makes people feel worse about their lives.
 That's one of the conclusions of a new study, "The Financial Crisis and the Well-Being of Americans," by Angus Deaton, an economist at Princeton University. In the working paper, issued by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Mr. Deaton examines data from the Gallup Organization, which polls people on how they feel about various aspects of well-being, including their level of happiness, stress and anger and whether they are satisfied with their standard of living.
 One of the intriguing findings is that the order in which Gallup posed questions affected the way people reported these various measures of well-being.
 When the pollsters asked questions about respondents' plans to vote, their preferred candidates, their approval ratings of the president's performance and whether the country was headed in the right direction, the respondents reported increased levels of stress and anger.
 "People appear to dislike politics and politicians so much that prompting them to think about them has a very large downward effect on their assessment of their own lives," Mr. Deaton reported. In fact, he wrote, "the effect of asking the political questions on well-being is only a little less than the effect of someone becoming unemployed."
 On the other hand, there were some unexplained spikes in people's assessment of their well-being. One of the largest increases came on April 6, 2009, a day that did not stand out for its obvious contribution to happiness or standard of living. Perhaps you can find a rationale in the main events of the day: there was an earthquake in L'Aquila in Italy, Robert Gates announced the military budget and Carrie Underwood won a Country Music Award.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Companies to Invest $4 Billion in New York State, Cuomo Says

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: I.B.M. and four other technology companies agreed to pour $4 billion into computer-chip research in New York, promising to hire thousands of workers and giving a major boost to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as he campaigns for companies to invest in the state and create jobs. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - I.B.M., Intel and three other technology companies agreed Tuesday to pour $4 billion into computer-chip research in New York, promising to hire thousands of workers and giving a major boost to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as he campaigns for companies to invest in the state and create jobs.
Mr. Cuomo, sounding downright giddy as he kicked off an economic development conference here, heralded the investment as a "really, really big deal" that proved that New York, especially upstate, could lure new investment from major corporations flush with potential suitors.

His announcement came as former President Bill Clinton, whom Mr. Cuomo served as housing secretary, made an appearance at the conference and urged business leaders and local officials to embrace environmentally friendly technology and new industries as they try to create jobs.
The computer-chip investment deal will also include Samsung, GlobalFoundries and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The governor's office said it would create 2,500 high-technology jobs and 1,900 construction jobs, and would also preserve 2,500 existing jobs.
"I think it's important to remember, as we start this conference - a better affirmation of our potential you could not have," Mr. Cuomo said. "These companies could have gone anywhere on the globe."
Over the past two decades, New York State has invested heavily in the burgeoning nanotechnology industry, primarily in the capital region. Mr. Cuomo and others have highlighted the effort as a model for regional economic development in the economically depressed upstate region.
The state will spend $400 million over five years as part of the new research deal. The money will go toward expanding the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany, and the investment by the technology companies will go toward creating jobs in Albany, Yorktown Heights, East Fishkill, Utica and Canandaigua.
Mr. Cuomo and other lawmakers said they hoped that the new research and development activities would lead to the construction of chip plants in several years, creating many more jobs, and would also serve as an example to other companies that New York was increasingly attractive to major corporations seeking to invest in research and high-technology manufacturing facilities.
"It's huge for the message, and it's huge for the jobs that go with it," the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who has been a booster of the nanotechnology sector in the capital region, said in an interview.
The semiconductor deal was promptly overshadowed on Tuesday by the news that the second-largest union of state workers had rejected their labor agreement with Mr. Cuomo. But before that, its announcement created a mood of triumph at the capital, where the governor had summoned members of 10 regional councils that he appointed to compete for state economic-development funding.
Mr. Clinton's visit only added to the festive mood, as Mr. Cuomo joked about picking up a southern accent from working under Mr. Clinton, and his staff cued a brief slideshow of old photos showing the governor, with noticeably darker hair, working alongside Mr. Clinton when he was president.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton, citing San Diego's success with biotechnology and the computer simulation business in Orlando, Fla., suggested that the capital region could similarly exploit its nanotechnology industry to turn around its economic fortunes.
Mr. Clinton focused mostly on giving economic-development tips: he particularly encouraged pursuing jobs related to clean energy sources and retrofitting buildings to be more energy-efficient. But he also offered a dollop of praise for the governor and lawmakers for their handling of the state's budget gap last winter, suggesting that Mr. Cuomo's fiscal stewardship would help encourage businesses to invest here.
"I travel all over America and all over the world, and the confidence people have in New York outside this state has exploded just because the government did its job," Mr. Clinton said. "They showed up, passed the budget on time, didn't raise taxes - it's an amazing, amazing thing for you."

HEADLINE: A $50 Billion Claim of Havoc Looms for Bank of America

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A lawsuit by Bank of America shareholders is proceeding that claims the bank and its executives failed to disclose a $15.3 billion loss at Merrill Lynch before its acquisition. 

 BODY:
Bank of America's potential liability for bad mortgages - in the tens of billions of dollars - is well known. But Bank of America is haunted by other demons from the financial crisis, the most significant one being a lawsuit arising from its troubled Merrill Lynch acquisition.
This lawsuit, brought by Bank of America shareholders, claims that Bank of America and its executives, including its former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, failed to disclose what would be a $15.31 billion loss at Merrill in the days before and after the acquisition. The plaintiffs contend that this staggering loss was hidden to ensure that Bank of America shareholders did not vote against the transaction.
 Bank of America disclosed this loss after Merrill was acquired. At the same time, Bank of America also disclosed a $20 billion bailout by the government. The bank's stock fell by more than 60 percent in a two-week period, a market value loss of more than $50 billion.
This episode also spawned a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bank of America, Mr. Lewis and Joseph Price, the former chief financial officer, settled for $150 million. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan approved the deal but complained that it didn't sufficiently penalize the individuals involved. The amount was paid by Bank of America with no liability for Mr. Lewis or Mr. Price. Judge Rakoff called the settlement "half-baked justice at best."
Judge Rakoff may see his wish for greater penalties granted. The New York attorney general's office has a lawsuit on the matter.
More significantly, a lawsuit seeking about $50 billion was brought by some of the largest class-action law firms and is quietly advancing in the Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The plaintiffs contend that Bank of America engaged in a deliberate effort to deceive the bank's shareholders.
According to the plaintiffs, who include the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and a Netherlands pension plan that is the second-largest in Europe, Bank of America's senior management, including Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, began to learn of large losses at Merrill Lynch in early November 2008, months before the deal closed.
Mr. Price met with the bank's general counsel, Timothy J. Mayopoulos, to discuss whether to disclose the loss - at the time about $5 billion - to Bank of America shareholders. Mr. Mayopoulos testified to the New York attorney general's office that while his initial reaction was that disclosure was warranted, he decided against it. Merrill had been losing $2.1 billion to $9.8 billion a quarter during the financial crisis, and so this loss would be expected by Merrill and Bank of America shareholders.
Plaintiffs in the private action and the New York attorney general's complaint claim that after this meeting, Mr. Price and other senior executives at Bank of America sought to keep this loss quiet and that Mr. Price in particular misled Mr. Mayopoulos.
Mr. Mayopoulos has testified that on Dec. 3, 2008, Mr. Price told him that the estimated loss would be $7 billion.
Mr. Mayopoulos concluded again that no disclosure was necessary. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Price misled Mr. Mayopoulos as the forecasted loss at this time had now grown to more than $10 billion.
The Bank of America vote occurred on Dec. 5 without its shareholders knowing about this gigantic looming Merrill loss, which was now about $11 billion.
Mr. Mayopoulos has testified he was surprised at this higher number when he learned of it at a Dec. 9 board meeting. Mr. Mayopoulos sought to meet with Mr. Price about the new loss. The next day, Mr. Mayopoulos was fired and escorted out of the building.
The Merrill acquisition was completed on Jan. 1, 2009.
Two weeks later, Bank of America disclosed for the first time that Merrill had suffered an after-tax net loss of $15.31 billion.
Bank of America has argued in its defense that the exact amount of the loss was uncertain during this time. Moreover, this disclosure was not necessary because Merrill's losses were within the range of previous losses and included a good will write-off of about $2 billion that was previously disclosed. The total loss was not material.
But if it is true that Mr. Price, with Mr. Lewis's assent, kept this information from Mr. Mayopoulos in order to avoid disclosure, this is a prima facie case of securities fraud. Would Bank of America shareholders have voted to approve this transaction? If the answer is no, then it is hard to see this as anything other than material information.
Plaintiffs in this private case have the additional benefit that this claim is related to a shareholder vote. It is easier to prove securities fraud related to a shareholder vote than more typical securities fraud claims like accounting fraud. Shareholder vote claims do not require that the plaintiffs prove that the person committing securities fraud did so with awareness that the statement was wrong or otherwise recklessly made. You only need to show that the person should have acted with care.
This case is not only easier to establish, but the potential damages could also be enormous. Damages in a claim like this are calculated by looking at the amount lost as a result of the securities fraud. A court will most likely calculate this by referencing the amount that Bank of America stock dropped after the loss was announced; this is as much as $50 billion. It is a plaintiff's lawyer's dream.
Bank of America is facing a huge liability from this claim. It is also facing even more liability for those who bought and sold stock during this period up until Jan. 15. In a ruling on July 29, the judge in this case allowed these claims to proceed against Bank of America, Mr. Price and Mr. Lewis. The judge had already ruled that the disclosure claim related to the proxy vote could proceed.
This case is on a relatively fast track, with an October 2012 trial date.
Given the $50 billion claim looming over it, Bank of America will most likely try to settle this litigation. The settlement value appears to be in the billions. Firing your main witness - Mr. Mayopoulos - and escorting him out the door no doubt only increases the cost.
The case shows how regulators' actions can be supplemented by private actions. And if the plaintiffs win, this case may be the exceedingly rare event of directors and officers, particularly Mr. Lewis and Mr. Price, actually having to pay money personally to settle a securities fraud claim. If so, the two men would join the relatively few executives from the financial crisis who have been personally penalized.
Whatever the outcome of this case, it appears that Bank of America shareholders were sacrificed in December 2008 so that the Merrill deal could be completed. The bill may now be coming due for Bank of America.

HEADLINE: Survey Sees Major Expansion of World's Data Centers

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
The next great expansion of the world's digital infrastructure is under way in developing markets like those of China, Brazil and Argentina, according to a global census of the industry released on Monday.
Despite growing concerns of a global economic slowdown, the companies that construct and operate data centers that run the Internet and store vast amounts of corporate and government data expect growth next year to match levels last seen in the world economy's boom years: about 19 percent.
The census focused on data centers, the buildings and complexes filled with the computers that operate the Internet, store and process e-mail, preserve medical records, carry out Web searches and perform countless other tasks for corporations, governments and other organizations. The London-based company that released the results, DatacenterDynamics, said it conducted some 5,400 interviews this year with industry officials around the world. Those officials are responsible for about 100,000 data centers, the company said. 
The officials interviewed cited the cost and availability of energy for their power-hungry computers as their top concern in planning future operations. Such energy concerns were driving them to design more efficient data centers.
But the predicted shift away from the Western United States, and out of the United States entirely, may also be related to those concerns. The census, which expressed its results in energy use, showed a projected increase of 46 percent in China over the next year.
''Imagine what might happen when India and China get the pedal to the metal in terms of data center growth and the effect that will have upon global energy consumption in the sector,'' said George Rockett, a co-founder of DatacenterDynamics.
The company said that projections of brisk growth in the Nordic countries could be partly a result of the availability of renewable energy there.
The findings received mixed reviews from other experts in the field. Jonathan G. Koomey, a consulting professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at Stanford University, pointed out that the projected growth rates were ''self-reported'' -- estimated by the companies themselves rather than by outside analysts, who would presumably be more objective.
A study that Mr. Koomey released in July indicated that while power consumption by data centers doubled from 2000 to 2005, it grew at a much slower pace in the next five years. He cited cutbacks caused by the recession and more efficient computing facilities as contributing factors.
Still, if the new figures are correct, they suggest that the industry is recovering its footing, he said.
''We just had the greatest economic shock since the Great Depression,'' Mr. Koomey said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if people started investing in facilities again.''
Although the census found minuscule growth in power consumption by data centers in the Western United States in 2012, it did predict growth in the Eastern United States of some 22 percent. James Coakley, president and chief executive of Power Loft Services in Manassas, Va., said that the large projections were ''hard to believe'' given current vacancy rates in data centers. ''I do not see the surge of demand that would produce that amount of growth -- at least not here in the U.S.,'' Mr. Coakley said.
Mark Bramfitt, a data center consultant and former California utility official, said he doubted that the pattern of data center growth would increase so quickly in the East, while sinking in the West, where it all began. ''Doesn't feel right at both ends,'' Mr. Bramfitt said.
DatacenterDynamics said, however, that it took great pains to avoid statistical anomalies like double-counting that could inflate the results.

HEADLINE: Researching the Sneeze and How to Handle It

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE paper products aisle generally is not seasonal, with consumers using about the same amount of toilet paper, napkins or paper towels every month. But not so with facial tissue: as cold and flu season rears its congested head, monthly sales increase as much as 65 percent over the summer months.
Generally that surge is good news for Kleenex, the Kimberly-Clark brand that invented facial tissue 87 years ago. But both Kleenex and Puffs, a Procter & Gamble brand, lost market share during the economic downturn to cheaper store brands. 
In the 52 weeks that ended on June 13, 2010, for example, Kleenex sales dropped 5.5 percent from the previous year, and Puffs, a Procter & Gamble brand, dropped 3.2 percent, while store brands climbed 6.4 percent, according to SymphonyIRI Group data, which does not include Wal-Mart.
Now Kleenex has something it claims is a first: Along with lotion, Kleenex Cool Touch contains ingredients that promise cooling relief to sore noses. A Cool Touch commercial -- by JWT New York, part of the WPP Group -- is scheduled to be introduced Monday, and the campaign will include print and online advertising as well as social media marketing.
''This really is a game-changing innovation,'' said Craig Smith, the brand director for Kleenex. ''This is the only tissue that releases a cool sensation, and it takes soothing to a whole different level.''
Kleenex, which declined to reveal how much it will spend on the campaign, spent $51.9 million on advertising in 2010, compared with $29.5 million by Puffs, according to Kantar Media, a division of WPP.
Soon after being introduced in 1924 as a ''sanitary cold cream remover'' for women, who had tended to reuse towels for that purpose, a Kimberly-Clark researcher with hay fever began using Kleenex tissues for his sniffles, and advertising soon declared them ''the handkerchief for health.''
Internal Kleenex research indicates that softness is the most important quality for 84 percent of facial tissue purchasers, but the company and its competitors still pursue other innovations to stand out on the shelf.
Puffs, for example, which began in 1960, introduced Puffs Plus with lotion in the United States in 1987, and Kleenex responded with its first lotion tissue in 1996.
In 2004, Kleenex introduced antiviral tissues, which promise to contain germs from sneezes better than conventional tissues.
And P&G in 2007 introduced Puffs Plus with the Scent of Vicks, a lotion-infused facial tissue that smells like menthol, with the selling point being not that Vicks helps comfort skin but rather that it has a comforting smell.
Kleenex Cool Touch, in contrast, is unscented. Among households that use facial tissue, 89 percent buy unscented varieties, while only 19 percent buy scented varieties, according to Mintel, a market research firm.
''We find that scent quite frankly is polarizing, with some who really enjoy it and some who don't,'' said Tracy Buelow, the Kleenex brand manager. ''When consumers are doing excessive wiping, they get what they term a 'hot, sore nose,' and while cooling tissues counteract that hot and burning feeling, scent doesn't address that need.''
After two consecutive years of declining revenue and market share, Kleenex has been bouncing back over the last year. While revenue for the over all facial tissue category is slightly down, by 0.6 percent, Kleenex is up 1.3 percent, having apparently drawn customers not from Puffs, whose revenue is virtually unchanged, but from private labels, whose revenue is down 4 percent, according to SymphonyIRI data for the 52 weeks that ended Sept. 4.
Kleenex has a 47.1 percent share of the facial tissue market, followed by Puffs, with 24.9 percent, and private labels, with 22.3 percent.
The brand attributes some of its growth to a marketing effort during flu season last year called Softness Worth Sharing. By going to Kleenex.com, or through in-store promotions, consumers could sign up to send a free purse pack of 10 tissues to friends or family, who were encouraged to do the same for others.
About one million packets of tissues were sent, and the promotion may have resonated with consumers better than simply mailing samples to designated ZIP codes or handing them out in Costco.
Writing in the Euromonitor Global Market Research Blog in May, Ian Bell, who heads tissue and hygiene research at Euromonitor, said, ''The nature of the initiative serves to turn the tissue product into a gift worth sharing, raising the product above commodity status, and adding emotion to the promotion that could never be achieved if people were simply ordering samples for themselves.''
Mr. Bell added, ''When consumers make a gift of the product to friends or family members it could well foster a stronger relationship between the consumer and the brand simply because of the feel-good nature of the promotion.''
A second Softness Worth Sharing program begins Saturday; this flu season, consumers who sign up to send packets of standard Kleenex will themselves receive a packet of the new Cool Touch variety.
Facial tissues are used in 70 percent of households, according to Mintel, and Mr. Smith, of Kleenex, believes that Cool Touch is an innovation that will draw consumers from other brands and also win over some who thought toilet tissue or paper napkins suited their noses fine.
''This will drive Kleenex's growth and draw new people into the category,'' Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: State Workers' Union Rejects Contract, Risking 3,500 Layoffs

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Danny Hakim contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The second-largest union of New York State employees has rejected a package of wage and benefits concessions negotiated by the Cuomo administration, blowing a hole in the state budget that could now prompt the largest wave of layoffs in two decades.
The union, the Public Employees Federation, which represents 56,000 state workers, announced on Tuesday that its members had voted 54 percent to 46 percent against the five-year contract in mail-in voting over the last several weeks. Nearly 70 percent of the membership cast ballots, officials said.
The labor pact, reached in July, would have imposed a three-year freeze on wages and higher health insurance costs in return for protection from broad layoffs for two years. That deal was virtually the same one that the largest union of state workers, the Civil Service Employees Association, approved in its own vote last month.
The president of the Public Employees Federation, Kenneth Brynien, said union members were ready to make sacrifices given the state's shaky fiscal condition. But he said a majority of workers concluded Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was not being reasonable in the concessions that he sought. 
''The cuts that are demanded of them in this tentative agreement were just too many, and they cut too deep,'' Mr. Brynien said at a news conference in Manhattan on Tuesday. ''The sacrifices were too great, and they said, 'Enough is enough.' ''
The labor vote roiled the capital, where Mr. Cuomo's aides waited barely two hours before announcing that they planned to proceed with laying off 3,500 workers. The administration said it would begin notifying most of those employees on Wednesday. The layoffs would amount to the largest wave of job cuts since the early 1990s, when Mr. Cuomo's father, Mario M. Cuomo, was governor.
''In this economic reality, rising state work force costs are unsustainable,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. Referring to federation members, he added, ''I urge them to reconsider.''
Mr. Cuomo's advisers made clear that they believed Mr. Brynien and other union leaders were to blame for the rejection of the agreement. Howard B. Glaser, the director of state operations, said in a statement that the vote represented ''a failure by P.E.F.'s leadership to effectively communicate the benefits of the contract to its members.''
''Layoffs could still be avoided,'' Mr. Glaser said, ''if P.E.F. clearly articulates to its members the benefits of the contract as well as the consequences of rejection and schedules a revote.''
Labor leaders spent the past several months trying to convince state workers that the concessions, including the first-ever furloughs and a requirement that workers pay a larger share of their health insurance premiums, were worth accepting in order to win some protection from layoffs. They were seeking to avoid the same fate as their union counterparts in Connecticut, where state workers in June rejected a labor deal, prompting a budget crisis.
Mr. Cuomo's budget, approved by lawmakers last winter, relied on $450 million in so-called work force savings. The governor said he would achieve those savings either through labor negotiations or broad layoffs, giving him significant leverage in his talks with workers fearful of losing their jobs.
But some federation members were vocal in their criticism of the tentative agreement, which they said was overly painful and did not provide strong enough layoff protections in return for the concessions. Wages were to be frozen for the first three years of the pact, with raises of 2 percent in each of the following two years; the protections from layoffs would evaporate after the first two years.
Mr. Brynien gave another example of what many union members considered an unfairness: the governor's refusal during the legislative session this year to seek the extension of a temporary income tax surcharge on high-earning residents. That position put Mr. Cuomo at odds with other Democrats and labor.
''The state should not be demanding this level of sacrifice from us while it's not demanding those same sacrifices from the wealthiest New Yorkers,'' he said.
On the union's Facebook page on Tuesday, some workers reacted to the vote by applauding their fellow union members for standing up to what they saw as mistreatment from Mr. Cuomo. Others said they were outraged that a majority had voted to reject the contract knowing that jobs were at risk.
''I knew it would be close; I didn't know which way it would go,'' Kathy D'Arminio, council leader of Division 399, a branch of the federation in Binghamton, said in an interview. ''I think people were unhappy with a five-year contract, people were unhappy with the furlough days. And the insurance premiums were another biggie.''
''I think we need to get together and decide where we're going to go,'' she added. ''We want to get back to the table as soon as possible.''
Several hundred federation members were only days away from being laid off when the union reached its tentative agreement with the governor in July.
But the layoff threat from Mr. Cuomo did not appear particularly intimidating to all federation members, many of whom hold white-collar jobs and tend to be more highly paid than the members of the Civil Service Employees Association.
''They looked at it and said, why should I give up anything, and that's a fairly compelling argument if you don't care about the people losing their jobs,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a research group that favors reduced government spending.
Mr. McMahon said he was not surprised that federation members rejected the contract, because state law locks in incremental pay increases after a public contract expires and before a new one is agreed upon. Preserving the status quo also locks in other aspects of the current contract, which expired at the end of March. And for the most part, he said, workers have a sense of whether their own jobs are at risk.
''They all know where they are in the pecking order,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''They have a pretty good idea who's going to lose their job, and most of them can say it's not going to be me.''
Mr. Brynien said he had asked Mr. Cuomo and his negotiators to return to the bargaining table and awaited their response. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, struck a note of sympathy with the union, saying that he hoped a resolution could be reached between the administration and the union.
''I do not wish to see layoffs,'' Mr. Silver said in an interview. ''I would hope that something can be accomplished in avoiding those layoffs.''

HEADLINE: Low Consumer Confidence Suggests Hiring Is Still Weak

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Confidence among the nation's consumers stagnated near a two-year low in September, and the share of households that said it was difficult to find a job climbed to the highest level in almost three decades, a research group said on Tuesday. 
The group, the Conference Board, said its sentiment index increased to 45.4 from a revised August reading of 45.2, which was the lowest since April 2009. A report on home prices showed values dropped less than had been forecast in the year ended in July.
The confidence reading signals that hiring has not improved since August, when the economy failed to create jobs and the unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent. Falling stock prices and concern that the crisis in Europe will undermine the global recovery may also be shaking Americans' resolve, raising the risk that spending will cool during the holiday shopping season.
''Consumers remain very concerned about income, employment and the state of the economy,'' said John Herrmann, a senior fixed-income strategist at State Street Global Markets in Boston. ''All of these factors point to even weaker labor market conditions as we get closer to the end of the year.''
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 4.1 percent in July compared with the same month in 2010, the group said. The median forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had projected a 4.4 percent decline. Values were little changed in July from the prior month after adjusting for seasonal changes,.
Investigations into bank foreclosure practices caused lags in processing that may have helped stabilize prices in recent months, said Celia Chen, a housing economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa.
''Due to foreclosure processing delays, fewer distressed sales are occurring relative to normal sales,'' Ms. Chen said. ''With more distressed homes likely to be sold in coming months, house prices will depreciate further before they stabilize.''
Economists expected that the Conference Board's September confidence gauge would climb to 46, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged from 40 to 49 in the survey of 74 economists. The index averaged 98 during the economic expansion that ended in December 2007.
The Conference Board's data showed a measure of present conditions declined to 32.5, the lowest since January, from 34.3 in August. The measure of expectations for the next six months rose to 54 from 52.4.
The share of consumers who said jobs were hard to get increased to 50, the highest level since May 1983, from 48.5 in August. That may signal a worsening of the September employment data.
Confidence dropped in six of nine regions, according to the report.
The percentage of respondents in the Conference Board survey expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months rose to 12 percent from 11.8 the previous month.
The proportion expecting their incomes to rise over the next six months decreased to 13.3 percent, the lowest since October, from 14.3 in August.

HEADLINE: Start-Up in California Plans to Capture Lithium, and Market Share

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A start-up company will announce on Wednesday that it is beginning commercial operations at a factory in Southern California to capture lithium from existing geothermal energy plants, a technology it says has the potential to turn the United States into a major lithium exporter.
The plant, built by Simbol Materials near the Salton Sea in the Imperial Valley, will also capture manganese and zinc. 
None of the materials that Simbol plans to produce are so-called rare earths, but a study by the American Physical Society in February identified lithium and zinc as likely to be very important in the new energy economy of the future. The society considers them ''energy critical elements.''
Lithium is a crucial element for batteries that power electric cars, and manganese is used in batteries and in specialty metal production. The United States imports much of its lithium and does not produce any manganese at all.
The company, based in Pleasanton, Calif., will piggyback on an existing geothermal plant that makes electricity by pumping hot water from deep underground and using its heat to make steam to drive a turbine. Then it re-injects the water into the ground. The ''water'' is actually a very strong brine, composed of about 30 percent dissolved salts, according to Luka Erceg, Simbol's co-founder and chief executive.
''When we looked into the brine resource, what we found was not only lithium, but manganese, zinc and about half the periodic table of the elements,'' said Mr. Erceg, referring to it as ''a smorgasbord of products.''
At this point, he said, the only ones that make good economic sense to recover are the lithium, manganese and zinc.
Extracting lithium from brine is a standard way to produce the metal. The only American lithium producer, Chemetall Foote, in Clayton Valley, Nev., makes the material by pumping brine into ponds and waiting months for the water to evaporate. Two other companies have announced plans to produce lithium in Nevada using the more conventional method of evaporation.
Simbol officials say they have developed a proprietary filtering process that takes minutes and will be located on piping that is a minor detour for brine that the geothermal energy company is pumping anyway. Costs are low enough to compete in the world market, company officials say, and environmental impacts are small since the geothermal plant is already in operation.
Robert L. Jaffe, a physics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the co-author of the American Physical Society report, said that extraction of lithium with a filtration system would be a new development, and that it remained to be seen if lithium could be captured that way at a price that would be competitive with the big producers in Chile and Argentina.
The plant will process 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of water a minute, and in the same period will produce 10 to 20 gallons of salts that include the marketable metals. Since last October, Simbol has been running a modest pilot plant that filters about 20 gallons a minute, Professor Jaffe said. The brine from the Salton Sea contains lithium in a concentration of 200 to 400 parts per million, and the extraction technology is about 93 percent efficient, he said.
The biggest lithium producers are Chile, Australia, China and Argentina. The element is used in metals, pharmaceuticals and, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, which would be a major source of demand for lithium if electric cars or plug-in hybrids became popular.
The future of the automotive battery market remains uncertain. President Obama set a 2015 goal of one million plug-in vehicles, which would include pure electrics as well as hybrids, but industry executives say they think the target will not be reached by then. The Chevy Volt and the Nissan Leaf went on sale this year, but sales so far are in only the low thousands. Worldwide sales could be far higher, but that is not certain yet either.
At the World Energy Council, a London-based trade association of energy producers, Stuart Neil, a spokesman, said that lithium was not as critical as materials like neodymium, but that ''if the amount of lithium available on the market increases, this should lower cost and therefore has the potential to increase the penetration rate of electric vehicles.''

HEADLINE: Europe Readies Plan for Tax On Financial Transactions

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is expected to unveil a detailed plan on Wednesday to create a financial transaction tax, despite the opposition of several member countries and a formal acknowledgement that it could have a significant negative effect on the European Union's gross domestic product. 
The plan, which has the strong support of France and Germany, will be discussed in a speech before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, by Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
The measure will probably include taxes on the purchase of stocks and bonds; derivatives will probably be taxed at a lower rate. Transactions on the currency markets are not expected to be included.
Critics are expected to highlight a formal study regarding the proposal's economic effects.
''With a tax rate of 0.1 percent, the model shows a drop in G.D.P. (minus 1.76 percent) in the long run,'' according to a draft of the plan.
One European Union official, who asked not to be identified because the proposal had not been published, said the actual effect would be less significant, because the assumptions used in the final proposal differed from those in an impact study.
He also suggested that the tax rate proposed on at least some transactions might be lower than 0.1 percent, and that the proposal would exempt the purchase of stocks and bonds when they were first issued. The impact study had assumed the tax applied to all transactions, he said.
Nevertheless, the proposal is highly divisive. France and Germany see it as a method of requiring the financial sector to provide compensation for some of the damage sustained in the economic crisis. They also think the tax can help deter more speculative transactions, which may provide little benefit to the real economy.
''The basic idea is that taxes could improve financial sector stability and the functioning of the market,'' the draft proposal says.
But Sweden and Britain are among those in opposition, saying that unless the levy can be adopted globally, the measure will simply drive financial institutions away from the European Union.
Prospects of a global deal were quashed earlier this month when the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told European finance ministers he would not agree to such a tax in the United States.
After Mr. Geithner's comments, Belgium's finance minister, Didier Reynders, called for Europeans to press ahead with their own proposal, perhaps including only the 17 nations that use the euro, if all 27 members of the European Union could not agree. If a euro zone agreement is impossible, a smaller group of countries could go ahead with their own low-level tax.
