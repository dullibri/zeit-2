HEADLINE: Midtown's Biggest Fans May Be Foreign Buyers

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
FOR many of New York's real estate players, Labor Day weekend was not the usual end-of-summer respite. The subprime mortgage woes had spread from the residential market to other areas, freezing credit, prompting layoffs at financial companies and threatening to derail the highflying Manhattan commercial market. 
 The extent of the damage -- which stemmed from years of easy credit extended to high-risk, or subprime, borrowers -- will become clearer as the market shakes out in coming months. But there is some reason for optimism: The credit crunch is likely to bring a much-needed break for an overheated market. What's more, it paves the way for a new class of deep-pocketed investors who have, until recently, watched the action from the sidelines.
 In particular, foreign investors who, buoyed by the strong economies and currencies in their own countries, now see an opportunity to scoop up coveted Manhattan real estate. 
 ''The global capital markets are flush with strong currency buyers who see our shores as a relative bargain,'' said Douglas Harmon, the senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, a real estate investment bank based in New York. 
 Foreign investors, according to Mr. Harmon and others in the industry, are generally more conservative in their financing, putting up more cash and relying less on debt. They also tend to be longer-term investors. By contrast, big domestic buyers, including the Blackstone Group, Tishman Speyer and Harry Macklowe, have used heavy levels of debt -- up to 95 percent of the purchase price, in some cases -- and relied on a steep increase in real estate prices and rents to justify the deals. 
 Foreign investment has picked up sharply. In May, there was the $1.18 billion sale of the Deutsche Bank building at 60 Wall Street to the Paramount Group of Germany. 
 In June, the Italian real estate investor Luigi Zunino made a foray into the New York market with the purchase of 660 Madison Avenue, the stylish office tower atop Barneys New York, for $375 million. At $1,488 a square foot, according to Mr. Harmon, it set a record for Manhattan commercial real estate. The deal, which closed on Aug. 30, was leveraged at a more modest 70 percent, with Deutsche Bank providing the financing, according to Mr. Harmon, who was the exclusive adviser for the transaction. That record was broken just four weeks later, when Somerset Partners, backed by European investors, paid $510 million -- or just under $1,600 a square foot -- for a 33-story office tower at 450 Park Avenue, according to Mr. Harmon, who also advised that deal. Somerset Partners assumed an existing commercial mortgage-backed security loan of $175 million, and used its own equity for the balance. 
 Israeli investors were also active. An Israeli-led investor group paid $648 million for a 70 percent stake in the Lipstick Building, Philip Johnson's landmark at 885 Third Avenue near 53rd Street. And Africa Israel USA, a subsidiary of an Israel-based international holding and investment company, bought the former headquarters of The New York Times Company on West 43rd Street from Tishman Speyer for $525 million, three times the $175 million that Tishman Speyer paid in November 2004. Africa Israel also bought the Clock Tower building in Madison Square Park for $200 million and a portion of the Apthorp Apartments on the Upper West Side for $426 million. 
 In late August, the Dubai investment company Istithmar beat out the Fast Retailing Company, the Asian apparel retailer, with a $942.3 million bid for Barneys New York, being sold by Jones New York.
 All told, there were 46 transactions totaling $5.27 billion by foreign buyers of commercial real estate in Manhattan through August, up from 28 for all of 2006, according to Real Capital Analytics in New York. ''The global economic expansion is creating a tremendous amount of surplus capital,'' said Dan Fasulo, a managing director of Real Capital Analytics, which tracks real estate deals. Much of that capital, he said, ''wants and needs to be here.''
 The United States is considered one of the most transparent and stable markets in the world, even given the current credit shakeup, with Midtown Manhattan, in particular, long an attraction for foreign buyers.
 ''People want a core, stable place to put their money,'' said Stephen Collins, the managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle's international capital group in the company's Washington office.
 Real estate professionals agree that the underlying fundamentals of the New York commercial market are still strong. Vacancy rates are near historic lows, at 5.3 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, with limited supply and development potential in prime locations. And while Manhattan rents have become painfully high for many businesses, they still lag behind those of several of the world's major cities, like London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In London, for example, office space downtown can rent for as much as $:140 a square foot, or roughly $270. The average price per square foot in the West End of London by the end of the second quarter was $243, versus $79.85 a square foot for Midtown Manhattan, according to CB Richard Ellis.
 ''Foreign investors continue to view New York as a prime investment site, credit crunch or no credit crunch,'' said Bruce S. Schonbraun, the managing partner of the Schonbraun McCann Group, a real estate consulting firm based in New York.
 Then there is the psychological element of owning a storied property. ''It's the Monopoly board,'' said R. Stuart Gross, the executive managing director at Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services company in New York. ''Some of that mentality prevails.'' 
 Real estate professionals expect continuing increases in the most desirable New York City neighborhoods, especially Midtown Manhattan, though there is increased concern that a credit-related downturn in the financial sector could hurt the New York economy. Layoffs at financial services companies spiked nationwide in August, with more than 10,000 job cuts announced in the New York and New Jersey region alone, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the executive employment firm. 
 Still, foreign investors are gearing up for their New York moment. Mr. Collins of Jones Lang LaSalle said that he and his colleagues spent much of August fielding calls from Irish, German and Japanese investors interested in American real estate. ''At the end of the day, it's still New York, the financial capital of the world,'' he said. ''With supply constrained, we will see some continued run-up'' of prices. 
 Matt M. Bronfman, a managing director at Jamestown Properties, a real estate company based in Atlanta that raises money from German investors, said he also saw ''more opportunities for guys like us who are going to put plenty of cash into deals and weren't relying on 95 percent debt.'' 
 ''We still love the New York story,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Mexican Trucks, a Road Into the U.S.

BYLINE: By GRETEL C. KOVACH

DATELINE: DALLAS, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Mexican truckers are expected to begin transporting goods throughout the United States in coming days, after a decision Thursday night by the Transportation Department that provisionally lifted restrictions confining them to the border region.
 The provision opening the United States to Mexican long-haul trucking was called for under the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, but it was delayed by resistance from some trucking and environmental groups.
 Under a one-year pilot program, as many as 100 Mexican trucking companies vetted by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration at the Department of Transportation will be allowed to travel beyond the 25-mile commercial border zone. The program also clears American truckers to operate anywhere in Mexico for the first time. 
 Federal officials and some trucking and commerce representatives said the agreement would streamline cross-border trade, reduce pollution and lower prices for consumers. Under the current system, three trucks are usually required to transport one load of goods from either the United States or Mexico through the border region and onward to the final destination.
 ''This long-awaited project will protect public safety on American highways as we work to both save consumers money and help our economy,'' John Hill, head of the Motor Carrier Safety Administration, said in a statement.
 The first two companies cleared to participate in the program are Transportes Olympic, based in Nuevo Leon, near Monterrey, Mexico, and Stagecoach Cartage and Distribution, of El Paso, Tex. 
 The Teamsters, the Sierra Club and other groups said they would continue their legal fight to stop the program because of ''serious safety, environmental, smuggling and security concerns.''
 Leslie Miller, a spokeswoman for the Teamsters, said American truckers were most concerned about sharing the roads with potentially unsafe Mexican vehicles, not the potential of increased competition from lower-wage workers. ''We have nothing against Mexican truck drivers; it's the companies that exploit them that we oppose,'' she said. ''We're absolutely not ready for this.'' 
 A federal appeals court had rejected an emergency motion the groups filed to stop the program. On Friday, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association also petitioned for further review of the program.
 But not all trucking interests oppose the program. A spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, a national group representing trucking companies, said they had concern over safety standards but thought over all that critics of the program were ''exaggerating the dangers.''
 ''They will inspect every Mexican truck every time it goes across the border, which is more than they do for American trucks,'' said the spokesman, Clayton Boyce.
 An inspector general's report released Thursday cleared the program to proceed but said the federal motor carrier safety agency had not completed plans for checking ''every truck, every time'' they cross the border as planned. The report also cited concern about state enforcement officials' testing English proficiency among the drivers, which is required under the pilot program.
 In recent years, Mexican trucks crossing the border with the United States were no more likely to be taken out of service because of safety or other violations than American trucks, according to preliminary results of a review of thousands of Texas Department of Public Safety inspection reports. The review was conducted by the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Texas, Austin.
 ''The problem on the interstates is too many trucks,'' said Robert Harrison, deputy director of the center, ''not too many Mexican trucks. As long as the inspections are adequate and in force, we have little to fear.''
 In 2006, more than 3.2 million trucks crossed the Mexican border through Texas, more than double the number that passed through California and other states, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 
 Trade with Mexico has quadrupled under Nafta, to $332 billion in 2006 from $81 billion in 1993, according to the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 ''This pilot project is a long overdue step toward reducing congestion and air pollution at the U.S.-Mexico border while promoting growth and jobs,'' Thomas J. Donohue, president of the chamber, said in a statement. ''The United States promised under Nafta to open its border to Mexican trucks -- with full reciprocity for U.S. carriers -- and it's time we kept our word.''

HEADLINE: Putting a Price on the Priceless: One Life

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
ASSIGNING a dollar value to a person's life might seem impossible, not to mention unthinkable. But after a wrongful death, the needs of the surviving family - financial, emotional or both - often lead to that grim calculation.
 Forensic economists advise courts and governments on how to translate lives cut short into money for the living. 
 ''It's terribly distressing to anyone who gets involved with it,'' said Don Frankenfeld, a South Dakota forensic economist who helped determine compensation for Sept. 11 victims. ''It's a scary, ghoulish kind of arithmetic.''
 Six years after the attacks, experts are still being asked to calculate the value of lives lost. There were 95 lawsuits by survivors bypassing the official compensation fund in favor of the courts. About half of them have settled; 41 cases are pending, including some concerning injuries. They are set to go to trial in federal court on Sept. 24.
 Here is how some economists, along with the American military, have arrived at dollar values to compensate for the loss of individual lives.
 The Value of Earnings Lost, Plus a Common Sum for Suffering
 THE fund to compensate families of those killed on 9/11 paid about $2 million, on average, for each of the 2,280 dead. The fund used three measures to set payments:
 1. Economic loss.
 2. Set amounts for pain and suffering: $250,000, plus $100,000 for each surviving spouse and child.
 3. Subtract any life insurance paid.
 Last, the fund's special master, Kenneth R. Feinberg, had discretionary power to adjust payouts, often adding to the awards for low-income applicants and subracting from the high end.
 Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer, said the government's generosity was unlikely to be repeated.
 ''I believe the 9/11 fund is not a precedent for anything,'' he said. ''How do you justify giving $2 million, on average, to 9/11 victims and nothing to victims in Oklahoma City? Nothing to Katrina victims? It was a very emotional Congressional response to an unprecedented historical event.''
 Mr. Feinberg is now directing a privately backed fund for victims of the shootings at Virginia Tech in April. Families of the 32 killed will be eligible for a uniform sum: $180,000.
 The Value of Experience Lost
 THERE is economic damage from a wrongful death: the value of a person's lost work life.
 Then there is the loss of life's experience - the daily satisfaction of living. Presumably, says the Chicago economist Stan V. Smith, people cherish life itself much more than their work.
 ''We value our being far more than we value our doing,'' he said. So why give the loss of work a dollar value but not the loss of daily experience?
 Mr. Smith has tried. He coined the term ''hedonic damages'' for lives and experiences lost.
 ''As economists, we can't say there's a limit to the value of life,'' he said. ''But there may be an average value that juries can consider.''
 That average, Mr. Smith figures, is around $4 million.
 Mr. Smith says that people unknowingly set a value on their own lives by what they are willing to pay to reduce their everyday risk of death.
 Say a certain home safety feature costs $50. If research shows that for every 100,000 of those devices in use, one life is saved, then the implied value of that life is $5 million:
 100,000 devices x $50 = $5,000,000 to save 1 life
 The more people are willing to pay for safety features, the more they are implicitly valuing their lives. Mr. Smith has calculated value-of-life figures for numerous purchases, based on their costs and how much they reduce the risk of death.
 PURCHASED ITEMS AND IMPLIED VALUE OF ONE LIFE:
 Automotive air bags: $598,463
 Smoke detectors: $628,618
 Auto safety features: $4,198,517
 Top-grade tires: $6,031,019
 The law creating the Sept. 11 fund provided for hedonic damages. But while common in injury cases, so far few states recognize it as a consideration in wrongful-death cases. Critics scoff at the notion of putting a dollar amount on enjoyment of life, calling it a costly ploy to inflate damage awards.
 The Military's Method
 ON Feb. 1, an American soldier - who was married with three children - was killed in Iraq. The benefits to this serviceman's family, depending on how long each member lives and whether he or she goes on to college, could amount to about $1.9 million over their lifetimes. (That figure is in today's dollars. The face value of the money would grow over time, to allow for the effects of inflation and keep its purchasing power from eroding.) Military families face a complicated death-benefits structure that evolves as children grow up and spouses retire or remarry. Bradley J. Snyder, the emeritus president of Armed Forces Services Corporation, which advises families, urges them to use benefits counseling provided by the military to avoid losing money owed to them. Mr. Snyder calculated the benefits to this soldier's wife and children:
 LUMP SUMS:
 Social Security death benefit: $255
 Military death gratuity: $100,000
 Military life insurance: $400,000
 TOTAL: $500,255
 POTENTIAL MONEY FOR COLLEGE 
 (paid while they attend): $199,602
 SOCIAL SECURITY, SURVIVOR BENEFITS 
 (total over lifetimes): $1.24 million
 This assumes his wife will live to age 80. The annual benefit will start at $62,808, but decline to $12,804 after the children reach 18. When she is 62, it will rise to $23,904.
 The soldier's base pay had been about $36,000 a year.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Shame

 BODY:
The rich get richer and the poor stay poor. The sad adage presents itself dramatically in New Jersey. 
 Contrast any of New Jersey's major cities with their nearby suburbs and the difference is startling -- modest or deteriorating housing downtown, sprawling mansions and obvious wealth beyond the city limits. 
 The latest census figures tell the same story in dry arithmetic. The wealthiest 20 percent of residents in Essex County, where Newark is, have incomes almost 23 times as high as the poorest 20 percent. In most other New Jersey counties, the gap ranges between 15 and 20 times as high. 
 The reasons for this disparity are well-known: well-paying manufacturing jobs have disappeared, replaced by low-paying jobs filled in many cases by immigrants, like landscaping or working in fast food establishments. Meanwhile, at the upper end of the scale, Wall Street bonuses have sent the averages skyward. 
 How to bridge the income gap is less obvious. According to the census figures, 677,000 New Jersey residents, or 7.8 percent of the population, lived below the national poverty line in 2005-6, almost the same as during 2000-1. Poverty for children was worse -- 11.5 percent. And these figures fail to show the problem's real extent since the poverty level is defined the same throughout the continental United States: $20,650 for a family of four. That is unrealistically low for New Jersey. 
 ''We hope that people are moving up the ladder, but we really don't know,'' says James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
 To its credit, New Jersey is helping by pouring money into its poorer schools. A string of State Supreme Court decisions has forced Trenton to spend about as much money on schools in several of its poorest districts as is spent in wealthier districts. The hope is that with better education, these students will do better in the job market than their parents have done. 
 With the state facing a fiscal crisis, there is increased pressure to reduce the commitment to poor districts. That must not happen. While the formula for state aid should be adjusted according to districts that need help the most, a state like New Jersey, with the second highest median income in the nation, has a moral obligation to see that all students get a solid education. 
 There is an important role for the federal government too. It must expand a program providing health insurance for children whose families cannot afford coverage. Regrettably, President Bush has threatened to veto a bill that would make almost half of New Jersey's 100,000 uninsured children eligible for coverage. 
 The Bush administration has already changed the rules to make it almost impossible to enroll children above 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $51,000 for a family of four. That may seem generous in states like Mississippi or Alabama, but it is far too low for New Jersey. Few families making that little can pay the high costs of rent and food in this area and still have enough left for the $11,000 or $12,000 a year that a typical family policy costs. 
 Bills approved in the House and Senate would provide coverage for children whose families earn up to three times the federal poverty level (the Senate bill) or four times (the House bill). A recent poll showed that almost two-thirds of adults support coverage for children at those levels. And in New Jersey, it is hardly too high. 
 In the interest of children, in the interest of simple economic realism, and in the interest of compensating in some small way for New Jersey's yawning income gap, President Bush should sign the final measure. 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 16, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Editorials on children's health, on Aug. 26, and on economic disparities, in the New Jersey Section on Sept. 9, incorrectly described a bill approved by the House of Representatives for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The Bill does not contain a provision raising eligibility to four times the poverty level.

My Many Years Of Saying 'Goodnight'
 To the Editor:
 ''Goodnight New York,'' the Sept. 2 photographic essay celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of ''Goodnight Moon,'' brought back many memories, mostly good: reading the book to my children, then later to my grandchildren. 
 Five years ago, trying to hold back the tears as my husband was drifting away from Alzheimer's, I read it to him every night. 
 He liked it as much as the children had.

 Forced Out of New York by High Housing Prices
 To the Editor:
 Re ''City of Aspiration'' (Sept. 2), on the housing prospects for the middle class of New York: 
 My wife and I consider ourselves middle class, and we recently left the city. We were two professionals, licensed and practicing civil engineers. 
 We lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and were O.K. financially. We then started a family and could not afford Manhattan anymore. 
 We looked at other options in the city, and even near suburbs, but we could not afford anything we saw and decided to move back home to Texas. 
 The article mentions a median-price house of $510,000 in the New York area and other home prices of $600,000, which this middle-class family could never afford. Our home close to town in Houston was half that, and we are just meeting the budget here. 
 Without the advantage of having relatives nearby (they are all here in Texas), we would have the added cost of day care or the limiting factor of one income. 
 So, while the tone of the article makes it seem as if there is affordable housing, after my personal search, I couldn't reach that same conclusion. 
 While I love New York, and we often miss the city terribly, we feel we had no choice but to leave. We were forced out by economics. 
 If only we had decided to be investment bankers.

 It's Time to Retire Those Carriage Horses
 To the Editor:
 New York City's horse-drawn carriage industry shouldn't be seen as a permanent fixture just needing cleanup. It's time to end the business entirely. Too many horses have endured misery in the name of entertainment. 
 The New York City comptroller's recent audit underscored the neglect and mistakes of a dysfunctional industry. May the audit awaken the mayor and City Council to the real heart of the matter: exploitation is not an appropriate tourist attraction.

HEADLINE: The New Gray Areas

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
Ever thought of retiring to someplace sunny and close to the beach? Or maybe you've considered moving into the city after raising a family in the suburbs. In fact, most of us will never do either. According to the United States Census Bureau, 9 out of 10 Americans over 60, or 41.5 million people, stayed in the same home or in the same county between 1995 and 2000. During that period, only 4.4 million Americans over 60 moved away. Those figures don't seem likely to change anytime soon. Last year, AARP surveyed Americans over 50 and found that 89 percent wanted to stay in their current home as long as possible. ''Americans are going to age in place,'' says Elinor Ginzler, AARP's director for livable communities. 
 William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, released a report in May called ''Mapping the Growth of Older America.'' Based on Census Bureau data and the bureau's and his own projections, Frey found that growth in the pre-senior population -- Americans 55 to 64 -- was a key factor in pinpointing where the senior population would take off in the next 15 or 20 years. Frey forecast that states in the West like Nevada and Utah and Southern states like Texas, Georgia and Florida would have almost two and a half times as many retirees in 2030 as they had in 2000. And he predicted that the suburbs of New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles would have much faster growth in their retirement populations than the cities they surround. Stephen M. Golant, a gerontologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, has studied the effects of a booming retiree sector on local communities and found that up until age 75 or so, older residents tend to be strong economic contributors to communities, spending on entertainment, restaurants, housing and health and medical services and often continuing to work or volunteer. But as they get older and their health fails and savings begin to run down, that effect may start to turn negative. 
 Ultimately, experts on aging say the impact of the graying of America on our communities may depend on our ability to plan ahead for the needs of the elderly -- housing options, health care services, public transportation. Golant says, ''The key factor will be whether we have the willingness as a society to respond to groups that become vulnerable -- economically, physically and psychologically.''

HEADLINE: Inside the Upside-Down World of the Short Sale

BYLINE: By NOAM SCHEIBER

 BODY:
''I have a license to carry. It's only for dogs. I've had a couple of bad run-ins with dogs.'' This was Gary Prescott. A few weeks earlier, Prescott and his partners at a firm called Equity Solutions Realty bid on a property just north of St. Petersburg, Fla. The owners, a recently separated couple, were several months late on their mortgage payments. Prescott was hoping to buy it before the foreclosure. So on a broiling-hot afternoon in May, he and I and a woman named Rose, who came to appraise the property for the bank, stood before a two-toned, white and cherry red house with two ratty mattresses leaning against the facade. A dog started barking when Prescott opened the door, and Rose became concerned. ''Are these people O.K. with us coming in?'' Rose asked. ''Yeah, I met the lady this morning,'' Prescott said to her, but then he excused himself. Two minutes later he was back with a black Kel- Tec handgun. 
 Prescott keeps his handgun at the ready for precisely this ritual, known to real estate investors as the B.P.O., or broker price opinion, and to the rest of us as an appraisal. The bank relies on the appraiser to evaluate Prescott's offer. Prescott showed up on this day to plead his case.
 Prescott trooped to the rear of the house while Rose, who asked that her last name not be used, waited with me in the foyer. Prescott is a wide-faced man with earnest green eyes and a mild overbite, which, from certain angles, makes him look much younger than his 50 years. He first got into real estate in the 1980s while attending college in Vermont. Lacking money, he used elaborate financing schemes to build a portfolio of some 20 apartments, which he'd rent to fellow students. He carries himself like someone who knows his way around an investment property.
 ''It's O.K., the dog's in a pen,'' Prescott called out. Rose and I took this as a cue to wade cautiously into the living room. The house looked as if it had been abandoned and resettled by squatters. There were takeout boxes all over the floor, along with empty beer cans and bottles of vodka. The walls were streaked with grime, and the only thing masking the smell of mildew was a terrific pet odor. The house was fairly typical of an impending foreclosure, in other words. People who can't make their mortgage payments don't often make maintenance a high priority. The lawn is usually the first to go; the living space the last. This place had been empty for at least a month and looked to be in the final stages of decay.
 For the last few years, Prescott and his partners have done a booming business in a transaction called a short sale. When a homeowner gets behind on his payments, he normally has two alternatives to foreclosure: refinance, or sell the house and pay back the loan. But since the local market collapsed in late 2005, many mortgages have turned ''upside down''-- that is, the owner owes more than the house is currently worth -- eliminating both options. That's where Equity Solutions comes in. Prescott asks the bank to approve the sale of the house at a cut-rate price (hence, ''short sale'') and to forgive the balance of the mortgage, all prior to the actual foreclosure. When executed correctly, a short sale can leave everyone better off: the homeowner walks away with his credit largely intact; the bank salvages part of a nonperforming loan without the headache of repossessing a house; and, of course, Equity Solutions gets the best of the deal -- a property it hopes to flip at a profit. (The firm rehabs some houses before selling them; others it unloads ''as is,'' a practice known as wholesaling.)
 Rose and I both stopped short when we got to the back porch. Prescott had neglected to mention that the dog in question was actually two dogs -- and that both were pit bulls. He seemed untroubled by their presence, however, and promptly got to work. ''There's the roof,'' he said, pointing to an overhang jutting out over the porch. ''It's all warped, corroded.'' Rose nodded without comment. Prescott darted inside: ''I'll show you the baseboards,'' he said. ''You can see the termite damage.'' Another nod. ''Oh, this is worth a picture here. The dry wall is peeling off.''
 After a while, Rose stopped tiptoeing around the house as if it were booby-trapped. She snapped a couple of unsolicited photos and even led the way into a bedroom. When we came out, the door to the adjacent bedroom was shut, and Rose turned the knob to ease it open. Suddenly she darted past me toward the front door, arms flailing over her head cartoon-style. A third pit bull came trotting out behind her and into the yard. The dog was clearly pregnant -- her swollen stomach sagged almost to the floor -- but mercifully she was good-humored. The smell, though, was ferocious. I poked my head into the vacated room and found the floor covered in excrement.
 ''She's wagging her tail, she's fine,'' Prescott called soothingly. ''Thank God the dog has a good disposition. A lot of pregnant ones don't.'' He resumed his inventory. ''Have you seen the kitchen? God forbid you have snakes in there -- '' But Rose had had enough. ''This is definitely just a tear-down,'' she sighed.
 ''You notice when she came out she was very negative,'' Prescott told me as we drove off. He was pleased that the bank would be receiving a downbeat assessment. ''This one is probably better to wholesale, but it's a good house for us if not.''
 Prescott met his partner Jim Izzolo in late 1999. A few years earlier, Prescott moved to Florida as a marketing executive for a portraitstudio chain called Olan Mills. Izzolo, who is about a decade younger than Prescott, was the real estate agent who sold him his first house in the area. The two men hit it off and began working together on the occasional real estate deal. One early investment was a four-family building on the Gulf of Mexico, not far from St. Petersburg. Prescott and Izzolo renovated the place and rented it out at a hefty monthly rate. They bought other beach properties to rehab and resell.
 One night in 2002, Prescott was at a bar in an oceanside restaurant when he overheard an older man say he'd bought 43 houses all at once. Prescott was intrigued and took the man out to lunch the following day. It turned out his dining companion had purchased the properties through short sales. It was the first time Prescott had heard of anyone buying a house for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.
 When Prescott told his partner about the idea, Izzolo was skeptical. ''You can't do it,'' Izzolo said. But both men were curious enough to do a little research. Prescott asked around at his real estate investment club. Sure enough, a few had heard of short-buying, and one investor recommended some self-proclaimed gurus. Before long, Izzolo and Prescott were on a plane to Denver to attend a course taught by two of them -- Dwan Bent- Twyford and Sharon Restrepo. Together, it cost them $4,500 to enroll, plus $3,000 for airfare and hotel. Izzolo paid it grudgingly. ''If this is a bunch of fluff, I'm going to raise hell,'' he told Prescott.
 The seminar was convincing enough that the two men paid Restrepo $10,000 to help set up their business, then called G. R. Prescott & Associates. The business did well from the start, and earlier this year, Prescott and Izzolo moved into a new office in a small shopping center in Largo, a middle-class St. Petersburg suburb. During the boom, foreclosure was mostly something that affected low-income people. It made sense to be near south St. Petersburg, the city's poorest neighborhood. Since the crash began in late 2005, however, foreclosure problems have worked their way up the socioeconomic ladder. According to the most recent data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the foreclosure rate for prime borrowers, who tend to be middle class, has increased by one-third since bottoming out in early 2006. And Prescott and Izzolo have followed the trends uptown. Prescott says that the potential for a large profit is greater reselling middle-class houses, with mortgages in the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, than for downscale homes.
 Still, as lucrative as it can be, short-buying more upscale homes can be tricky in a down market. Prescott says the partnership was closing deals on about 50 houses a year at a profit of about $20,000 to $25,000 each at the height of the boom. But last year, the first full year of focusing on more affluent homeowners, was the company's worst ever -- it made only about $10,000 to $15,000 a house on approximately the same number of houses. Reselling the homes has become much more difficult. During the boom, Prescott and Izzolo could buy a house and quickly wholesale it to another investor, who would do the fixing up and either rent it or resell it. But the slumping real estate market has scared off many investors. And while Equity Solutions can always do the rehab and sell the house retail -- that is, to a family that wants to live in it -- a down market tends to make middle-class buyers incredibly choosy. For example, the company recently negotiated the short sale of a house for $199,000, even though the owner still owed $288,000 on the mortgage. But the partners could resell the house for only $230,000. They made a profit of about $21,000 -- less than they expected. This has made it all the more important to procure homes at a substantial discount.
 In recent months, the parade of grim statistics on foreclosures -- more of a death march, really -- has become the central story line in this decade's preoccupation with real estate. The Wall Street Journal reported in June that lenders will repossess nearly one million homes through foreclosure both this year and next, almost double the annual number between 2000 and 2006. The problem with so many foreclosures is that they create a vicious cycle. When a bank repossesses a home, it tries to unload it as quickly as possible, for as cheap as necessary. This adds to the inventory of homes available -- in the Tampa Bay area, only about 1 in 15 homes sells each month, versus 1 in 2 at the market peak -- and depresses prices. But when prices drop, foreclosures rise, because financially strapped homeowners can't sell their houses to pay off their mortgages.
 The foreclosures are concentrated in the subprime portion of the market -- that is, among people who qualified for mortgages despite the fact that they had poor credit histories. Nationally, 1.3 percent of all homes were in foreclosure as of early 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, but that percentage quadruples for the subprime demographic. Subprime mortgages typically involve adjustable interest rates that escalate quickly, so it's not surprising that foreclosures have increased over the past few years. Since the real estate market peaked in 2005, the subprime foreclosure rate has spiked from 3.3 percent to more than 5 percent. Some of the mortgages, called ''liar loans,'' require almost no documentation of a borrower's ability to pay. The most infamous breed is known among mortgage brokers as the ''Ninja'' loan, short for ''no income, no job or assets.''
 All of this was made possible by the securitization of residential mortgages, one of the most fateful financial-market innovations of the last generation. Put simply, many lenders no longer hang on to the majority of the loans they make. Instead, they typically sell them to investment banks, which slice them up into securities and offload them to investors. Over the last several years, hedge funds, pension funds and university endowments eagerly snatched up subprime mortgage securities on the assumption that, even if a significant number of homeowners defaulted, the rest were paying such high interest rates that the investment was sound.
 The entirely foreseeable consequence of this was to give rise to what economists call ''moral hazard.'' Because the banks were acting as middlemen rather than holding the mortgages themselves, their incentive to vet borrowers declined strikingly. Mortgage quality declined with it. Over the last few months, as investors have seen the value of their subprime portfolios collapse -- two such funds run by the investment bank Bear Stearns disintegrated this summer, for example -- it has become painfully obvious that investors' assumptions about the risks they took on were wildly optimistic.
 One day I was in the Equity Solutions office and Prescott handed me a Washington Post article about New Century Financial, one of the more notorious mortgage lenders. The article reported that salesmen in one New Century office had become legendary for strolling past the cubicles of the company's appraisers -- the people charged with rejecting bad applications -- with a baseball bat. One salesman slammed his bat down on an appraiser's desk after she turned down a deal. ''The stress in that place was ungodly,'' the appraiser told The Post. ''There was instant notification to everyone as soon as you rejected a loan. And you dreaded doing it because you paid for it.''
 Long before there can be a short sale, even before there can be a broker price opinion, Prescott must locate a distressed homeowner and establish a rapport. Some in the short-sale business use fliers or direct mail for this purpose. Others cold-call. A select few advertise on radio or latenight television. But no one would deny that old-fashioned door-knocking is far and away the most effective way of landing a deal.
 Today the partners no longer personally do any prospecting. Instead, they employ a team of roughly half a dozen contractors to gin up business. The door-knockers receive a fixed fee of $3,000 for any deal that closes (and a bonus if the house is subsequently resold for a large profit). The more prolific among them can earn $75,000 a year. Four years ago, however, when Prescott and Izzolo were just starting out, it fell to the two men to do the door-knocking themselves. Izzolo was the undisputed champion of this activity, and he still trains the new recruits.
 Izzolo volunteered to take me through a brief role-playing exercise. He is a small man with short brown hair and droopy eyelids. The day I met him, he was wearing a short-sleeved red shirt and black chinos and sported a week-old goatee. Though he has a half-ironic manner that makes it hard to tell when he's joking, particularly when he slips into over-enunciated real estate speak, his talent for salesmanship is obvious.
 The basic idea, as in all sales efforts, is to leave the prospect simultaneously insecure about his situation and awed by your expertise. To accomplish the former, the door-knocker will systematically demolish any assumptions, most of them admittedly delusional, that allow the homeowner to believe he can resolve his troubles alone. To accomplish the latter, the door-knocker will trot out an intimidating litany of dates and deadlines -- you will get another notice in 30 days, you will have a chance to ask a judge for a 60-day extension -- which the door-knocker can help navigate.
 Izzolo illustrates one technique based on his own experience. ''You'd knock on a door and say, 'What do you think your house is worth?' They say, 'One-twenty.' You look around and say, 'One-twenty?' '' Izzolo screws up his face for emphasis. ''They say, 'Well, 110.' You say, 'One-ten?' '' Izzolo screws up his face again, but now he sticks out both hands, too. ''They say, 'O.K., 100.' You say, 'Well, you don't have any equity.' They think you're going to walk away. And you say, 'No, there's a way.' ''
 Door-knocking has become vastly more efficient in the Internet age. Banks and mortgage lenders must file paperwork with a local court to begin the foreclosure process, at which point the borrower typically has three to six months to settle up or vacate the house. Pre-Internet, anyone prospecting for short sales would have spent hours each week rifling through court documents. In recent years, however, online listing services have proliferated. The service-providers send workers to the courthouse and regularly update their listings. Investors like Prescott pay a monthly fee to access them. The prospectors then fan out across town to make their pitches.
 One afternoon I went on a door-knock with a prospector named Ray Smith. Smith is in his late 20s, broad-shouldered and blond. He bought a few houses from Prescott and his partners two years ago and came aboard not long after. Smith has recently scaled back his prospecting efforts while he studies to become a licensed appraiser and tends to his own fast-growing stable of rental units. He lives on the northern edge of St. Petersburg's slowly gentrifying ghetto, in strategic proximity to tenants and prospective clients.
 We circled the neighborhood in Smith's beat-up Jeep Cherokee for two hours without making much progress. When we rang the doorbell of a tan stucco house on 20th Avenue, two children pressed their heads against the window, but no one answered. A teenage girl greeted us at an apricotcolored house on 26th Avenue. She told us her mother received a thick package -- the foreclosure notice -- after the landlord stopped paying the mortgage, but she didn't know any more than that. Between houses, Smith shared his philosophy on door-knocking. ''Most people want to talk to you,'' he said. ''It'' -- foreclosure -- ''is a problem. And everyone wants to talk about their problems.'' Later he told me that the trick is to be patient. ''A lot of people think they have more options than they do,'' he said. ''They say they're going to sell it. You call back and say, 'Did you sell it yet?' '' Invariably the answer is no.
 The very last address on our list was not far from Smith's place. It was a two-story house with blue-gray siding, set back so far from the road we almost missed it. A makeshift wooden fence blocked our access to the porch, so Smith banged on the side of the building. When no one answered, we tried our luck at the rear of the house. Finally, a gawky man no older than 25 emerged from the porch. He had long brown hair and a prominent Adam's apple and was wearing a gray T-shirt that said, ''Makeup Doesn't Cure Ugly People.'' It looked as if we had woken him up.
 Once Smith introduced himself, the young man seemed either grateful for the interest or too defeated to shoo him away -- it wasn't entirely clear which. Predictably, the man said he was thinking about selling. ''What are you trying to sell it for?'' Smith asked. The young man said, ''Two-fifteen.'' Smith said: ''Two-fifteen? Wow, you really think you can sell it for 215?''
 After some brief chitchat, the young man invited us in for a tour. He told us he was a landscape foreman who had lost his job. He couldn't suppress his pride when showing off the fans he'd installed and a new second-floor bathroom. Behind almost every door there were more people, three generations in all. A mother in one room, a sister in another. Young children came out of the woodwork, as in one of those cartoons where a house has been sliced down the middle to reveal activity inside every nook and cranny. When the tour ended, Smith asked if there was a place we could sit and talk. The landscaper led us to a small den with a bookshelf full of James Patterson novels and an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts.
 The landscaper told us his family moved into the house last fall, at which point the landlord suggested they buy it. In December he closed on a mortgage. He told me he thought the payments would be around $1,000 a month, but by February they were nearly double that amount. He lost his job around the same time. With no income and an entire brood to feed -- he and his girlfriend have five children, including 4-month-old twins -- he said he hadn't paid more than $100 in any month since. The foreclosure documents arrived in mid-May, about a week and a half before we did.
 Speaking very slowly and very calmly, Smith sketched a crude time line on a yellow legal pad with the dates June 17 and July 17 spelled out in block letters. ''You'll get another foreclosure notice here,'' he said, pointing to the second date. He told the landscaper he would have a month to move out at that point, unless he got an extension from a judge. ''We'll go to court with you,'' he added reassuringly. Smith punctuated his sentences by asking, ''Do you see what I'm saying?'' The landscaper nodded vigorously each time, but it wasn't clear that he did. Every few minutes he looked up and said hopefully, ''If you could help us stay in the house, that'd be great,'' even though Smith had suggested nothing of the kind. After Smith explained how a short sale works, he handed the landscaper a document authorizing Prescott to access his records. ''Now let's do the right thing and sign there,'' Smith said. The young man scribbled his signature.
 After the encounter with the landscaper, I stopped by the office to meet with Izzolo and Bill Mirro, a childhood friend of Izzolo's who joined the firm almost three years ago. They immediately concluded that the landscaper's mortgage was dubious. For one thing, the property had been appraised for $215,000. But given the size of the house and its location -- on the northern edge of the poorest part of town -- the price seemed outrageously high. All the more so given that the sale took place in December 2006, a year after the market had turned. Appraisers must justify their estimates with recent sales data for comparable houses in the neighborhood. Mirro speculated that the appraiser had simply gone two blocks north -- across Central Avenue, the boundary between the historically white and black sections of St. Petersburg -- where an identical house sells for $20,000 to $30,000 more. ''If the bank's based in California, they don't know,'' he said.
 The landscaper appeared to have what is known as a ''phantom second'' mortgage. Because he lacked money for a down payment and had no hope of qualifying for 100 percent financing on $193,500, which is what the owner appears to have been asking, the inflated appraisal of $215,000 made it look as if he were borrowing only 90 percent of the asking price. It was unlikely that the landscaper even knew about the arrangement.
 The landscaper never actually owned his house in any meaningful sense. He never could have afforded it in a rational world. ''It was the bank's house,'' Mirro said. ''He was just living in it.'' From the perspective of the lender, he was an easy mark for a mortgage that could quickly be resold on Wall Street, but he had no equity. The real casualties of the boom are people like Shenecial Bailey and her husband, who owned the house with the pregnant pit bull. If not for relentless marketing and the allure of easy money, she would probably be sitting on more than $50,000 in home equity today.
 The couple bought their house in 1998 for the modest sum of $53,000. By 2003, the value had climbed to more than $70,000. Soon they were on the receiving end of endless offers to cash out their equity in exchange for a larger loan. They agreed to one in February of that year, then again in December 2005. This put another $45,000 in their pockets. But by the following year, the money was gone and the Baileys were splitting up. The monthly payments were now more than double what they had been under the original mortgage, and far higher than Shenecial Bailey, an assistant manager at a local McDonald's, could afford. She stopped making payments in August, and the bank sent a foreclosure notice in December.
 By late April, Bailey was about to lose not only her home but also her shot at ever getting another one. Prescott hadn't heard from the Baileys' lender for several days, and the auction date was less than a week away. If it were to arrive before Prescott could close the deal, the Baileys would see their credit destroyed and all his work would be for naught. Prescott advised Shenecial Bailey to declare Chapter 13 bankruptcy to stop a potential sale. He had a paralegal prepare the necessary documents and urged Bailey to drive the documents to the courthouse immediately. It was the morning of the auction, and it sometimes takes the court two days to notify a lender of a bankruptcy filing. She and Prescott just had to hope the papers would be processed in time.
 Prescott is prone to philosophical musings, which sometimes masquerade as mundane observations. One day, as we were driving back from one of his properties, he explained his approach to his volatile line of work. ''The key to this business is to keep expenses low,'' he told me. ''That's where all these seminars go wrong. They say buy a nice car, buy a nice house. All those people lose.'' He was scowling as he told me this.
 Even now that he has socked away a comfortable nest egg, Prescott still lives modestly. His dream is to buy the lot next door to his house and build a Mediterranean-style palazzo. But he plans to do it in the style of the third world. ''I'll put the facade up, build the whole shell, do the grounds, build the foyer, a bedroom to start off. But then you leave it and do it out of your own pocket.'' It's as though Prescott has seen too much wreckage as an investor to take on even a modest risk in his personal life. In any case, he says he's too cheap to consider it. ''Even at a decent interest rate, if you financed it for 30 years and borrowed $2 million, you'd end up paying $4 million, $4.5 million. That's nuts. Crazy.''
 Dealing day in and day out with foreclosure candidates can influence your worldview. Prescott's experiences have made him a bit of a bleeding heart, even if he wouldn't necessarily describe himself that way. ''The socialization process you get in this country is not good,'' he said as we drove farther. ''We're consumers, we're not people. People go through school and it's rote learning. They're not equipped to function in society.''
 Prescott is the first to acknowledge that he's in business to make a buck. But his self-image is deeply tied to the idea that he's helping homeowners. He often gets emotionally involved in their cases. When Izzolo mentioned a client named Harold Craton, 79, who started drowning financially after his furniture-refinishing business failed, Prescott became sober-faced. ''This is a guy you'd really like to see keep the house, but he's so far under the bus.'' Another client was a 21-year-old telemarketer whose uncle had used him as a frontman to secure several mortgages, then had promptly fallen behind on the payments. ''Whoever made those loans ought to be in jail,'' Prescott told me. ''Here's a kid working hard, trying to get out of the inner city, and he's picked up by a crook who happens to be a relative.'' When clients are vacating a house, Equity Solutions will help sell their appliances and any other belongings they might want to liquidate. Recently, Prescott's sisterin- law began posting Craton's antiques for sale on eBay. ''We try to get them a little money to start a new life,'' Prescott said.
 At times it can be hard to tell where Prescott's do-gooder instincts leave off and self-interest kicks in. Prescott has told me that if clients ask, he will try to work out a forbearance with the bank -- which is to say, some sort of repayment plan that lets them keep their house. ''I'll do that for nothing,'' he said. ''It's good karma.'' No doubt. On the other hand, the majority of homeowners who win forbearances end up back in foreclosure within a year. When they do, they're likely to call Equity Solutions.
 When I dropped in on Prescott in late June, he seemed reflective. He'd spent weeks working on a deal for a house owned by the telemarketer with the dodgy uncle. Prescott had finally reached an understanding with the lender and even had a buyer lined up. But at the last minute, the lender informed him that there were actually two mortgages on the house and that the second had been sold to another bank. Prescott would have to open up an entirely separate negotiation to complete the sale. He stared straight ahead and slowly shook his head as he told me this.
 Still, the recent news on the deal front hadn't been all bad. Shenecial Bailey stopped the auction of her home with a successful bankruptcy filing. In June, her lender allowed the sale of the property to Prescott for $80,000. Bailey promptly went to court and retracted the bankruptcy, a move known as a voluntary dismissal, which preserved her good credit. After the sale -- and a thorough cleaning by Bailey -- Equity Solutions resold the house for $100,000 to an investor the partners had dealt with frequently. Prescott and his partners cleared $11,000. ''It was a small one for us,'' he said. Had the housing market been better, he added, ''we would have made 20.''

HEADLINE: Near Ground Zero, Baby Carriages and Busy Shops

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Six years ago, in the aftershock of the terrorist attack that reduced the World Trade Center to a smoldering pile, local officials wondered whether people would want to live or work around the financial district again.
 Today, as new residents fill converted office buildings and jam the raucous block party that erupts nightly on Stone Street, the more likely curiosity about Lower Manhattan is: Where did all these people come from, and how can they afford to live here?
 Despite the slow pace of reconstruction at ground zero, the area below Chambers Street is humming with activity, much of it designed to appeal to the well-heeled professionals who are transforming the neighborhood. Already, it has added hundreds of condominium units and hotel rooms, a thriving restaurant row, a private school charging $27,000 a year, a free wireless Internet service, a BMW dealership and an Hermes boutique.
 A Tiffany & Company jewelry store is coming soon, and plans are in place for the arrival of grocery stores, the type of business that the area has long lacked. 
 ''There were very few who would have predicted that Lower Manhattan would have rebounded as quickly as it has, despite all of the false starts and delays and emotional overlays,'' said Carl Weisbrod, president of Trinity Real Estate and former president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''There were few people who were quite that optimistic.''
 The rebound is a testament to the healing power of billions of dollars in government aid, like the federal Liberty Bond program, which provided more than $6 billion in tax-exempt financing for reconstruction downtown, as well as various rent and wage subsidies from redevelopment agencies.
 Optimism abounds now among developers and merchants, who are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into real estate along the narrow streets of Lower Manhattan. They are counting on the district, in its next incarnation, to be not just a collection of office towers and trading floors, but also a self-sustaining residential neighborhood that will appeal to families.
 Even accounting for the exodus of residents immediately after 9/11, the population of Lower Manhattan has increased by more than 10,000 in the last six years, according to census data. To accommodate new residents, more than 6,000 apartments have been created in the last four years, through conversions or construction, and an additional 5,000 are planned, according to the Downtown Alliance. 
 Office space, now in short supply, is renting for more than it did before 9/11. Over the next several years, around 14 million square feet of commercial space is scheduled to be built, replacing the offices and stores destroyed on 9/11, according to data compiled by Cushman & Wakefield, a large real estate brokerage. 
 The economic rebound is indisputable, but it has left some downtown merchants with mixed feelings.
 Karena Nigale has found the new financial district to be more attractive as a place to run a business, but less affordable as a place to live. Since 9/11, she has opened two hair salons -- each called KK Salon -- within a few blocks of the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Ms. Nigale started out catering to investment bankers and traders with $25 shaves and $40 haircuts. But she has expanded to serve a broader clientele, staying open on Saturdays to serve residents of the area.
 ''Before, this neighborhood was operating from 8 in the morning until 5 o'clock in the afternoon,'' and on weekdays only, Ms. Nigale said. She expected her business would soon become a seven-day-a-week operation.
 Ms. Nigale lived above her first salon until the din from the carousers on Stone Street below her windows, along with a rent increase of more than 30 percent, drove her out. Unable to afford a suitable apartment in the sizzling downtown market, Ms. Nigale and her 11-year-old daughter decamped to the Jersey City riverfront about a year ago. 
 ''I need two bedrooms, and there's nothing for less than $4,000 a month around here,'' Ms. Nigale said, speaking from the larger salon she opened on Maiden Lane last year. A place to park would cost at least an additional $400 a month, she said.
 Her business, though, is thriving. Her young customers all have ''big watches, expensive handbags,'' and no qualms about the cost of her services, she said.
 Indeed, the Downtown Alliance, the neighborhood's business improvement district, estimates that the median annual income among the households in the financial district is $165,000, which is about triple the figure for Manhattan as a whole. 
 While salons and grocers may be welcome in the neighborhood, economic development officials argue that maintaining downtown's position as a global corporate center is important for the city and even the nation.
 Nearly 20 million square feet of office space has been lost since 9/11, from the destruction of the World Trade Center, the damage to the Deutsche Bank building and the conversion of older office buildings to residential use. Still, said William Bernstein, the acting president of the Downtown Alliance, ''The financial industries will always be the backbone of Lower Manhattan's economy.''
 A recent sign that downtown's traditional role remains viable is the decision this summer by JPMorgan Chase & Company to build a headquarters for its investment bank on the site of the ruined Deutsche Bank building. The Chase building will stand just a few blocks from where Goldman Sachs is building a 2.1-million-square-foot tower. Both are within a block of ground zero. 
 And 7 World Trade Center, which contains 1.7 million square feet of space, is open and more than half leased. The other buildings planned at ground zero would add 12 million square feet of office space in coming years.
 Office rents downtown are 10 percent higher, at $45 a square foot, than six years ago, and the vacancy rate has dropped below 7 percent, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield. 
 Business owners are finding other uses for some older office buildings besides turning them into condos. Across Broad Street from the stock exchange, a former Bank of America building has been transformed into the Claremont Preparatory School.
 Starting its third year, the school has several hundred students from prekindergarten through eighth grade, said Michael C. Koffler, the chief executive of MetSchools, the operator of Claremont Prep. 
 About 40 percent of them live downtown, and he expects that number to grow as more apartments become available and the neighborhood gains more stores like a Gristede's supermarket planned on Maiden Lane and a Whole Foods proposed for nearby TriBeCa.
 ''You see children in baby carriages all the time,'' Mr. Koffler said. ''You see people walking dogs. There will be many more apartments with three bedrooms, meaning the development community is acknowledging that this will be a community of families.''
 For some, the neighborhood's growing pains have been a frustrating disruption. 
 Tazz Latifi's pet supply shop, Petropolis, sits three blocks south of ground zero in the street-level space of an older apartment building. Since she opened in March 2006, her business has had to weather the relentless reconstruction of the surrounding blocks, Ms. Latifi said.
 Her first unpleasant surprise came last year, when the building was emptied for a conversion to luxury condominiums. Since then, she said, Con Edison has dug up the street outside her shop three times. In recent weeks, some of the local streets have been closed because of last month's fire at the Deutsche Bank building, in which two firefighters died.
 ''It's frustrating for the residents here,'' said Ms. Latifi, 38. ''I have so many customers that have moved because of the noise and the air quality.''
 Peter Poulakakos has had a front-row view of the less tangible changes through the windows of Ulysses' pub on Stone Street and the six other food-service businesses he and his partners operate nearby. Talking over a standing-room-only crowd on a Thursday night in late summer, Mr. Poulakakos recalled that the street, which was first paved in the mid-17th century, was a trash-filled alley a decade ago.
 Now, closed to traffic and lined with restaurants and bars, it is the stage for one of the liveliest social scenes in Manhattan, a slice of South Beach tucked into the financial district -- minus the palm trees and bikinis.
 Inside Ulysses', which stays open until 4 a.m., couples were dancing to salsa music blaring from a D.J.'s booth. Next door at Adrienne's Pizza Bar, which serves until midnight and was named after Mr. Poulakakos's mother, a pair of women were buying a $12 four-cheese pie to take home.
 A belief in the downtown economy's ability to recover from disasters, financial and otherwise, runs in the Poulakakos family. Mr. Poulakakos's father, Harry, ran the Wall Street mainstay Harry's at Hanover Square for decades. He closed it in 2003 after his wife died, but his son and a partner revived it as Harry's Cafe and Steak. 
 In April, Peter Poulakakos took a bigger leap, opening Gold Street, a restaurant that never closes, at the base of 2 Gold Street, a 51-story building where two-bedroom apartments rent for as much as $5,900 a month. 
 ''Downtown still has a ways to go, as far as progress,'' Mr. Poulakakos said. But the tide of sentiment about its prospects has clearly turned, he added.
 ''We get a lot of customers who used to live down here,'' Mr. Poulakakos said. ''They say, 'I wish I was living here now, because it's so different.' ''

HEADLINE: Energy Proposals Go From Tame to Exotic

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
LONG ISLANDERS made it through this summer without a major blackout, although to stay cool they paid steep electric bills in this era of record prices for the oil and gas that fuel utility generators.
 But the challenge of keeping the Island's lights on and its air-conditioners humming in the years to come has energy experts scrambling to satisfy this power-thirsty land of homes filled with big-screen televisions, computers and video games.
 Huge energy projects -- some strikingly innovative -- are competing for approval and billions of dollars, even as a couple of high-profile projects have been scuttled. Complicating the debate over the Island's energy future are transformations in the two entities responsible for the system, the Long Island Power Authority and KeySpan Energy.
 After the change of governors in Albany in January, new leaders are set to take the helm of the authority, which has overseen the electric system since Long Island Lighting Company's demise in 1998. At the same time, the British energy conglomerate National Grid has bought out KeySpan, which inherited Lilco's power plants and the workforce that operates the electric system. 
 Exotic-sounding projects are being explored by various companies and scrutinized by regulators. 
 Atlantic Sea Island has proposed a 60-acre artificial island for a liquefied natural gas terminal south of Long Beach. Broadwater Energy wants a floating liquefied natural gas terminal as big as the Queen Mary anchored in the middle of Long Island Sound. Other companies are considering underwater turbines on the East End to harness tidal currents.
 More conventional proposals include the revamping of the Island's five major power plants, though that would cost billions of dollars. And there are renewed calls to curb consumption, notably from LIPA's new chairman, Kevin S. Law.
 Recent setbacks for a wind-turbine project and an underwater natural gas pipeline in the Sound underscore the inherent risks of such proposals. Mr. Law recommended shelving the authority's plan to erect 40 giant wind turbines off Jones Beach because the cost had soared to $811 million -- quadruple initial estimates. And a federal judge blocked the proposed Islander East pipeline from Connecticut.
 Some other projects are moving forward. The $600 million, 65-mile Neptune cable project now connects to New Jersey for cheaper electricity, some of it coal- and nuclear-generated. An antiquated cable across the Sound will be replaced next year. And the 350-megawatt Caithness Energy power plant is being built in Yaphank. National Grid and the new LIPA leadership are already having an impact.
 National Grid agreed to $236 million in estimated savings to LIPA and promised to clean up about 20 toxic sites inherited from Lilco, though critics of the deal wanted more concessions. The company now owns the five aging power plants and employs the 2,700 workers. 
 The authority, meanwhile, has changed hands from the Republican Pataki administration to the Democratic Spitzer administration. Its longtime chairman and current president, Richard M. Kessel, is leaving. Mr. Law will succeed him, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer will name a new chairman. Serving 2.8 million people, the authority ranks as one of the nation's largest municipal utilities. 
 ''Everything is on the table,'' Mr. Law said in an interview outlining his vision. ''LIPA has been in its infancy, and now we're going into the teenager years. I want to explore what it will be when it grows up. We want to make it a leader in the nation.''
 Mr. Law listed his priorities as conservation, renewable energy, modernizing plants, overseeing National Grid and making the authority more transparent.
 Though Mr. Law effectively ended the wind turbine project, he said he remained committed to renewable energy, including other wind turbine projects. ''No one wants to be held hostage to Mideast oil,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kessel also remains a proponent of wind turbines, calling them the only way to meet state standards for renewable energy.
 Skeptics contend that the wind is not strong enough here. ''Long Island is not a great place for wind power,'' said Matthew C. Cordaro, a former Lilco official who is now an energy professor at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University.
 One hurdle for renewable energy is that wind, solar and tidal power cost more than fossil fuel, critics say. The public likes the concept, Mr. Law said, ''but if you ask would you pay more for it, then the question gets dicier.''
 Environmentalists dispute the cost comparisons. ''You have to get away from today's cost and look at tomorrow's -- the cost of oil 20 years from now,'' said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Campaign for the Environment. 
 There are also hidden costs of fossil fuel, including health hazards, global warming and geopolitical strain, Ms. Esposito said. 
 Some of the renewable-energy technology is experimental, like the tidal turbines recently installed in the East River -- then shut down for modification after a string of mishaps.
 Only about 1,000 homes on Long Island have gone solar, said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the nonprofit Renewable Energy Long Island. Vouching for the savings, he said he pays about $6 a month for electricity after he built an efficient home and installed solar panels.
 As for conservation, Mr. Law said: ''The cheapest way to save money is the plant we don't have to build. We are going to have really aggressive conservation: 15 by 15 -- reducing demand 15 percent by 2015.'' 
 Dr. Cordaro agreed: ''Conservation is the low-hanging fruit, things like replacing all your light bulbs. It makes a lot of sense.''
 Replacing the generators at existing plants would yield more electricity at a lower cost with fewer emissions, energy experts agree. The problem, Mr. Kessel said, is construction and equipment costs that could exceed $1 billion per plant.
 The current power system supplanted Lilco, unpopular for its sketchy service record and electric rates that were the highest in the continental United States. 
 ''We've come a long way from the old Lilco days,'' Mr. Kessel said, ''from the worst performing utility in the state to the best.'' The authority has added 2,000 megawatts; its one-day record for peak demand is about 5,800 megawatts. 
 But customers still grouse about high bills, since the initial savings of about 20 percent after LIPA took over from Lilco have been offset by rising oil and gas prices. The authority also passes along to customers $325 million a year in property taxes. 
 Despite the progress here, critics like Dr. Cordaro say LIPA succumbed to political interference by Republicans. Martin R. Cantor, an economist at Dowling College, lamented that the agency was still saddled with the multibillion-dollar debt from the never-opened Shoreham nuclear plant.
 One former authority board member, Sheldon R. Sackstein, said that it ''could have done much more'' by bidding the deals with KeySpan and National Grid more competitively -- or, better yet, taking over the power plants and workforce as a full-fledged public utility.
 Mr. Kessel said he was dubious about tinkering with the current structure. But his successor, Mr. Law, left the possibility open. ''Maybe it makes sense for those people to be in LIPA,'' he said of KeySpan's workers, ''and for LIPA to own the generation plants.''

HEADLINE: Can Michael Dell Refocus His Namesake?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Round Rock, Tex. 
 ON a recent afternoon at his company's headquarters here, Michael S. Dell is seated in a spacious conference room named Dobie Hall -- in honor of the University of Texas dormitory where, in 1984, he started the computer giant that bears his name. 
 He boasts that Dell Inc. has just reported quarterly profits that exceeded Wall Street projections. It's an encouraging sign, he says, that the company -- buffeted by high-profile production problems and accounting shenanigans -- is finally regaining momentum.
 Over the last few years, Dell, once the gold standard among PC makers, has simply overlooked major growth trends in personal computing. It missed significant shifts in notebook computer sales and the consumer market as a whole, lagged competitors in international sales, and lost the profit edge that it enjoyed from its superior procurement-and-supply network. Hewlett-Packard, having overcome its own woes, passed Dell last year as the largest seller of PCs worldwide. 
 Dell's ills also extend beyond the nuts-and-bolts of making and marketing PCs. After a yearlong internal investigation, Dell conceded last month that some managers had falsified quarterly results to meet sales targets from 2003 to 2006. The company expects to reduce earnings over those years by $50 million to $150 million, tiny sums compared with the billions of dollars in profits it earned during that same period. (Dell posted annual sales of about $57 billion last year.) Yet the accounting disclosures suggest a corporate culture in which at least some senior managers felt under such pressure that they doctored the numbers; the disclosures have prompted a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
 ''The company was too focused on the short term, and the balance of priorities was way too leaning toward things that deliver short-term results -- that was the major root cause,'' explains Mr. Dell, dressed for the Texas summer in a short-sleeved polo shirt and jeans. 
 The recent setbacks would be humbling for any company, but especially so for Dell, a smooth-running machine for years and a model of the efficiencies that the shrewd use of technology and customer information can produce. Dell was widely admired beyond the technology industry, and it was cited in business-school studies alongside companies like Wal-Mart Stores.
 Successful entrepreneurs, of course, are hardwired by inclination and necessity to look beyond immediate hurdles for opportunities, and Mr. Dell is no exception. He says he is not leading a simple turnaround, but rather a long-term campaign to transform a company known for a cultlike adherence to a certain way of doing business. 
 As the company surged to the lead in the PC industry, the ''Dell model'' relied on direct sales over the Internet and by telephone rather than through retail stores, cutting prices to gain market share, focusing on computer hardware rather than services, leaning heavily on the American market and avoiding acquisitions. But since Mr. Dell reclaimed the role of chief executive in late January, he has changed all that. 
 At internal meetings, he repeatedly emphasizes that the Dell model ''is not a religion,'' according to staff members. Moreover, Mr. Dell -- who once ran a company famous for its laserlike devotion to next week rather than next year -- no longer champions short-term goals and fixes. ''We're moving the needle in terms of getting focused on the right long-term issues,'' he says.
 But re-engineering the Dell model will be a daunting challenge. ''Dell continued to do the same old thing, when it was no longer working,'' observes David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''This is going to be about changing the way they do business at many levels.''
 ''Dell can do it,'' Mr. Yoffie adds, ''but it's going to take a lot more innovation on more fronts than the company has shown in the past.''
 LAST year was, to borrow a term, the annus horribilis for Dell. Its problems kept building throughout 2006: sluggish growth, disappointing financial results, complaints about customer service, even a high-profile safety recall of notebook computer batteries. Not all of these were the company's fault. For example, Sony made the batteries that could overheat and catch fire, causing other companies like Apple to also issue recalls.
 But there was no disputing that Dell had stalled. Wall Street, as well as Dell's own board, had become impatient with the company's management. So a change came quickly early this year, at the end of January. Dell's outside directors voted unanimously that the company needed a single leader instead of having a chairman (Mr. Dell) and a separate chief executive (Kevin B. Rollins, who had been C.E.O. since 2004). 
 At the time, Mr. Dell was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and when the board asked him to become chief executive, he agreed. There were a few long walks, he recalls, when he was ''deep in thought'' about how to proceed, but he did not hesitate about taking over. He had built the company, after all, and his name was on every box it shipped.
 ''I have a responsibility,'' he says. 
 So, on Jan. 31, Mr. Dell became chief executive -- again -- and Mr. Rollins, a former Bain consultant who joined Dell in 1996, was out. Mr. Dell describes Mr. Rollins as a ''great business partner and friend.'' Other executives at Dell also point to Mr. Rollins's contributions over the years, as the operating field general beside Mr. Dell during the years of torrid growth. But Mr. Rollins, they say, was seen as the foremost practitioner, and advocate, of the old Dell model, even when pushing the same buttons no longer worked.
 Still, Dell executives are quick to say that Mr. Dell's return as chief executive has nothing to do with any sharp differences between him and his predecessor. Rather, it was due to the depth of Dell's troubles and the need for someone to assume control and forcefully take the company on a different path. 
 ''It's not all about Michael versus someone else before,'' says Paul D. Bell, a senior vice president. ''Michael was here. He was chairman. But it was up to Michael to take the first-mover role in driving change and he did it.''
 Mr. Dell began shaking things up immediately. He has recruited senior executives to lead the company's marketing, consumer products, operations and services business. He is also paring layers of middle management as part of a plan to trim Dell's payroll by 10 percent, or roughly 8,800 workers.
 In recent months, the company has stepped beyond selling over the Internet and by telephone -- the famous Dell direct model. It has forged retail agreements to sell computers at Wal-Mart stores in the United States, at Carphone Warehouse outlets in Europe and at Bic Camera stores in Japan. More retail deals are in the works. 
 Rethinking the retail business was a matter of necessity. A lot has changed, Mr. Dell notes, since the company tried and abruptly exited retail sales in 1994. The shift in the consumer computer market and toward notebooks, which customers want to touch before buying, is part of it. So is Dell's need to do better in markets abroad, where people are less comfortable buying computers by phone or over the Internet. ''We're going after those new customers with retail partners,'' Mr. Dell says. 
 He also moved quickly on another front. Whereas the Dell of old shunned acquisitions, the company is now willing to go shopping. It has made three deals in the last two months -- business and consumer software companies -- and there will be more, Mr. Dell says. But he says that they will be limited to purchases of smaller companies and start-ups, with 50 to 500 employees, to add technology and expertise that promise to ''turbocharge growth'' in businesses earmarked for investment and rapid expansion, like services, consumer offerings, international sales and building data centers tailored for big Web companies.
 The consumer market looms large for Mr. Dell. Consumers were traditionally an afterthought at Dell, which garners more than 80 percent of its sales from corporate customers. Home computer users generally had to settle for business computers that were tweaked a bit for the masses and were little more than bland, generic boxes.
 But in recent years, consumers became picky. Where users once focused on price, processing speed and storage capacity, they now looked for stylish, well-designed machines as well -- a trend common throughout the entire consumer electronics business, but one that was lost on Dell.
 ''On the consumer side, we're drastically changing what we're doing,'' Mr. Dell says. ''We're only touching the surface of the opportunity now.''
 Ronald G. Garriques, who joined Dell from Motorola in February, is guiding the change in Dell's consumer strategy. Selling machines with more flair in retail stores is part of the plan, said Mr. Garriques, president of the global consumer group, a new position at Dell. But he suggests that Dell will take a hybrid approach, offering hardware options, extra features and services through its Dell.com site on machines that it also sells in stores.
 Dell's direct online relationship with customers, Mr. Garriques says, can help it develop services that link PCs, software and cellphones. To illustrate Dell's thinking, he describes as a possibility a service that would allow parents to use Web maps and cellphone signals to track family members on the screen of a Dell PC in the kitchen. ''With Dell's direct-to-consumer model,'' he says, ''we can bring that as a solution to families.'' 
 Such offerings, he says, don't have to generate big profits on their own. ''Great services sell a lot of devices that use those services,'' says Mr. Garriques, noting how Apple's iTunes music service has fed iPod sales.
 Dell also hopes to offer services on hardware beyond PCs. Last month, the company agreed to buy Zing Systems, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes software for hand-held devices that manage and exchange entertainment wirelessly, without the need for a PC. Zing's founder is Tim Bucher, a former product designer at Apple.
 Stale design remains an issue, and something the company has to continue to address if it wants to lift consumer sales. It recently recruited designers from around the world and more than doubled the size of its design group, to 80, in the last year. Dell designers now speak of product ''love'' and ''lust,'' observes Ken Musgrave, the director of industrial design -- a far cry from just a few years ago, when design always took a back seat to competitive pricing. 
 In June, Dell introduced notebook computers in eight colors. And color, Mr. Musgrave says, is merely the ''first level of personalization'' for Dell. He showed off prototype notebook shells in different materials and designs, noting that Dell's build-to-order system gives it the freedom to make highly stylized and personalized machines in limited runs of just dozens to a few hundred. ''There are a lot of different design levers to pull for the future,'' he says.
 AS soon as he took over as chief executive, Mr. Dell declared a two-month ''amnesty'' to encourage people to discuss problems and deal with them quickly, without fear of being fired or demoted. Otherwise, Mr. Dell says, managers might have understated troubles and defended past decisions. 
 One common issue, he says, was that there was ''no central leader'' in areas like manufacturing, services, sales and marketing. A decentralized organization of many go-it-alone groups, focused on regional markets, made sense when Dell was growing from $5 billion to more than $55 billion in annual revenue over the previous decade, faster than any technology company in history. Then, chasing growth opportunities was the priority.
 Dell's marketing epitomized the fragmented approach. When Mark Jarvis joined Dell as its chief marketing officer in April, he did an inventory of the advertising and marketing firms that worked for the company worldwide. The total count was 869. ''The company didn't really evolve, it just grew,'' he says.
 Mr. Jarvis is now moving to streamline Dell's marketing. In the last month, he has cut in half the number of the company's marketing and ad agencies. By the end of October, he says, Dell will select a lead worldwide agency. One goal, he says, is greater consistency in the themes, message and approach of the company's marketing. The new internal marketing slogan is ''One Company, One Brand, One Beat.'' Already, there is a change in the look of Dell ads. Themes like ease of use and personalization are prominently featured. 
 Mr. Jarvis, a former Oracle executive, says Dell's brand is widely known and respected, but often not linked to a clear message. So he wants to give the brand a makeover, saying that in the consumer market, it needs to be ''much cooler and go away from low prices; a lot of people see us as a cheap PC company, and that's not where we want to be.''
 In the corporate market, Dell plans to pitch itself as the company that can simplify information technology for businesses, part of an effort to gain market share from competitors like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. When asked how his long-term agenda will change the company, Mr. Dell is direct: ''It will push us much more into solutions and services from products. That doesn't mean products go away. But there's going to be a big element of doing more for customers through services.''
 The services strategy is long overdue. Services is a bigger market than hardware, and corporate customers were asking Dell to do more to help them manage their data centers more efficiently, according to current and former company executives. But Dell was slow to react, and the lapse illustrates the perils of doggedly sticking to the old model and ignoring a promising new market. Instead of making long-term investments in building a services business, Dell just kept its eye on hitting quarterly sales targets by peddling Dell hardware and other companies' software.
 Dell recruited Stephen F. Schuckenbrock last December from Electronic Data Systems to lead its services business. Today, Dell garners $5 billion a year in services revenue, but most of that comes from technical support and maintenance on Dell machines. 
 Mr. Schuckenbrock wants Dell to help corporations run their data centers, while reducing hardware budgets, energy consumption and staffing. Mr. Schuckenbrock predicts that services will grow three to four times faster than the company's overall growth rate. A former Dell executive, who requested anonymity because he is forbidden to discuss company matters, said a recent internal report concluded that the company's annual revenue from services could reach $20 billion over the next five to seven years.
 Dell is already a major reseller of VMware, the dominant maker of virtual machine software used to juggle operating systems and applications on a single server. Dell plans to expand the relationship with VMware by offering virtualization services and its own data-center tools. In July, Dell bought SilverBack Technologies, a start-up that makes software to monitor and manage computers. The goal, Mr. Schuckenbrock says, is to offer ''the best point of view, technology and solutions to optimize industry-standard data centers.''
 Until a year or so ago, Dell tried to sell its standard products to leading Web giants like Yahoo, Salesforce.com and Microsoft. But those customers wanted something different. Eventually, Dell listened and designed circuit boards, cabling, racks and power management systems to suit the requirements of large individual customers. (Google, which still designs and builds its own computers, is not yet among them.) Prototypes can be built in weeks, with thousands of the custom-made computers shipping in months. That rapid response, says Brad Anderson, a senior vice president, is ''really back to Dell's roots.'' 
 Mr. Anderson says that the biggest initial hurdle for Dell on these big deals is its reputation as a producer of commodity computers. ''It takes time to convince them that Dell is committed to novel products and real innovation,'' he says.
 DELL still faces formidable obstacles as it tries to regain its footing. Just three years ago, Dell's hyperefficient operations gave it margins that were six to eight percentage points higher than those of its principal rival, Hewlett-Packard, according to a recent report by Sanford C. Bernstein. Today, Dell has no such edge.
 ''We created this incredible supply chain, and that sort of stagnated,'' Mr. Dell acknowledges. ''We squandered that away. Some of our competitors jumped over us in a Darwinian way. Now it's our turn.''
 To solve his operating headaches, Mr. Dell brought in Michael R. Cannon, the chief executive of the Solectron Corporation, a contract manufacturer, as Dell's head of global operations in late February. Mr. Cannon is convinced that Dell can regain its advantage by tightly integrating regional operations into a close-knit global network. ''Manufacturing is going to be a core competence at Dell,'' Mr. Cannon says, ''and there is a lot of room for innovation.''
 But the Dell manufacturing machine has sputtered recently. It has had trouble perfecting the bright colors on its new notebook computers, resulting in shipment delays and irritated customers. Dell says it is moving swiftly to correct the production problem, caused in part because it significantly underestimated demand for its new notebooks.
 Dell's corporate comeback, its founder says, will not always go smoothly. ''Hey, we've got a lot of work to do,'' Mr. Dell concedes, ''and we're just getting started.''
 And the man once known as a by-the-numbers, short-term thinker is now, apparently, planning many years ahead. Asked about how long he intends to remain chief executive, Mr. Dell compares himself to Wal-Mart's founder. 
 ''I'm 42 years old. I think that would put me on the young side for C.E.O.'s,'' he says. ''I don't think Sam Walton became a C.E.O. until he was 45.'' 
 So how long will he remain C.E.O., then? ''A long time,'' he responds.

HEADLINE: As the Iraqis Stand Down, We'll Stand Up

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
IT will be all 9/11 all the time this week, as the White House yet again synchronizes its drumbeating for the Iraq war with the anniversary of an attack that had nothing to do with Iraq. Ignore that fog and focus instead on another date whose anniversary passed yesterday without notice: Sept. 8, 2002. What happened on that Sunday five years ago is the Rosetta Stone for the administration's latest scam. 
 That was the morning when the Bush White House officially rolled out its fraudulent case for the war. The four horsemen of the apocalypse -- Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell and Rice -- were dispatched en masse to the Washington talk shows, where they eagerly pointed to a front-page New York Times article amplifying subsequently debunked administration claims that Saddam had sought to buy aluminum tubes meant for nuclear weapons. ''We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,'' said Condoleezza Rice on CNN, introducing a sales pitch concocted by a White House speechwriter. 
 What followed was an epic propaganda onslaught of distorted intelligence, fake news, credulous and erroneous reporting by bona fide journalists, presidential playacting and Congressional fecklessness. Much of it had been plotted that summer of 2002 by the then-secret White House Iraq Group (WHIG), a small task force of administration brass charged with the Iraq con job. 
 Today the spirit of WHIG lives. In the stay-the-surge propaganda offensive that crests with this week's Congressional testimony of Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, history is repeating itself in almost every particular. Even the specter of imminent ''nuclear holocaust'' has been rebooted in President Bush's arsenal of rhetorical scare tactics.
 The new WHIG is a 24/7 Pentagon information ''war room'' conceived in the last throes of the Rumsfeld regime and run by a former ABC News producer. White House ''facts'' about the surge's triumph are turning up unsubstantiated in newspapers and on TV. Instead of being bombarded with dire cherry-picked intelligence about W.M.D., this time we're being serenaded with feel-good cherry-picked statistics offering hope. Once again the fix is in. Mr. Bush's pretense that he has been waiting for the Petraeus-Crocker report before setting his policy is as bogus as his U.N. charade before the war. And once again a narrowly Democratic Senate lacks the votes to stop him. 
 As always with this White House, telegenic artificial realities are paramount. Exhibit A, of course, was last weekend's precisely timed ''surprise'' presidential junket: Mr. Bush took the measure of success ''on the ground here in Anbar'' (as he put it) without ever leaving a heavily fortified American base. 
 A more elaborate example of administration Disneyland can be found in those bubbly Baghdad markets visited by John McCain and other dignitaries whenever the cameras roll. Last week The Washington Post discovered that at least one of them, the Dora market, is a Potemkin village, open only a few hours a day and produced by $2,500 grants (a k a bribes) bestowed on the shopkeepers. ''This is General Petraeus's baby,'' Staff Sgt. Josh Campbell told The Post. ''Personally, I think it's a false impression.'' Another U.S. officer said that even shops that ''sell dust'' or merely ''intend to sell goods'' are included in the Pentagon's count of the market's reopened businesses.
 One Baghdad visitor left unimpressed was Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Chicago, who dined with her delegation in Mr. Crocker's Green Zone residence last month while General Petraeus delivered his spiel. ''He's spending an awful lot of time wining and dining members of Congress,'' she told me last week. Though the menu included that native specialty lobster tortellini, the real bill of fare, Ms. Schakowsky said, was a rigid set of talking points: ''Anbar,'' ''bottom up,'' ''decrease in violence'' and ''success.''
 In this new White House narrative, victory has been downsized to a successful antiterrorist alliance between Sunni tribal leaders and the American military in Anbar, a single province containing less than 5 percent of Iraq's population. In truth, the surge had little to do with this development, which was already being trumpeted by Mr. Bush in his January prime-time speech announcing the surge. 
 Even if you believe that it's a good idea to bond with former Saddamists who may have American blood on their hands, the chances of this ''bottom up'' model replicating itself are slim. Anbar's population is almost exclusively Sunni. Much of the rest of Iraq is consumed by the Sunni-Shiite and Shiite-Shiite civil wars that are M.I.A. in White House talking points. 
 The ''decrease in violence'' fable is even more insidious. Though both General Petraeus and a White House fact sheet have recently boasted of a 75 percent decline in sectarian attacks, this number turns out to be as cooked as those tallies of Saddam's weapons sites once peddled by WHIG. As The Washington Post reported on Thursday, it excludes Shiite-on-Shiite and Sunni-on-Sunni violence. The Government Accountability Office, which rejected that fuzzy math, found overall violence unchanged using the methodology practiced by the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency. 
 No doubt General Petraeus, like Dick Cheney before him, will say that his own data is ''pretty well confirmed'' by classified intelligence that can't be divulged without endangering national security. Meanwhile, the White House will ruthlessly undermine any reality-based information that contradicts its propaganda, much as it dismissed the accurate W.M.D. findings of the United Nations weapon experts Hans Blix and Mohammed ElBaradei before the war. General Petraeus intervened to soften last month's harsh National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq. Last week the administration and its ideological surrogates were tireless in trashing the nonpartisan G.A.O. report card that found the Iraqi government flunking most of its benchmarks.
 Those benchmarks, the war's dead- enders now say, are obsolete anyway. But what about the president's own benchmarks? Remember ''as the Iraqis stand up, we'll stand down''? General Petraeus was once in charge of the Iraqi Army's training and proclaimed it ''on track and increasing in capacity'' three years ago. On Thursday, an independent commission convened by the Republican John Warner and populated by retired military officers and police chiefs reported that Iraqi forces can take charge no sooner than 12 to 18 months from now, and that the corrupt Iraqi police force has to be rebuilt from scratch. Let us not forget, either, Mr. Bush's former top-down benchmarks for measuring success: ''an Iraq that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself.'' On that scorecard, he's batting 0 for 3. 
 What's surprising is not that this White House makes stuff up, but that even after all the journalistic embarrassments in the run-up to the war its fictions can still infiltrate the real news. After Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack, two Brookings Institution scholars, wrote a New York Times Op-Ed article in July spreading glad tidings of falling civilian fatality rates, they were widely damned for trying to pass themselves off as tough war critics (both had supported the war and the surge) and for not mentioning that their fact-finding visit to Iraq was largely dictated by a Department of Defense itinerary. 
 But this has not impeded them from posing as quasi-journalistic independent observers elsewhere ever since, whether on CNN, CBS, Fox or in these pages, identifying themselves as experts rather than Pentagon junketeers. Unlike Armstrong Williams, the talking head and columnist who clandestinely received big government bucks to ''regularly comment'' on No Child Left Behind, they received no cash. But why pay for what you can get free? Two weeks ago Mr. O'Hanlon popped up on The Washington Post op-ed page, again pushing rosy Iraq scenarios, including an upbeat prognosis for economic reconstruction, even though the G.A.O. found that little of the $10 billion earmarked for reconstruction is likely to be spent.
 Anchoring the ''CBS Evening News'' from Iraq last week, Katie Couric seemed to be drinking the same Kool-Aid (or eating the same lobster tortellini) as Mr. O'Hanlon. As ''a snapshot of what's going right,'' she cited Falluja, a bombed-out city with 80 percent unemployment, and she repeatedly spoke of American victories against ''Al Qaeda.'' Channeling the president's bait-and-switch, she never differentiated between that local group he calls ''Al Qaeda in Iraq'' and the Qaeda that attacked America on 9/11. Al Qaeda in Iraq, which didn't even exist on 9/11, may represent as little as 2 to 5 percent of the Sunni insurgency, according to a new investigation in The Washington Monthly by Andrew Tilghman, a former Iraq correspondent for Stars and Stripes. 
 Next to such ''real'' news from CBS, the ''fake'' news at the network's corporate sibling Comedy Central was, not for the first time, more trustworthy. Rob Riggle, a ''Daily Show'' correspondent who also serves in the Marine Reserve, invited American troops in Iraq to speak candidly about the Iraqi Parliament's vacation.
 When the line separating spin from reality is so effectively blurred, the White House's propaganda mission has once more been accomplished. No wonder President Bush is cocky again. Stopping in Sydney for the economic summit after last weekend's photo op in Iraq, he reportedly told Australia's deputy prime minister that ''we're kicking ass.'' This war has now gone on so long that perhaps he has forgotten the price our troops paid the last time he taunted our adversaries to bring it on, some four years and 3,500 American military fatalities ago.

HEADLINE: Our Man in Panama

BYLINE: By EVERETT ELLIS BRIGGS. 
Everett Ellis Briggs was the United States ambassador to Panama from 1982 to 1986, the ambassador to Honduras from 1986 to 1989, and a member of the National Security Council staff in 1989.

 BODY:
Norfolk, Conn.
 THE deposed dictator of Panama, Manuel Antonio Noriega, was to have been released from a federal prison outside Miami today after serving 15 years of a 30-year sentence for narcotics trafficking. Instead, he remains behind bars pending extradition to France, where he is wanted for money laundering. And that's not Mr. Noriega's only legal problem: in Panama there is a warrant for his arrest for the 1985 assassination of a political opponent, Hugo Spadafora. 
 As Mr. Noriega re-emerges from the shadows, it's worth remembering how badly the United States mishandled the Panamanian misadventure, which led to the loss of hundreds of lives and cost us politically throughout the region. Mr. Noriega's rise and fall is instructive only insofar as it tells us how the United States should not conduct itself when faced with a thuggish foreign dictator who happens also to have been a longtime intelligence ''asset.'' 
 I witnessed the Noriega fiasco firsthand. After years in charge of Panama's intelligence service, he ascended to power during my term as ambassador to Panama. Later, when I was ambassador to nearby Honduras and then as a member of the National Security Council under President George H. W. Bush, I had bit parts in the unfolding drama. 
 This is my version of what happened in the years between the time he seized power and his capture in 1989. 
 In the summer of 1985, during Ronald Reagan's second term as president, I made a stopover in Mexico City, on my way to Panama, to visit my friend Jack Gavin, the actor turned diplomat who was then the ambassador to Mexico. Ed Meese, the attorney general, happened to be visiting at the same time, and the two of us sat down with the Gavins for supper.
 I complained to Mr. Meese about the United States government's apparent unwillingness to investigate General Noriega's involvement with the drug trade. Once or twice a month, Panamanians would ask members of my staff, ''When are you guys going to do something about Noriega and his drug smuggling?'' But whenever I asked my intelligence people or the Drug Enforcement Administration to investigate a particular story, invariably I was told there was nothing to the allegations. 
 General Noriega's longtime relationship with our military and civilian intelligence services, and the drug agency's apparent satisfaction with the crumbs of cooperation it was getting from his Panamanian Defense Forces, were the only ways to explain Washington's apparent lack of curiosity, I suggested. 
 Meanwhile, I said, General Noriega was trying to undermine the presidency of Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a respected international banker and former student of George Shultz, then the secretary of state. Having maneuvered himself into command of the country's military in 1984, General Noriega had originally thrown his weight behind Mr. Barletta, helping him win a seriously flawed ''election'' that earned Mr. Barletta the nickname ''Fraudito'' in opposition circles.
 But when Mr. Barletta tried to govern honestly -- to rein in the bureaucracy, reform the banks and the legal system, and direct government assistance so that it would nourish the economy rather than enrich Panamanian kleptocrats -- General Noriega decided he must go. That was a problem, I argued. Panama needed someone like Mr. Barletta in power, particularly with the scheduled turnover of the canal and the treaty-mandated American exit from the isthmus by 2000. 
 I was delighted when Mr. Meese immediately instructed the two assistants who were with him to open a Justice Department investigation into General Noriega's possible involvement with drug trafficking. It was Mr. Meese's decisiveness that gave me comfort when, not long after the dinner, General Noriega finally forced Mr. Barletta to resign in favor of a more pliant successor. At least the attorney general would be keeping an eye on the general.
 At first, the Reagan administration seemed focused on the problem. After Mr. Barletta's September resignation, the United States decided to try to block General Noriega from interfering with Panama's civilian government. Soon after Mr. Barletta's departure, John Poindexter, the national security adviser, and Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, made a secret stopover at an Air Force base in the former Canal Zone, near Panama City. In a private lounge away from any base activity, the three of us met with General Noriega.
 Our underlying message was this: You know the current state of our relations with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua (where the Pentagon was providing support to the contras in their war against the ruling government). If you continue to act as a destabilizing force, you can expect the United States to turn on you as we have turned on them. 
 General Noriega knew of America's covert support for the contras, because he had collaborated with us on several occasions. So he had to understand the warning. Unfortunately, in the first in a series of missteps, our message was compromised. Right after the meeting, without my authorization, the local C.I.A. chief in Panama called on General Noriega to find out how the meeting had gone. The general must have taken this visit as an indication that he need not worry, because his old friends in intelligence remained supportive.
 Within hours of the Air Force base meeting, I left for Washington, for an interagency review of the Panamanian situation. At Mr. Abrams's office at the State Department, I quickly learned that Mr. Poindexter's trip had probably been for naught. His strong message would not be accompanied by any actions. The consensus was that so long as the United States was focused on fighting the Sandinistas and their communist allies in El Salvador and Guatemala, we could not afford to swing at another hornets' nest. 
 Neither the Pentagon nor the C.I.A. showed any inclination to break with the general, and said as much. He could cause considerable embarrassment for his longtime patrons. Worse, he could disrupt the day-to-day business of our military stationed in Panama. The general was, as far as I know, on at least a couple of payrolls and was supposedly providing us intelligence, though during my time in Panama I didn't see that he produced anything of real use. 
 And the accusations of narcotics trafficking? I do not recall that there was any mention of the Justice Department investigation. I suspect I didn't bring it up because I didn't want to. Given the power of those who were opposed to taking action against General Noriega, it would have seemed prudent to keep the investigation out of the discussion. 
 After the meeting, I returned to my post in Panama. Once there, I tried my best to ostracize General Noriega by keeping visiting dignitaries away from him. I hoped to signal American disapproval, to persuade his military colleagues to ditch him and to inspire the democratic opposition to regroup.
 But after only two weeks, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. undermined my intended message. During a visit to military units in Panama, he arranged to make a courtesy call on General Noriega. I sought to dissuade the admiral, citing the sitdown with Mr. Poindexter. When I suggested his ''courtesy'' might be misinterpreted, Admiral Crowe waved me away with a curt rejoinder: ''Poindexter is only a vice admiral.''
 Obviously, my efforts to isolate General Noriega did not prosper -- but I did what I could. When Vernon Walters, a high-ranking C.I.A. official, sent the general a very cordial Christmas greeting via the diplomatic pouch, I managed to intercept and destroy the message (without Mr. Walters's knowledge). 
 A few months later, in early 1986, my tour in Panama ended. Within a year, General Noriega was in full control of all the levers of power in Panama. The entire government would soon realize what some of us had felt from the beginning: General Noriega was a monster and a crook. He began rounding up and torturing opposition leaders, continued laundering drug money and threatened the prospects for an orderly transfer of the canal.
 My day-to-day involvement with the ''Noriega problem'' ostensibly ended with my 1986 transfer to Honduras, but the feeling of futility persisted over the next couple of years. 
 Washington, having now decided that some sort of action must be taken against the dictator, pinned all its hopes on a renegade officer in the Panamanian military who was supposed to lead a coup -- despite this individual's clear lack of a following inside the military and among the civilian population. 
 In any case, our government soon threw away whatever leverage it might have had with General Noriega's inner circle by announcing that the entire Panamanian leadership was now barred from entering the United States. Whatever slim chance we had of persuading a turncoat was dashed. (Shortly before the 1989 invasion, a group of second-level officers did try to oust General Noriega, but the attempt proved a failure, with the leaders summarily executed.)
 The real trouble in the years leading up to the invasion was caused by the Justice Department investigation in which I had placed so much hope. The investigation backfired, wrecking the ability of our government to deal with General Noriega without the use of force or the loss of lives. 
 In February 1988, the public announcement of General Noriega's indictments for drug trafficking made normal relations with Panama impossible. Beginning with my conversation with Mr. Meese in Mexico City and throughout the months and years that followed, again and again I was told that General Noriega's indictment, once reached, would be sealed. By not making the indictment public, we could grab General Noriega the next time he came to the United States to see his Miami dentist or to gamble in Las Vegas, or even if he accepted an invitation to visit the C.I.A. or the Pentagon. 
 The last time I received this assurance, from someone at the National Security Council, was three days before the news media reported the indictments.
 Justice's failure to control its prosecutors set off the endgame. In the wake of the announcement, the State Department tried to persuade General Noriega to accept a plea and surrender to American justice. Failing that, it proposed, incredibly, that he relinquish power and go into retirement somewhere else, like Venezuela or Spain. 
 This drama took so long to unfold that, by the end of the year, I was serving under a new president, George H. W. Bush, as the chief Latin American adviser at the National Security Council. During my very brief time there, I learned that two key members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, had blocked a proposal to deal with General Noriega by snatching him. The operation wasn't imminent, but the senators opposed even drawing up a plan for it on the curious grounds that any attempted clandestine operation against General Noriega might cause his death. I urged my immediate boss on the council, Brent Scowcroft, to reconsider the idea, but he told me it had already been vetoed.
 By the fall of 1989, General Noriega forced the issue by having his forces begin harassing American civilians and members of the military in Panama. And so our military invaded in December and brought General Noriega, in chains, to trial in this country. 
 (Rumor has it that when American forces broke into General Noriega's house in Panama City they found a freezer full of bundles of voodoo candles, each wrapped in a piece of paper with one of his enemies' names on it, and that one of these candles bore my name. My efforts to retrieve the candle from the C.I.A., however, have been unavailing.)
 DESPITE deserving credit for going after General Noriega, the Department of Justice is the chief culprit in this sorry story for allowing the indictments to be publicized. Although that decision led to the prosecution of a wanted felon, the success was accomplished at the cost of heavy collateral damage.
 Almost everyone in government, however, shares some of the blame. America's civilian and military intelligence agencies must be fingered for putting General Noriega on their payrolls, for being unable or unwilling to detect his criminal activities and for their resistance to ditching him once it became obvious that he was out of control.
 Those running administration policy toward Latin America, myself included, failed to deal decisively with General Noriega or even to fashion a strategy to deal with him. That interagency meeting should have produced a plan. The Pentagon and the C.I.A. should have been brought to heel. The White House should not have allowed a couple of senators to determine how to handle the problem. And although the narcotics investigation at Justice was crucial, it should have been part of the plan, not independent of other considerations.
 Of course, as with the present-day foreign policy issues that plague Washington, it is easy in retrospect to say that everyone should have acted with greater foresight, wisdom and determination.
 As for what the United States should do about Mr. Noriega now that he has completed his prison term, my answer would be to pack him off to France, where he has been sentenced to a 10-year prison term. Mr. Noriega still has the potential to disrupt Panama's highly charged political climate. Allowing the onetime dictator to return home would be one last way for this country to bungle its dealings with him.

HEADLINE: Some Labor Pains For First Data Deal

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
All last week, Wall Street was watching the high-stakes negotiations between Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and a group of big banks led by Citigroup, which must entice investors to buy $24 billion in bonds and loans to finance the First Data Corporation buyout. 
 But Henry C. Duques, First Data's chairman and chief executive, joked that he has a side bet over when the deal will ultimately close. Mr. Duques, whose is known as Ric, said in a recent interview that he is expecting his second grandchild and that his family organized a pool to wager on whether the baby arrives before the First Data acquisition is complete. The baby is due this Friday. The First Data deal is expected to close by the end of the month, according to the merger agreement. 
 So far, K.K.R. and the banks are still haggling over the price and terms of the financing, which could push back the closing date. Mr. Duques was mum about the details and his own bet. But he did offer this nugget: ''If it is a boy, and the deal closes before it is born, we may name the baby Henry.'' It was unclear if that would be after himself or Henry R. Kravis, K.K.R.'s founder. ERIC DASH
 ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH Nothing like the sighting of Google's mysterious -- and mysteriously large -- jet to stir speculation. Valleywag.com, a gossip site for Silicon Valley techies, posted a tip that the plane, a converted Boeing 767 wide body, had been seen sitting on the tarmac at the federally owned Moffett Field, which is near Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
 Google is in the final phases of negotiating a land lease to build facilities at Ames Research Center, where the airfield is located, as part of NASA's research park there, according to Jon Murchison, a company spokesman. But Mr. Murchison was unable to shed any light on the whereabouts of the plane, which, he said, ''is not owned by Google but by the founders,'' Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Nor could David Schwarz, who was the lawyer for Blue City, the holding company that is technically the plane's owner, during last year's dispute between the company and a designer who was hired to refit the plane and later fired. 
 Mr. Schwarz said that he is no longer representing Blue City, and Mr. Murchison said that there is no personal press officer for Mr. Page and Mr. Brin. 
 So why was the plane parked at Moffett? There has been a flurry of guesses on Valleywag.com, including ''exchanging science done on the airplane for a hangar and landing permission.'' But maybe it's just that, as one posting said, ''Helicopters are so ... East Coast.''ELIZABETH OLSON
 THE JET SET Frits van Paasschen, the new chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, will not be commuting a long distance on the shareholders' tab as his predecessor, Steven J. Heyer, did. But he will have plenty of access to the corporate jet. 
 Starwood has given Mr. van Paasschen less than 60 days to move from Colorado, where he was chief executive of the Coors Brewing Company, to a residence near its headquarters in White Plains. After the criticism of Mr. Heyer's frequent absence from the main office, Starwood said in Mr. van Paaschen's contract that he has ''to be regularly and consistently present at company's headquarters during business hours.'' 
 But Starwood also promised him $500,000 worth of personal use of company aircraft his first year. According to its 2007 proxy statement, that is more than Mr. Heyer's tally last year. Mr. van Paasschen also gets a $3 million sign-on bonus, $5 million in stock and options and a $1 million salary. PATRICK McGEEHANKEEP ON BLOGGING When Arianna Huffington won a Webby Award last year for her blog, The Huffington Post, she was limited to a five-word acceptance speech: ''Darlings, make blogs, not war.'' She plans to take a bit longer as keynote speaker at the first WebbyConnect conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., in October. 
 Ms. Huffington said she would discuss the hybrid future of old and new media at the conference, which will bring together previous award winners and judges, as well as leaders in entertainment, advertising and politics. She said she looked forward to being ''live blogged.'' ''When you read back, you notice your mannerisms, all the things that are kind of automatic. It's amusing.''
 She also said she hoped that chance meetings at the conference would be as productive as those at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. Meetings there with the television journalist Charlie Rose and with Jacob Weisberg, editor of Slate, will result in the first online ''mash up'' for Democratic presidential candidates, to be taped on Wednesday. The Huffington Post, Yahoo and Slate will be the hosts, and Mr. Rose will be the moderator.

HEADLINE: Bush Irks Australians, but They Can't Look Away

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
''Oh, you people are recording my every move,'' President Bush lamented to Annabel Crabb, a political columnist for a local newspaper, as she watched him pick his way through some pasta salad at a buffet barbecue for Australian troops the other day.
 He was right. 
 There was good news and bad news for Mr. Bush in his foray this week to the land down under. The good news is that Australians love Americans. The bad news is that they do not seem to love the American president.
 ''He's an easy fellow; he looks like a terrific bloke to have a drink with or have a barbecue with,'' said Matt Price, a political columnist for The Australian, a national newspaper. ''I think people are really schizoid about this visit. Australians really appreciate the American alliance, and we love America. But Bush is -- he's damaged goods.'' 
 With discussions at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum dull enough to put even the most dedicated policy wonk to sleep, and with Mr. Bush parked in Sydney for a four-night stretch (an eternity for a man who, on his last international trip, zipped through Poland in three hours), the president became the biggest story in town -- a sitting duck for the fun-loving, and very determined, Australian press corps. 
 He was an object of both fascination and ire, a strange and curious creature in a land that is filled with them.
 A local television station kept a video camera trained on the president's hotel. ''Let's check on Bush Cam,'' the announcer would intone. When Mr. Bush slipped out one afternoon for a bike ride, a helicopter news crew gave chase, filming close enough overhead to make the hearts of Secret Service agents palpitate. 
 Ms. Crabb's newspaper, The Sydney Morning Herald, ran an interactive Web feature: ''Give President George Bush an Australian makeover for his APEC visit.'' The site depicted Mr. Bush as a cartoon paper-doll cutout wearing only American flag underwear. Visitors were invited to dress him in attire that included a Crocodile Dundee hat, a koala costume and a word bubble that proclaimed, ''G'Day!!''
 Ms. Crabb said such attention was to be expected. ''It's kind of a reasonably significant national pastime in Australia to tell jokes about George W. Bush,'' she said. 
 And Mr. Bush, master of the malapropism, gave his critics fodder. During a speech on Friday, he thanked Prime Minister John Howard ''for being such a fine host for the OPEC summit'' -- a slip of the tongue that he quickly corrected, lest anyone think he was attending a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 Later, he mangled his pronunciation of ''Australian,'' rendering it much closer to ''Austrian.'' In anticipation of an Australian beef lunch, he proclaimed, ''I'm a meat guy.'' 
 Of course, it is the president's policies, not his food preferences, that irk Australians. 
 Mr. Bush is unpopular here largely because of the war in Iraq, but he also suffers a bit from guilt by association, for his close friendship with Mr. Howard, whose approval ratings are not much better than Mr. Bush's. 
 Australians like to say they live in the only country that has fought alongside the United States in every major war of the 20th and 21st centuries. (Britain opted out of Vietnam.) But a recent poll by the Lowy Institute for International Policy, a research group here, found that despite that fondness as allies, two-thirds of Australians surveyed said Mr. Bush had caused them to have an unfavorable view of the United States. 
 ''Australians have just made a judgment that the very muscular approach that America took was unpopular and unsuccessful, and it's damaged America's place in the world,'' said Michael Fullilove, who conducted the survey. ''And we don't like that, because we are a close U.S. ally. So in a sense, the damage that America did itself in those years is something that Australians hold against President Bush.''
 If Australians are angry with Mr. Bush, they do have their own peculiar way of showing it. For example, there was the effort by a group calling itself Bums for Bush (that would be bum as in bottom, not bum as in hobo), which advertised a ''world record moon attempt'' in Hyde Park here on Friday. ''Only 4,000 cheeks are needed,'' the advertisement said, to ''tell Bush what we really think about his visit.''
 With Sydney locked down under miles of steel fence to protect the leaders of the 21 nations attending the economic meeting, Mr. Bush -- who arrived well before the others so he could meet with Mr. Howard -- took the brunt of the blame for the heightened security. One of the first things he did here was to apologize. 
 ''Look,'' he told a reporter, ''I don't want to come to a community and say, you know, what a pain it is to have the American president.''
 Then an Australian television comedy crew poked holes in the $250 million security operation, steering a fake Canadian motorcade -- complete with an actor dressed up as Osama bin Laden -- through two police checkpoints, within shouting distance of the Intercontinental Hotel, where Mr. Bush was staying.
 The police, who arrested 11 people on charges of illegally entering a restricted zone, were not amused. The White House, which said Mr. Bush was never in any danger, was. 
 ''Absolutely hilarious,'' said the president's deputy press secretary, Dana Perino.
 Mr. Bush, for his part, seemed to sense the absurdity of his own situation. At the barbecue for the troops, under Ms. Crabb's watchful eye, he helpfully counted his own noodles (there were eight) in a scene she wrote about in her front-page column this way: ''Eight!'' he concluded. ''Eight noodles! There's your story! Nice helping you out!''
 The next day, Ms. Crabb sounded flustered -- and a bit charmed -- by a president who, aware she was trying to ridicule him, had deftly turned the tables. ''For a professional two-bit smart-aleck writer like myself,'' she said, ''it was an interesting realization.''

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton Tries to Do Good By Doing Good Business

 BODY:
Jonathan Rauch writing in The Atlantic about former President Bill Clinton's approach to philanthropy:
 Clinton says he has been concerned about climate change for years, but that a hostile Congress and cheap oil prevented him from doing much about it when he was in office. Out of office, one day he decided to replace every light bulb in his house with a compact fluorescent. But when he went to his local hardware store in Chappaqua, N.Y., he couldn't find bulbs in a lot of the shapes and sizes he needed. ''So I literally picked up the phone and called Jeff Immelt'' -- the C.E.O. of General Electric -- ''and I said, 'I'm trying to be a good customer. I'm trying to buy American, support G.E. I like your eco-initiatives. But I can't fill half these sockets. What am I going to do?' And he said, 'Well, make me a bigger market, and I'll make whatever bulbs you want.' '' 
 It's a charming story, if somewhat tarnished by the fact that, through a spokesman, Immelt said he had no recollection of the conversation. In any event, a light bulb had lit up in the ex-president's head. ''It struck me that we were in the same sort of deal,'' he says, ''where we have very low knowledge of the economic options among consumers, drastic undercapitalization, and a completely disorganized market.'' 
 Culture Clash
 Lourdes Garcia-Navarro reporting on National Public Radio's ''Morning Edition'' on threats to peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus.
 Though peyote ... has been used for hundreds of years by Mexican Indians, it only became popular ... after Carlos Castaneda ... wrote ''The Teachings of Don Juan'' in the 1970s ... 
 Now, the Mexican government and the Indian community that uses peyote in sacred ceremonies are warning that peyote is under threat.
 Peyote is the attraction for many of the foreigners who flock to ... northern Mexico ... The desert area ... is the most important for the sacred rites of the Huichol ...
 ''If peyote disappears, then their whole culture disappears,'' says Pedro Medellin, who heads a government study on the peyote population in the Huichol sacred areas.
 Oh, Big Brother!
 Robert Gellman, a Washington-based privacy and information policy consultant, offered some ''fanciful predictions'' on surveillance and tracking in 2020 on the Web site DMNews: 
 Every car will be required to have a transponder, and automated highway readers will record all trips. ... The system will collect fees for using congested roads, replace parking meters and prevent undesirable people from driving in certain areas. ... Driving with a malfunctioning transponder will be illegal. A black market will emerge in cars registered to ''clean'' or dead individuals. ...
 No one will be able to operate a computer without registering through a token, fingerprint or other identification device. ... Every individual will be required to maintain a personal Web page with basic contact information accessible by the government and the public. ... Currency will disappear and all money will be electronic. Every transaction will be permanently tracked. Private money systems will develop using tokens, gold and other forms of intrinsic value ...
 The health and insurance industries will try to control costs by monitoring food purchases. ... There will be a black market in unregistered junk food.

HEADLINE: And For My Second Act, I'll Make Some Money

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
A NEW book out last week reported that President Bush wants to hop on the lecture circuit when he leaves office in 2009 -- ''replenish the ol' coffers,'' as he put it in Robert Draper's account of his presidency, ''Dead Certain.'' 
 ''I don't know what my dad gets,'' the president told Mr. Draper. ''But it's more than 50, 75'' thousand dollars a speech. He added, ''Clinton's making a lot of money.'' 
 In recent years, virtually every president has left office and parlayed his experience into handsome fees. Criticism has followed.
 Ronald Reagan was excoriated for taking $2 million for two speeches in Japan, at a time when the United States was locked in economic battle with his hosts; George H. W. Bush's association with the Carlyle Group was held up to ridicule in Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11''; and Bill Clinton has been lambasted for extracting eye-popping fees, sometimes $350,000 a speech. 
 There was no exception for the current president, with critics accusing him -- in advance -- of venality, greed and capitalizing on his presidency in a time of war.
 In the book, Mr. Bush did not really explain his interest in more money. His assets are estimated at between $8 million and $20 million (and his daughters are out of college). Moreover, since the 1950s, when it was clear that Harry Truman could not afford even an office staff, the federal government has taken care of former presidents. Mr. Bush will receive an annual pension of $186,000, travel funds, mailing privileges, Secret Service protection, office space, staff, stationery and transition expenses.
 ''These are not people who are put out on the street destitute,'' said Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates tighter campaign finance rules.
 And yet, what is an ex-president to do with the rest of his life? They are now generally leaving office at a younger age than their predecessors and living longer. Mr. Bush will be 62 when he clears out; Bill Clinton was 54. Their youth makes it unrealistic to expect them to retire and vanish.
 ''Presidents have always been able to profit from their prominence,'' said Brian Flanagan, assistant director of the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies in Grand Rapids, Mich.
 Sometimes this surprises people. ''We've gotten to know our presidents through their careers in public service,'' he said. ''So people can feel betrayed or confused when they see a former president in a different light, cashing in on their celebrity. You see athletes doing it and movie stars. It's hard to put a president in the same category.''
 Mr. Bush has been vague about his post-presidential plans. He mentioned having ''a nice place in Dallas'' and setting up a Freedom Institute. Otherwise, he told Mr. Draper, ''I can just envision getting in the car, getting bored, going down to the ranch.''
 Mr. Bush is not the first to face a blank slate after serving in the most important job in the world. Franklin Pierce, who left office at 52 in 1857, found post-presidential life a big drag. ''After the White House,'' he lamented, ''what is there to do but drink?'' He died at 64.
 Mr. Pierce aside, most former presidents have been active one way or another. But in the early days of the republic, they re-emerged in public roles often with the incumbent's blessing. George Washington, who left office at 65, retired to Mount Vernon but was recalled to command the United States Army when war with France seemed imminent. 
 ''Washington was the model for many years,'' said Mark K. Updegrove, author of ''Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House.'' ''You were useful to the degree to which the incumbent could use you, as an emissary, a diplomat, an adviser.''
 Those who returned to public service included John Quincy Adams, who went on to serve in the House of Representatives. Andrew Johnson was appointed to the Senate. William Howard Taft finally got the job he wanted, as chief justice of the Supreme Court.
 But the modern post-presidency has been marked by a new kind of activism, Mr. Updegrove said. It often involves rehabilitating one's image and making money, and sometimes those have been one and the same.
 Richard Nixon spent his early post-Watergate years in exile. Under the 1958 Former President's Act, a president would forfeit his pension if he were impeached; Nixon avoided that fate by resigning. In addition, he was paid $600,000 for his interviews with David Frost and $2.3 million for his memoirs.
 Gerald R. Ford was the first ex-president to serve on corporate boards. But Mr. Clinton has leveraged his presidency to a greater extent than any other former chief executive, making at least $40 million in speaking fees since leaving the White House in 2001.
 He has, however, like other presidents, devoted much of his time -- and much of his speaking income -- to global charities. He and the first President Bush have joined forces for relief for victims of the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Former President Jimmy Carter has devoted himself to numerous causes and won the Nobel Prize.
 Still, one area of concern about former presidents involves fund-raising for their libraries, which they are allowed to do while in office. Donors don't even have to be disclosed, though Congress is considering a measure to change that, applying to sitting presidents and for four years after they leave office. Still, the practice has become more complicated with a former president whose son is in the Oval Office now and another whose wife could be soon.
 ''Retirement has usually meant riding off into the sunset,'' said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. ''But now, ex-presidents are enormously influential, especially if they are succeeded by their children or their spouses.'' 
 Apart from that measure, the public has not demanded restrictions on former presidents, perhaps because they understand the sacrifices made while in office. The toll is evident in before and after pictures. ''It's an exhausting office, and a lot of presidents don't survive long after they leave,'' said Mr. Flanagan, the historian. ''You think, well, they've earned the opportunity to go out there and earn a little money.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 16, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the employment of former presidents after leaving the White House misstated the circumstances under which a president would lose his pension. Only a president who was impeached and convicted -- not merely impeached -- would forfeit his pension and related benefits. The article also misstated the title of the chief justice. He is chief justice of the United States -- not of the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Mansions In the Sky

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
WHEN Jon and Susan Ashley move back to the United States from London next summer, they want their children to have the usual perquisites of suburban living. They will move into a sprawling two-story home where their twins, Zack and Alec, 11; their daughter, Sophie, 6; and their month-old son, Dylan, will have their own bedrooms and a separate playroom.
 But they won't be in Greenwich, Conn., or Armonk, N.Y. The Ashleys will move into a 31-story Upper West Side condominium, where they have bought three apartments that they are combining into a six-bedroom, 4,200-square-foot duplex. 
 Mr. Ashley, 41, said he wanted his family to live in Manhattan because he works such long hours at a private equity firm that he would see his children less if he had to spend more time commuting. 
 Many of his contemporaries are also living closer to the office. ''A lot of my friends and peers have three kids,'' he said, ''and a lot more of them are staying in the city.'' 
 While the national housing market is experiencing a major slowdown, Manhattan's wealthiest families are buying up as many apartments as they can and combining them into rambling mega-units. Brokers and developers say that buyers in this segment of the market are finding that they have few large apartments to choose from, and so they are creating the spaces they want from a half dozen one- and two-bedroom apartments. While some buyers are swallowing up whole floors of new condominiums, others are buying neighboring apartments in older co-op buildings as they become available. 
 Gary Barnett, the chief executive of the Extell Development Corporation, which is building the Ariel West at 245 West 99th Street, where the Ashleys bought, said the building has 70 apartments after seven units were combined into three.
 These combination units are not bargains: two-bedroom apartments in the building typically cost $1.5 million to $2 million, and three- and four-bedroom apartments cost $2.5 million to $3 million.
 Mr. Barnett plans to include 4,500- to 8,500-square-foot apartments in two projects planned for the Upper West Side for more families like the Ashleys. ''A number of people we're seeing who have three, four and even five children need these spaces,'' he said.
 This trend is seen most often on the Upper East and Upper West Sides. For example, in the last two months, five families paid $5.5 million to $13 million for apartment combinations at the Brompton at 205 East 85th Street. These resulting apartments range from 4,500 to 8,000 square feet, according to the Related Companies, the Brompton's developer. 
 David Wine, the chairman of Related, said he saw so much demand for the Brompton that he was adding more combination units in the company's next project. Related is building up to 20 4,100-square-foot apartments and 4,500 to 5,000-square-foot town houses at Superior Ink, a new 17-story building in the West Village built on the former site of the Superior Ink factory.
 Mr. Wine said he wasn't worried that the demand for large apartments would go away, ''as long as the city retains the high-paying financial industry and remains an attractive place where families can live.''
 Other developers say they have found that apartments sell faster when combined into larger spaces. Orin Wilf, the president of Skyline Developers, said he had buyers coming into the sales office at 170 East End Avenue for about six months saying that they liked the apartments but wanted more space. 
 So he combined about a dozen apartments into larger units and sold them within a month. In the end, 16 buyers bought two units and two buyers bought three units for combinations. The combined apartments range in size from 4,500 to 7,000 square feet, and what had started out as a 110-unit building now has 90 apartments. Mr. Wilf and his wife, Lisa, who had originally bought one apartment, decided to combine two into a 6,500-square-foot home for themselves and their two children.
 ''I thought 3,600-square-foot apartments for the Upper East Side would be perfect when we first started designing the building,'' Mr. Wilf said. ''We came to realize people wanted 4,000 square feet, 5,000, 6,000.''
 But some people question the need for these huge combinations. They note that in the past, many wealthy Manhattan families managed to live in Classic 6's -- two-bedroom apartments with living room, dining room, kitchen and maid's room -- even during boom periods like the 1980s. 
 Denise LeFrak Calicchio, a member of a New York real estate family and a longtime real estate broker familiar with the ways of Manhattan wealth, is author of ''High Rise Low Down'' (Barricade Books, 2007). She says the original Classic 6 typically ranges from about 1,700 square feet to as much as 2,800 square feet. 
 ''Three bedrooms and staff quarters were considered grand apartments in the old days,'' Ms. Calicchio said. ''The families are larger, the egos are larger and the competition is bigger.''
 Jill Kargman, who wrote ''Momzillas'' (Broadway Books, 2007), about an Upper East Side family trying to get into a co-op, grew up in a three-bedroom Upper East Side apartment in the 1980s. She said that -- with a few exceptions -- her friends lived in similar-sized apartments where they shared bedrooms with siblings or had a sibling who slept in what was nominally the maid's room. 
 Following tradition, Ms. Kargman, who is expecting her third child, said he would sleep in the maid's room in her Upper East Side apartment. She also said that some of her contemporaries had so many rooms that they were running out of colors. 
 ''It becomes a suburban home in the sky,'' she said. ''Going part and parcel with the four kids is a bigger apartment. I never grew up with a playroom.''
 She added that combining units is changing the dynamics of apartment living. Some owners have bought up so many apartments that their children have multiple floors and hallways to ramble through. ''The building becomes this Eloise-style story,'' she said, referring to the storybook character who scampered through the Plaza Hotel. ''They don't have this tiny block they're confined to.'' 
 John Burger, a managing director at Brown Harris Stevens, warns co-op boards and buyers to approach combinations with caution because the results may not be what the architect originally envisioned for the building. ''Buildings that place an emphasis on their architectural integrity do not allow units to be combined,'' he said. He added that the Dakota typically doesn't allow combinations. 
 Census figures show that the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan jumped by a third from 2000 to 2005. And wealthy families argue that they need lots of space if they are going to live in Manhattan. 
 Such buyers are willing and able to pay more for the privilege. In fact, buyers paid 18 percent more for apartments with four bedrooms or more in the second quarter of this year than in the corresponding period last year, Brown Harris Stevens says. 
 In the second quarter, apartments with at least four bedrooms were the only category with a shrinking inventory of new listings. While there were 3 percent fewer newly listed four-bedroom apartments on the market last quarter, there were 44 percent more studios, 19 percent more one-bedrooms, 14 percent more two-bedrooms and 5 percent more three-bedrooms.
 ''It's the only category in the second quarter where we saw a decline in the number of apartments,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property.
 Manhattan's wealthiest residents have plenty to spend. Census data show that the wealthiest 20 percent of Manhattan residents made nearly 40 times more than the poorest 20 percent -- $351,333, on average, compared with $8,855. 
 Stephanie Coontz, the director of public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, a research group in Chicago, described this as an ''hourglass economy'' with more rich people at the top and more poor people at the bottom. At the top, the superrich are finding that there are so many ''merely rich'' people that they have to find new ways to distinguish themselves. They are able to set themselves apart by having larger families and larger combined apartments to house them.
 ''You've got this incredible wealth at the top, and more people jockeying to put themselves at the top of that,'' Ms. Coontz said. 
 The larger apartments are proving to be good investments. 
 Ian Stone, a real estate and venture capital investor, originally bought five apartments at the Park Millennium at 111 West 67th Street for $5 million after he and his wife, Alicia, had their first child. He spent nearly two years renovating the apartment before they could move in.
 But then he noticed that apartments were selling for high prices nearby at 15 Central Park West. He decided to put the apartment at the Park Millennium on the market and sold it for $10 million in January. The Stones, who now have two children, moved into a 4,000-square-foot rental at Trump Place.
 The sale convinced Mr. Stone that there was a lot of demand for big apartments. So late last year, he bought six more apartments at the Park Millennium for $7.2 million to convert into a 4,200-square-foot apartment. The apartment will feature four bedrooms, a den, office and play area. He expects to finish it by January 2009. If he decides to sell it, he said, he will charge at least $13 million.
 He also put down a deposit on two apartments at Linden 78 at 230 West 78th Street to combine into 4,500 square feet. More recently, he paid $5 million for six apartments at 595 West End Avenue that he will combine into 5,000 square feet.
 Mr. Stone, a native of Long Island, plans to sell two of the combined apartments and move into the third apartment. He doesn't know which one he will move into. 
 He said he had never expected to be such a convert to Manhattan living. ''When I moved to the city, I never imagined raising my kids in the city. We can just walk everywhere. Having kids in the city, you form a sense of community.''
 Louise Phillips Forbes, an executive vice president at Halstead, said that 18 buyers, mostly families, had bought 38 apartments at 595 West End. Mr. Stone was one of three buyers to combine multiple apartments, she said. One family bought five for $5.5 million and another family bought four for $4.4 million.
 She said she found it difficult to keep up with demand. As she put it, ''we had them gone literally in six days.''
 Ms. Forbes understands first-hand why demand is growing. She and her husband, Christopher, combined two apartments into a 3,000-square-foot home for their sons, Douglas, 4, and Kenneth, 20 months.
 She now sells town houses or apartments with more than nine rooms once or twice a month, she said, compared with once or twice a year six years ago. She said these clients all want ''mega-mansions'' because ''my contemporaries, their families and their wealth have expanded.''

HEADLINE: Appreciating Depreciation

BYLINE: By JON GERTNER. 
Jon Gertner is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
My house was built in 1923, in a small town 20 miles west of New York City, in a development that consists of several hundred homes -- mostly three- and four-bedrooms in Dutch colonial style -- on land that had been fruit orchards for the better part of 150 years. Walking home from the train station on some evenings, I've tried to imagine how it must have felt to hike through the neighborhood in the 1920s, not long after its transition to suburbia, just after the first families began moving in. Actually, I've seen some photographs. Set like large wooden blocks in a nearly barren landscape, the rows of houses evoke a desolation akin to what I've experienced in subdivisions stamped out by big home-building companies all over the United States -- places that aren't neighborhoods yet but outposts, lonely agglomerations of houses holding on for dear life to the hems of their metro areas. 
 And yet people bought houses in my town anyway, and they kept buying as the century progressed and the metro area engulfed it. Settling here must have taken a considerable amount of optimism, I've always thought, but new arrivals kept paying more and more (even after inflation). Recently, I drove over to the county archives to go through old deed books, aware that we seem about to fully enter an era of depreciation, to trace the arc of appreciation of my house.
Anyone who has ever dug through public real estate documents can tell you that finding one deed in an oversize, musty ledger leads to an older deed in a different musty ledger, and as you step back in time trying to match buyers and sellers -- actually, deed ''grantors'' and ''grantees'' -- you meet families you never knew who paid handsome sums for a place you know quite well. For just a single New Jersey county, the deed histories fill a small library, hinting at how oceanic the ebb and flow of property has been in this country over the past hundred years. Many of the deed records for my own house included sales prices in the margins; less fortunately, these were noted in a financial shorthand, so my conversion to dollars, done largely with the help of the county register's office, is somewhat approximate. Still, the timeline goes something like this: In December 1922, my quarter-acre lot was sold by two brothers named Trimpi to Arthur Sauer, the developer, for around $2,200. A short while later, in April 1923, the lot and finished house were sold to John and Mabel Haselmayer for around $17,500. The Haselmayers didn't stay long. In 1926, they sold to Laura Baldwin -- the price was unrecorded -- and Baldwin and her husband in turn sold to the Dunaways in 1929, just a few months before the stock market crash, again for an unrecorded amount. The Dunaways sold to the Mentzes in 1948 for about $20,500. Forty-five years passed before Margaret Mentz sold to the Hymans, in 1993, for $211,000. 
 My wife and I are the property's eighth owners in 85 years. We bought it in 2001 for $425,000. If we sold it now -- a questionable proposition in this market, I think, seeing as how buyers are scarce and prices stalled -- I'm not sure how we'd do. Housing economists often describe prices as sticky, since sellers typically take a long time to reduce their asking prices in periods of slack demand. A year ago I might have hoped we'd sell our house for 60 percent over what we paid; today I might say 50 percent. Next year, I wouldn't be surprised if it's closer to 45 percent. If that turned out to be the case, then it's likely that the houses of the newest generation of homeowners -- those, like me, who have never really known a down market -- will have become unstuck at last. What's worse, if home markets seem unstuck here, they may be even more so elsewhere. Driving along the highways outside Denver this summer, I passed one fallow farm field after another with its billboard summoning buyers to a Shangri-La that wasn't yet built but would assuredly be ''starting'' in the low $200,000s. At the moment, it's difficult to imagine these communities will start anytime soon. Will they ever? 
 Now that we've become accustomed to the idea that buying a house means buying into a market as well as a neighborhood, it's unnerving to see things unwind. There aren't many upsides to what's happened over the past few months, with some lenders going bankrupt and many borrowers who assumed too much risk or debt facing a difficult future. Still, one of the more depressing aspects of the housing run-up was the widespread conflation of a house's price and its value. If there is a possible benefit to the slump, it may be that we'll emerge with a different understanding of the value of our homes, regarding them less as investments (perhaps burying the presumption, at least until the next boom, that they're as reliable as stocks and bonds) and more as something all too ordinary. That is, as places to live.
 I say this in part because I tend to believe that houses are immensely valuable for their intangible benefits (a sense of place, community and stability), while being much more complex investments than we acknowledge. When we calculate appreciation, for instance, we almost always discount the steady and substantial costs of upkeep and improvements, especially on older houses. We assume large income tax benefits, even when they are eroded by property taxes. We forget that inflation matters (the $425,000 we paid for our house, for example, would be about $500,000 today). Finally, we overlook the historical data, which suggest that trends in housing prices have been mostly unremarkable over the 20th century. Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, who has been one of the most astute longtime observers of the housing market, concluded in 2005 that during the past hundred years, prices have mostly been flat or declined, with just a few exceptions. These were after World War II (when the Mentzes enjoyed a substantial gain on their home), in the late 1990s (when the Hymans enjoyed a similar increase) and in the past five years (when my wife and I enjoyed the boom).
 There's no perfect way to explain these jumps. As most of us know by now, property-value appreciation reflects everything from demand sparked by regional wage growth and low interest rates to supply costs determined by raw materials and the availability of land. Psychological elements -- the urgency and risk-taking that characterize speculative markets -- can be a crucial factor in pushing up prices, too. What further complicates things is that houses have no underlying revenue stream (such as a stock's corporate earnings) on which to base an assumption of true value. So there's no precise way to work out how, say, exotic mortgages and lax credit standards distort the market. 
 Thus, during the recent boom the best indicator of value became ''what houses are selling for'' -- another variation, in other words, on the greater-fool theory, which holds that commodities are worth only as much as someone else will pay for them and that someone (a greater fool) will always be willing to pay more than the last buyer. To anyone who shopped for a home in a booming metropolitan area over the past few years, though, this was also the defining conundrum of the era: an apartment or house couldn't possibly be worth the stratospheric asking price -- but then again, maybe it could. Wouldn't that have to be true if six bidders were considering buying it?
 Like most people, I instinctively consider value in terms of the particular charms of my house. But it's more accurate to focus on the land and why its value rises or falls over the years. My insurance company knows this; that's why the replacement value of our house (what it would cost to rebuild it) is significantly less than what my wife and I paid for the property, which means that our land, unlike our house, is now worth quite a bit. But what changed over the years?
 To go back to the 1920s and connect the value of the property with what was happening in the region demystifies a few things. Before the builder poured the foundation, our land had a modest and unspecified value due to its soil and suitable climate for agriculture; in the recollections of long-dead residents, gathered in a book at the local library, I've read wistful remembrances of flourishing strawberry patches and thriving orchards that grew a now-uncommon variety of apple (the Harrison). The original price of our quarter-acre lot -- $2,200 in 1922 -- is equivalent to just over $27,000 today, a fairly small sum. But then the township, and the economy of the New York metro area, grew vigorously. A good school system, a commercial district, a manufacturing district, a library, a pool -- these became town assets. New churches and synagogues were established. Roads and infrastructure improved. Such financial investments were distributed, in effect, to the value of all the land in town. By the time of the postwar boom in land appreciation, the town had been largely built out, so that when demand bumped up against the limits of supply, land values rose further. In the 1970s, Newark International Airport was greatly expanded. A nearby Interstate highway, linking my town to both New York City and eastern Pennsylvania, was completed in the 1980s. And in the 1990s, an upgrade to the commuter rail line, making for a much quicker ride into Manhattan, pushed prices up again.
 All of these developments lend a certain rationality to the appreciation curve of my house over the years; at least to me, they suggest why it's not contradictory to have poor expectations for the short term of the housing market, as most of us do now, and modest expectations for the long term. You would have done O.K., in other words, if you owned my house through the right decades. But that history suggests something else, too: it suggests that waiting for residential property to increase in worth can be an epic, unpredictable slog. How could John and Mabel Haselmayer, the building's original residents, know there would be a nearby highway? Or that New York's metro area would do so much better than Philadelphia's? You start to notice that location and luck are a potent combination. And that in the end, we might be better off thinking of appreciation not in terms of years, but in terms of generations. 
 I happen to believe this explains why most of us would be happier watching the grass grow over the next few summers than obsessing over our property values. But a long horizon doesn't explain everything, including one of the more intriguing aspects of the current slump, which is the fact that homes in New York City, especially on the high end, continue to sell and appreciate. At the moment, builders in the city are finishing about 30,000 new units a year, which is one and a half times the rate at the start of the boom.
 Logic suggests that so much new housing, along with tighter credit markets, will dampen both supply and prices. But if it doesn't? We may get to see whether boutique cities have permanently separated themselves from other real estate markets, like wealthy private-equity barons who will never again fly in anything but private jets. My friend Jim, who lives in Brooklyn and whose house has appreciated to about seven times what he paid for it in 1994, recently told me about watching a house-hunting show on HGTV with his 10-year-old son. The episode featured a couple who had $435,000 to spend on a good-size house. 
 My friend's son shook his head. ''No way,'' he said. ''That's just wrong. You can't get a house for $435,000.''
 Well, not in Manhattan or brownstone Brooklyn. At least not anymore. And at least not yet.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just the Destination, It's the Connection

BYLINE: By DAVID KAUFMAN

 BODY:
 AS a former American Ambassador to Morocco and now an international business consultant focused primarily on Eastern European markets, Michael Ussery has spent his career perfecting the art of the European airport transfer. Over the past decade he has logged more than 110 flights between his Washington base and Europe and the Middle East.
 ''There was a lot of trial and error,'' Mr. Ussery said. ''But at some point in the late 1990s I found Vienna airport to work best for me, and I have been flying through it ever since.''
 As travel expands throughout Europe and the Middle East, Americans are increasingly having to trade nonstop flights for journeys with pit stops along the way. Many are unprepared and unaware of the potential connection headaches awaiting them. 
 With major airports from London to Madrid adding terminals, and already sprawling hubs like Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle in Paris operating at full capacity, airport waits of over an hour have become frustratingly commonplace. Add in limited runway capacity, delays on arriving flights and frequent ground crew strikes, and ''connecting between flights is simply inconvenient, unreliable and stressful,'' according to Henry Harteveldt, principal travel analyst with Forrester Research in San Francisco.
 Yet as travelers like Mr. Ussery can attest, ''transiting'' through Europe need not be a nightmare. The trick is knowing which airports most efficiently link American gateways with the maximum number of onward destinations -- offering the quickest journey times between gates, along with high-quality restaurants and lounges along the way.
 ''The key factor here really is speed,'' said Edward Plaisted, chief executive of Skytrax, a London-based consultancy specializing in traveler-satisfaction surveys.
 In its most recent annual survey of some seven million passengers from 93 countries, Skytrax named Munich Airport the best airport in Europe, and No. 4 in the world. Skytrax respondents specifically noted Munich's ''service, efficiency ... and the ease of the transit process'' as key components of its appeal, the survey report said. ''While Munich still cannot rival Frankfurt in terms of service from the U.S., for connecting it really is the best example in Europe today,'' Mr. Plaisted said of the airport, which saw 10 million transit passengers last year, an increase of more than 7 percent from 2005.
 Indeed, connection times in Munich average just 30 minutes, compared with 45 minutes in Frankfurt, 50 minutes in Amsterdam and up to two hours in both London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle, according to Munich airport officials. And with a new daily nonstop to Denver starting this summer on Lufthansa, there are now direct Munich flights from 13 United States cities, linked to 383 weekly onward flights to Eastern and Southern European destinations. Although time savings can vary by season, flying via Munich can prove prudent. For instance, a flight from Kennedy Airport to Naples, Italy -- for which there are few nonstops -- can require more than three hours of layover at Heathrow on British Airways, while flying Lufthansa via Munich requires a layover of less than an hour. The Lufthansa flight takes off later, but arrives in Naples some two hours ahead of British Airways. 
 Much of Munich's success is attributed to its layout. It is a 15-year-old structure designed as a single terminal and purpose-built as a transit hub. It's a contrast to most of its regional counterparts -- relics of mid-20th-century aviation architecture with terminals added as needed, often far from the original center. 
 But Munich is not the only central European airport that makes transiting relatively easy to bear. With layovers even at the most efficient European airports occasionally stretching beyond a few hours, easy access to a city center is a key lure for many frequent travelers. George Antoniadis, chief executive of Alpha Flying, an airplane leasing company based in Manchester, N.H., says the 15-minute train trip between downtown Zurich and its main airport is part of the reason he flies only via Zurich on his twice-monthly journeys between Boston and Athens. ''It's fully integrated into the urban life of the city, so you can easily jump out to catch some air and then quickly get back to your next flight,'' he said. Zurich was ranked as the No. 2 airport in Europe by Skytrax. 
 When choosing to stay in the airport, Mr. Antoniadis says his transfer times at Zurich average a mere 15 minutes, thanks to its small size and essentially single-terminal layout. It's this kind of ease that has made him a Zurich -- and Swiss International Air Lines -- loyalist, despite far greater numbers of Boston flights on Lufthansa, British Airways or Air France. 
 Mr. Ussery feels much the same about Vienna Airport and Austrian Airlines, as does Douglas Combs, a Washington-based private equities investor who travels 200 days a year, often to Eastern and Central Europe. ''If I am not going to Paris or London, I am flying via Vienna,'' Mr. Combs said. ''There's free Wi-Fi, the city center is just 20 minutes away, and I am usually between terminals in under five minutes.''
 While Zurich and Vienna continue to dominate routes connecting to Eastern and Southern Europe, Munich is expanding on its flights to India and the Middle East, including new summer flights to both Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The moves come as both regions (the Persian Gulf most dramatically) are inaugurating nonstop flights to the United States and building airports aimed at transcontinental transit passengers. 
 For the moment, Dubai ''remains the best airport in the Middle East out of what's available,'' said Mr. Plaisted of Skytrax. The airport's success is almost single-handedly due to Emirates, Dubai's national carrier, which not only flies some of the most luxurious cabins in the sky -- with dine-on-demand ''room service'' and in-suite minibars in first class -- but offers three daily flights to New York efficiently linked to extensive onward connections throughout India, Asia and Australia. 
 Emirates' separate morning flights to Sydney and Melbourne, for instance, depart just two hours after their first New York arrival, while Emirate's Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore connections are also under two hours. With Delta's new nonstop from Atlanta operational and Emirates introducing a nonstop Houston flight in December, Dubai International Airport is now a viable transit option for Southeastern and Midwestern fliers, as well. 
 Still, with Dubai Airport, now sprawling and struggling to cope with some 29 million annual passengers, experienced travelers are beginning to look elsewhere for stress-free Gulf transit points. ''While Dubai certainly offers connectivity to almost every place in the world, the airport is just too big, too busy and lacks things to do,'' said Phil McGrane, director of Dubai-based 3P Events, which produces corporate events, who regularly flies between regional capitals and the United States and Britain. ''I prefer Abu Dhabi, which is small, compact and easy to navigate. The only thing lacking are good coffee stations.''
 Mr. Plaisted of Skytrax confirms that the Persian Gulf will see the next great battle of the airport hubs, as both Doha and Dubai complete entirely new airports and Abu Dhabi spends billions of dollars improving its own. 
 In Asia, Shanghai and Beijing are also spending billions on new or improved airports -- though sluggish Chinese bureaucracy and inconsistent visa policies will make it difficult for them to compete with regional hubs like Hong Kong or Singapore for United States-based passengers. And Mr. Plaisted says Warsaw, Budapest and especially Prague airports offer acceptable levels of ease and efficiency for connections to the rest of Eastern Europe. ''Still,'' he added, ''service can vary greatly here depending on the specific airline.''

HEADLINE: In 2000, a Streetwise Veteran Schooled a Bold Young Obama

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
 The rise of Barack Obama includes one glaring episode of political miscalculation. Even friends told Mr. Obama it was a bad idea when he decided in 1999 to challenge an incumbent congressman and former Black Panther, Bobby L. Rush, whose stronghold on the South Side of Chicago was overwhelmingly black, Democratic and working class.
Mr. Obama was a 38-year-old state senator and University of Chicago lecturer, unknown in much of Mr. Rush's Congressional district. He lived in its most rarefied neighborhood, Hyde Park. He was taking on a local legend, a former alderman and four-term incumbent who had given voters no obvious reason to displace him.
 Mr. Rush's name recognition started off at 90 percent, Mr. Obama's at 11. Then Mr. Rush's son was murdered, leading Mr. Obama to put his campaign on hold. Later, while vacationing in Hawaii with his family, he missed a high-profile vote in the Legislature and was pilloried. (One Chicago Tribune editorial began, ''What a bunch of gutless sheep.'') Then President Clinton endorsed Mr. Rush. 
 ''Campaigns are always, 'What's the narrative of the race?' '' said Eric Adelstein, a media consultant in Chicago who worked on the Rush campaign. ''In a sense, it was 'the Black Panther against the professor.' That's not a knock on Obama; but to run from Hyde Park, this little bastion of academia, this white community in the black South Side -- it just seemed odd that he would make that choice as a kind of stepping out.''
 The episode revealed a lot about Senator Obama -- now running for president, against the odds again and with a relatively slim resume. It showed his impatience with the frustrations of his state Senate job; his outsize confidence; his fund-raising powers; his broad appeal; and his willingness to be what Abner J. Mikva, a former congressman and supporter, calls ''a very apt student of his own mistakes.''
 It also shed light on the complicated ways that class has played out in Mr. Obama's political career as a factor entangled with his race. Class emerged as a subtext in the Congressional campaign, along with generational differences that separate Mr. Obama from older black politicians.
 He might have fared better if he had jumped into the race sooner, campaigned even harder and found a way to speak more effectively to working-class black voters, people involved with that campaign say. But most say they doubt he could have won. It is hard to take out an incumbent, and though Mr. Rush may have looked vulnerable after losing a lackluster campaign against Mayor Richard M. Daley in early 1999, he was not vulnerable enough.
 ''He was blinded by his ambition,'' Mr. Rush said. ''Obama has never suffered from a lack of believing that he can accomplish whatever it is he decides to try. Obama believes in Obama. And, frankly, that has its good side but it also has its negative side.''
 Not that the loss hurt Mr. Obama. Not long after getting ''my rear end handed to me,'' as he later put it, he ran successfully for the United States Senate -- this time with no sitting Democrat to displace, with abundant planning and with a more experienced campaign staff, including David Axelrod, a Daley consultant who is the senior political adviser on Mr. Obama's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
 ''Certain Democrats in Chicago say it's the best thing that ever happened to him, not winning that race -- that he couldn't have been positioned to run for the U.S. Senate from that district,'' Mr. Adelstein said. ''In that district, you get pigeonholed pretty quickly as 'an African-American congressman,' not as a more transcendent congressman.''
 Mr. Rush's district, the state's most Democratic, was 65 percent black. And in 1999, it included not only Hyde Park, home of the University of Chicago, but several relatively affluent Irish-American neighborhoods.
 There were plenty of college-educated, white, ''latte liberals'' with whom Mr. Obama polls well. But he was barely known outside his state Senate district, in the eastern part of Mr. Rush's district. To win, he would have to expand his support among blacks, including the older, church-going, Rush loyalists who vote disproportionately in primaries.
 ''Taking on Bobby Rush among black voters is like running into a buzz saw,'' said Ron Lester, a pollster who worked for Mr. Obama. ''This guy was incredibly popular. Not only that, his support ran deep -- to the extent that a lot of people who liked Barack still wouldn't support him because they were committed to Bobby. He had built up this reserve of goodwill over 25 years in that community.''
 Mr. Rush had grown up in Chicago, enlisted in the Army, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped found the Illinois Black Panther Party in 1968. He coordinated a medical clinic that pioneered mass screening for sickle cell anemia, which disproportionately affects blacks. As an alderman in 1992, he had ousted a black political legend -- Representative Charles A. Hayes, a veteran of the civil-rights and labor movements who was caught up in a scandal that year involving the House bank.
 Frustration at the Statehouse
 Mr. Obama, 15 years younger than Mr. Rush, arrived in Chicago in his 20s after growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He worked as a community organizer on the South Side for three years, then returned to the city after graduating from Harvard Law School. He ran a voter registration drive, joined a law firm, taught constitutional law and been elected to the state Senate from Hyde Park in 1996.
 But he was frustrated at the Statehouse. He had distinguished himself as an ethics reformer there, but it was difficult for Democrats to get much done in a period of virtual Republican lockdown. ''He was looking for opportunities to run for offices,'' said Dan Shomon, who was then a Senate aide. 
 In February 1999, Mr. Rush lost the mayoral primary to Mr. Daley, getting just 28 percent of the vote. Toni Preckwinkle, a city alderman, encouraged Mr. Obama to challenge Mr. Rush.
 Mr. Shomon said he and Mr. Obama did an amateur poll to gauge his chances. They designed questions, recruited volunteers to telephone 300 people, and concluded that Mr. Rush was vulnerable. Mr. Shomon, who became Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said, ''Obama will tell you that this poll was not the best poll in the world.'' Asked why, he said, ''Because the results didn't turn out to be correct.''
 State Senator Terry Link, a friend of Mr. Obama, said he advised him not to run. ''He tried to justify it: He didn't feel Bobby was representing the area, he thought he could do a better job,'' Mr. Link recalled. ''I think he misread it. He didn't analyze the strength of the congressman in that area, the will of the people.''
 Mr. Obama, in a brief telephone interview, said, ''In retrospect, there was very little chance of me winning that race. That was a good lesson -- that you should never be too impressed with your own ideas if your name recognition in a Congressional district is only eight or whatever it was.''
 He entered the race in late September, six months before the primary. He told voters that Mr. Rush represented ''a politics that is rooted in the past, a reactive politics that isn't good at coming up with concrete solutions.'' He promised new leadership, reaching beyond the black community and leading coalitions to take on contemporary problems, cut crime, expand health care coverage, promote economic development and expand educational opportunities.
 But several weeks later, Mr. Lester's polling put Mr. Rush's approval rating at 70 percent and Mr. Obama's at 8 percent. Forty-seven percent of the people polled favored Mr. Rush, 10 percent favored Mr. Obama and 5 percent favored a third candidate, State Senator Donne E. Trotter, who is also black. Almost all of Mr. Obama's support initially came from whites, Mr. Lester said.
 ''Bobby Rush had not been the most active member of Congress from Illinois, but there was no issue that made him particularly vulnerable,'' Mr. Mikva said. ''He hadn't robbed a bank or beaten his grandmother or things like that. In that respect, I was concerned.''
 ''Also,'' Mr. Mikva said, ''I had seen reform candidates running against incumbents in African-American areas. It's hard. Reform is not the most compelling issue to people who don't have a job.''
 Then in mid-October, Mr. Rush's 29-year-old son, Huey Rich, was shot on his way home from a grocery store. He hung between life and death for four days. Mr. Rush benefited from an outpouring of sympathy; the wake was studded with politicians and there were renewed calls for gun control, one of Mr. Rush's causes. 
 ''That incident seemed to wash away any bad feelings that voters had or might have had about Bobby Rush,'' said Chris Sautter, whose communications firm worked on the Obama campaign.
 Later, Gov. George Ryan called the Legislature into special session to try to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills that the Illinois Supreme Court had overturned. Mr. Obama was voting consistently in favor of it. But the session dragged on toward Christmas and an annual trip to Hawaii to visit his grandmother, who had helped rear him.
 He had planned to return after the holiday when the session was to resume, Mr. Shomon said. But a crucial vote came up earlier than expected. With Mr. Obama and others absent, it failed by five votes. Mr. Obama, in particular, came under fire. In his defense, he said he had not flown back in time because his 18-month-old daughter was sick. But he was hammered by editorial writers, the governor and Mr. Rush.
 ''We were thrown under the bus,'' Mr. Shomon said. ''It was a terrible day of news coverage, since, A, we got blasted for not being there and, B, the perception was that Obama doesn't care about gun safety.''
 The Downfall 
 In his book ''The Audacity of Hope,'' Mr. Obama wrote: ''Less than halfway into the campaign, I knew in my bones that I was going to lose. Each morning from that point forward I awoke with a vague sense of dread, realizing that I would have to spend the day smiling and shaking hands and pretending that everything was going according to plan.''
 Billboards in the district read: ''I'm sticking with Bobby.'' A few black elected officials endorsed Mr. Obama but most fell in line behind the incumbent. Ministers closed ranks. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, pastor of the St. Sabina Catholic Church, said other ministers and congregation members called to complain when he endorsed Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama's Ivy League education and his white liberal-establishment connections also became an issue. Mr. Rush told The Chicago Reader, ''He went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We're not impressed with these folks with these Eastern elite degrees.'' 
 Mr. Rush and his supporters faulted him for having missed experiences that more directly defined the previous generation of black people. ''Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it,'' Mr. Rush told The Reader. 
 Mr. Obama was seen as an intellectual, ''not from us, not from the 'hood,'' said Jerry Morrison, a consultant on the Rush campaign. Asked recently about that line of attack, Mr. Rush minimized it as ''chest beating, signifying.'' 
 The implication was not exactly that Mr. Obama was ''not black enough,'' as some blacks have suggested more recently; his credentials were suspect. ''It was much more a function of class, not race,'' Mr. Adelstein said. ''Nobody said he's 'not black enough.' They said he's a professor, a Harvard elite who lives in Hyde Park.''
 Not everything went badly. Mr. Obama proved unusually good at raising money. He raised more than $500,000 -- less than Mr. Rush but impressive for a newcomer -- tapping connections at the University of Chicago, Harvard Law School, law firms where he had worked, and a network of successful, black, Chicago-based entrepreneurs who have played an important role in subsequent campaigns.
 He was also catching on among whites in the district thanks to Thomas J. Dart, then a popular state representative who is now Cook County sheriff. 
 But President Clinton's endorsement of Mr. Rush, an early supporter of Mr. Clinton, dealt a final blow.According to Mr. Adelstein, Mr. Clinton -- after a personal request from Mr. Rush -- overrode his own policy of not endorsing candidates in primaries.
 Mr. Rush won the primary with 61.02 percent of the vote; Mr. Obama had just over 30 percent. Mr. Obama was favored by whites but lost among blacks, Mr. Lester said. Looking back, some say the magnitude of the loss reflected Mr. Obama's failure to connect with black, working-class voters. Mr. Mikva said, ''It indicated that he had not made his mark in the African-American community and didn't particularly have a style that resonated there.''
 The Candidate Matures
 He and others say Mr. Obama learned from that experience. Mr. Mikva recalls telling him about advice once given to John F. Kennedy by Cardinal Richard Cushing: ''The cardinal said to him, 'Jack, you have to learn to speak more Irish and less Harvard.' I think I recounted that anecdote to Barack. Clearly, he learned how to speak more Chicago and less Harvard in subsequent campaigning.''
 Mr. Shomon said, ''There was a gradual progression of Barack Obama from thoughtful, earnest policy wonk/civil rights lawyer/constitutional law expert to Barack Obama the politician, the inspirer, the speaker.'' Denny Jacobs, a friend of Mr. Obama and a former state senator, agreed. ''He stumbled on the fact that instead of running on all the issues, quote unquote, that hope is the real key,'' he said. ''Not only the black community but less privileged people are looking for that hope. You don't have to talk about health care, you have to talk about 'the promise' of health care. Hope is a pretty inclusive word. I think he is very good at selling that.''
 In March 2004, Mr. Obama won the Democratic primary for the United States Senate with nearly 53 percent of the vote, racking up huge totals in wards he had lost to Mr. Rush in 2000. (Mr. Rush, still stung by Mr. Obama's challenge to him, endorsed a white candidate in the race, Blair Hull, a former securities trader.) Mr. Obama won the general election with the biggest margin ever in an Illinois Senate race.
 Today, Mr. Rush, a practicing Baptist minister in his eighth term in Congress who is backing Mr. Obama's presidential candidacy, still seems to be ruminating about the Obama phenomenon with grievance and wonder. Mr. Obama's ambition has found its audience, he said. In a Congressional race, your neighbors ''hold you to a different standard.''
 ''For what he's doing now, he didn't need to march against police brutality,'' Mr. Rush said, invoking his own record. ''He didn't need to demonstrate against poor meat in substandard grocery stores. He didn't need that kind of stuff because obviously his audience was at a different level.''
 Mr. Rush has an explanation for Mr. Obama's emergence after the dark days of 2000 as a political star four years later. He vanquished a field of multimillionaires, some more experienced and better known, and benefited from fortuitous domestic scandals that sidelined two opponents and left him facing a Republican widely seen as unable to win.
 ''I would characterize theSenate race as being a race where Obama was, let's say, blessed and highly favored,'' Mr. Rush said, chuckling. ''That's not routine. There's something else going on.''
 What was he suggesting?
 ''I think that Obama, his election to the Senate, was divinely ordered,'' Mr. Rush said, all other explanations failing. ''I'm a preacher and a pastor; I know that that was God's plan. Obama has certain qualities that -- I think he is being used for some purpose. I really believe that.''

 BODY:
If you've got it, flaunt it. And there was a whole lot of flaunting going on in the third annual Art Parade on Saturday in SoHo. It was like a mini-Rose Bowl pageant, but with men in heels, a ukulele orchestra, trash-bag attire, a no-nukes float, a nonstop food fight and the director of a major New York museum, hair dyed blue, barreling down West Broadway. 
 As pageants go, this one was short (about four blocks, one hour) and friendly in a fringey, attitudinous way. It's hard to imagine its happening in uptight, cash-rich, chutzpah-poor Chelsea, and it didn't. And there was nothing not to like. 
 The first Art Parade was organized two years ago by a SoHo gallery, Deitch Projects, and was crammed into a few blocks on Grand Street. Everyone had a ball, so it was repeated last year, but at twice the size and length and in a different location: down West Broadway from West Houston Street to Grand. This year's version took the same route and added still more participants: more than 800 artists who conceived, constructed, carried, wore or performed some 82 mobile works of art. 
 You know an event has arrived when the New York City Police Department turns up to close streets and control crowds. And so it was on Saturday. Art Parade 2007, now jointly produced by Creative Time and Paper magazine, with Deitch still organizing, was an official traffic stopper.
 Veterans of the 2006 parade returned. The Malcolm X Shabbaz High School marching band from Newark once again kicked things off, this time with the help of its chapter of the R.O.T.C. Nick van Woert's Bobble Head Collective, with its giant crazed stockbroker masks, was back. So was Steve Powers, also known as Espo, reprising his 2005 inflatable black limousine, a salute to celebrity gas guzzling.
 The Dazzle Dancers, with their colossal ''DD'' float, always make a memorable impression, both for their anarchic choreography and their continuing commitment to battle, as their online manifesto says, ''the forces of blandness, fear, and isolation so common in our clenched culture of coffee franchises, fear marketing and money worship.'' The manifesto also emphasizes that they prefer to work nude, but they dressed up (sort of) for this occasion.
 I was happy to re-encounter Corinne Doll, a k a Coco, with her foam core cutouts of female muses, Cleopatra, Louise Brooks, Pocahontas, and Courtney Love among them. And it was a pleasure to welcome the first-time parader Assume Vivid Astro Focus, an artist who is also an art collective and which contributed a floating Macy's parade-size portrait of Jayne County, transsexual hero, glitter-punk idol and author of the must-skim autobiography ''Man Enough to Be a Woman.'' 
 New talent is the life of any enterprise, and the Art Parade was refreshed again this year through an open call for proposals. Rumor has it that certain proposed works changed dramatically, which is to say beyond recognition, between acceptance and realization. But no one's complaining. Everything's art, even the Brazilian Sisters, a performing trio who may or may not be related, are almost certainly not from Brazil (someone at Deitch thought Miami but wasn't sure) and didn't do much but model bikinis.
 Among other debutante work I very much liked a ballet of the abstract paintings in motion by Arden Sherman, Ralph Bishop, Christine Baldizzi and others who go by the name Algorithm Nation. The John Erickson Museum of Art held the eye: a portable museum out of Chicago, with miniature galleries carried, as if on trays, by its curators. One gallery held a solo show by Arnold Mesches, a political painter whose work made a splash in the East Village '80s and whom somebody should bring back to New York. 
 Perhaps that somebody could be the highly irregular Brooklyn Museum. It was the only traditional institution to make the scene on Saturday, its staff turning out in force, led by the museum's director, Arnold Lehman, cerulean-haired and cheering like mad.
 Of pieces by solo artists, some of the quietest were best. I was particularly taken with one called ''Siameze Rapunzels: The World's Longest Multi Human Hair Braid'' by the New York artist Hrafnhildur Arnardottir, a k a Shoplifter. It consisted of several young women whose long hair was indeed braided together, encouraging them to walk with dainty, tiptoe steps.
 Tom Bogaert's ''Canary Space Ship,'' a kind of multiplex bird cage, was sweet. So was Matthew Blair's ''Kafka Helmet,'' beak-shaped and pointed at the ground, and Matthew Rodriguez's spectacular piled-up ''Sir Shaully Van Snooten Haufer,'' a sculptural tour de force. 
 Not all was sunshine and light, however. The parade had its share of heavy-metal gloom. Kembra Pfahler's band of blue-skinned furies, the Girls of Karen Black, moved down West Broadway at a funereal pace, bloody dolls clutched in their arms. Dennis McNett flashed fantastic death's-head prints, while Tlisza Jaurique and Marcus Zillox carried the figure of Death dressed as the Virgin of Guadalupe on a litter.
 And here, as in other ways, the parade is ahead of the news. Death is going to be big in art this year. With Damien Hirst's diamond-encrusted skull in the news, and Goth whatnots still in fashion, mortality is shaping up to be a thematic mini-trend of the kind cooked up to keep sales moving through the season. Or at least that's apparently the hope, although frankly, if the economy keeps shape-shifting, Chelsea could power down fast. Would this have any effect on the Art Parade, with its here-today spirit and throwaway work? Would it become the larger, even fringier, truly go-for-broke event it has the potential to be? Can't wait for 2008 to see.

HEADLINE: Free-Market Mischief In Hot Spots Of Disaster

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Festivalgoers in Venice and Toronto who attended the premieres this weekend of ''The Shock Doctrine,'' a six-minute film written by the author Naomi Klein and the director Alfonso Cuaron, saw images of electroshock treatments from the 1950s, animated pages from a C.I.A. torture manual and footage of the 9/11 attacks and the 2004 tsunami. The brief movie encapsulates the thesis of a new book of the same title by Ms. Klein: That unconstrained free-market policies go hand in hand with undemocratic political policies. 
 While Mr. Cuaron's political passions can be glimpsed in his dystopian 2006 thriller ''Children of Men'' (Ms. Klein is a commentator on the DVD), most Hollywood directors don't end up making promotional videos for thick texts about global economics. ''When she asked if I was interested in doing a trailer,'' he said from Italy, ''my answer was, 'I'm sorry, I can't do it.' '' 
 Then Mr. Cuaron read the book: ''I had to call her back. I said, ''Naomi, please don't drop this. You -- we -- have to do this.'' He drafted his son Jonas to direct. (The film can be seen on her Web site, naomiklein.org.) 
 While perhaps not quite as powerful a marketing tool as having Victoria Beckham photographed reading ''Skinny Bitch,'' it's not bad. Yet this sort of fortuitous event seems regularly to happen to the 37-year-old Ms. Klein.
 Her book ''No Logo'' was at the printer just as young demonstrators rioted in Seattle in 1999 to protest the World Trade Organization meeting there. Overnight Ms. Klein, with her dark eyebrows and youthful intensity, became both a spokeswoman for and analyst of the anti-globalization movement that caught fire around the world. That book sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. 
 ''The Take,'' her 2004 documentary about a workers' cooperative in Argentina produced with her husband, Avi Lewis, was being filmed when Carlos Saul Menem, the former president who had presided over that county's economic collapse, unsuccessfully attempted a dramatic comeback. Argentina was where Ms. Klein began to formulate her argument in ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism,'' being released in the United States on Sept. 18. 
 ''I felt it emotionally before I understood it factually,'' Ms. Klein said during a recent visit to New York from her home in Canada. It was ''blindingly obvious'' to everyone there, she said, that there was a ''connection between violence, the military coup and these economic policies that people didn't want.''
 In her book she argues that the shock therapy prescribed by Western economists during the last 30 years could not have been imposed without political shock therapy, namely brutal repression and a suspension of democratic rights. Western countries, along with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, essentially exploited disasters -- hyperinflation, the tsunami, the war in Iraq -- to force through radical changes like privatization, deregulation and severe cuts in social spending. These policies, imposed by foreign and American disciples of the laissez-faire economist Milton Friedman, she maintains, caused grinding poverty and hardship for millions while often permitting multinationals to buy up a country's most valuable assets for going-out-of-business prices.
 Even the shock of 9/11, she said in an interview, was ''harnessed by leaders to end the discussion of global justice.'' 
 Nor are democratic governments exempt. Solidarity in Poland in 1989, she writes, was forced to reverse positions on which it was elected -- i.e., backing worker cooperatives -- and impose a state of emergency after being strong-armed by the I.M.F. and other lenders that refused to extend aid and credit unless Poland adopted a radical free-market program. 
 ''We did not lose the battle of ideas,'' Ms. Klein likes to say. Alternatives to the free market were ''crushed by army tanks and think tanks.'' 
 Her unconventional take is sure to stir criticism. Yet holding politically unpopular views is something of a family tradition for Ms. Klein. Her parents went to Canada, where she was born in 1970, so her father could avoid the Vietnam draft. Her family later moved back to the United States but returned to Canada when her father, a doctor, decided he wanted to work in a public health system. Her mother belonged to a feminist filmmaking collective.
 Ms. Klein wrote for the campus newspaper while at the University of Toronto in the mid-1990s, but was dispirited by the left's seeming malaise. There was a ''smallness to our politics,'' she said of the preoccupation with race, gender and ethnicity. When she returned to school a few years later, she met a group of younger activists who were excitedly organizing around globalization.
 As Ms. Klein talks about protests, one can see her enthusiasm about the power of mass mobilization. In her public speeches, like one she gave at the American Sociological Association conference this summer in Manhattan, she seems as interested in promoting activism as in promoting her book. 
 ''We are missing movement power,'' she complained. ''Fixing the world's problems has become an increasingly elite affair -- a matter between C.E.O.'s and celebrities. It's noblesse oblige on a large scale.''
 That comment is a pointed jab at the globe-trotting economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, who has recently enlisted Bono in an ambitious campaign to end global poverty. In her book Ms. Klein partly blames Mr. Sachs for the disastrous results in Russia and wrenching deprivation in Poland and Bolivia, where he was an adviser.
 ''There's a theme which I broadly agree with that the extreme free-market reform ideology of the 1980s and onward really got out of hand,'' said Mr. Sachs, who is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. But ''she didn't really understand a lot of things that happened in the places I was involved.''
 The zeal of the free-marketers is so great, Ms. Klein declares, that if a natural or financial disaster fails to materialize, economists and policy officials help precipitate one. In her book she quotes a speech delivered by the economist John Williamson in 1993: ''One will have to ask whether it could conceivably make sense to think of deliberately provoking a crisis so as to remove the political logjam to reform.''
 She points out that the International Monetary Fund's own auditing arm criticized the fund's approach after it forced Asian governments to accept shock therapy during the 1997-98 financial crisis. More than 24 million people across Asia lost their jobs. 
 The demands were ''ill-advised'' and ''broader than seemed necessary,'' Ms. Klein writes, citing the audit, which concluded that ''crisis should not be used as an opportunity to seek a long agenda of reforms just because leverage is high, irrespective of how justifiable they may be on merits.''
 Mr. Williamson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has not read the book, but after a brief description said, ''It doesn't sound like she has a full appreciation of my position.''
 Anders Aslund, also at the Peterson Institute and the author of a forthcoming book, ''Russia's Capitalist Revolution: Why Market Reform Succeeded and Democracy Failed,'' labeled a description of Ms. Klein's argument as ''complete nonsense.''
 ''If you don't do anything, you have the state managers take over,'' he said, citing Uzbekistan and Belarus as places where halfway economic measures were tried and resulted in dictatorships. Political scientists are at fault, he said, because they haven't ''got a clue about how to build a democracy.'' 
 Ms. Klein, who was heartily attacked for ''No Logo,'' is not unaccustomed to criticism. But she added that then, ''I had a movement on my side.'' This time, she said, ''I think this will be a lot lonelier.''

HEADLINE: The Health Care America Wants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks (''The New Social Contract,'' column, Sept. 7) dismisses a single-payer health insurance system on the grounds that Americans ''will not likely embrace a system that forces them to defer to the central government when it comes to making fundamental health care choices.'' 
 Yet the federal government's Medicare program has strong political support. 
 In 2003, even a conservative Republican president and Congress found it politically advantageous to expand Medicare significantly by adding prescription drug benefits.
 Extending Medicare to cover all Americans would strengthen America's economy in three ways. 
 It would reduce administrative expenses, replace costly emergency room visits for those now lacking insurance with more cost-effective preventive care, and improve the global competitiveness of American manufacturers, who now bear much higher health care costs than do their foreign rivals.
 Gregory M. Saltzman Ann Arbor, Mich., Sept. 7, 2007 The writer is a professor of economics and management at Albion College. 
 To the Editor:
 According to David Brooks, single-payer health care is a bust, since Americans are too individualistic to embrace ''a system that forces them to defer to the central government.'' 
 But most Americans are now forced either to defer to the profit-seeking H.M.O. their employer chooses, or to switch jobs (which is certainly not as easy as switching brands of toothpaste) and be beholden to the H.M.O. one's new employer has chosen. 
 Many other Americans are not lucky enough to be offered health insurance at work at all, and are forced to use the emergency room as their site of primary care. Hence, I doubt whether Americans, if there were a truly informative national discussion on the issue, would take the bogus threat of single-payer serfdom seriously, especially if the single-payer system is pitched as ''Medicare for all.''
 Craig Duncan Ithaca, N.Y., Sept. 7, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks does not recognize that a single payer system based upon expanding Medicare, a proven system, to universal coverage does not mean ''free'' health care and would not place a burden on future generations.
 Of course, premiums would be paid, perhaps adjusted for income. 
 The difference would be that the not-for-profit single payer system would be dedicated solely to using premiums for paying for medical treatment rather than a cash cow used to maximize profit through investment, limiting benefits and denying claims. 
 Medical providers and consumers as well as small and large businesses would all benefit from this approach. The system of relegating a nation's health care to those interested only in profit is uncaring and in many ways, abusive. 
 Herb Wild Punta Gorda, Fla., Sept. 7, 2007
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks seems favorably disposed to Stuart Butler's health care reform plan for Americans. 
 While Mr. Butler's plan may be an excellent plan, it is both innovative and untried. I propose a health care plan for all Americans that is in place and is presently in use and has a high satisfaction rating albeit slightly controversial because it is a single-payer program. 
 I am speaking of the health care package that the United States government provides our president, vice president, senators, members of the House, Supreme Court justices, secretaries of state, defense and so on. 
 I am confident that this health care package that our government offers to our leaders would be acceptable to the overwhelming majority of our citizens. It's worth a try.
 Isaac Comerchero New York, Sept. 7, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks makes what he imagines to be two salient points explaining why single-payer health systems are not right for America: they are ''European'' and invariably centralized.
 He is mistaken on both counts. Canada has just such a system but is distinctly North American. 
 Canadian health care, moreover, is delivered by 10 provincial and several territorial governments, not the government of Canada. Almost all of these jurisdictions use highly regionalized delivery systems.
 There are, in fact, substantial variations in structure, procedures, coverage and financing, and these mirror and accommodate many local realities. Canadian health care already is the continent-spanning flexible web of networks Mr. Brooks so admires. 
 Ronald Hikel Stratford, Ontario, Sept. 7, 2007 The writer was deputy minister of health for the province of Manitoba, 2000-1, and co-chairman of the federal-provincial council of deputy ministers of health.
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks espouses a new, complex health care plan redolent of the costly Medicare replacement plans in effect since the beginning of 2007. The federal government is now spending additional overhead to finance plans that are partly public and partly private and that have replaced, for some of us, traditional Medicare.
 Two local medical groups my wife and I have tried to use this year will not accept our Medicare replacement insurance, even though both accept traditional Medicare. 
 Mr. Brooks writes that Americans ''will not likely embrace a system that forces them to defer to the central government when it comes to making fundamental health care choices.'' 
 He is manifestly wrong. 
 Millions find traditional Medicare more than satisfactory, and I lament that my wife and I are presently covered by an inadequate replacement plan rather than the excellent central government plan known as Medicare. 
 Robbins Winslow Naples, Fla., Sept. 7, 2007

HEADLINE: Pacific Rim Nations Adopt Nonbinding Emissions Targets

BYLINE: By TIM JOHNSTON; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting here limped to a close on Sunday, with a heavily compromised agreement on tackling climate change and few answers on how to advance the global trade agenda. 
 At the top of the agenda at this year's meeting of the Pacific Rim group -- whose 21 countries include the United States, China, Russia, Australia and Indonesia -- were global warming and the stalemate that has paralyzed the trade talks that began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. On both fronts, there was only limited success.
 ''The world needs to slow, stop and then reverse the growth of global greenhouse-gas emissions,'' the leaders said in a joint statement on the climate. 
 But the agreement sets no timetable for stemming the increase in carbon dioxide emissions after 2012. That is when the binding terms of the Kyoto Protocol -- the treaty adopted by most industrialized countries, but rejected by the United States and Australia -- expires.
 The APEC leaders hope that by 2030, for every 1 percent of growth in national output, the increase in carbon dioxide emissions will be held to 0.75 percent.
 Environmentalists say that cuts in emissions are needed and that concrete targets are the only solution. ''It's business as usual,'' said Ben Pearson of Greenpeace. He said that as economies become more advanced, they use energy more efficiently. But overall energy usage would not drop, he added. 
 Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the deal was the best that could be reached in the circumstances. ''What one has to do is find the maximum that individual countries will agree to at the present time, take that, bank it and move on to something further in the future,'' he told journalists.
 James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House environment office, said the agreement validated President Bush's longstanding approach to the climate issue -- rejecting top-down caps on emissions in favor of voluntary initiatives that propel technology improvements, and recognizing that a shift from growth to reduction in greenhouse gases will take time.
 But critics say the lack of ambition displayed in the climate change statement is indicative of a lack of urgency. 
 The leaders also issued a statement supporting the Doha round of trade talks.

HEADLINE: In Place of Smokestacks, Makers of Dumplings and Doors

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
On some buildings, big faded letters on warm red brick are like a sequoia's rings. The letters speak of age and industrial reincarnation. One long-gone brewery on Bergen Street in Crown Heights declares ''Heinz 57 Varieties'' and ''Monti Moving & Storage Miami Puerto Rico Calif. Overseas.'' 
 Well, the movers moved six years ago. Now the only varieties are the tenants, who represent the changing face of urban manufacturing. After this Brooklyn building was renovated and split into 25 work spaces, it became home in February to artists, woodworkers, film editors and architects. 
 Gregory Horgan and his wife, Cayce Becket, run a company that designs and builds custom architectural items, like handrails or wine cellar doors. The main area looks like a factory, with hammers, wrenches and sanding belts hung on a pegboard that serves as a backdrop to assorted power tools. Through a narrow doorway is a brighter space, filled with desks, computers and bookcases, where the pair meet clients and work out designs. 
 ''It's rough enough to work in,'' said Mr. Horgan. ''But it's clean enough to have an office.''
 Rough has its charms. There are thick beams and columns that date to the 19th century. The ceiling is mottled with a reddish-brown patina some folks would pay good money to duplicate. Mr. Horgan thinks it had something to do with the tomatoes that Heinz probably processed here a century ago.
 ''I couldn't wish for a better space than this,'' he said, admiring the ceiling. ''This is old Europe and modern industrial America.''
 Such is the New York factory in the 21st century. The smokestacks are gone, taking jobs (and pollution, sometimes) to places where hands are cheap. But according to advocates for industrial development in the city, newer specialty companies like Mr. Horgan's occupy a growing part of the city's industrial landscape, along with makers of food products, especially for the burgeoning ethnic market. Many other firms that make construction materials, furniture or lighting have also grown in response to increased demand for environmentally friendly buildings.
 ''The most important thing we found was the need for more and smaller industrial spaces,'' said Adam Friedman, executive director of the New York Industrial Retention Network, which assists manufacturers with space and advice. ''Big guys like Farberware and Swingline left the city. What survived here are the niche manufacturers where proximity to their market makes a big difference.''
 Inside the Monti Building (as it is still called) are companies that need to be in the city and close to clients: set designers for theaters, window prop studios for retail clothing stores, for example. For a firm like Mr. Horgan's and Ms. Becket's, being close to clients has other advantages in this age of environmental consciousness, since local procurement is one of the measures used by developers to tout ''green'' buildings.
 The four-story Monti Building itself has solar panels to power the studios, a green roof and floors that radiate heat in the winter. Its rebirth was the brainchild of Benton Brown and Sue Boyce, who were originally interested in just finding a living space where he might be able to do his sculpture. One thing led to another, and a factory space was born. They wound up living in the former brewery's icehouse around the corner. Now the building is his art.
 ''Everything is rented out, except for the ground floor,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We're looking for someone special. Definitely some type of manufacturer.''
 According to state figures, there are still some 230,000 manufacturing jobs in the city, which on average pay more and have better health insurance benefits than service jobs in retail or restaurants. Mr. Friedman noted that immigrants and minorities account for a majority of the production work force.
 In previous generations, immigration fueled industrial growth, providing a steady source of unskilled and eager workers. These days, the immigrants help spur industrial growth in unexpected ways. As newcomers arrive in this country, they bring with them tastes for familiar food, which Mr. Friedman said made ethnic specialty foods the fastest-growing segment of the New York food industry.
 ''New York is the perfect place to be making that,'' he said. ''We have people from 149 different countries living here. Each immigrant group creates its own market. And that becomes an incubator.''
 A low-slung building on a short Williamsburg side street has proved to be a hothouse for the Twin Marquis Food Group, makers and importers of a vast array of Asian products, from noodles and dumplings to bubble tea and ginger candies. Behind the bland facade are 150 workers in a spotless 80,000-square-foot factory that can crank out 44,000 dumplings an hour. Machines tuck the filling into the dumpling wrappers and move them through a 30-foot-long steam chamber and into a dark, cold freezer before they plop down into plastic bags.
 This behemoth started out in 1989 with just two people, one to make noodles and another to sell them to restaurants and stores in their Chinatown neighborhood. Rising rents in Manhattan nudged the company over the bridge, and it settled on its current location in 2004.
 ''Since we have more space, we were able to introduce more products,'' said Kevin Li, assistant marketing manager. ''Before, we sold to Chinese restaurants. Now, with more products, we target the mainstream, too. We have distributors who sell to supermarkets.'' 
 Not only are they able to satisfy the needs and tastes of customers from various parts of Asia, making Korean-style dumplings or Thai curry samosas, they are also trying to change American eating habits. 
 ''In Chinese culture, you can eat dumplings as a main course,'' Mr. Li said. ''Americans see it as an appetizer, but maybe we can change their perception one day.''
 Mr. Friedman sees such approaches as redefining the knowledge-based economy.
 ''It's funny to think of food processing as having knowledge content,'' he said. ''But that is exactly what is going on.''
 But the kind of pressure that forced manufacturers out of Manhattan is starting to surface in some of the other neighborhoods where they resettled. Joe Angel, a fourth-generation baker who makes muffins and distinctive black and white cookies, thought he had found a good space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, for $7.50 a square foot after his SoHo landlord quintupled his rent in 1999. During the day, the bakery is humming, while at night independent distributors line up for items that wind up throughout the city.
 Mr. Angel's arrival in Brooklyn marked a shift in the local economy: his bakery took over a 23,000-square-foot space after the previous tenant, a garment maker, moved production to the Dominican Republic. But now another local shift may have an unwanted effect on him; residential development along the waterfront is all but certain to raise his rent when his lease is up in three and a half years.
 ''I can't afford to put ovens and flour and mixers out there if it's costing me $20 a square foot,'' he said. ''It's not going to happen.''
 Recognizing that smaller manufacturers need affordable space -- and the city needs the jobs they provide -- some urban planners urged officials to rethink where industry can be located. Ron Shiffman, a veteran planner and chairman of the Industrial Retention Network, said many of the newer companies are a lot cleaner than past factories and can coexist alongside housing in mixed-use neighborhoods. He has also suggested an approach not normally associated with bricks and metal.
 ''We're thinking of a trust for industrial space,'' Mr. Shiffman said. ''The same way we realized we have to save small farms, I believe we are going to need to save places for manufacturing in urban areas.''
 Mr. Angel would like that. Right now, however, he is thinking of moving to New Jersey, even if that would eliminate the $1 million in sales to the independent distributors, since they would be reluctant to travel too far out of their way. Just in case, he is focusing on institutional and other markets that do not need to be near him, especially if he freezes his products before they are picked up by a single, larger distributor. 
 ''I still have three years,'' Mr. Angel added. ''We're hoping the real estate market will crash.''

HEADLINE: In Polygamy Country, Old Divisions Are Fading

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE, Utah, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
For generations of rural religious polygamists like those Warren S. Jeffs once led, this was the big town and the citadel of sin all in one. 
 St. George, founded on the southern route to California in wagon train days, was the place to buy groceries or spend an occasional night out. But it was also the local fortress of mainstream Mormonism, which is vehement in its opposition to polygamy. 
 The polygamists, in turn, looked down on Mormons as apostates who lost their way more than 100 years ago by denouncing polygamy, and thus the teachings of the church's founder, Joseph Smith, in a political compromise to achieve statehood for Utah. 
 Now Mr. Jeffs is being tried on felony charges that he was an accomplice to rape in arranging polygamous marriages between under-age girls and older men, and the jury is being drawn from a pool of St. George residents. 
 The trial is expected to throw a sharp light on polygamy and on the culture of Mr. Jeffs's group in particular, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is estimated to number about 10,000 people throughout the West. Jury selection began Friday, and Mr. Jeffs, 51, could face life in prison if convicted. 
 The old and bitter history of intra-Mormon relations hangs over everything here. But many people said the divisions were not what they once had been. Even as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon Church is known, has cracked down on polygamy in recent years, an intermingling of cultures has begun to bubble up here, opening hearts and minds in greater understanding, if not quite tolerance. 
 Economics, not religion, is driving the change.
 St. George and Washington County have exploded with growth over the last 10 years, as retirement and tourism melded with the draw of Las Vegas, about two hours away. For years, the county has ranked near the top of the nation in its rate of expansion.
 In the polygamist communities of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz., which Mr. Jeffs presided over as a prophet of God, according to his followers, family-based construction companies dominate business. St. George, about 35 miles away, grew and changed, drawing more non-Mormons than ever before, and polygamist builders were often the ones framing rows of new homes and pouring concrete foundations.
 And so the two sides got to know each other better. Some people here said that they hated what they had read about Mr. Jeffs, but that they had come to like some of the polygamists they had met.
 ''Awesome workers,'' said Aaron Svedin, who works in quality control in a vitamin manufacturing plant in St. George where three young men from polygamist families have recently been hired. The first started as a mechanic, and Mr. Svedin, a member of the Mormon Church, said the other two were hired because the first man worked out so well.
 Mr. Svedin, 38, said he thought he could be fair in judging Mr. Jeffs if he had been called as a juror, partly because he had gained a broader sense of the people in Mr. Jeffs's world. 
 ''I hope Warren Jeffs gets a fair shot,'' Mr. Svedin said.
 Few people in fundamentalist polygamy communities will talk to a reporter, let alone be interviewed. In Centennial Park, Ariz., about an hour southeast of St. George, one construction-business owner agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. He said that he had done jobs in St. George and that the town was a different place now.
 ''St. George had to grow up,'' the man said. ''They needed the help as they grew, and capitalism takes over very fast.''
 Thousands of newcomers to St. George, Mormon or not, have also diluted the community's opposition to polygamy in ways that could potentially affect the jury, residents said.
 Amber Clark, 28, an Army veteran who moved here from California about two months ago and who described herself as an active Mormon, said she thought polygamists should be left alone, so long as no one was under age or coerced into marriage. 
 ''I'm liberal in that respect,'' Ms. Clark said. ''If it's legal in some states for people of the same sex to get married, why is it not legal to marry more than one wife?'' 
 Some polygamist communities are responding to the new environment as well.
 Earlier this year, for example, a cafe called the Merry Wives opened in Hildale, acknowledging plural marriage, something that probably would not have happened as recently as a year or two ago, said the manager, Charise Dutson.
 A mural on the restaurant wall depicts three women working together in an idyllic, sun-drenched garden. Waitresses in long skirts serve breakfast. Most of the business comes from curious travelers on the highway, said Ms. Dutson, 35, but locals have increasingly warmed to the idea that it is acceptable not to fear outsiders so much.
 ''We are who we are,'' Ms. Dutson said. ''We're proud of our heritage.''
 The increasing contact is also building confidence that life after Mr. Jeffs, no matter what happens at the trial, will be different. 
 Paul Hanson, who lives in a fundamentalist community about an hour from St. George and works for a building products company, said he had come to understand that the Mormon splinter groups and the Mormon Church, based in Salt Lake City, shared the same flaw: they want their members to think a certain way.
 ''The reason I haven't joined any of the groups, even the Mormon Church, is that there's not enough freedom,'' Mr. Hanson said. ''You can't express your own opinions.''

HEADLINE: Longest, and Possibly Coolest, A Train Still a-Thrumming at 75

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; William Neuman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
On Sept. 10, 1932, one minute after midnight, a 7-year-old boy named Billy Reilly dropped a nickel into a turnstile and boarded an A train at 42nd Street. It was a southbound express, and it was Billy's first ride on an A.
 It was the city's first ride, too -- 171,267 passengers rode it that September day in 1932, its first day of operation. The line, then called the Eighth Avenue subway, spanned only 12 miles and 28 stations, from the top of Manhattan to the bottom.
 Some 75 years later, the A line stretches farther than it did back then, literally and culturally.
 Over the years, the A line has become less of a train and more of an icon, a symbol of the nearly 500,000 varied and eclectic New Yorkers and others it carries through the city daily. The A line is certainly not the oldest run in New York's subway system, nor has it ever been the smoothest-running, the most punctual or even the cleanest. But an argument could be made, thanks in part to Duke Ellington's up-tempo stamp of approval, that it is perhaps the coolest. 
 ''There's no 6 train song or D train song,'' said Dr. John Morrow, 33, a cardiologist who rode a packed A train recently on his way to lunch. ''The A train has a little more cultural significance.''
 Today, on the A line's 75th birthday, transit officials will celebrate with a ceremony at the start of the line at the Inwood/207th Street station. A special train made up of six prewar cars is scheduled to provide service along the line's original route to the Chambers Street stop in Lower Manhattan.
 Back in 1932, the new subway was part of the Independent Subway System, or the IND, the first city-owned subway network. The IND competed with two private subway systems, the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which opened first, in 1904. The city took control of the BMT and IRT in 1940. 
 The Eighth Avenue subway, which took seven years to build, was the IND's first line, and it dazzled riders with longer stations to accommodate 10- and 11-car trains, wider platforms and sleek R1 cars manufactured by Pullman Standard.
 ''The R1 cars that ran on the A train at that time were phenomenal,'' said Stan Fischler, a subway historian who has written several books about the city's subway system. ''If you had put air-conditioning into them, they'd be good enough to run today.''
 The A train is the longest line in the system -- 31 miles, from northern Manhattan through Brooklyn to Far Rockaway in Queens. New York City Transit, the arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that operates the subways, says it is the longest subway line in the world. 
 The A often feels like the city's very own transcontinental railroad, traveling deep under the ground and soaring high above it, below the bustle of Washington Heights, past old tombstones in graveyards in Ozone Park, over the waters of Jamaica Bay. Perhaps the most famous section is the run under Harlem heard between the notes of Ellington's ''Take the A Train.'' 
 ''Think about what a bargain it is,'' Mr. Fischler said. ''For two bucks you go all the way to Rockaway. Do you realize what that would cost you in a taxi? You couldn't afford the tip.''
 There is a strange symmetry to the line. You step on at the 207th Street station in Inwood in northern Manhattan, and you step off at the Far Rockaway/Mott Avenue terminal in Queens, near a western Long Island hamlet named Inwood. (Some trips end in Ozone Park and some in Rockaway Park.) 
 Those riding the A train the weekend before its anniversary, however, could hardly enjoy such uninterrupted, long-distance travel: Because of weekend track work, people had to board shuttle buses to get from Howard Beach to the Rockaways.
 ''I did not know I was going to be on a bus, but you kind of expect it on weekends,'' said Shamiyah Brown, 27, who rode the shuttle bus with her seven children and her niece on Saturday. ''I'm not surprised.''
 The A train's first registered complaint was apparently made just minutes after it began running, when a man at the Chambers Street station became upset because he had put two nickels into a malfunctioning turnstile. 
 Since then, the line has gotten mixed reviews from passengers and the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group. In the group's latest report card, which ranks the city's 22 main subway lines from best to worst, the A train was tied for 12th place. The group found, among other things, that the line arrives with below-average regularity.
 The A line has been crippled by fires (the January 2005 blaze at the Chambers Street station, for instance) and has seen its share of tragic and bizarre occurrences.
 The limbs and torso of a 19-year-old Brooklyn man were found in a blue plastic bag in a tunnel in 2005. Pigeons have been known to step aboard trains at the outdoor Far Rockaway stop and casually step off at the next station. In May 1993, a man posing as a subway motorman took an A train with hundreds of passengers for a three-and-a-half-hour ride. He made 85 stops, and arrived on time at the Ozone Park/Lefferts Boulevard station.
 On Saturday afternoon, the line that carried Billy Reilly on its inaugural run -- he moved to the front of the crowd at the 42nd Street station when a transportation commissioner learned he was born the day of the new subway's groundbreaking, March 14, 1925 -- carried Dr. Morrow, who sat reading and listening to a Tom Waits song on his iPod.
 It carried Ernest Rivera, 28, an unemployed father of three from Brooklyn. It carried Gunther, a Manhattan couple's white puppy. It carried a middle-aged woman with a tattoo on her chest, a man holding a surfboard and another man who had remembered to wear his A train T-shirt.
 Rudy Worrell, 54, knelt on the floor and played his flute and duct-taped keyboard. Mr. Worrell remembered taking the A train as a boy, to play hooky from school. Years later, he would return to the A, unemployed and homeless, playing his music aboard it for small donations.
 ''This is my bread and butter,'' he said as the train rumbled along. ''Ain't nothing like the A train.''

HEADLINE: Still Married, With Children, But Trading Insults in Russian

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Turn on the sitcom that is the hottest television show in Russia, and it all seems so familiar. Moored to his living room couch is a shoe salesman who is more interested in watching sports than conjugal relations. His wife has shocking hair and an even more shocking mouth. A couple of ne'er-do-well teenagers round out this bawdy, bickering bunch.
 In fact, the show is an authorized copy of the American sitcom ''Married With Children,'' with a Russian cast and dialogue but scripts that hew closely to those of the original. This knockoff is such a sensation, especially among younger viewers, that its actors have become household names, and advertisements for its new season are plastered around Moscow.
 A drumbeat of anti-Americanism may be coming from the Kremlin these days, but across Russia people are embracing that quintessentially American genre, the television sitcom, not to mention one of its brassiest examples. And curiously enough, it is the Russian government that has effectively brought ''Married With Children'' to this land, which somehow made it through the latter half of the 20th century without the benefit of the laugh track. 
 The show's success says something not only about changing tastes here but also about Russia's standing. Sitcoms are typically grounded in middle-class life and poke fun at it. The popularity of Russian versions of ''Married With Children'' and other adaptations of American sitcoms suggests that Russia has gained enough stability and wealth in recent years that these jokes resonate with viewers.
 '' 'Married With Children,' with its satire on the American middle class, fits the style of our channel well,'' said Dmitri Troitsky, a senior executive at the Russian channel TNT, a Gazprom-owned network whose programming bent is roughly similar to that of the Fox network in the United States. ''It seemed interesting and topical for us to do a parody on the Russian middle class.''
 These days, American visitors in Russia could be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled upon some bizarre realm of reruns. Adaptations of two other shows, ''Who's the Boss?'' and ''The Nanny,'' are also popular here.
 All three programs are distributed by Sony Pictures Television International, which has created versions of them and other American programs around the world, often in partnership with local producers. ''The Nanny,'' which was first broadcast here in 2004, was such a hit that after running out of episodes to copy, some of the show's original American writers were commissioned to create 25 more episodes, said Ron Sato, a Sony spokesman.
 ''Married With Children,'' which ran from 1987 to 1997 in the United States, has been renamed ''Schastlivy Vmeste,'' or ''Happy Together.'' Its setting has been moved from the Chicago area to Russia's heartland metropolis of Yekaterinburg. The sniping couple, Al and Peg Bundy, have become Gena and Dasha Bukin.
 The thrust is the same: sending up family life as outrageously -- or as vulgarly, depending upon your point of view -- as possible.
 A typical bit: In the living room, Gena suddenly tells Dasha to take off her clothes. Dasha is elated that Gena finally wants to have sex, and then Gena says, ''No, Dasha, I'm simply dying of hunger, and hope that that will take away my appetite.''
 Natalya Bulgakova, a spokeswoman for TNT, said the show, which had its debut last year, is now the most popular scripted series among Russians ages 18 to 30. (Older Russians typically roll their eyes at mention of ''Schastlivy Vmeste,'' as if they briefly wonder whether life under Communism was not so bad after all.)
 TNT is owned by Gazprom-Media, which is controlled by Gazprom, the Russian national resources behemoth that is controlled by the government. Asked about the show, Gazprom-Media said in a statement that it did not interfere in its stations' programming decisions.
 While even Americans who do not speak Russian could discern the American roots in ''Schastlivy Vmeste,'' it is fair to say that many Russian viewers might not. But even Russians who do would seem unlikely to be bothered by the show's origins.
 Russian television has come a long way from the staid, politically tinged fare of Communist times, and these days there are many channels offering a steady diet of movies, dramas, game shows, soap operas and reality shows -- some locally produced, some imported and dubbed. 
 News programs, which are tightly overseen by President Vladimir V. Putin's administration, are another story. As in Soviet days, they rarely divert from the Kremlin's point of view. Barbed political satire, which thrived after the fall of the Soviet Union, has been suppressed.
 Sitcoms were first broadcast in Russia in the 1990s, when the country was on the brink of economic collapse, but both original sitcoms and copies of American ones achieved poor ratings. People were struggling and seemingly not in the mood for breezy jokes about the lives of the comfortable. Unable to identify with the sitcoms' characters, Russians instead flocked to dubbed Latin American soap operas.
 Only recently, with the economic upturn, has the sitcom taken hold.
 ''This is probably the last television genre to be adopted in Russia,'' said Elena Prokhorova, who studies Russian television and is a visiting professor at the College of William and Mary, in Virginia. They did not work before, she said, because ''sitcoms require a very stable social life.''
 The producers and actors of ''Schastlivy Vmeste'' said that while the Russian scripts followed the outlines of the American ones, they had made changes for a Russian audience, fashioning plots around Russian holidays and using sets that better resemble interiors in Russia. Viktor Loginov, who plays Gena Bukin, looks younger than Ed O'Neill, who played Al Bundy, in part because the show is geared toward younger audiences.
 They also insisted that the humor was more Russian. ''We try to capture the so-called Russian soul so that it will be accepted by our Russian audience, so the character becomes a guy from the street,'' said Mr. Loginov, a classically trained actor.
 Still, the feel of ''Schastlivy Vmeste'' seems far more American than Russian. Classic Russian humor tends more toward narrative satire than slapstick. 
 Though ''Married With Children'' was something of a shock when it first appeared in the United States, provoking advertiser boycotts, two decades later the Russian version has not stirred a similar reaction. Russian television critics note that, as in much of the world, television here has become home for a lot of relatively coarse fare.
 Daniil B. Dondurei, editor in chief of Cinema Art magazine, said he saw a darker significance in the success of shows like ''Schastlivy Vmeste.'' 
 ''Today, people are becoming accustomed to not thinking about life,'' he said. ''The television is training them to not think about which party is in Parliament, about which laws are being passed, about who will be in charge tomorrow. People have become accustomed to living like children, in the family of a very strong and powerful father. Everything is decided for them.''

HEADLINE: A Watershed Agreement

 BODY:
A seven-year standoff over a huge commercial development that threatened New York City's water supply has been all but settled with a new agreement that would permanently protect sensitive lands while providing an economic transfusion to an area of New York State that could use one. 
 If successfully carried through, the compromise will mark a milestone for conservation, for watershed protection and for smart growth in the Catskills. It could serve as a template for agreements elsewhere in New York and the Northeast, where the tension between open space and development seems a permanent fact of life.
 At issue was an ambitious plan for a five-star resort offering 400 hotel rooms, 350 time-share apartments, a spa, conference center, restaurants and two golf courses on Belleayre Mountain, 120 miles northwest of New York and within 20 miles of two of the city's largest reservoirs. The fear was that the project would destabilize the mountain's thin soil, sending polluted water into streams feeding the reservoirs, and that it would also invite secondary development that would enlarge the threat. 
 Under the settlement, 1,200 acres on the more fragile eastern side of the mountain -- nearly two-thirds of the land in the original proposal -- would be sold to the state for inclusion in the Catskill Forest Preserve. The developer, Dean Gitter, would be allowed to build a considerably smaller resort on 620 acres on the western side of the mountain, but would also be required to limit environmental damage by not building on steep slopes and by not using chemical fertilizers on the golf course. The project is expected to generate 1,800 construction jobs and 450 permanent jobs and generate about $4 million annually in property and sales taxes.
 Nearly as remarkable as the deal itself was the number of moving parts involved in putting it together and the fact that they did not grind to a halt. 
 The architect of the compromise was Representative Maurice Hinchey, an upstate Democrat. Gov. Eliot Spitzer and his deputy secretary for the environment, Judith Enck, were crucial in reviving negotiations with Mr. Gitter. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development helped work out the environmental safeguards. And the Trust for Public Land, an open space preservation group, engineered the land sale. 
 In the end, everyone gave up something, but the result was a victory for the environment, for the local economy and most of all for common sense.

HEADLINE: Back From Iraq, Still Facing Fire

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Today and tomorrow, the United States ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, and the top American general there, David Petraeus, will appear before Congress to offer a progress report on the war. The Op-Ed page asked six experts on the Iraq conflict to come up with three questions they would pose to the two men.
 Beyond the Surge 
 1. General Petraeus, has the surge bought us anything more enduring than fleeting tactical victories?
 2. You and Adm. Michael Mullen, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have both said the surge will end in April 2008. What options do we have then?
 3. If the United States reduces its forces in Iraq over the next 12 to 24 months, is there a way to pursue our strategic goals of no genocide, no safe haven for Al Qaeda, and no regional war? -- Nathaniel Fick, a Marine infantry officer in Iraq and Afghanistan and the author of ''One Bullet Away.''
 Starving the Troops
 1. General Petraeus, why have the White House and State Department failed you by neglecting a diplomatic and economic surge to complement the military one?
 2. Based on the counterinsurgency calculus in the new Army manual you helped write, you don't have sufficient manpower in Iraq, even with the surge. Why has the administration not given you enough troops?
 3. Americans are well aware of the shortages of materiel, from rifle scopes to armored Humvees, our troops have suffered from. Why, for example, have you not been given a sufficient number of the effective mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles called ''MRAPs''? 
 -- Paul D. Eaton, a retired Army major general who was in charge of training the Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004.
 Wrong Way to Vote?
 1. Ambassador Crocker, in Iraqi elections, voters pick national party lists, not individuals to represent specific district constituencies. Has this system made it harder for Iraqi leaders to achieve legislative progress? If so, can it be changed?
 2. What changes in United States law could help you succeed in your work in Iraq?
 3. Should the United States create a civilian reserve corps to train, equip and deploy volunteer civilians for civilian reconstruction tasks, just as we do military reservists for military tasks? 
 -- Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense for policy from July 2001 to August 2005.
 Our 9-Year Plan
 1. General Petraeus, with Gen. George Casey, the Army chief of staff, having declared that the current level of American military commitments is ''not sustainable,'' what are your plans for preserving your recent gains while also achieving security in the rest of Iraq?
 2. In an interview with the BBC, you recently observed that ''the average counterinsurgency is somewhere around a 9- or a 10-year endeavor.'' With the Iraq war now approaching the four-and-a-half year mark, are we halfway to our goal? Or did the nine-year clock begin ticking only with the initiation of the surge?
 3. You have described your mission as ''buying time for Iraqis to reconcile.'' How will we know when reconciliation is occurring? Please explain how American collaboration with Sunni insurgents lends itself to this larger process of reconciliation. -- Andrew J. Bacevich, a professor of history and international relations at Boston University.
 Keep an Eye on Iran
 1. Ambassador Crocker, President Bush and others have made reference to bottom-up conciliation and the tribal uprising against insurgents in Anbar Province. Would Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and other Iraqi officials have taken any action to work with Sunni tribal leaders without pressure from the United States? Aren't you getting constant complaints from tribal leaders, and local and provincial Sunni officials, about the lack of central government cooperation and response? 
 2. What is the level of Iranian influence over the central government and in Shiite-majority areas in the south? Is it growing or weakening? How does Iran affect the size and actions of the various Shiite militias? 
 3. What Iraqi ministries are now effective and fully functioning in serving the needs of all Iraqis, rather than influenced by various religious and political factions? -- Anthony H. Cordesman, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 Bye to the Brits
 1. General Petraeus, even if we accept evidence that the ''surge'' is indeed delivering real tactical results, how great is the value of these when the Iraqi national government and its institutions still seem so ill fitted to exploit them?
 2. What do you think might be the consequences for the security situation in Iraq if the United States undertook military action against Iran's nuclear facilities?
 3. How serious are the consequences for allied strategy of the British Army's withdrawal from Basra? Are the British justified in their assertion that the security situation in the city is now sufficiently stable to allow the Iraqi National Army to manage it? -- Max Hastings, British military historian and author of ''Warriors: Portraits From the Battlefield.''

HEADLINE: Where's My Trickle?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Four years ago the Bush administration, exploiting the political bounce it got from the illusion of success in Iraq, pushed a cut in capital-gains and dividend taxes through Congress. It was an extremely elitist tax cut even by Bush-era standards: the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that more than half of the tax breaks went to Americans with incomes of more than $1 million a year.
 Needless to say, administration economists produced various misleading statistics designed to convey the opposite impression, that the tax cut mainly went to ordinary, middle-class Americans. But they also insisted that the benefits of the tax cut would trickle down -- that lower tax rates on the rich would do great things for the economy, helping everyone. 
 Well, Friday's dismal jobs report showed that the Bush boom, such as it was, has run its course. And working Americans have a right to ask, ''Where's my trickle?''
 It's true, as the Bushies never tire of reminding us, that the U.S. economy has added eight million jobs since that 2003 tax cut. That sounds impressive, unless you happen to know that a good part of that gain was simply a recovery from large job losses earlier in the administration's tenure -- and that the United States added no fewer than 21 million jobs after Bill Clinton raised taxes on the rich, a move that had conservative pundits predicting economic disaster.
 What's really remarkable, however, is that four years of economic growth have produced essentially no gains for ordinary American workers.
 Wages, adjusted for inflation, have stagnated: the real hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers, the most widely used measure of how typical workers are faring, were no higher in July 2007 than they were in July 2003.
 Meanwhile, benefits have deteriorated: the percentage of Americans receiving health insurance through employers, which plunged along with employment during the early years of the Bush administration, continued to decline even as the economy finally began creating some jobs. 
 And one of the few seeming bright spots of the Bush-era economy, rising homeownership, is now revealed as the result of a bubble inflated in part by financial flim-flam, which deceived both borrowers and investors.
 Now you know why 66 percent of Americans rate economic conditions in this country as only fair or poor, and why Americans disapprove of President Bush's handling of the economy almost as strongly as they disapprove of the job he is doing in general.
 Yet the overall economy has grown at a reasonable pace over the past four years. Where did the economic growth go? The answer is that it went to the same economic elite that received the lion's share of those tax cuts. Corporate profits rose 72 percent from the second quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2007. The real income of the richest 0.1 percent of Americans surged by 51 percent between 2003 and 2005, and although we don't yet have the data for 2006, everything we know suggests that the income of the rich took another upward leap.
 The absence of any gains for workers in the years since the 2003 tax cut is a pretty convincing refutation of trickle-down theory. So is the fact that the economy had a much more convincing boom after Bill Clinton raised taxes on top brackets. It turns out that when you cut taxes on the rich, the rich pay less taxes; when you raise taxes on the rich, they pay more taxes -- end of story.
 But it's not just trickle-down that has been refuted: the whole idea that a rising tide raises all boats, that growth in the economy necessarily translates into gains for the great majority of Americans, is belied by the Bush-era experience.
 As far as I can tell, America has never before experienced a disconnect between overall economic performance and the fortunes of workers as complete as that of the last four years.
 America was a highly unequal society during the Gilded Age, but workers' living standards nonetheless improved as the economy grew. Inequality rose rapidly during the Reagan years, but ''Morning in America'' was nonetheless bright enough to make most people cheerful, at least temporarily. Inequality continued to increase during the Clinton years, but wages rose, as did the availability of health insurance -- and the great majority of Americans felt prosperous. 
 What we've had since 2003, however, is an economic expansion that looks good if not great by the usual measures, but which has passed most Americans by. 
 Guaranteed health insurance, which all of the leading Democratic contenders (but none of the Republicans) are promising, would eliminate one of the reasons for this disconnect. But it should be only the start of a broader range of policies -- a new New Deal -- designed to turn economic growth into something more than a spectator sport.

HEADLINE: In Miami, Democrats Reach Out to Hispanic Voters

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Democratic presidential candidates courted the fast-growing Hispanic electorate on Sunday night by debating on a Spanish-language television network, where they promised to swiftly overhaul the immigration system and accused Republicans and President Bush of stoking anti-Hispanic sentiment.
 The three leading candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, had especially sharp criticism for leaders of the Republican Party. They expressed concerns that Republicans were enabling anti-immigrant feelings and even racist attitudes, or at least not taking a tougher stand against them.
 Mrs. Clinton said legislative proposals to overhaul the immigration system, which all the Democrats at the debate endorsed, had been used by Republicans and some in the news media to ''bash immigrants'' and engage in demagoguery.
 ''The Republican candidates need to understand that they are doing a great disservice to our country,'' she said. 
 Later, Mrs. Clinton added: ''There are many in the political and frankly in the broadcast world today who take a particular aim at our Latino population. I think it's very destructive.'' A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said after the debate that she was referring to the CNN anchor Lou Dobbs and the radio host Rush Limbaugh, among others.
 Mr. Obama, who is seeking strong support from both black and Hispanic voters, recalled a telegram the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sent to Cesar Chavez when the two men were each involved in protest strikes. The telegram read, ''Our separate struggles are one.''
 ''That's what's been missing from presidential leadership -- explaining to the American people from all walks of life that our separate struggles are one,'' Mr. Obama said. ''A president has to not only speak up forcefully against anti-immigrant sentiment and racist sentiment, but also make sure that all workers are being tended to.''
 Mr. Edwards put the blame on President Bush for divisive attitudes that can lead to anti-Hispanic sentiment, saying he ''uses absolutely every tool available to him politically to divide the country.'' Mr. Edwards added, ''This needs to be brought to an end.''
 The debate was an opportunity for the candidates to reach some of the 17 million eligible Hispanic voters in the United States in a primary season when they are expected to have a greater voice because of early contests in California and New York. It also allowed some of the candidates to highlight their ties to Hispanics. Gov. Bill Richardson, the only Hispanic running for the party's nomination, spoke a few lines of Spanish during the debate; Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the only other Democratic contender fluent in Spanish, used a bit as well.
 ''I am very proud of being a Latino,'' Mr. Richardson said in Spanish at the start before a moderator reminded him to speak English. 
 ''I'm disappointed today that 43 million Latinos in this country, for them not to hear one of their own speak Spanish is unfortunate,'' Mr. Richardson said to applause in the debate hall at the University of Miami.
 Yet neither Mr. Richardson nor Mr. Dodd, when asked, said they would support promoting Spanish as the second official language of the United States. Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who was also asked, did embrace the idea.
 The candidates generally focused on policies to support legal immigration and immigrants, and to a lesser extent on border security, unlike the Republican candidates, who tend to stress enforcement. (One of the eight Democratic candidates, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, did not attend the debate to prepare for Senate headings this week, a spokeswoman said.)
 None of the Democrats made any especially bold moves, although Mr. Dodd and former Senator Mike Gravel of Alaska said they would take steps to end the trade embargo with Cuba, and Mr. Richardson said he would consider it if President Fidel Castro released political prisoners.
 Mr. Dodd said that he would have a robust foreign policy in Central and South America and that the Bush administration had faltered in building relations and projecting a positive image of America to nations there.
 ''We shouldn't be losing a public relations battle to Hugo Chavez,'' Mr. Dodd said, referring to the leader of Venezuela.
 Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Dodd were pressed about their support for a barrier along the Mexican border and asked why they would not support a similar wall along Canada.
 Mr. Obama did not address the distinction between Mexico and Canada, talking instead about his support for an immigration overhaul and border security. Mrs. Clinton said she supported ''much more border patrolling and much more technology'' on both borders, and a barrier ''in certain areas.'' Mr. Dodd echoed Mrs. Clinton, then focused on making trade and economic agreements that benefited Central American countries.
 Mr. Richardson, meanwhile, criticized the notion of a barrier on the Mexican border as ''a horrendous example of Washington misguided policy.''
 ''If you're going to build a 12-foot wall,'' Mr. Richardson said, ''you know what's going to happen? A lot of 13-foot ladders.'' 
 The candidates did not offer major new ideas about fixing immigration, but sought instead to emphasize the intensity they would bring to the issue. Most of them said they would try to overhaul immigration in their first year in office and would include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants and tougher border security.
 Mr. Kucinich said the problem of illegal immigration stemmed partly from trade agreements like Nafta, which he said he would cancel as president. He said wrongheaded policies were to blame for illegal immigration, not the people themselves.
 ''There are no illegal human beings,'' he said to applause. 
 Several of the Democratic candidates, who as a field generally support withdrawing American troops from Iraq, said they did not expect a coming military report on conditions in Iraq to persuade them to change their views on ending the war. 
 America's top commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, is scheduled to speak to Congress on Monday, and some of the Democrats suggested that his testimony would be skewed rather than objective.
 ''What I'm concerned about, about the Petraeus report,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''is that it will basically be a sales job by the White House, that it'll be a P.R. document.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton said that nothing General Petraeus told Congress would persuade her to endorse the Bush administration's current strategy in Iraq.
 ''There is no military solution; that has been said for years now,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''That is why I believe we should start bringing out troops home.''
 Mr. Obama agreed that the current course in Iraq would only lead to ''the same problems that we've had,'' and called explicitly on Republican members of Congress to turn on Mr. Bush and support a timetable for withdrawal.

HEADLINE: Yanks Support Wang on Their Way to Sweep

BYLINE: By PAT BORZI

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Chien-Ming Wang was breezing along with a 3-0 lead Sunday, pitching as economically as ever, when things took a sudden bad turn. 
 Kansas City had two men on with two out in the fourth inning, and Wang walked Mark Teahen after getting ahead of him, 1-2, to load the bases. Then Alex Gordon ripped a high sinker inside the first-base line for a tying three-run double.
 With a postseason spot in the balance, every game is vital for the Yankees. Wang, no longer an intriguing youngster but the unquestioned ace of the staff, knew what he had to have happen from there. ''I had to slow down,'' he said. 
 Wang allowed only one more hit and no more runs before leaving after seven innings, and the Yankees rallied for a 6-3 victory to get Wang his 18th victory of the season. 
 With Seattle beating Detroit, 14-7, the Yankees opened a four-game lead in the wild-card race over the Tigers with 19 to play. In the American League East race, the Yankees remained five and a half games behind Boston, which defeated Baltimore on Sunday. The Red Sox' Josh Beckett also won his 18th game to tie Wang for the A.L. lead.
 ''We're not looking at Boston; we're looking at us,'' said Alex Rodriguez, who concluded a remarkable week by homering in his fifth consecutive game. ''We're proud of where we are, but we've got to make sure we finish it off.'' 
 Rodriguez continued to make a strong case for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award. His two-run homer in the first gave him four home runs and six runs batted in for the series, and seven home runs in his five-game streak. He has 52 this season. Only Roger Maris, Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle have hit more home runs in a season with the Yankees than Rodriguez has this year. Rodriguez went 7 for 12 (.583) in the series with five runs scored. 
 ''He's like a machine,'' first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz said. ''What he's doing now is not normal, and fun to watch.'' 
 Jorge Posada added a tie-breaking two-run double in the fifth as the Yankees won their fifth straight and completed a three-game sweep of the Royals. It was an encouraging start to a nine-game trip, with stops in Toronto and Boston to follow.
 ''The most important thing we can talk about at this point in time is our record,'' said Manager Joe Torre, noting the Yankees are a season-high 19 games over .500. ''We're playing well right now, and we have to make sure we pay attention every day.'' 
 It took some regrouping by Wang (18-6) after the fourth to make it happen. Torre described Wang's day as ''a little Jekyll and Hyde,'' with the one bad inning and occasional wildness mixed in. Wang stumbled covering first base in the first inning, but otherwise showed little sign of the stiff back that troubled him in his last start. He allowed five hits, struck out four and walked four, tying his season high. 
 ''He was a little too strong,'' Posada said. ''It seemed like he wanted to go too fast.''
 The Yankees came back in the fifth by capitalizing on two breaks. Left fielder Joey Gathright overran Rodriguez's one-out single for an error, allowing Rodriguez to take second. After Brandon Duckworth walked Hideki Matsui on four pitches, the left-hander John Bale relieved, and Posada lined a deep drive to right. Teahen turned left going back, and the wind blowing toward the foul pole carried the ball away from him and off the wall for a two-run double. 
 INSIDE PITCH
 Derek Jeter, whom Manager Joe Torre pulled from Saturday's game in the fifth inning with right knee stiffness, lobbied to play Sunday, but Torre stuck with his plan to sit him. With a day off Monday, Torre hoped the two-day rest would enable Jeter to return Tuesday in Toronto, perhaps as the designated hitter. ... Torre didn't hear from Roger Clemens about his side session Saturday, so he took the unusual step (for him) of sending Clemens an e-mail message Sunday morning. After the game, Torre reported that Clemens had not yet replied.
 Pitchers KEI IGAWA, SEAN HENN and ROSS OHLENDORF and outfielder BRONSON SARDINHA joined the Yankees from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. JEFF KARSTENS and Matt DeSalvo will meet the team in Toronto. ANDY PHILLIPS (broken right wrist) was transferred to the 60-day disabled list to clear room for Ohlendorf on the 40-man roster, making Phillips ineligible for postseason play.

HEADLINE: Redefining Goals: Less Talk of Victory Now

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, President Bush tried to avert an incipient rebellion in Congress over Iraq by presenting a new strategy that he said would be a prelude to a decrease in American forces. He began the effort with a speech at the United States Naval Academy where midshipmen interrupted him with hearty cheers. 
 Behind him, the White House had erected a huge backdrop emblazoned with the words: ''Plan for Victory.'' 
 On Monday afternoon, when Gen. David H. Petraeus begins testifying about the latest plan for extracting troops -- a slow process that could begin as early as December -- no one will be talking about achieving victory, just stability. Nor will there be orchestrated cheers. Part of the strategy this time is to keep Mr. Bush well in the background until later in the week, when he is expected to address the country with a revised plan, picking a course that the White House hopes will end the unusually public disagreements among the president's military advisers about how much more effort and blood to invest in the war.
 There is no doubt that Mr. Bush still staunchly believes that the Iraq project can be salvaged; visiting Anbar Province last Monday, he used the word ''success'' a half-dozen times. But the kind of ''victory'' he described in November 2005, when Representative John P. Murtha initiated the first Democratic calls to get out of Iraq, is no longer discussed as the goal. 
 Back then, Mr. Bush's 38-page ''National Strategy for Victory in Iraq'' defined victory with a set of short-, medium- and long-term goals whose accomplishment, he said, would guide the withdrawal of troops. Among the short-term goals were ''meeting political milestones; building democratic institutions; standing up robust security forces to gather intelligence, destroy terrorist networks, and maintain security; and tackling key economic reforms to lay the foundation for a sound economy.'' 
 General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, several senior administration officials acknowledge, will have to say that two years and two strategies later, those goals still appear distant -- the one common point of agreement in the tornado of recent reports from government agencies, the intelligence community and panels of outside experts. ''It's Crocker who has the harder job,'' a senior administration official said last week. ''Petraeus can argue that he's gotten somewhere. It's a much harder case to make on reconciliation.''
 General Petraeus's task, administration insiders and some outsiders said, is to use his credibility among Democrats and Republicans to make a case that President Bush can no longer make without support. Then comes the hard part: easing Mr. Bush, a man who revels in his own steadfastness, out of the straitjacket of his past optimistic pronouncements about what must be accomplished.
 Mr. Bush, as Robert Draper reported in his recent biography, ''Dead Certain,'' has said he must sound optimistic themes because that is who he is -- and because no one would follow a president who was publicly racked with doubt. It is a lesson that Mr. Bush is said to have extracted not only from his upbringing, but from his memories of another Texas president, Lyndon B. Johnson.
 Now, however, Mr. Bush's talk of ''victory'' or ''success'' has run headlong into the sober assessments of the National Intelligence Estimate, which Democrats plan to raise in the hearings this week. Mr. Bush has also heard in recent days from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are worried about the sustainability of current operations, and he has heard the concerns of the admiral in charge of Central Command, William J. Fallon, who has argued that with so many resources tied up in Iraq, the United States is dangerously unprepared for other confrontations, including the possibility of one with Iran.
 ''There's a lot of scar tissue that everyone has to cut through around here,'' said one senior administration official, who has been surprised by the degree to which Mr. Bush and his longtime aides are trapped by their own vision, and past statements, of how success in Iraq would transform the Middle East. One former senior official, brought in for consultations recently to the White House, said he now feared that Tehran, not the United States, had the greater influence over events in Iraq. ''There was silence in the room,'' he said. 
 But by the end of the week, Mr. Bush may find he is holding a number of cards. In recent interviews, Mr. Bush's aides have signaled the argument he will be making: that the progress General Petraeus has made at the provincial level, where Sunni Arabs have turned against Al Qaeda, will slowly start affecting politics and the potential for reconciliation in Baghdad, at the national level. He will argue that the change in attitude among Sunnis has created an opening that the United States must exploit, an argument that already appears to have persuaded some wavering Republicans in the Senate. 
 While it is unclear what Mr. Bush will say when he addresses the country, it does seem clear that he will no longer insist on ''victory,'' in the way he used the term in 2005, before troops can come home. Something more akin to Nixon's ''Peace With Honor'' appears to be in the cards, officials say, rewritten and updated for a very different kind of war. 
 Mr. Bush can take heart from Nixon's experience: 37 years ago, the Senate defeated the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment, which would have forced an end to military operations in Vietnam within months and forced a withdrawal the next year. If history does not repeat itself, it rhymes: the Democrats are backing away from plans they made in early summer, to push again for a hard deadline for troop withdrawal after General Petraeus's testimony. 
 Nonetheless, this week is likely to be regarded as a momentous one. Until a week ago, every presidential speech, every bit of military testimony, was about the need to persevere, and to add troops. Starting Monday, the new argument seems almost certainly to be about how fast or how cautiously to draw down, and what would constitute a ''sustainable'' presence in a country that even most of the Democratic presidential candidates acknowledge will require a major American presence for years to come.

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students will create proposals for hands-on, interactive and/or multimedia museum exhibits that bring different historical figures, eras, events, groups, or movements to life. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will create proposals for hands-on, interactive or multimedia museum exhibits that bring different historical figures, eras, events, groups or movements to life.
Author(s):
Sarah Kavanagh, The New York Times Learning Network
Yasmin Chin Eisenhauer, Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance: one hour
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Create quizzes for their classmates to complete and discuss why they learn and remember some material easily while other material is difficult to absorb and retain.
2. Discover how new museums have been bringing history to life through interactive exhibits.
3. Create their own hands-on museum exhibit proposals and pitch their ideas to their classmates.
4. Write letters to the teacher listing ways that history classes can be made more fun and engaging, or write reflection papers about a visit to a museum.
Resources and Materials:
- pens/pencils.
- paper.
- classroom board.
- butcher paper or posterboard.
- markers.
- copies of the article "History's Real Stuff (Sorry, Miss Grundy)," at www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070910monday.html (one per student).
Activities and Procedures:
1. Students respond to the following prompt (written on the board before class): "Compose a five-question true or false quiz on a topic in history of your choice. You should know the answers to each of your questions." When students have finished composing their quizzes, have them swap with the people sitting next to them. Each student should take the quiz and then have it graded by his or her partner. Once all pairs have finished grading, tally the results on the board. As a class, discuss which topics were most popularly used for the quizzes. Which subjects seem to produce the most number of correct answers? Why do they think these subjects were more memorable? Were they taught these subjects a certain way in class or were other learning resources employed that enhanced their learning?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "History's Real Stuff (Sorry, Miss Grundy)" (www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070910monday.html). As students read, instruct them to underline information offered by historians and museum learning specialists about the exhibits that seem to teach young people most successfully. Focus on the following questions:
a. Why did more visitors go to the National Museum of the Marine Corps, Mount Vernon and the International Spy Museum than attended the art museums on the National Mall?
b. How does Kathryn Shattuck, the article's author, use the "stale soda cracker"?
c. What does Ms. Shattuck mean when she says that "museum directors ... sense opportunity -- and profitability -- in the low [history] test scores" of American youth?
d. What word do you associate with high school history class?
e. Can you think of an example of how you might "find [yourself] -- spiritually, socially and intellectually" in the material presented in a history museum?
f. What source of historical information do you find the most trustworthy: your teacher, your older relatives, your textbook, museums or other sources?
g. What do the statistics on the Smithsonian's Web site say about how the popularity of history museums compares to the popularity of art museums?
h. What are some examples of interactive exhibits mentioned in this article? Do you know of interactive exhibits not mentioned in the article?
i. Do you think that history museums should "stop at nothing to attract a crowd"? Can the "bells and whistles" go too far? Why or why not?
j. Why are museums looking for ways to attract people of younger generations?
k. Colonel David Fabian says "the museum is not the artifacts. It's stories." How does this approach manifest itself in the exhibits mentioned in this article?
l. How is "hands-on" or "interactive" learning different from "regular" learning? Do you think young people learn more when they engage in interactive learning? Why or why not?
3. As a class, discuss the sentences and phrases that students underlined while reading. What was discussed in the article that conveyed the kinds of exhibits that teach young people successfully? Write students' answers on the board. This list should include that: viewers needs to find themselves in history, viewers need contact with real historical artifacts, viewers need sensory connections to the subject matter and viewers need to be told a story. Have students add to this list with other criteria they gathered from their discussion during the warm-up activity. Keep this list on the board for future reference.
Inform students that they will be creating a proposal for an interactive, hands-on history museum exhibit focusing on an era, event, movement, group or person. Have students brainstorm a list of possible subjects based on their studies. Which subjects seem to be most popular? Why? What makes a subject interesting? What makes it less interesting? Have the class as a whole select the subject they like the least and discuss ways they can make learning interesting, engaging and fun.
As a class, create a list of subtopics for the subject agreed upon for the exhibit proposal. For example, if your class's exhibit proposal will focus on America in the 1920s, your subtopics might be "styles and trends," "music and entertainment," "art and architecture," "technology and inventions," and "books and literature."
Next, split the class into small groups and assign each a subtopic. Tell groups that they will create proposals for the design of interactive, multimedia or hands-on exhibits to teach museum visitors about their respective subtopics. Each group's proposal should include: a diagram, map or drawing of the entire exhibit along with a written description of what will happen at the group's individual station, and a description of what people will learn from the exhibit as a whole. Students should be given butcher paper, or poster board, and markers to create their diagrams, maps or drawings. Have students review the article they just read for examples of interactive exhibits. Remind them that successful interactive exhibits have included sensory experiences, multimedia presentations, re-enactments, role-playing and hands-on activities. Have students look through their class notes, handouts and textbooks for relevant historical content.
Once groups have finished both the drawn and written components of the proposals, inform them that they will now pitch their respective ideas to a museum board. The objective of their presentations is to sell their ideas to the museum board by highlighting how their proposals will hold the attention of young museum visitors while simultaneously educating them.
Call one group to the head of the classroom to present first. Then choose one representative from each of the remaining groups to sit in a semi-circle facing the presenters to play the role of the museum board. The rest of the class should sit behind the students who are playing the board. After the first group presents, have the students who are playing board members ask clarifying questions of the presenters. Remind students that the goal of the board is to find an exhibit that educates as well as entertains.
Repeat this process to make sure that every student has a turn.
Once each group has pitched a proposal to the class, reconvene. Remind students of the activity they did at the beginning of class. Ask them again if they can think of ways to make learning history interesting. How can the techniques used in museums be used in schools?
4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: If you are teaching this lesson in tandem with a trip to a museum, have students write reflection papers about their visit. What was the most memorable exhibit or learning center? Why? What did they like least and most? Did the museum meet the criteria for interactive exhibits that the class discussed? Why or why not?
If you are not teaching this lesson in tandem with a trip to a museum, have students write letters to history teachers listing ways that history classes can treat stories as "the heart" of history in order to make learning more interesting to young people. Outline specific strategies history teachers can use to make the classroom and the subject matter more interactive and hands-on. Can teachers use different technologies? Can they teach different content? Can they engage students in specific types of activities? What can students do to support teachers in this endeavor?
Further Questions for Discussion:
- Do you have a favorite museum? Why is it your favorite?
- What projects have you done in history classes that have inspired you or piqued your interest?
- What projects have bored you?
- What eras, events, movements or people in history do you think are the most interesting to learn about? Why?
- What eras, events, movements or people in history do you think are the least interesting to learn about? Why?
Evaluation and Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on completion of the quiz activity, participation in class and group discussions, creative execution of exhibit proposals and presentations, thoughtful composition of letters or reflection papers.
Vocabulary:
mettle, marksmanship, verisimilitude, re-enactment, espionage, artifacts, evocative, curators, expansive, catering, diaspora, multimedia, interactive, exhibitions, fuselage, ricocheting, crusader, inaugural, subtle, melding, poignant, flamboyant, bolstered, quintessentially, effusively.
Extension Activities:
1. Create an evaluation form for a museum that you will visit as a class. What criteria should an educational museum geared toward young people meet? While on the museum visit fill out the evaluation form and discuss your findings when you return to class.
2. Write a letter to a museum that you have visited with suggestions about how it can gear exhibits toward young people while maintaining educational integrity.
3. Visit a local museum and pick one gallery to modify in order to make it more interactive and hands-on. Determine what the gallery is trying to teach and find new ways to teach the same material. Submit your suggestions to the museum curator.
4. What do curators do? What are their job responsibilities? What education and experience did they need before becoming curators? What do they like most about their profession? What do they like least? Interview a curator at a local museum or historical society for answers and submit an article for the features section of your school newspaper.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Economics - Research how museums are financed. Look at the differences between public and private museums. What roles to government funding and philanthropy play? Create a chart that compares several museums along these criteria.
Fine Arts - Create a proposal for an interactive art museum exhibit for a specific movement like Cubism or Impressionism.
Science - Science museums have been very successful at creating interactive exhibits geared toward young people. Create your own version of a hands-on science museum for elementary students. Act as a tour guide for students when they visit your museum.
Technology - Visit the Web site of one of the museums mentioned in the article and explore the exhibits. Write a review and include suggestions for how the museum can make better use of the Internet to extend and enhance the experience.
Teaching with The Times - Visit the online audio slideshow that accompanies the article you read in class. (At www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/07/arts/20070909_HISTORY_FEATURE.html.) Pick another article from the print edition of The Times and write a proposal for how the paper could use the Internet to enhance this article and attract younger readers.

HEADLINE: Seeking Terror's Causes, Europe Looks Within

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Since the terror attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 six years ago, Europe has faced far more new attacks and reported plots than the United States. 
 Train bombings in Madrid three years ago killed 191 people, the London transit attack two years ago killed 52 commuters, and a string of plots have been discovered and foiled. Then last week, arrests were made in Germany in a plot that the police said could have caused even worse carnage than in Madrid or London.
 In response, Europeans for the most part are looking inward to explain why Islamist extremists have made the Continent a favored target, while the United States has been spared -- despite its position of world leadership and the anger it has stirred waging wars in two Muslim countries.
 In that setting, questions about how minority populations of Muslims are integrated into the mainstream are coming to the fore, along with basic questions about Islam itself. Less attention is being focused on finger-pointing at the United States, analysts say. 
 German newspapers reporting on the arrests last week of three men -- two German citizens who converted to Islam and a Turkish resident of Germany -- did not mention the Bush administration. Instead, they focused on the debate about tougher security measures, and on Islam itself. An editorial in Bild on Friday said: ''There are no easy answers. But the 1.4 billion or so Muslims owe it to the rest of the world to at least try to give answers and find a remedy. A religion with bloody margins does not belong in a world which wants to and must move closer together.'' 
 France and Germany both opposed the war in Iraq, and both countries have been targets of terrorist plots by Islamist extremists, noted Francois Heisbourg, a French expert on terrorism and a special adviser to the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. 
 ''Bush is incredibly reviled in Germany, and Iraq is viewed as a total disaster, which it is,'' he said. ''But it doesn't lead people to say we have terror because of Bush. Why? Because these guys strike a country that is against the Iraq policy.'' 
 A French government white paper in 2006 described 11 attempts by Islamist jihadists to blow up targets in France in the past 10 years, some of them before 9/11, Mr. Heisbourg said. This showed, he said, that just because France has criticized the Bush administration and stayed out of Iraq, it enjoys no immunity from terrorism. 
 The foiled attack announced by the German government last week was probably motivated by Germany's involvement in Afghanistan, said Jeremy Shapiro, a specialist in European affairs at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
 German troops in Afghanistan have been targets of the Taliban, and demands for a withdrawal are growing in the German Parliament. A vote on German participation in the war is scheduled for next month. 
 Europeans' concern about their vulnerability to terrorism was highlighted last week when the German Marshall Fund released a survey showing a sharp increase in the number of Germans who fear international terrorism. 
 The survey found that 70 percent of Germans felt they might suffer a terror attack, 32 percentage points more than in 2005. That brings the level of fear among Germans close to the level among Americans, which stood at 74 percent in a similar survey, said John K. Glenn, the director of foreign policy at the German Marshall Fund. 
 The increased alarm in Germany follows the failure of an attack during the World Cup last year in which two suitcase bombs were placed on commuter trains but did not explode. Two Lebanese suspects in that plot were said to have been angered by cartoons published first in a Danish newspaper that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad. 
 The growing anxiety of Germans could also reflect stepped-up warnings of the danger of attacks from the interior minister, Wolfgang Schauble.
 The most recent results by the Pew Global Attitudes Project show that the United States continues to be held in low regard in Europe. In a 2007 survey in Germany, the proportion of respondents with a favorable opinion of the United States fell to 30 percent, from 60 percent in 2002; and in France the percentage with a good impression of the United States fell to 39 percent, from 62 percent. The surveys had margins of sampling errors of plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage points. 
 In Spain, a great majority of the population concluded after the attacks on commuter trains in March 2004 that if Jose Maria Aznar, as prime minister, had not dispatched Spanish troops to Iraq in league with the Americans, the attacks would not have happened, said Juan Aviles, a professor of contemporary history at the National University for Distance Learning. 
 Even so, he said that a February 2005 survey by the Royal Elcano Institute, a Madrid research center, found that 63 percent of respondents felt that Islamist terror sprang mainly from religious fanaticism, up from 59 percent in May 2004, and that only 17 percent believed that anti-American sentiment was the cause, down from 24 percent nine months earlier.
 The deep uneasiness about the spread of Islamist radicalism has taken hold across Europe, said Christoph Bertram, the former director of the Institute of International Security Affairs in Germany. 
 ''There is a sense in our societies that the radicalism was not created by the United States but caused by the lack of integration,'' Mr. Bertram said. ''One of the points we all recognize is that it has been extremely difficult to integrate the third generation.'' 
 Each European country has encountered its own set of problems trying to deal with its Muslim population. 
 In France, for example, the riots in 2005 in Paris among mostly North African immigrants, many of them Muslims, were mainly about economic discrimination, said Mr. Heisbourg, the terrorism expert. In Britain, the Muslim population is overwhelmingly Pakistani and is reasonably well integrated economically, but many Pakistanis feel stronger cultural ties to Islam and Pakistan than to Britain. 
 In response to the 2005 attacks on the London transit system by four suicide bombers, and before last week's foiled attack in Germany, the British and German governments were searching for ways to better integrate their Muslim populations. 
 Constanze Stelzenmuller, the director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin, said earlier government attitudes of ''indifference masquerading as tolerance'' had now been shunted aside. Now, she said, German-language courses are offered to Turkish immigrants, particularly women, to better integrate those at the edges of the population of Turkish origin, which totals 2.7 million. 
 The core of the 9/11 attackers hatched their plan in Hamburg, so ''no one is blaming the Americans,'' Ms. Stelzenmuller said. ''A reasonable German on the street will say that the jihadists are brought on by their rejection of society, and that Western foreign policy is a root cause of that.''

(PHOTOGRAPH BY ULI DECK/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY) CHART: ''Terror Plots in Europe'' Major terrorist attacks or plots previously uncovered by authorities in Europe: 2004 SPAIN: On March 11, four bombs placed on commuter trains in Madrid killed 191 people. Twenty nine men have been on trial since last February. BRITAIN: On March 30, British authorities said they had foiled a plot to set off fertilizer bombs around London. In April 2007, five men were convicted of the plot and jailed for life, and two were acquitted. 2005 BRITAIN: Four suicide bombers killed at least 52 people on the London transit system on July 7. On July 21, another group tried to detonate their backpacks with explosives on three subway trains and a bus, but the explosives failed to detonate. Four men were convicted in July 2007 and sentenced to life in prison
two others will be retried. 2006 GERMANY: In July, two homemade bombs, carried onto commuter trains in Cologne in suitcases, failed to explode. Two Lebanese men were arrested. Officials later said the plot was fueled in part by anger over the publication of satirical cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper. BRITAIN: In August, authorities said there was a plot to blow up as many as 10 passenger jets bound for the United States and began raids across Britain to break up the plot. They said 24 suspects were planning to carry liquid explosives onto the airliners. At least seven have been released
the first trials could begin next year. DENMARK: In September, nine men were arrested on suspicion of preparing explosives for a terror attack. Five were eventually released
 the trial of the remaining four began this month. 2007 BRITAIN: In June, two car bombs were found in London and two men rammed a Jeep Cherokee into an entrance at Glasgow Airport. Officials initially focused on eight suspects, almost all in the medical profession, but four were released without charge. Three doctors have been charged, and a fourth suspect died of burns sustained in the Jeep crash. DENMARK: Eight men were arrested this month on suspicion of plotting a bombing. Investigators described the threat as imminent and said the arrests grew out of an international investigation that had lasted several months. Six suspects were released after brief detention. Some of the suspects had connections to ''high-ranking members of Al Qaeda,'' a Danish intelligence official said.

HEADLINE: In Hartford and Bridgeport, Bits of Drama in Primaries

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Although voters in 23 cities and towns across Connecticut will cast their ballots in primary elections on Tuesday, few contests are expected to be as dramatic as the contests in Hartford, where the home of the mayor was searched last month by state investigators, and Bridgeport, where the mayor, who has admitted to past drug dependency, is rumored to be considering a run as an independent.
 Mayor Eddie A. Perez of Hartford, who has three opponents in the Democratic primary, is the city's first Hispanic leader. Last month, investigators searched his house in connection with an investigation into his hiring of Carlos Costa, a contractor with multimillion-dollar city contracts, to renovate his kitchen and bathroom without obtaining the proper permits. Mr. Perez, 49, who quickly apologized, explained that Mr. Costa was a longtime friend whom he paid for the work, albeit late. 
 Although no charges were filed against Mr. Perez, the whiff of scandal was enough to turn several Democratic voters interviewed on Monday against him.
 Sara Cohen, a violinist who was having lunch at Tisane, a bistro near the Victorian homestead of Mark Twain, said Mr. Perez's troubles reminded her of an earlier Connecticut corruption scandal. ''I thought he was all right until the news broke,'' she said. ''But now the whole thing just smacks of John Rowland.'' 
 Mr. Rowland, a Republican, resigned as governor in 2004 and served almost a year in federal prison for receiving benefits, including home renovations, from people doing business with the state.
 Next door, standing outside the clothing store he owns, Michael Vallieres, 30, echoed Ms. Cohen. 
 He said Hartford, an impoverished city of about 120,000 people, needed a mayor with a good relationship with Washington. Mr. Vallieres said he planned to vote for one of Mr. Perez's Democratic challengers, I. Charles Matthews, a lawyer and three-term city councilman who was deputy mayor in the early 1990s.
 Rufus Corbett, 67, said he, too, might vote for Mr. Matthews. But less than 24 hours before the primary, Mr. Corbett, like at least a dozen other Hartford residents interviewed, said he was still undecided.
 ''The Perez scandal put a shadow on the thing,'' Mr. Corbett said as he entered a CVS drugstore in the city's west end, where he has lived for 42 years. ''I've been listening to Mr. Matthews, and I like what he has to say about the economy, so I may vote for him. But today I look at one person, tomorrow, another.''
 Mr. Perez is also facing Art Feltman, 49, a state representative who is the House chairman of the legislature's Planning and Development Committee. The fourth candidate is Frank D. Barrows, 61, who served in the State Senate for eight years and is a corrections officer. 
 The Republican committees in both Hartford and Bridgeport have endorsed candidates who are running unopposed in the general election.
 Perhaps the most closely watched political figure in Bridgeport this election season is the city's Democratic mayor, John Fabrizi, who is not officially running for re-election but is said by workers for other campaigns to be considering a run as an independent. 
 In a city where a former mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, is serving a nine-year sentence on corruption charges, voters were surprisingly sanguine about Mr. Fabrizi, who admitted in June 2006 that he had been addicted to cocaine. 
 Many residents said Mr. Fabrizi was ''only human'' and entitled to some flaws, primarily because he responds to their needs.
 Gary Peterson, 45, leaned on his red pickup, parked on Mill Hill Avenue, and explained why he wanted to see Mr. Fabrizi remain in office.
 ''I feel he's accessible,'' said Mr. Peterson, a plumber. ''If there's a problem, you call him up and he always gets back to you. I don't care if it's 10 o'clock at night.''
 Joey Lopez, an unemployed construction worker, agreed. 
 ''He rides through the neighborhood,'' said Mr. Lopez, 51. ''He eats at the local restaurants. He said he tried coke. Who hasn't tried drugs? Everybody has a past.''
 The candidates for the Democratic nomination for mayor are Bill Finch, 51, who was re-elected in November to a fourth term in the State Senate, and Christopher L. Caruso, 48, a state representative who was first elected in 1990. On Monday, Mr. Finch and Mr. Caruso jousted on a local radio show on subjects including the city's economy and plans to restore a long-defunct city fountain. Mr. Finch has been endorsed by the city's Democratic committee. 
 Joshua Logan, 26, who was trimming sideburns on a customer at the V.I.P. Barber Shop, said Mr. Finch had helped secure state money for his alma mater, Central High School.
 ''I know his word means something,'' Mr. Logan said.
 Mr. Caruso, who was raised on the city's east side and worked as an X-ray technician for many years, was the only legislator who turned his back on Mr. Rowland during an address to the General Assembly after the governor admitted that he had accepted free work on his lakeside cottage. He said it was because of cuts in aid to Connecticut cities.
 Also seeking the mayor's office is Ralph Cennamo, 87, a political gadfly who is registered with the independent Park City Party. Campaign workers are speculating that if Mr. Caruso wins the primary, Mr. Cennamo will drop out of the race and Mr. Fabrizi will step in. Mr. Fabrizi could not be reached for comment Monday night.

HEADLINE: An Opportunity for Wall Street In China's Surveillance Boom

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Li Runsen, the powerful technology director of China's ministry of public security, is best known for leading Project Golden Shield, China's intensive effort to strengthen police control over the Internet. 
 But last month Mr. Li took an additional title: director for China Security and Surveillance Technology, a fast-growing company that installs and sometimes operates surveillance systems for Chinese police agencies, jails and banks, among other customers. The company has just been approved for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The company's listing and Mr. Li's membership on its board are just the latest signs of ever-closer ties among Wall Street, surveillance companies and the Chinese government's security apparatus. 
 Wall Street analysts now follow the growth of companies that install surveillance systems providing Chinese police stations with 24-hour video feeds from nearby Internet cafes. Hedge fund money from the United States has paid for the development of not just better video cameras, but face-recognition software and even newer behavior-recognition software designed to spot the beginnings of a street protest and notify police. 
 Now, the ties between China's surveillance sector and American capital markets are starting to draw Washington's attention.
 Rep. Tom Lantos, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was disturbed by a recent report in The New York Times about the development of surveillance systems in China by another company, China Public Security Technology, which, like China Security and Surveillance, incorporated itself in the United States to make it easier to sell shares to Western investors. 
 Mr. Lantos called American involvement in the Chinese surveillance industry ''an absolutely incredible phenomenon of extreme corporate irresponsibility.'' 
 He said he planned to broaden an existing investigation into ''the cooperation of American companies in the Chinese police state.'' 
 Executives of Chinese surveillance companies say they are helping their government reduce street crime, preserve social stability and prevent terrorism. They note that London has a more sophisticated surveillance system, although the Chinese system will soon be far more extensive. 
 Wall Street executives also defend the industry as necessary to keep the peace at a time of rapid change in China. They point out that New York has begun experimenting with surveillance cameras in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city, and that corporations make broad use of surveillance cameras in places like convenience stores and automated teller machines.
 ''Is New York a police state?'' said Peter Siris, the managing director of Guerrilla Capital and Hua-Mei 21st Century, two Manhattan hedge funds that were among the earliest investors in China Security and Surveillance. 
 Mr. Lantos and human rights advocates contend that surveillance in China poses different issues from surveillance in the West because China is a one-party state where government officials can exercise power with few legal restraints.
 Mr. Lantos is part of a Democratic Congressional majority that is increasingly eager to confront China at a time of high Chinese trade surpluses and considerable economic insecurity in the United States. He is also a longtime ally of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House and a fellow Californian, who made her reputation in Congress as a critic of China on human rights issues.
 A White House spokesman, Tony Fratto said the White House would not comment on specific companies, adding, ''It's not appropriate to interfere in the private decisions of Americans to invest in legally incorporated firms.''
 The New York Stock Exchange said that it had no comment except to confirm that China Security and Surveillance was expected to list on the exchange ''later this year, subject to the usual conditions, including approval by the S.E.C.'' 
 Because the company already has shares traded in the United States and is not selling any additional shares, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations say approval is automatic once the company fills out a notification form and the New York Stock Exchange confirms it has approved the listing. 
 Over the last year, American hedge funds have put more than $150 million into Chinese surveillance companies. 
 The Chinese government trade association for surveillance companies, which also regulates the industry, predicts that the surveillance market here will expand to more than $43.1 billion by 2010, compared with less than $500 million in 2003. Under the Safe Cities program adopted by the government last winter, 660 cities are starting work on high-tech surveillance systems. 
 Many Western experts, skeptical that China faces a terrorism threat, have suggested that the government may be using it as an excuse for tougher policies toward ethnic minorities in western China, notably Xinjiang Province, and toward Tibet.
 Terence Yap, the vice chairman and chief financial officer of China Security and Surveillance Technology, said his company's software made it possible for security cameras to count the number of people in crosswalks and alert the police if a crowd forms at an unusual hour, a possible sign of an unsanctioned protest.
 Mr. Yap said terrorism concerns did exist. His company has outfitted rail stations and government buildings in Tibet with surveillance systems.
 Mr. Yap and Lin Jiang Huai, the chairman and chief executive of China Public Security, said that their companies did not do business with the Chinese military and should not raise concerns in the United States. They also said their businesses used technology developed in China and were therefore not subject to United States export controls. 
 China Security and Surveillance has been aggressively raising money in the United States, including $110 million in convertible loans so far this year from the Citadel Group, a big hedge fund in Chicago. In the last 18 months, the company has used the money to acquire or make a deal to buy 10 of the 50 largest surveillance companies in China. 
 James Mulvenon, the director of the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, which does classified analyses of foreign military and intelligence programs for the Pentagon and other government agencies, said that Beijing clearly wanted the company to consolidate the industry.
 ''They're really sort of the Ministry of Public Security's national champion,'' Mr. Mulvenon said of China Security and Surveillance. ''In terms of the gear and building the surveillance society, they are the ones.''
 After the company announced sharply higher sales and profit on Aug. 13, a succession of American hedge fund managers and investment bank analysts took turns on a conference call questioning and congratulating Mr. Yap.
 Traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board market while waiting for the beginning of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company has raised almost all of its money through the Citadel loans and private placements of stock with 17 institutional investors in the United States, including the Pinnacle Fund and Pinnacle China Fund in Plano, Tex., and JLF, a hedge fund based in Del Mar, Calif.
 The Pinnacle funds' investments have risen six-fold in 17 months. The funds, which raise all their money in the United States, are also the main investors in China Public Security Technology, with a stake that has nearly tripled in value since February.
 Barry Kitt, the founder and general partner of the funds, declined to comment. Citadel and JLF officials also declined to comment.
 Each time China Security and Surveillance makes an acquisition, it holds an elaborate banquet, with dancers. The majority of the 500 or more people invited are municipal and provincial security officials, as well as executives of rival companies that may become acquisition targets.
 ''When they come, they hear central government officials endorsing us, they hear bankers endorsing us or supporting us, it gives us credibility,'' Mr. Yap said. ''It's a lot of drinking, it's like a wedding banquet.''
 Lehman Brothers bankers and various Ministry of Public Security officials have spoken at such events, which have been held all over the country. One was at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, where Mr. Li himself -- of Project Golden Shield -- addressed the crowd. 
 China Security and Surveillance has headquarters in Shenzhen, a high-tech manufacturing center in southeastern China, but two years ago it purchased a ''shell'' Delaware company with no operations but a listing on the American over-the-counter bulletin board market. It turned the Delaware company into its corporate parent.
 China Public Security, also with headquarters in Shenzhen, incorporated in Florida in the same way to obtain a listing on the over-the-counter bulletin board.
 China Security and Surveillance is involved in some of the most controversial areas of public security. Mr. Yap said on the conference call with Wall Street analysts and hedge fund managers in August that one of the company's growth areas involved surveillance systems for Internet cafes; the government is trying to clamp down on users of the cafes in order to discourage pornography and prostitution.
 Critics say the surveillance is aimed at catching democracy advocates, Falun Gong adherents and others the Communist Party regards as threatening, noting that rules for nightclubs are less rigorous, and do not require live feeds to police stations.
 Mr. Yap said investment firms from Europe, the United States and Asia were so enthused about the surveillance market in China that he typically led a full-day tour each week to some of the company's factories and installations. 
 At an aging Shenzhen police station, where the scuffed and peeling yellow walls look as though they have not been painted since the Cultural Revolution, a $100,000 bank of new video screens behind the duty officer's desk shows scenes from nearby streets. In another neighborhood, the company has installed a $1 million system.
 Many of the surveillance cameras are still assembled at a modest factory. But the company has used $20 million of the cash it raised in the United States to acquire a large industrial park with six just-completed factory buildings and six dormitories. 
 In Shenzhen, white poles resembling street lights now line the roads every block or two, ready to be fitted with cameras. In a nondescript building linked to nearby street cameras, a desktop computer displayed streaming video images from outside and drew a green square around each face to check it against a ''blacklist.'' Since China lacks national or even regional digitized databases of troublemakers' photos, Mr. Yap said municipal or neighborhood officials compile their own blacklists.
 To show off his systems, Mr. Yap strode across a nearby plaza flanked by apartment towers and a low-rise shopping area, pointing out tiny unobtrusive domes and tubes attached to various poles. ''See, there's a camera on the lamp pole, and another one over there and another one here,'' he said. ''Big Brother is watching you.''

HEADLINE: Defendant in Student's Death Was Jealous, Prosecutors Say

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
An unemployed and sometimes homeless security guard charged with strangling the daughter of New York University professors told investigators that he had been jealous because she invited other men but not him to her party, prosecutors said in court papers released yesterday. 
 Prosecutors said the homeless man, Michael Cordero, 23, made a videotaped statement in which he said that on Aug. 2, the night after the party, he had gone to the apartment in Greenwich Village where his girlfriend, Boitumelo McCallum, 20, was staying.
 They argued and he choked her to death, according to prosecutors' written account of the statement. 
 Then, as if they were breaking up, he took a pair of dog tags inscribed with their names and put it in one of her hands and wrapped a towel around her body, according to the prosecutors' account.
 Ms. McCallum had given him the dog tags for his birthday, he told investigators.
 ''He had called her during the party, and could hear that there were men at the party,'' the prosecutors' account says. 
 After his arrest on Aug. 8, Mr. Cordero appealed to the sympathy of a detective, telling him he was an orphan and had had a hard life, according to another document filed by prosecutors yesterday. 
 He said that he loved Tumi, Ms. McCallum's nickname, that they ''had a special thing, that his life has been hard, that his parents are both dead,'' according to the same document. 
 The details of Mr. Cordero's statements were released as he pleaded not guilty yesterday to second-degree murder and petty larceny. Ms. McCallum's parents watched the arraignment, sitting in separate rows of the courtroom. Her mother, Teboho Moja, is a clinical professor of higher education at the Steinhardt School at New York University, and her father is an adjunct professor at the same school. 
 Mr. Cordero glanced briefly at his pregnant sister, who was sitting opposite Ms. McCallum's parents, as he entered the courtroom.
 Mr. Cordero's father died two or three years ago and his mother died when he was much younger, his lawyer, Eric Sears, said yesterday. He said Mr. Cordero had been homeless and staying with relatives, often his sister, at the time of Ms. McCallum's death.
 ''They belonged to different worlds,'' Mr. Sears said. ''She was a well-traveled, sophisticated, well-educated young woman. He was a sometimes homeless, orphaned street kid. It just makes you wonder how well we know our children.''
 Ms. McCallum was strangled and smothered with a towel in her mother's Greenwich Village apartment, according to prosecutors. Both parents were in South Africa, the police said at the time.
 Friends said Mr. Cordero had met Ms. McCallum while she was a student at the Beacon School, a public high school near Lincoln Center, and he was living in a nearby housing project. She became his confidante, the friends said, and they eventually became romantically involved.
 Mr. Cordero was taken into police custody after he slit his wrists on the rooftop of an Upper West Side building where his relatives lived, the police said.
 Records show he had two earlier arrests for minor drug offenses.

HEADLINE: Fantasies, Well Meant

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I must have hit a nerve. While in Las Vegas last week, I interviewed the mayor, Oscar Goodman, who enthusiastically explained how legalizing prostitution and creating a series of ''magnificent brothels'' could be a boon to his city's development.
 Vegas is already a paradise for pimps, johns and perverts, and I accused the mayor in a column of setting the tone ''for the systematic, institutionalized degradation'' of women. 
 Mr. Goodman was not pleased. He snarled to the local press that he had no use for me, and added, ''I'll take a baseball bat and break his head if he ever comes here.''
 The mayor, who made a name for himself as a defense lawyer for mobsters, loves to slip into a clownish, tough-guy persona. (He never lets anyone forget that he had a walk-on as himself in the movie ''Casino.'') But behind his bluster is a serious issue that should be addressed.
 A lot of people more thoughtful than Oscar Goodman believe that prostitution should be legalized as a way of protecting and empowering the women who go into the sex trade. I've lost patience with those arguments, however well meaning. Real-world prostitution, in whatever guise, bears no resemblance at all to the empowerment fantasies of prostitution proponents. I have never seen such vulnerable, powerless women as those in the sex trade, legal or illegal.
 At Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour's ride outside of Vegas, the women have to respond like Pavlov's dog to a bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. It could be 4 a.m., and the woman might be sleeping. Or she might not be feeling well. Too bad.
 When that electronic bell rings, she has five minutes to get to the assembly area, a large room where she will line up with the other women, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who happens to drop by.
 ''It's not fun,'' one of the women whispered to me during a tour of the brothel.
 The first thing to understand about prostitution, including legal prostitution, is that the element of coercion is almost always present. Despite the fiction that they are ''independent contractors,'' most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps -- the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings).
 They are hardly empowered. Years of studies have shown that most prostitutes are pushed into the trade in their early teens by grown men. A large percentage are victims of incest or other forms of childhood sexual abuse. Most are dirt poor. Many are drug-addicted. And most are plagued by devastatingly low levels of self esteem.
 And then there are the armies of women and girls who are trafficked into the sex trade by organized criminals, both inside and outside of the U.S.
 That a city, a state or any other governmental entity in the U.S. could legally sanction the sexual degradation of women and girls under any circumstances, much less those who are so extremely vulnerable, is an atrocity. And if you don't think legalized prostitution is about degradation, consider the ''date room'' at Sheri's. That's a small room where a quiet dinner for two can be served. Beneath the tiny table is a couple of towels and a cushion for the woman to kneel on.
 The only one empowered in that situation is the john.
 Mayor Goodman's concept of magnificence notwithstanding, Nevada's legal brothels are not nice places. ''The only place I've ever had a gun pulled on me was in a legal brothel,'' said Melissa Farley, a psychologist and researcher who has studied the sex trade in Nevada for the past two and a half years.
 Ms. Farley, who is in her 60s and has the demeanor of a college professor, was threatened at gunpoint by a legal pimp who didn't like her attitude. ''I tried to change the look on my face in a hurry,'' she said.
 Any honest investigation of the facts, as opposed to abstract theories, of prostitution -- in any form -- would reveal a horror show. That's why the authorities in so many other countries that have given an official green light to prostitution, including Germany and the Netherlands, have been revisiting their policies.
 Legal prostitution tends to increase, not decrease, illegal prostitution, in part by creating a friendlier climate for demand. It tends to increase, not decrease, sex trafficking. And the recent explosion of prostitution in all its forms promotes the sexualization of girls at ever younger ages.
 Oscar Goodman should be viewed as a wake-up call. As a society, we should be offering help to the many thousands of women who would like to escape prostitution, and providing alternatives to those in danger of being pulled into it.

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea Seen Aiding Tax Shelter Prosecution

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The government's criminal case against promoters of questionable tax shelters took a step forward yesterday when an investment adviser at the center of the inquiry pleaded guilty and provided new details on those involved.
 The plea by David Amir Makov, 41, in Federal District Court in Manhattan is expected to bolster the government's investigation of Deutsche Bank over its work with questionable shelters, including one known as Blips, whose workings Mr. Makov described in detail yesterday.
 No charges have been filed against Deutsche Bank, and it was not named in court documents yesterday. In a statement that he read yesterday, Mr. Makov described his tax shelter work with Bank A, which people close to the case have identified as Deutsche Bank. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. 
 Mr. Makov's plea is also expected to help the government's case against the four remaining defendants, who include three former employees of the accounting firm KPMG and an outside lawyer. Those four are scheduled to go to trial in October.
 As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Makov agreed to pay a $10 million penalty; he will be sentenced at a later date. His lawyers declined to comment yesterday.
 His guilty plea to conspiracy to commit tax evasion puts back on track a faltering case that had become, to the consternation of prosecutors, a referendum on the constitutional rights of white-collar defendants, rather than the largest criminal inquiry ever into abusive tax shelters. 
 The turning point came in July, when Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed criminal charges against 13 of the 18 defendants, all but 2 of them former KPMG employees. The judge also accused prosecutors of violating the rights of the defendants by pressuring KPMG to cut off payment of their legal fees. The government is appealing that ruling.
 Mr. Makov and 18 other defendants, 17 from KPMG, including several top-ranking executives, were indicted in 2005 on various charges of fraud, tax evasion and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department in connection with making and selling four types of shelters, including Blips, that deprived the government of $2.5 billion in taxes from the late 1990s to recent years. One defendant, David Rivkin, a former KPMG partner, entered a guilty plea in 2006 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. 
 Two former business partners of Mr. Makov, Robert Pfaff and John Larson, both former KPMG employees, could be most affected by the plea agreement. In the late 1990s, the three formed Presidio Advisory Services and related entities to make and sell the Blips shelters and to use them for their own incomes. The other remaining defendants are Raymond J. Ruble, a former law partner at the law firm now known as Sidley Austin, and David Greenberg, a former partner at KPMG.
 Yesterday Mr. Makov gave a brief explanation on the workings of Blips, or Bond Linked Issue Premium Structure, which he said he helped to create.
 In previous hearings, Judge Kaplan had chastised prosecutors for failing to explain clearly how Blips worked. 
 The Blips shelters were created to generate artificial losses that were then used by wealthy investors to offset gains in legitimate income. The shelter involved a purported investment component as well as banks, extending purported loans to investors. Blips were marketed and sold around 1999 and 2000 to at least 186 wealthy investors and generated at least $5.1 billion in phony tax losses, according to prosecutors. The Presidio entities made at least $134 million selling Blips.
 One test of an abusive tax shelter is whether it has a legitimate business purpose or genuine economic substance, like real loans, with money at risk, or real investments.
 Although Blips were created on paper to look like seven-year investments, it had neither real loans nor a real investment component, Mr. Makov explained yesterday. ''There was no economic substance,'' he said. ''Instead, we created the appearance of economic substance, rather than the reality.'' Mr. Makov added that he was ''clearly told by Bank A, KPMG'' and others ''that the loan was not at risk.'' 
 While he initially thought that Blips were legitimate, he said that ''as part of the deception'' he was eventually ''asked by representatives of Bank A,'' among others, ''to come up with an investment rationale.'' 
 Mr. Makov is a graduate of the Harvard Business School and a one-time employee of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund founded by two Nobel economics laureates, whose implosion in 1998 led the Federal Reserve to organize a bailout. Mr. Makov also worked, from around 1996 to 1998, at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank.
 Mr. Makov, who was originally charged with dozens of counts of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, entered a guilty plea to one information count of conspiracy. Each count carries five years in jail. Prosecutors are expected to drop all of the other charges if he cooperates throughout the trial. 
 KPMG reached a $456 million agreement with prosecutors in 2005 over its work with questionable tax shelters.

HEADLINE: With Global Economy Jittery, OPEC Seems Split on Output Issue

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
The world's top oil producers appeared divided on Monday about how to respond to the threat of a slowing global economy, suggesting that the OPEC meeting here on Tuesday could be contentious. 
 In their first gathering in six months, OPEC's representatives must decide whether to bow to pressure from consuming nations and increase supplies to help bring down oil prices. Some members would like to keep OPEC's overall output steady, however, fearing that an economic slowdown might depress the use of oil and force prices down.
 One proposal floated Monday afternoon by the Persian Gulf members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries called for a modest increase of 500,000 barrels a day. That idea could face opposition from OPEC's traditionally hawkish members, Iran and Venezuela, which have said recently that they saw no need to increase supplies. Nigeria and Libya also said they favored keeping OPEC policy unchanged for the time being. 
 ''There is enough crude in the market,'' Gholam Hossein Nozari, Iran's acting oil minister, told reporters in Vienna on Monday. 
 Rafael Ramirez, the Venezuelan representative, said, ''We didn't come here worried about increasing production.'' 
 The prospect of a recession in the United States, raised last week by weak employment statistics, has transformed what was supposed to be a routine meeting into a test of the group's ability to remain united in its management of the oil markets. 
 A decade ago, the cartel mistimed a decision to increase production just as the Asian financial crisis unfolded. The oil market collapsed as a result, and prices plummeted to $10 a barrel.
 But energy experts said that OPEC needed to increase output quickly to meet the expected surge in winter demand. It takes about 40 to 60 days for oil pumped in the Middle East to be shipped to the United States. 
 ''Time is running out,'' said Roger Diwan, an oil analyst at PFC Energy, a consultant firm in Washington. ''The market needs more oil this winter. OPEC's strategy of draining stocks has succeeded. Now they have to adapt to higher demand levels.''
 Consumers have repeatedly called for OPEC to ease its grip on supplies. The International Energy Agency, which represents the world's 26 biggest oil-consuming nations, said on Monday that additional oil supplies would be needed in the coming months to meet demand. 
 ''We think that the current market is very tight,'' said Nobuo Tanaka, the energy agency's new executive director. 
 Samuel W. Bodman, the American energy secretary, said Monday that he had encouraged OPEC producers to increase supplies.
 In New York, crude oil for October delivery rose 79 cents, to $77.49 a barrel on Monday. Oil futures are up 24 percent this year. 
 Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader and its top producer, has remained silent ahead of the meeting. According to a recent PFC Energy report, the Saudis are considering a proposal to increase OPEC production by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day. But Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi minister, has given no clues about his intentions.
 OPEC's 12 nations, including its most recent member, Angola, account for about 40 percent of the world's oil exports. OPEC does not fix global oil prices but its decisions to increase or curtail supplies have a direct impact on oil markets.
 In the last three years, oil prices have risen because of strong growth in consumer demand, led by the United States and China, and political upheaval in some of the biggest oil-producing nations, like Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela -- all of them OPEC members. 
 Oil producers are enjoying the biggest boom since the early 1980s and have become increasingly dependent on that revenue.
 But analysts say that if the demand for oil softened as a result of an economic slowdown, the floor that has sustained oil prices in recent years would become increasingly shaky. 
 Not everyone believes OPEC will act at Tuesday's meeting. 
 ''OPEC governments are now reluctant to add output when they see risks to global economic growth,'' Lehman Brothers analysts wrote in a note last week. ''OPEC is reminded of its inability to stop a downward price spiral.'' 
 Last year, OPEC nations cut supplies by 1.7 million barrels a day. The group's 10 members with quotas -- Iraq and Angola are excluded -- pumped 26.71 million barrels a day last month. That is 860,000 barrels a day more than the official target.

HEADLINE: 'Feel Good' vs. 'Do Good' on Climate

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
After looking at one too many projections of global-warming disasters -- computer graphics of coasts swamped by rising seas, mounting death tolls from heat waves -- I was ready for a reality check. Instead of imagining a warmer planet, I traveled to a place that has already felt the heat, accompanied by Bjorn Lomborg, the Danish political scientist and scourge of environmentalist orthodoxy.
 It was not an arduous expedition. We went to an old wooden building near the Brooklyn Bridge that is home to the Bridge Cafe, which bills itself as ''New York's Oldest Drinking Establishment.'' There's been drinking in the building since the late 18th century, when it was erected on Water Street along the shore of Lower Manhattan.
 Since record-keeping began in the 19th century, the sea level in New York has been rising about a foot per century, which happens to be about the same increase estimated to occur over the next century by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The temperature has also risen as New York has been covered with asphalt and concrete, creating an ''urban heat island'' that's estimated to have raised nighttime temperatures by 7 degrees Fahrenheit. The warming that has already occurred locally is on the same scale as what's expected globally in the next century. 
 The impact of these changes on Lower Manhattan isn't quite as striking as the computer graphics. We couldn't see any evidence of the higher sea level near the Bridge Cafe, mainly because Water Street isn't next to the water anymore. Dr. Lomborg and I had to walk over two-and-a-half blocks of landfill to reach the current shoreline.
 The effect of the rising temperatures is more complicated to gauge. Hotter summer weather can indeed be fatal, as Al Gore likes us to remind audiences by citing the 35,000 deaths attributed to the 2003 heat wave in Europe. But there are a couple of confounding factors explained in Dr. Lomborg's new book, ''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.''
 The first is that winter can be deadlier than summer. About seven times more deaths in Europe are attributed annually to cold weather (which aggravates circulatory and respiratory illness) than to hot weather, Dr. Lomborg notes, pointing to studies showing that a warmer planet would mean fewer temperature-related deaths in Europe and worldwide.
 The second factor is that the weather matters a lot less than how people respond to it. Just because there are hotter summers in New York doesn't mean that more people die -- in fact, just the reverse has occurred. Researchers led by Robert Davis, a climatologist at the University of Virginia, concluded that the number of heat-related deaths in New York in the 1990s was only a third as high as in the 1960s. The main reason is simple, and evident as you as walk into the Bridge Cafe on a warm afternoon: air-conditioning. 
 The lesson from our expedition is not that global warming is a trivial problem. Although Dr. Lomborg believes its dangers have been hyped, he agrees that global warming is real and will do more harm than good. He advocates a carbon tax and a treaty forcing nations to budget hefty increases for research into low-carbon energy technologies.
 But the best strategy, he says, is to make the rest of the world as rich as New York, so that people elsewhere can afford to do things like shore up their coastlines and buy air conditioners. He calls Kyoto-style treaties to cut greenhouse-gas emissions a mistake because they cost too much and do too little too late. Even if the United States were to join in the Kyoto treaty, he notes, the cuts in emissions would merely postpone the projected rise in sea level by four years: from 2100 to 2104. 
 ''We could spend all that money to cut emissions and end up with more land flooded next century because people would be poorer,'' Dr. Lomborg said as we surveyed Manhattan's expanded shoreline. ''Wealth is a more important factor than sea-level rise in protecting you from the sea. You can draw maps showing 100 million people flooded out of their homes from global warming, but look at what's happened here in New York. It's the same story in Denmark and Holland -- we've been gaining land as the sea rises.''
 Dr. Lomborg, who's best known (and most reviled in some circles) for an earlier book, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist,'' runs the Copenhagen Consensus Center, which gathers economists to set priorities in tackling global problems. In his new book, he dismisses the Kyoto emissions cuts as a ''feel-good'' strategy because it sounds virtuous and lets politicians make promises they don't have to keep. He outlines an alternative ''do-good'' strategy that would cost less but accomplish more in dealing with climate change as well as more pressing threats like malaria, AIDS, polluted drinking water and malnutrition.
 If you're worried about stronger hurricanes flooding coasts, he says, concentrate on limiting coastal development and expanding wetlands right now rather than trying to slightly delay warming decades from now. To give urbanites a break from hotter summers, concentrate on reducing the urban-heat-island effect. If cities planted more greenery and painted roofs and streets white, he says, they could more than offset the impact of global warming.
 The biggest limitation to his cost-benefit analyses is that no one knows exactly what global warming will produce. It may not be worth taking expensive steps to forestall a one-foot rise in the sea level, but what if the seas rise much higher? Dr. Lomborg's critics argue that we owe it to future generations to prepare for the worst-case projections.
 But preparing for the worst in future climate is expensive, which means less money for the most serious threats today -- and later this century. You can imagine plenty of worst-case projections that have nothing to do with climate change, as Dr. Lomborg reminded me at the end of our expedition.
 ''No historian would look back at the last two centuries and rank the rising sea level here as one of the city's major problems,'' he said, sitting safely dry and cool inside the Bridge Cafe. ''I don't think our descendants will thank us for leaving them poorer and less healthy just so we could do a little bit to slow global warming. I'd rather we were remembered for solving the other problems first.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Slowed in July

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Consumers borrowed less in July than in June, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday.
 Consumer credit increased $7.5 billion in July, to $2.46 trillion. In June, credit rose $11.9 billion, less than previously reported. The figures do not include mortgage debt. 
 Auto sales slumped to a two-year low in July, capping the weakest quarter of consumer spending since the last three months of 2005. Slumping home values and stricter lending standards have made it harder for Americans to borrow against their homes for extra cash, suggesting that more and more will turn to credit cards to finance spending.
 ''Consumers have been increasing their use of consumer credit as mortgage-equity withdrawals have shrunk,'' said Steven Wood, president of Insight Economics in Danville, Calif.
 Economists forecast that consumer credit would rise by $8 billion after an originally reported $13.2 billion increase in June, according to the median of 33 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
 In Monday's report, the Fed also reported that consumer credit increased at a 3.7 percent annual rate in July after rising at a 5.9 percent pace during June. Revolving debt, like credit card balances, rose $5 billion in July and nonrevolving debt, including auto loans, rose $2.5 billion, the smallest increase since October.

HEADLINE: Low Technologies, High Aims

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Beneath the bustling ''infinite corridor'' linking buildings at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, just past a boiler room, an assemblage of tinkerers from 16 countries welded, stitched and hammered, working on rough-hewn inventions aimed at saving the world, one village at a time.
 M.I.T. has nurtured dozens of Nobel Prize winners in cerebral realms like astrophysics, economics and genetics. But lately, the institute has turned its attention toward concrete thinking to improve the lives of the world's bottom billion, those who live on a dollar a day or less and who often die young.
 This summer, it played host to a four-week International Development Design Summit to identify problems, cobble together prototype solutions and winnow the results to see which might work in the real world. 
 Mohamed Mashaal, a young British engineer headed for a job with BP on the North Sea this fall, poured water into a handcrafted plastic backpack worn by a design partner, Bernard Kiwia, who teaches bicycle repair in rural Tanzania and hopes to offer women there an easier way to tote the precious liquid for long distances. 
 Sham Tembo, an electrical engineer from Zambia, and Jessica Vechakul, an engineering graduate student at M.I.T., slowly added a cow manure puree to a five-gallon bucket holding charcoal made from corncobs. In the right configuration, the mix might generate enough electricity to charge a cellphone battery or a small flashlight for a year or more.
 The summit (www.iddsummit.org) was the brainchild mainly of Amy Smith, a lecturer at M.I.T. who received her master's there in 1995 and in 2004 won a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' award, and Kenneth Pickar, an engineering professor at the California Institute of Technology. Faculty and students from Olin College, an engineering school near Boston, were also involved.
 The flurry of activity was taking place at D-Lab, a research center and set of courses at M.I.T. devoted to devising cheap technologies that could have a big effect in impoverished communities. In homage to Ms. Smith's passion for attacking poverty from the ground up, the lab is nicknamed ''Amy's World.''
 Typically, D-Lab sends students abroad in midwinter breaks to work with people who are struggling with a lack of clean water, electricity, cooking fuels or mechanical power to turn crops into products. For four weeks, though, the real world had come to M.I.T.
 Throughout the workshop, Ms. Smith served as scoutmaster, cheerleader, cook and personal shopper (when work flowed deep into the night), and she provided periodic reality checks. 
 She seemed dazed at times, but never fazed. ''Everyone calls this an experiment,'' Ms. Smith said of the workshop, the first of its kind. ''I call it the realization of a vision.''
 The work itself was often two steps back, not one step forward. As Lhamotso, a young woman from Tibet, and Laura Stupin, who just graduated from Olin, wrestled with a whirring Rube Goldberg mash-up of bicycle and grain mill, the chain slipped with a loud clang. 
 ''We have a real friction problem,'' Ms. Stupin yelled.
 The workshop was developed over the last year by Ms. Smith, Dr. Pickar and others after a meeting to discuss a ''design revolution'' -- a shift in focus among companies, universities, investors and scientists toward attacking problems that hamper development in the world's poorest places. 
 ''Nearly 90 percent of research and development dollars are spent on creating technologies that serve the wealthiest 10 percent of the world's population,'' Ms. Smith said. ''The point of the design revolution is to switch that.''
 She added: ''There are several different places where that revolution has to take place. We started thinking, 'How do we train engineers so they might start thinking of this as a field of engineering they'd want to pursue?' ''
 Developing a pedal-powered grain mill or a backpack for water, as workshop participants did, was only a first step. The teams also had to be sure that their creations could be built of local materials cheaply enough to be bought by the world's poorest people, that they could be fixed easily and fit ways of living that have deep-rooted rhythms. 
 The workshop began in mid-July, with the arrival of nearly 50 visitors from Brazil, Ghana, Guatemala, Tanzania, Tibet and other countries. 
 Most of the $200,000 budget was provided by donations from individuals and private groups, including the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, which supports university programs to develop commercially viable products that advance society. 
 The workshop began with a lecture by Paul Polak, a psychiatrist turned entrepreneur, who develops simple solutions for the problems of the poor. Dr. Polak, who has become something of a guru to the design revolution movement, railed against conventional charity and insisted that the route to prosperity lies in inventions that improve lives but mesh with existing lifestyles. 
 He laid out the principles of development from the bottom up, including the importance of first listening and watching, then following the old dictum ''small is beautiful'' with another, equally important one: ''cheap is beautiful.''
 The goal, he said, should be to improve a million lives, and to make technologies that can be sold and bought in increments -- like a drip-irrigating system that can expand as a farmer's income rises. Dr. Polak said in an interview that at least in the classroom, the push for such initiatives was coming from young people. 
 Ms. Smith said she wanted to avoid having the workshop end up as yet another academic exercise where the only outcome is often a set of paper proceedings or pledges. This time, she said, the goal was ''no paper, just prototypes.''
 In fact, in the first days of the workshop, it seemed that the only paper in evidence was an ever-spreading, flower-petal array of blue, green, pink and yellow sticky notes on walls and blackboards. The notes charted the progression from basic needs (water, food, energy, health) to specific issues (a three-mile hike to and from the nearest water supply in a Tanzanian village, the lack of a well-testing kit that a Bangladeshi village clinic could afford). 
 Ms. Smith placed participants in project teams. Then came round-table discussions, rough sketches, technical drawings and the first three-dimensional models. 
 Half a dozen volunteer mentors helped the participants make their ideas more concrete. Some were academics, like Ariel Phillips of Harvard, whose specialty is group dynamics. Others were drawn from Ms. Smith's black book filled with an array of fixers and crafters -- people whose careers have been spent solving problems by turning metal, plastic, wood, circuitry and motors into working devices. They included Dennis Nagle, a former weapons designer who abandoned the profession, he said, during the Summer of Love and turned to lighting design and other things, like the 24-ton array of speaker cabinets for a Guns N' Roses concert. 
 The mentors' task was making things work. ''Ladies and gentlemen, we're on the verge of a Home Depot run,'' announced Jock Brandis, who had driven to the workshop from Wilmington, N.C. After a career building contraptions on movie sets, Mr. Brandis now helps run the Full Belly Project, which develops machines to simplify village work. 
 Mr. Brandis noted that the budget for developing a peanut sheller for a Malian village was far different from that for building a camera-toting vehicle in rural Mexico to film Antonio Banderas galloping through the desert as Zorro. But the challenge of filling a niche with limited materials and tools is similar. 
 The other similarity is that both kinds of design begin with a blank slate. As Mr. Brandis put it: ''It's, 'Here's the model high-rise made of Styrofoam, and then the flying saucer has to fly into it, and we need to shoot it three times from three different angles, and next Tuesday it's got to happen.' ''
 At the workshop, Mr. Brandis examined with approval one group's design for an oven with three grates of progressively finer mesh to hold charcoal fuel, so that big pieces that have not burned down stay separate from more fully consumed fuel, limiting harmful smoke. 
 ''What you try to do in virtually every situation is make their lives more efficient,'' he said. ''That's what the big revolution in America was between 1860 and 1960 -- that a person doing a day's work can produce a lot more product. And that means time is more valuable and that means he has more time to do other things.''
 Ashley Thomas, an entering senior at M.I.T., explained the appeal of such work while struggling with a teetering metal frame for a cooler that uses evaporation from wet fabric instead of electrical components to draw heat from its contents. The idea was conceived with participants from Tibet, where meat must be stored for weeks in isolated rural areas, and India, where heat can quickly ruin a vendor's inventory. 
 ''Imagine a fruit vendor in a rural area or the slums,'' explained Deepa Dubey, a partner of Ms. Thomas, who studies product design as a graduate student in Kanpur, India. ''He comes with all his fruit and vegetables. At the end of the day he makes one dollar, and whatever is left he has to throw it away because he can't store it.''
 Ms. Thomas said, ''Amy's class is about the hardest class to get into at M.I.T., including at the Sloan School, which is basically about how to make a million dollars after you graduate.''
 She added: ''It's taking industrial design theory and applying it to where you can have the greatest impact. Here, $5 worth of angle iron and towels could mean a month's supply of food. To me, that's just worth so much more than spending that amount of time working on designing a slick new computer.''

HEADLINE: Intel Raises Its Outlook; Rival Offers New Chip

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation raised its financial outlook for the current quarter yesterday, citing stronger-than-expected demand for microprocessors and high hopes for the back-to-school shopping season.
 The announcement threatened to upstage a rival, Advanced Micro Devices, in its most important product announcement in years: a higher-performing version of its Opteron chip for server computers that it hopes will help it return to profitability.
 Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., said it now expected revenue of $9.4 billion to $9.8 billion in the third quarter, up from its earlier estimate of $9 billion to $9.6 billion. The average forecast of Wall Street analysts calls for Intel's revenue to be about $9.4 billion for the quarter, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. 
 The company also said it expected gross margin ''in the upper end'' of its forecast of 52 percent plus or minus several percentage points.
 Intel's margins disappointed during the second quarter, coming in at 46.9 percent, well below its forecast of 48 percent, because of lower average selling prices for its microprocessors.
 Intel shares climbed in early trading yesterday, immediately after the report, but then declined 12 cents, to close at $25.35. Shares of A.M.D. rose 33 cents, or nearly 3 percent, to close at $12.94.
 Intel's stock has rallied in recent months, from about $19 a share six months ago, and many investors say they believe that the company is reclaiming its technological leadership over A.M.D., which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif.
 After several consecutive quarters of losing market share, Intel in recent quarters has released a host of new multicore processors, including its first quad-core chip, while A.M.D. has suffered from pricing pressure and a short-term inventory glut. In July, A.M.D. reported a $600 million loss for the second quarter, its third loss in a row. The company is also still struggling to absorb ATI Technologies, the graphics chip maker it acquired last year for $5.6 billion.
 But A.M.D., which has lately been gaining back market share as it works off inventory, is banking that its latest server chip will help it return to profitability. The new chip uses so-called quad-core technology, where four processors are placed on one piece of silicon, allowing greater performance and energy efficiency. A.M.D. executives said yesterday that they expected the company to have a strong second half.
 Intel's report and A.M.D.'s optimism appear to have somewhat quashed fears that widening problems in the housing market might damp purchases of large consumer products like home computers -- at least for now.
 ''There isn't a lot of evidence that there's been an impact on the computing market,'' said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. ''All the signs are the market is doing well.''
 Ashok Kumar, an analyst with the CRT Capital Group in San Francisco, agreed that the computer industry had not yet seen any fallout from the mortgage crisis, but he said the economic climate could make it hard to forecast sales later in the year. He said demand for notebook computers continued to be strong, particularly in emerging countries. Microprocessors used in notebooks have a higher average selling price than chips for desktop computers, so the impact on revenue is greater.
 Tom Beermann, an Intel spokesman, said the revised forecast was ''based on what we're seeing worldwide in terms of strength in revenues from chipsets and microprocessors,'' but he would give no further details. 
 Intel is scheduled to release its third-quarter report on Oct. 16.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Tries To Move The City Beyond 9/11 GRIEF

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The planning in New York City for today's commemoration of the 2001 terror attack had become a seemingly familiar standoff.
 On one side was a vocal core of victims' relatives threatening to hold their own event because the ceremony would, for the first time, take place not at ground zero but across the street, at Zuccotti Park. On the other, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, accused by the relatives of insensitivity, was holding firm that it was unsafe to allow mourners at what was now an active construction site.
 The mayor and the families agreed to a compromise: the ceremony would be held at the park but relatives would still be allowed to descend to the pit where their loved ones perished. 
 When he took over as mayor in 2002, Mr. Bloomberg threw himself into fixing the many pressing problems wrought by the terror attack: shoring up the security of a city suddenly at the center of a bull's-eye; closing the gaping hole in the midst of Lower Manhattan; bolstering a sinking economy suffering the loss of thousands of jobs.
 But the mayor has also played an essential if more subtle role in nudging the city to gradually let go of its grief. It is a challenge the mayor has handled sometimes clumsily and sometimes with great sensitivity and eloquence, as he charted the path away from the concrete events of 2001. Now, as he works to imbue the city with optimism for the future, he even hints at a day when remembering may not mean reading the names of all the dead.
 ''You're going to have to change to keep it relevant,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference yesterday when asked about the fact that one television network had originally planned not to broadcast the entire ceremony, which exceeds four hours. ''I've never been a believer that doing the same thing every time is the best way to accomplish anything.''
 Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg, who spurns dwelling on the past and prefers to keep his emotions to himself, has been pushing the city from the start to move beyond its tragedy. Early on, he championed building schools and housing at ground zero and suggested that the soaring memorial envisioned by his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, would turn it into ''a cemetery'' and drive residents and businesses away.
 Mr. Giuliani is scheduled to take part in today's ceremony, a move criticized by some because he is a candidate for the presidency.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told The New York Times just before the first anniversary of the attack: ''I think the Jews do it right. They have a headstone unveiling a year after the funeral, and that's sort of the time that you sort of stop the mourning process and start going forward. And the 9/11 ceremonies, what I'm trying to do is that in the morning we will look back, remember who they were and why they died. And in the evening come out of it looking forward and say, 'O.K., we're going to go forward.' ''
 In recent months, that campaign has become more urgent as Mr. Bloomberg has taken a more active role in accelerating development at the site, stepping in to break the logjams, muscling his way through the opposition with a conviction that his priorities -- getting the project done, leaving a legacy for the future -- and values are the right ones.
 On Sept. 11, said Edward Skyler, a deputy mayor who, as campaign press secretary, had been with Mr. Bloomberg that day, the city ''had been dealt an enormous emotional blow, but he didn't want it to be a transformative blow for the worse.''
 The attack ''had clearly changed the city. but he didn't want it to change the city's fundamental can-do attitude,'' Mr. Skyler said. ''He has tried to find the right balance between remembering and rebuilding.''
 That balance has been tricky at times. After alienating some of the victims' relatives with his insistence that the names on the memorial be listed randomly, Mr. Bloomberg brokered a compromise that allows emergency responders, colleagues and relatives to be listed together.
 After loudly criticizing the anemic fund-raising efforts for the memorial, he took over as chairman of the foundation and is nearing the goal of more than $300 million, he said yesterday.
 And when, this year, contractors threatened to further delay the demolition of the Deutsche Bank building by walking off the job, Mr. Bloomberg convened a meeting at Gracie Mansion, eventually agreeing with the state that they should be paid more to complete the work.
 Even today's ceremony, taking place largely away from ground zero itself, is a result of that effort.
 ''He's first and foremost a pragmatist, but that doesn't mean he's not a feeling individual,'' said Christy Ferer, Mr. Bloomberg's liaison to the victims' families. Ms. Ferer, who lost her husband in the attack, said she had detected a growing admiration between the families and the mayor over the years, along with some lessening of interest in grieving at the site, as more of the families have opted for more personal commemorations, and as attendance at the ceremony has waned.
 Some relatives have thought the same way all along. Nikki Stern, whose husband, Jim Potorti, died in the Marsh & McLennan offices, said she believed the idea of balancing remembering and rebuilding was logical, and something she had supported publicly as early as October 2001. ''For me, I didn't see anything else we could do but go forward,'' she said. ''It doesn't mean we don't feel like laying down and dying. But we can't.''

HEADLINE: Paulson Urges Restraint In Policy on China Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. warned Monday that enacting legislation aimed at punishing China over its economic policies could jeopardize future growth and unsettle markets already on edge over the severe difficulties in the American housing and mortgage sector.
 ''I really do believe we are at an inflection point here,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview. ''When we look at taking unilateral actions aimed at another nation, this can have enormous repercussions to our economic well-being. You know, we're playing with fire.'' 
 Mr. Paulson said he remained confident that the American economy was resilient enough to survive recent market turmoil. But he said he feared Chinese retaliation and a loss of China as an engine of global growth and a market for American exports.
 Exports to China grew at the rate of 32 percent last year, and the Treasury Department says that total exports contributed nearly a percentage point of the 4 percent growth of the second quarter of 2007. 
 Mr. Paulson's office arranged for the interview to underscore his concerns after discussions with leading business officials, particularly in the financial services, manufacturing and automotive sectors, all of whom he said are depending on exports to help them get through current economic difficulties.
 According to Mr. Paulson, all these leaders were concerned about legislation that would impose duties or other punishment on China if Beijing did not allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate against the dollar, a move that would make Chinese exports more expensive and goods imported by China cheaper. The businesspeople feared that such legislation could lead to retaliation by China, Mr. Paulson said.
 ''There was a concern that given what's going on in the global economy and the emerging protectionist sentiment in many parts of the world,'' he said, ''how dangerous it is to take a unilateral punitive action that could lead to a trade war or that would be unsettling to the markets.'' 
 Mr. Paulson declined to specify which bills were worrisome, but Treasury officials have been most concerned recently about a bill supported by Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who leads the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the panel's ranking Republican.
 The bill has also been endorsed by Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, and Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican. In addition to penalizing China for its refusal to let the yuan float against the dollar, it might require increased tariffs and a ban on federal agencies purchasing Chinese products.
 Another bill, sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, would make it easier for the United States government to brand China a currency manipulator and clear the way for legal challenges through the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. 
 Mr. Schumer and Mr. Baucus issued statements late Monday disputing the Treasury secretary's contention that their bills would harm American exports to China or the American economy and suggesting they would proceed with their bills.
 ''The only thing the currency bill threatens is a Chinese government that doesn't want to play by the rules,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''It is Alice in Wonderland logic to say that when the Chinese manipulate their currency, it helps our exports.''
 Mr. Baucus said that he advocated ''responsible and relevant policies that keep our economic relationship from veering off course,'' adding, ''I've spent decades in the Senate working to build a sustainable economic relationship with China and I intend to continue to do so.''
 Mr. Paulson, who took office as Treasury chief in the summer of 2006 after running Goldman Sachs and doing many deals in China, has made improving relations with the government in Beijing his highest international priority. 
 He has traveled to China four times in the last year.
 He also established a ''strategic economic dialogue'' between leading cabinet members in the United States and China as a supplement to the regular negotiations between the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative's office. Many in the administration say the dialogue has produced few results so far, however.
 Mr. Paulson said that there had been ''many positive developments'' in relations with China, including recent steps to open up China's markets to American banks and financial services. And Mr. Paulson noted that as of Monday, China had allowed its currency to appreciate 10 percent against the dollar since mid-2005.
 But he added that he, too, remained impatient with China's pace of change -- both on currency and opening its markets to American goods, services and investments. ''I'm not an apologist for the fact that China is not moving quickly,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Paulson said what progress had been made could be jeopardized by ''sticking our thumb in the eye'' of China or other trading partners. 
 The larger problem, he said, was an American fear that ''somehow China's economic growth and success hurts us.'' He said he and others in the Bush administration needed to convince Americans and members of Congress of the benefits of China as a source of affordable consumer products and a marketplace for American exports.

HEADLINE: Nervous Market Ends the Day Mixed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street finished a volatile session mixed yesterday as investors grappled with the possibility that the Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates as much as they hope.
 The stock market ratcheted up and down throughout the day, with Wall Street still nervous after Friday's dismal employment report, which showed the first monthly decline in jobs in four years. 
 Speeches from Fed officials yesterday seemed to give investors a bit more reason to be optimistic about the economy, but the officials avoided hinting at how the central bank might alter rates.
 For many investors, a rate cut after more than a year of the Fed's standing pat on rates is practically a given. The debate, as they see it, is whether the Fed will reduce rates by a quarter percentage point or half a percentage point on Sept. 18 to loosen up the tight credit markets -- and also whether the central bank will continue to reduce rates as the year goes on.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.47 points, or 0.11 percent, to 13,127.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1.85 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,451.70, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 6.59 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,559.11.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.98, or 0.77 percent, to 769.81.
 Bond prices rose as stocks slipped, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note down to 4.32 percent from 4.38 percent on Friday. The price rose 15/32, to 103 13/32.
 Stocks experienced a short relief rally in afternoon trading after Gen. David H. Petraeus said to Congress that he recommended to President Bush that the drawdown of American forces from Iraq start this month, said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons. But the gains were quickly lost.
 Declining issues outnumbered those advancing about five to three on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 2.85 billion shares, down from 3.19 billion on Friday.
 The market also absorbed more news of fallout from mortgage failures. The Countrywide Financial Corporation said after the closing bell on Friday that it would cut as many as 12,000 jobs -- up to 20 percent of its work force -- as it tries to ride out upheaval in the mortgage industry. The company expects new mortgages to fall 25 percent next year.
 Countrywide fell $1, or 5.5 percent, to $17.21.
 Not all financial stocks were weak, though. The British billionaire Joseph C. Lewis acquired a 7 percent stake in the investment bank Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns rose $2.13, or 2 percent, to $107.50.
 Some technology stocks were also strong. Advanced Micro Devices rose 33 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $12.94 after releasing its newest microprocessor, and Apple rose $4.94, or 3.8 percent, to $136.71 after selling its millionth iPhone on Sunday.
 Intel rose initially after raising its third-quarter sales outlook, but finished down 12 cents at $25.35.
 Light crude oil for October delivery rose 79 cents, to $77.49 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: 3 at Fed Say They Can See Some Threats to Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 

 BODY:
Three senior Federal Reserve officials said on Monday that the turmoil in housing and mortgage lending had begun to threaten the overall economy, a condition policy makers have said is the crucial test for deciding whether to lower interest rates at their meeting next Tuesday.
 A Fed governor, Frederic S. Mishkin, told an audience in Manhattan that the risk of a broader downturn ''cannot, in my view, be ruled out'' and ''poses an important downside risk to economic activity.'' 
 In unusually direct language for a Fed policy maker, Mr. Mishkin said inflation pressures had become less of a problem -- a judgment that, if embraced by other Fed officials, would remove a major argument against lowering interest rates.
 ''I believe that the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced,'' he said, ''given the greater downside risks to real growth.'' 
 Mr. Mishkin is a relatively new member of the Fed board, but he was a well-known specialist in monetary policy at Columbia University with longstanding ties to the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke. In 1997, while Mr. Mishkin and Mr. Bernanke were university professors, they wrote a book that called on central banks to base policy around a public target for inflation.
 In speeches on Monday, two other Fed officials sent a similar message. Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, predicted that the housing decline would probably continue and would impose ''significant downward pressure'' on consumer spending.
 Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, admitted that an unexpectedly bleak unemployment report on Friday had made him more worried about a downturn.
 Neither Mr. Lockhart nor Ms. Yellen are currently voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. But both sit in on the meetings. 
 On Wall Street, the debate among analysts was no longer about whether the Fed would reduce rates but by how much.
 Several analysts predicted that the central bank will lower the Federal funds rate, for overnight loans between banks, by half of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent. Until a few days ago, most analysts were betting on a quarter-point cut. 
 Fed officials in their comments said nothing about how much they wanted to lower rates. In Monday's speeches, given before the central bank begins a weeklong silent period ahead of its policy meeting, several made it clear they now see concrete risks of a downturn.
 In Atlanta, Mr. Lockhart went so far as to retreat from a more optimistic stance he had taken a few days ago. He said on Thursday that he had not seen any ''conclusive sings of weakness in the broader economy.''
 On Monday, he delivered the same speech but acknowledged that he had been jolted by Friday's surprisingly dismal report that the economy had shed 4,000 jobs in August. ''Friday's new data show employment was beginning to soften back in June,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''I am processing the information.'' 
 In her speech, Ms. Yellen said that a housing downturn and tighter credit were likely to cause ''significant downward pressure'' on consumer spending and thus on economic growth.
 ''The financial market turmoil seems likely to intensify the downturn in housing,'' she predicted. Even if investors overcome some of their fears, mortgage rates are likely to remain higher on a long-term basis and could continue to push housing prices down.
 ''Should the decline in house prices occur in the context of rising unemployment, the risks could be significant,'' Ms. Yellen said.
 Her comments highlighted a point recently stressed by Mr. Bernanke, that Fed officials do not plan to wait for irrefutable statistical evidence of an economic downturn. Rather, they are ready to act on warning signs, including anecdotal business reports, that the probabilities of a downturn are too high to ignore.
 The debate is far from over. Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, played down the importance of last week's bleak employment report. Speaking at a conference in Laredo, Tex., on Monday, Mr. Fisher said the report was merely a ''discordant note'' and that he was still unpersuaded about a broader downturn.
 ''As yet, tighter credit conditions do not appear to have had a major impact on overall economic activity outside of real estate,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''Our economy appears to be weathering the storm thus far.'' 
 Several analysts predicted that the central bank would cut rates by half a percentage point at its meeting next week and would reduce them further before the end of the year.
 ''It's unambiguous,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG Hoenig, an investment research firm in New York. ''You've had a second sharp leg down in housing, and I believe it's going to weigh on consumer spending and employment.''
 Mr. Barbera said the unemployment report on Friday had been the final piece of evidence to convince him that the Fed would reduce rates to 4.75 percent next week and to 4 percent by the end of the year.
 Steven Weiting, an economist at Citigroup, predicted a half a percentage point reduction as well, saying that credit pressure resulting from panic over soured subprime loans was continuing to build.

 Voters See Pros and Cons
 In Giuliani, Poll Finds
 Republican voters say Rudolph W. Giuliani has strong leadership qualities and associate him closely with his handling of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but that has not translated into a substantial advantage over his party's other presidential candidates when it comes to fighting terrorism, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.

FUNDING A CENSOR? Hedge funds are financing some of China's elaborate security systems, including the nation's extreme control over the Internet. Now, the growing ties between China's surveillance sector and American capital markets are starting to draw Washington's attention. 
 GUILTY PLEA IN TAX CASE David Amir Makov pleaded guilty in a federal case involving promoters of questionable tax shelters, a move that is expected to help the government's case against the four remaining defendants. [C1.] 
 IN THE NAME OF PROFIT Why is lead paint leading to recalls of Chinese-made goods? The simplest answer, experts and toy companies in this country say, is price. It's simply cheaper to make the toys using lead paint, which had been found on at least 16 toys, including the the popular Thomas & Friends train sets, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

HEADLINE: Iraq Through China's Lens

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Dalian, China
 It's nice to be in a country where Iraq is never mentioned. It's just a little unnerving when that country is America's biggest geopolitical and economic rival these days: China.
 I heard China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, address an international conference here in Dalian, and what impressed me most was how boring it was -- a straightforward recitation of the staggering economic progress China has made in the last two decades and the towering economic, political and environmental challenges it still faces.
 How nice it must be, I thought, to be a great power and be almost entirely focused on addressing your own domestic problems? 
 No, I have not gone isolationist. America has real enemies that China does not, and therefore we have to balance a global security role in places like the Middle East with domestic demands.
 But something is out of balance with America today. Looking at the world from here, it is hard not to feel that China has spent the last six years training for the Olympics while we've spent ourselves into debt on iPods and Al Qaeda.
 After 9/11, we tried to effect change in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world by trying to build a progressive government in Baghdad. There was, I believed, a strategic and moral logic for that. But the strategy failed, for a million different reasons, and now it is time to recognize that and focus on how we insulate ourselves from the instability of that world -- by having a real energy policy, for starters -- how we protect our security interests there in more sustainable ways and how we get back to developing our own house. 
 By now it should be clear that Iraq is going to be what it is going to be. We've never had sufficient troops there to shape Iraq in our own image. We simply can't go on betting so many American soldiers and resources that Iraqis will one day learn to live together on their own -- without either having to be bludgeoned by Saddam or baby-sat by us.
 So either we get help or get out. That is, if President Bush believes staying in Iraq can still make a difference, then he needs to muster some allies because the American people are not going to sustain alone -- nor should they -- a long-shot bet that something decent can still be built in Baghdad. 
 If the president can't get help, then he has to initiate a phased withdrawal: now. Because the opportunity cost this war is exacting on our country and its ability to focus on anything else is out of all proportion to what might still be achieved in Iraq by our staying, with too few troops and too few friends.
 Iraqis can add. The surge has brought more calm to Iraq largely because the mainstream Iraqi Sunnis finally calculated that they have lost and that both the pro-Al Qaeda Iraqi Sunnis and the radical Shiites are more of a threat to them than the Americans they had been shooting at. 
 The minute we start withdrawing, all Iraqis will carefully calculate their interests. They may decide that they want more blood baths, but there is just as much likelihood that they will eventually find equilibrium.
 I have not been to Dalian in three years. It is not just a nice city for China. It is a beautiful city of wide avenues, skyscrapers, green spaces, software parks and universities. 
 The president of Dalian University of Technology, Jinping Ou, told me his new focus now is on energy research and that he has 100 doctoral students dealing with different energy problems -- where five years ago he barely had any -- and that the Chinese government has just decided to open its national energy innovation research center here.
 Listening to him, my mind drifted back to Iraq, where I was two weeks ago and where I heard a U.S. officer in Baghdad tell this story: 
 His unit was on a patrol in a Sunni neighborhood when it got hit by an I.E.D. Fortunately, the bomb exploded too soon and no one was hurt. His men jumped out and followed the detonation wire, which led 1,500 feet into the neighborhood. A U.S. Black Hawk helicopter was in the area and alerted the U.S. soldiers that a man was fleeing the scene on a bicycle. The soldiers asked the Black Hawk for help, and it swooped down and used its rotor blades to blow the insurgent off his bicycle, with a giant ''whoosh,'' and the U.S. soldiers captured him.
 That image of a $6 million high-tech U.S. helicopter with a highly trained pilot blowing an insurgent off his bicycle captures the absurdity of our situation in Iraq. The great Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi said it best: ''Great powers should never get involved in the politics of small tribes.''
 That is where we are in Iraq. We're wasting our brains. We're wasting our people. We're wasting our future. China is not.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing I.T. To Unlikely Places, Like America

BYLINE: By DAVID STROM

 BODY:
BUSINESSES, especially big ones, began outsourcing information-technology operations nearly a decade ago. But compared with the earliest efforts, corporate I.T. outsourcing today is far more precisely calibrated.
 Where outsourcing once meant transferring departments to Bangalore, India, or Riga, Latvia, it now usually involves assigning specific, basic operational tasks like making data backups, running e-mail networks and maintaining computer servers. As a result, outsourcing has become more attractive to smaller businesses that in the past might not have had the resources to hire a full tech-support team to do the work. 
 The vendors supplying this new generation of outsourcing services are called managed service providers, or M.S.P.'s. They come in all shapes and sizes, from I.B.M. down. Some operate their own large data centers. They have emerged in unexpected places -- American cities like Portland, Ore.; Little Rock, Ark.; and Madison, Wis., where there is enough skilled labor for the tasks, and the expenses are less than in bigger cities. 
 Using these companies can offer big payoffs for businesses with I.T. departments that are stretched thin. 
 ''It can free up internal resources for more important activities,'' says Lloyd Hession, chief security officer of BT Radianz, which provides services to brokerages and other financial firms.
 Mark E. Bakken, chief executive of Bedrock Managed Services and Consulting in Madison, Wis., said that operations typically accounted for 70 percent of a company's I.T. budget. ''If we can cut that by a third, they can pocket the money or use it to grow,'' he said.
 The changes reflect a shift in the scale of information-technology outsourcing, said Richard Ruiz, the general manager of the small- and medium-business services unit at I.B.M. Global Technology Services. 
 ''Ten years ago, I.T. was more of an expense,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''Back then we did big, complex and expensive outsourcing deals. Now I.B.M. has a more diversified outsourcing product portfolio and can approach smaller customers, too.'' 
 M.S.P.'s are thriving because of several trends. First, Internet connectivity is cheap and getting cheaper. 
 Corporations can expect more flexibility in Internet capacity, paying for what they use, rather than for extra capacity they may need only at peak times. 
 ''The real driver was the ability to provide a flexible bandwidth model to cater to unpredictable demands on our Web servers from the general public looking for information,'' said Aaron Bazler, the network and infrastructure manager for the Manchester Airport Authority in Britain. When the airport outsourced its parking-reservations system, it freed up bandwidth for its own needs. 
 Falling Internet connectivity prices, in turn, make it easier for the M.S.P.'s to access the Internet bandwidth they need to ensure reliable operations and prevent a failure. ''We have four upstream Internet providers coming into our place,'' said Rich Bader, the chief executive of EasyStreet Online Services in Beaverton, Ore., outside Portland. Among the three very high-speed lines, he said, usually one goes down once a month. ''The trick is that we have enough spare bandwidth on the other lines to handle any outage.'' 
 Second, the Internet is playing a larger, more integral role in many corporations' collections of computing applications. Take e-mail: it is hard to find any major company that doesn't have an Internet connection for its employees' e-mail. 
 ''E-mail is now about external communications, and we sell Microsoft Exchange by the mailbox at $15 per month each,'' Mr. Bader said. ''Exchange is very picky to run properly, and a lot of companies just don't want to devote the necessary resources to get the kind of reliability that the business requires.''
 Having more Internet-connected applications requires more skill in running the applications and the broadband connection to these servers. 
 ''The amount of expertise needed to keep Internet applications running and secure continues to increase,'' Mr. Bader said. ''Before we just had stand-alone Web servers. Now they are integrated into various other internal corporate applications, which means that businesses are even more dependent on their availability.'' 
 Moreover, Internet connections mean data and network security considerations are critical, said Mr. Ruiz of I.B.M. ''The Web drives a lot of security issues for our customers, and they need help managing and containing these issues,'' he said.
 And as the size of a typical I.T. staff continues to decrease, there is great importance in shifting responsibility for maintaining these critical servers to an outside provider who can monitor and manage them nonstop. 
 ''We have had no major outages in the past year except for routine maintenance,'' Mr. Bazler of Manchester airport said. ''Having an M.S.P. manage our servers has made a huge positive difference in their availability.'' 
 Third, the software tools that are needed to monitor and manage computer servers remotely are cheaper and more reliable than they used to be. Both I.B.M. and Microsoft, among others, have deepened and broadened their management-tools products, making it easier for engineers to keep machines running and updated, and foster certain economies of scale for M.S.P.'s that are handling multiple customers. 
 ''I call Dell or H.P. and wait on hold and tell them what they need to fix so my customers don't have to waste their time,'' said Bob Longo, the director of ClearPointe Technology, an M.S.P. in Little Rock, Ark. 
 ClearPointe has a minimum of three engineers on duty at all times. The company monitors more than 25,000 devices, and does routine maintenance on 700 servers for customers all over the United States for an average monthly cost of $700 a server.
 Fourth, even the smaller corporations are motivated to do a better job with disaster recovery and off-site data protection as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, which set new financial reporting and auditing rules for businesses and other legislation. In the past, only the largest corporate data centers made off-site plans; now it is more common for smaller ones to do so. M.S.P.'s have tailored their offerings and sell less expensive solutions for this market. 
 ''Legal compliance complexity is really driving more business to M.S.P.'s,'' said Charles Weaver, president of MSPAlliance, an association of managed-service providers based in Chico, Calif.

HEADLINE: Prices Surge In China; Trade Surplus Grows Wider

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
China's monthly inflation surged to an 11-year high in August and the trade surplus grew, according to reports released here Tuesday, adding to pressure on the authorities to increase interest rates and slow the sizzling economy. 
 The National Bureau of Statistics said prices rose 6.5 percent, driven by a 49 percent jump in the cost of pork and other meat from the month a year earlier.
 The trade surplus widened by 33 percent over August 2006, to $24.97 billion, the second-highest monthly level on record, the General Administration of Customs reported.
 This latest increase in the trade imbalance could add to pressure from the United States on the Beijing authorities to ease controls that critics say keep the Chinese currency, the yuan, undervalued, adding to the surplus. The Senate is already considering two measures that would impose sanctions if Beijing failed to take such action.
 China ran a $15 billion trade surplus with the United States in August, according to the customs figures. Exports to the United States rose 16.7 percent, to $20.9 billion; imports of American goods increased 15.5 percent, to $5.9 billion.
 The trade surplus with the United States for the first eight months of the year totaled $103.3 billion, according to the Chinese government. 
 Beijing has tried to narrow the gap by repealing rebates of value-added taxes on hundreds of products and imposing new taxes to discourage exports of steel and other energy-intensive or polluting goods. It has also allowed the yuan's value to increase, to a rate late Tuesday of 7.52 to the dollar, compared with roughly 8.08 to the dollar two years ago, a rise of more than 7 percent.
 But the flood of export revenue is straining China's ability to contain pressure on prices, amid a boom in which the economy grew at an annual pace of 11.9 percent in the most recent quarter. 
 Inflation in August was the highest monthly rate reported since December 1996. The spike in food prices, which were up 18.2 percent from August 2006, is especially worrisome because food costs particularly hurt China's poor majority.
 Authorities have blamed a deadly swine ailment and higher prices for animal feed for the rise in food prices.
 A Lehman Brothers economist, Mingchun Sun, wrote to clients, ''We expect more monetary tightening to rein in inflation, including further rate hikes.'' 
 The government has raised interest rates four times this year to try to restrain the boom and has imposed investment curbs on the auto, textile and other industries. But experts say these measures are requiring longer than expected to take effect.
 China's August exports totaled $111.3 billion, while imports were $86.4 billion, according to the customs agency. European nations were the biggest trading partners, with exports to Europe rising 31.3 percent, to $23 billion, and imports from there up 21.8 percent, at $10.2 billion.

DATELINE: FORT PIERRE, S.D. 

 BODY:
From the scrub and gravel, a building rises here in the shape of a giant eagle -- a striking symbol, its creators say, for an American Indian cultural facility and a judicial center.
 Except that this eagle has only one wing. Federal money for the other has run dry. And even the one eagle wing, all 30,000 square feet of it, is mainly just a shell, ceilings unfinished and rooms empty, silent but for the buzz of black flies that bite. 
 This $18 million center, once championed by Tom Daschle, the former South Dakota senator and Senate Democratic leader, was meant to accomplish something unprecedented: lure outside investment to impoverished Indian reservations across the region by creating a court system where outsiders could recoup losses if a business deal went bad.
 The effort had drawn praise from bankers' associations, South Dakota's bar association, the State Chamber of Commerce, the National Congress of American Indians and the 11 chairmen of the Sioux Nation tribes. But along the way, Mr. Daschle lost his seat in the Senate and annual funds for the half-finished project known as the Wakpa Sica (pronounced WALK-paw SHE-cha) Reconciliation Place have dropped precipitously, leaving some here to wonder what, if anything, will come of the place. 
 Proponents of Wakpa Sica, named, in Lakota, for the Bad River junction where Sioux leaders met members of the Lewis and Clark party, say theirs is the story of a good idea swept aside in Washington's abrupt distaste for certain pet projects paid for through budget mechanisms known as earmarks. 
 In this remote town of 2,000, the people who have been planning the center for more than a decade say they feel unfairly tarnished by anti-earmark sentiment, prompted in part by the scandals surrounding the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Representative Randy Cunningham of California and by proposed projects like the $200 million ''bridge to nowhere'' in Alaska.
 ''The thing is, this is anything but a bridge to nowhere,'' said Marshall Matz, a lawyer in Washington who is representing the center. ''But no one wants to hear that. The Congress seems to feel we are an earmark, and earmarks are very difficult now to get money for.''
 The South Dakota center finds itself contending with the risk inherent in every earmark, silly or worthwhile. Its champion, Mr. Daschle, is gone, and with him the money. That is the fate of many earmarked projects with powerful sponsors who move on. Those tied to large companies, which can ensure survival by seeking help from multiple lawmakers, struggle less; little projects in little places risk more.
 And even though those in South Dakota's current Congressional delegation say it is a worthy project, this is hardly a climate in which others are likely to fight for someone else's earmark. 
 ''This is a cautionary tale,'' said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, which tracks such federal spending and describes the earmarks from the 2005 budget as ''out of control,'' including $1.3 million for Wakpa Sica. ''If you had a more objective funding system -- not political patronage -- the funding would be consistent, and that's one of the problems with these things. Live by the earmark, die by the earmark.''
 Despite new rules brought about by the recent scandals requiring lawmakers to attach their names to their pet projects, Washington has hardly sworn off earmarks. House lawmakers have put together spending bills with nearly 6,500 earmarks worth almost $11 billion, though the budget process is far from done.
 But the pace, so far, is significantly slower than in the prescandal days of 2005, when Congress financed more than 15,000 pet projects, by some estimates, totaling more than $30 billion.
 In the late 1990s, a group of American Indians and outside civic and academic leaders approached Mr. Daschle about the center here. In a telephone interview from Washington, where he is now a special policy adviser at a law firm, Mr. Daschle recalled that he viewed it as a way to accomplish many things: to tell the history of American Indians and this country in South Dakota; to further reconciliation with the state's nine tribes; and, perhaps most uniquely, to create a legal model, a court system and a high court that would make non-Indian businesses more comfortable in Indian Country.
 Outside investors often fear that the tribes' independent legal systems and shifting leadership pose too much risk. Ultimately, the new judicial center was intended to encourage economic development -- in the form of investment in business and loans for new enterprises -- on reservations, where poverty rates are among the worst in the nation.
 ''You can draw a red line around every reservation in South Dakota and until we have an appellate court, we're not going to have any economic development on the reservation,'' said Clarence Mortenson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the chairman of the board of Wakpa Sica. 
 In 2000, Mr. Daschle succeeded in getting Congressional authorization for Wakpa Sica as part of a larger Indian Advancement Act, but that did not include money. Mr. Daschle recalled working to convince his colleagues that the legal element of the center could be used by tribes all around the country and that it was not ''just some Indian pork'' for South Dakota. At the time, Mr. Daschle said, no one ''seriously challenged'' the project. 
 In the budget bills that followed, the project (then estimated to cost $18 million, now estimated at closer to $25 million) was granted annual appropriations of at least $1.3 million for a total of nearly $8 million. 
 But in 2004, after the budget was set for the next year, Mr. Daschle was defeated by John Thune, a Republican and former congressman. In the next budget, Wakpa Sica received $350,000. For the 2007 fiscal year, it got nothing. The 2008 budget process is not completed yet, but the House proposal would give Wakpa Sica $150,000.
 As the center has struggled, the very definition of the word earmark has become a matter of intense debate here. The fact that the center received broad Congressional authorization in 2000 -- rather than being slipped into a spending bill as part of a deal -- makes it unfair to consider it an earmark, Mr. Matz said.
 Others, including Mr. Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, vehemently disagree. 
 ''It's still a line-item provision inserted at the request of a lawmaker,'' Mr. Ellis said. 
 And at least one lawmaker, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, questioned elements of the center itself. 
 ''We don't need any more cultural centers,'' Mr. Coburn said. ''We're fighting a war; why should we be spending any more on a cultural center?''
 As the money has faded away, plans here have been scaled back. During a tour, the construction manager, Richard Rangel, spoke of ways to stretch the money -- lower-grade carpet and ceiling materials. The grant proposal writer, one of just a handful of staff members at the center, was let go. 
 Members of South Dakota's delegation defended and praised the project, but offered little in the way of comfort. After all, they have their own favored projects to fight for. And the demands of Indian tribes, in particular, often run toward more basic needs like keeping emergency rooms, schools and roads open. 
 A spokesman for Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a Democrat and South Dakota's only member of the House, called the project a ''top priority'' and pointed to the $150,000 being considered this year as something she had secured.
 Kyle Downey, communications director for Mr. Thune, said, ''Budgets are tight these days, and earmark reform has made it tough for this project and many others to get finished simply on federal funding.'' Mr. Downey added that Mr. Thune helped get authorization for Wakpa Sica during his tenure in the House. 
 The state's other senator, Tim Johnson, a Democrat, said the war in Iraq and tax breaks had ''drained resources from many important domestic projects, including the Wakpa Sica Reconciliation Place.'' 
 While work on a judicial system continues, Mr. Daschle said he still hoped there would be a center to house it. He said he recalled being at the ground-breaking ceremony and feeling a rush of momentum and hopefulness.
 ''It has eroded,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''The half-eagle is a perfect metaphor for the half-commitment we're now getting from government.''

HEADLINE: OPEC to Lift Oil Output Modestly; Price Rises

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: VIENNA, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
OPEC sought to regain its authority over volatile oil markets Tuesday, agreeing to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day. But prices still rose to a record.
 At the same time, representatives of leading OPEC nations said they feared that a slowing global economy might limit future demand. The oil cartel signaled that it would be ready to act swiftly to protect its members' interests. 
 The decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which came as a surprise to many, followed an unusually long day of arguments about the size and timing of a production increase, intended to meet an expected surge in winter consumption and to push prices down. 
 While the rise in crude oil supplies would be modest, about 2 percent, OPEC nations including Iran, Venezuela and Algeria had initially expressed strong opposition to an increase in production. Others feared that a mistimed decision to add oil to the market might backfire at a time of heightened economic concern.
 As Vera de Ladoucette of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, saw it: ''The Saudis convinced other OPEC countries that $80 a barrel was a ceiling. They were really worried about contributing to the world economic crisis. They acted prudently.''
 Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations brokered the deal during a seven-hour-long meeting here. Analysts said Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader and the group's biggest supplier, would be more comfortable with oil around $70 a barrel. The production increase, the first official one in more than a year, will be effective on Nov. 1.
 But the commodities market seemed to shrug off the decision. In New York on Tuesday, crude oil for October delivery rose 74 cents, to settle at a record $78.23 a barrel. The market consensus was that there would be a big drop in oil supplies in the inventory data to be reported Wednesday by the United States Department of Energy. Oil-consuming countries, including the United States, have been urging OPEC producers to add output to the market, warning that winter was expected to bring a big rise in oil consumption that producers outside OPEC would not be able to meet. They warned further that high oil prices could put an additional drag on the global economy. 
 OPEC members were eager to stress that they were being responsible and responsive. ''Our message to consumers is that we care and we are concerned, and that is why we increased production,'' Abdalla Salem el-Badri of Libya, the group's secretary general, said at a news briefing after the meeting. 
 And David Kirsch, an oil analyst at the consulting firm PFC Energy, said: ''OPEC is uncomfortable with a situation that takes control away from the fundamentals, and therefore from OPEC. The question they are wrestling with is that there are very short-term bullish pressures on prices, but longer-term question marks.''
 OPEC representatives said they were aware that excessively high prices might put a dent in a global economy that is already suffering from the weak housing market in the United States. Some oil ministers at the meeting said they did not want to be blamed for worsening global economic woes.
 ''We think that the market is a little bit high,'' Kuwait's acting oil minister, Mohammad al-Olaim, said. 
 Yet OPEC also recognized the dangers that a slowing world economy posed to its business. Many ministers here feared repeating the mistake made in 1997 when the group increased supplies by 2.5 million barrels a day just as the Asian financial crisis was brewing. The result was a collapse in crude oil prices the following year, to $10 a barrel. The producers' revenue was cut in half.
 This time, the organization hinted that its members would keep close watch on the market and would be ready to act quickly if needed by cutting production if prices declined too much. 
 In a carefully worded final statement, OPEC said it would be ready ''to swiftly respond to any developments which might jeopardize oil market stability and their interests.''
 Analysts present in Vienna took that to mean that the producing countries would reduce production if prices were to decline too rapidly.
 The organization is scheduled to meet twice before the end of the year, once in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in November, at a meeting of heads of state, and again in December in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
 Because of high demand, OPEC members had already been pumping more oil than their previous quotas allowed. 
 The 10 countries of OPEC's 12 that have been allocated production quotas -- all except Angola and Iraq -- pumped an average of 26.7 million barrels of crude oil a day last month, according an estimate by Bloomberg, or 900,000 barrels a day more than their collective target.
 The new production level raises the target to 27.2 million barrels a day.
 Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS in New York, said, ''For OPEC, the risk of doing nothing and seeing prices escalate seemed bigger than the risk of doing something and watching prices come off from it.''

HEADLINE: Housing Costs Consumed More of Paycheck in 2006

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
Housing costs ate up more of the monthly paycheck for millions of Americans in 2006 than the year before, despite signs of a slowdown in the housing market, according to figures made public today by the Census Bureau. The bureau also reported that more Americans over age 65 were continuing to work last year, whether by choice or out of economic necessity.
 The housing data describe the buildup of economic pressures before the recent wave of foreclosures, as lenders allowed home-buyers to borrow more money relative to their earnings and consumers borrowed or refinanced as if the market would never fall. At the same time, incomes did not keep up with housing prices. 
 Nationally, half of renters and more than one third of mortgage holders -- 37 percent, up from 35 percent in 2005, or a rise of more than 1.5 million households -- spent at least 30 percent of their gross income on housing costs, the level many government agencies consider the limit of affordability. 
 ''Maybe it all means that housing is not as smart an investment for as many people as we thought,'' said Matt Fellowes, a scholar in metropolitan policy at the Brookings Institution. ''Stocks perform better than houses over time. Maybe the American dream should be building wealth in general, not building a certain type of wealth, which we see is narrow and dangerous.''
 Fourteen percent of mortgage-holders spent at least half their income on housing in 2006, up from 13 percent last year, while among renters there was little change. In both years, 25 percent of renters spent half their income on housing. 
 The rising housing burden cuts into the money people have available for other expenses and anticipated the rise in foreclosures. 
 ''It's not an accident that the states that are leading in foreclosures, including California, Nevada and Florida, are also on top of the list for the proportion of mortgage borrowers paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing,'' Mr. Fellowes said. ''Take away the four top states, and there's actually a decrease in foreclosures.'' 
 In California, where the median home price rose to $536,000 (compared with a national median of $185,000), more than half of all homeowners with mortgages and renters lived in housing not considered affordable. Twenty-two percent of California homeowners and 27 percent of renters spent more than half their income on housing last year. 
 These consumers are extremely vulnerable to any change in their income or expenses, including increases in their adjustable mortgage rates, said Eric S. Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. The states with the highest shares of mortgage-holders paying at least 30 percent of their incomes for housing -- California (52 percent), Nevada (46 percent), Hawaii (46 percent), New Jersey (45 percent) and Florida (45 percent) -- include the leaders in housing foreclosures. 
 ''The lure was that housing prices would always increase,'' so people with adjustable rate mortgages could refinance before the higher rates kicked in, Dr. Belsky said. Lenders approved mortgages based on borrowers' abilities to pay at the low initial rate, not the potential higher one, he said. 
 ''But the more you initially stretched, the more painful any increase becomes, and the less recourse you have to make up the money, because there are only so many places to stretch the budget.'' As interest rates rose and housing prices softened, many people now owe more money on their houses than the houses are worth, he said. 
 The question now, he added, was whether the recent rise in interest rates would push more people into the rental market, and so drive up rents. ''It's too early to tell,'' he said. 
 The housing statistics come from a wide-ranging annual study called the American Community Survey, which the Census Bureau released in two parts. The first part last month revealed modest gains in median household income last year and a rise in the number of uninsured. The data were analyzed for The New York Times by Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College.
 Housing values and rents both rose in 2006. The median gross rent inched up to $763 per month, from $751, and the median home value rose to $185,000 from $173,000. 
 The cheapest rents were in Dona Ana County, N. M. ($401) and Belmont County, Ohio, ($417), while the highest median home values were all in Southern California: Santa Barbara, Santa Monica and Newport Beach, each slightly over $1,000,000. The combined five boroughs of New York City were far down the list, at $496,000, but New York County -- that is, Manhattan -- finished fourth among counties, with median home values of $788,000.
 The new data also show changes in the composition of households. Homeownership continued to rise, while the percentage of households that could be described as nuclear families -- two parents with children under 18 -- continued its decline, to 22 percent last year, from 24 percent in 2000. More families spoke a language other than English in their homes in 2006, when compared with the previous year, most often Spanish. 
 The increase in older workers reflects a combination of factors, said Yung-Ping Chen, a professor of gerontology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Nearly one quarter of Americans from 65 to 74 -- 23 percent -- were either working or looking for work, up from 19.6 percent in 2000. 
 While the poverty rate for this age group has declined, dropping below that for people age 18 to 64, many still fear that they will run out of money, especially as companies have eliminated traditional pension plans, he said. 
 ''People are living longer, and they need more resources,'' Dr. Chen said. ''There's a great fear of income inadequacy. At the same time, I don't see a lot of people in the need category having the option to work longer. It's a typical social issue embedded in economic realities -- those who need it the most are not able to prolong their work life. It's not just bricklayers or long-haul truck drivers. Even nurses -- it's hard work.''

HEADLINE: How Do You Like Your Genes? Biofabs Take Orders

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
INDUSTRIAL age foundries made cast-metal parts. Information age foundries, or ''fabs,'' produce computer chips. Now come foundries for the biotechnology age, churning out the stuff of life itself. 
 Such ''biofabs'' produce made-to-order genes, the stretches of DNA that contain the instructions for living creatures. The foundries take orders over the Internet from pharmaceutical companies or academic scientists and ship back the finished genes in as little as a week or two. The genes can be used to genetically engineer bacteria or other cells to make proteins, or in various types of biological research.
 Sales of the gene-synthesis industry are estimated at only $50 million a year, but they are growing rapidly. One foundry, GeneArt, in Regensburg, Germany, has gone public. It says it expects sales this year to increase at least 60 percent, to 12.5 million euros, or about $17 million. 
 Fueling the surge is the productivity of DNA synthesis, which has increased 700-fold in the last decade, according to Bio Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. The cost per base pair, the basic chemical unit of a DNA molecule, has dropped to less than $1, from about $30.
 The ability to make genes has given rise to a field called synthetic biology, which might lead to artificial life in a few years. For now, though, most of the biofabs' business is coming from transforming the practice of 30-year-old ''conventional'' genetic engineering. 
 ''The prices have come down to the point where it is less expensive for many researchers to have a gene synthesized than to make the equivalent molecule themselves,'' said John Mulligan, chairman and chief scientist at Blue Heron Biotechnology, a gene-synthesis company in Bothell, Wash. 
 Genetic engineers generally extract a gene from an organism. Then they might modify it or put it in a different organism. The gene for insulin, for instance, can be extracted from human cells and put into bacteria, which will produce insulin for use by diabetics. It is a cut-and-paste operation, like writing a phrase by snipping the necessary words out of magazines and gluing them together in the proper order. 
 Gene synthesis, by contrast, is like typing the phrase on a word processor. Scientists specify the sequence of the desired gene and have it ''printed'' at the foundry. They can do this because the complete genome sequences of humans and many other species are available in databases. 
 Peter Kuhn, an associate professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, has been studying the proteins made by the virus that causes SARS, which killed nearly 800 people in 2003. 
 Before the introduction of gene synthesis, Mr. Kuhn had to isolate the genes from the virus itself, then put them into bacteria to have them produce the proteins. Now he orders the genes from DNA2.0, a foundry. 
 ''If we were starting this today, I wouldn't even bother trying to get any of this from the natural source,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''I would just order everything.'' 
 DNA is made up of four chemical units called bases, usually represented by the letters A, C, G and T. The bases are paired to form the rungs of the twisted ladder structure of DNA. 
 The first mail-order DNA companies sprung up about two decades ago, selling short, single-stranded pieces of DNA, usually 20 bases to 60 bases long. These strands, called oligonucleotides, or oligos, are used to help find and amplify full genes. 
 Sales of DNA oligos are about $700 million a year, according to BioInformatics, a market research firm, though some executives say that figure is too high. Production is automated and competition is cutthroat, with prices of 10 cents to 50 cents a base. 
 Customers ''want to have it delivered to them the next day and they really don't want to pay much for this custom service,'' said Mary Buchanan, a business manager at Invitrogen, a leading supplier of oligos. Other major participants include Integrated DNA Technologies and Operon Biotechnologies. 
 The newer biofabs make complete double-stranded genes, usually hundreds to about 2,000 base pairs long, though in a few cases, longer than 10,000. Leaders in this business include GeneArt, Blue Heron, DNA2.0, which is in Menlo Park, Calif., and Codon Devices of Cambridge, Mass.
 Customers usually place orders -- a sequence of hundreds of As, Cs, Gs and Ts -- through a biofab's Web site or by e-mail. ''It's really not possible to take an order like that over the phone or even by fax,'' said Jeremy Minshull, president of DNA2.0.
 Manufacturing is a prime example of what is called mass customization, highly automated production with every single product being different.
 The machines that string together bases make so many mistakes that they cannot make a full gene flawlessly. So the companies make shorter oligos and splice them together. Error checking is crucial. 
 A new opportunity for foundries could come from synthetic biology, which involves designing cells almost from scratch to perform specific tasks, like producing biofuel. Synthetic biologists envision writing the DNA code for such cells the way computer programmers write software. Then the DNA would be manufactured and put into cells. 
 Ultimately, it might be possible to create artificial life. The scientist J. Craig Venter is trying to do that by synthesizing the 580,076-base genome of a simple bacterium, which would be inserted into some other bacterium. 
 Some biofabs are distancing themselves from such talk, fearing it could arouse public distrust. ''We are not in the business at Codon of creating life,'' said John P. Danner, president of Codon Devices. 
 There is concern that DNA synthesis might be used to make pathogens. In 2002, scientists at Stony Brook University announced that they had synthesized the polio virus, using its published genome sequence and mail-order oligos. It took them three years, but a sequence that long, 7,500 bases, can now be made in weeks. 
 The foundries say they screen orders against a database of pathogen DNA sequences and verify that customers are from reputable institutions. The leading companies have formed a consortium to write other safeguards and regulations. 
 But critics say governments should devise the regulations. ETC Group, a technology watchdog, said that regulations were needed to prevent ill-advised or careless applications, not just nefarious ones. 
 ''The danger is not just bioterror,'' ETC said in a report earlier this year, ''but 'bioerror.' ''

HEADLINE: Cost of Health Insurance Rises Again, but at a Slightly Slower Rate

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The cost of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has increased 6.1 percent this year, well ahead of wage trends and consumer price inflation, but below the 7.7 percent increase in 2006, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported yesterday.
 Because doctor and hospital costs continue to rise at an even faster rate, the modest slowdown in insurance inflation mainly reflects cutbacks in coverage by many health plans, which have found ways to make employees pay more for their care. Industry experts said that without those measures, premium costs would have risen by 9 percent or more. 
 The total average annual cost for family coverage premiums rose this year to $12,106. 
 ''For that kind of money, you could buy a compact car every year,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Foundation, a nonprofit group that produces the widely watched annual survey. He noted that health costs had increased 78 percent since 2001, more than four times the pace of prices and wages.
 The 2007 increase was the smallest annual rise since 1999, when health premiums jumped 5.3 percent.
 Kaiser did not try to project 2008 costs for health premiums. But research houses are forecasting increases for next year that include 6.7 percent by Mercer Health and Benefits; 9.9 percent by PricewaterhouseCoopers; 10.5 percent by the Segal Company; and 11 percent by AON Consulting. 
 The costs of hospital and doctor care seem to be ''outpacing premium increases,'' said Jon Gabel, a principal investigator for the Kaiser survey. That could squeeze insurance company profit margins, which have been running at 6 percent to 7 percent, he said. 
 Sixty percent of employers offer health benefits, including nearly all large companies with 200 or more workers. But fewer than half of small businesses with three to nine employees do so, the survey found. 
 The telephone survey, which ended in May and was conducted by Kaiser and the Health Research and Educational Trust, queried 3,078 public and private employers and was based on 1,997 that responded to the full survey. 
 It found that employers and workers are still slow to embrace the widely publicized high-deductible plans with savings options that have been promoted by the Bush administration and many insurance companies and banks. Such health savings account plans attained only a ''modest enrollment'' of 3.8 million workers, according to Kaiser. That was 5 percent of all covered employees, compared with 4 percent in 2006. 
 Almost one in five large employers currently offer some sort of health savings option, combined with high-deductible insurance. But that number may not grow much. Only 2 percent of employers that do not already offer health savings accounts said they were very likely to add them next year. 
 Under health savings plans, employees can set aside money in tax-sheltered accounts that roll over year to year and that workers can take with them if they change jobs. Employers also have the option of contributing to the accounts of workers to help cover potentially high out-of-pocket costs. But only about half of the employers that offer the plans make such contributions, according to the survey. 
 Other findings included a sign of growing awareness that preventive care can be cost effective: most preferred-provider organizations, or P.P.O.'s -- the networks that cover 57 percent of all workers -- now pay for services like immunizations and mammograms without charging the employee. 
 Also, nearly half of all employers that offer health benefits now cover unmarried domestic partners of the opposite sex, and about 37 percent cover same-sex partners.
 As for drug plans, three in four covered employees are in them, with average out-of-pocket payments of $11 for generic drugs, $25 for the health plan's preferred brand-name drugs and $43 for brands not on the preferred list.

HEADLINE: Has the Jump In Wages Met Its End?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Americans think about their lives in relation to the past, they are decidedly upbeat. In resounding numbers -- regardless of whether the economy is in a boom or a bust, whether the country is at war or peace -- they tell pollsters that they live better than their parents did. And there is good reason for the good cheer: People live longer today than past generations did; they're healthier while alive; they're more educated; they're richer; and they face less discrimination.
 But when the discussion is about the future, the national mood darkens. In one typical poll from last year, only 34 percent of people said they expected today's children to be better off than people are now, down from 55 percent when a similar question was asked in 1999. So while Americans are generally pleased with their lot in life today, they're anxious about the future. 
 It's in this context that most people may want to think about last week's bad employment report from the Labor Department. Professional economists are now trying to figure out whether the unexpected loss of jobs in August means that a recession is on the way or whether the decline was just a blip that will soon be reversed. Wall Street puts the odds of a recession at around one in three, which -- given Wall Street's penchant for rosy forecasts -- means the odds are probably closer to one in two.
 In an earlier time, the recession question would have been the one that mattered most for typical American families. The answer would have meant the difference between getting continued raises above inflation and being forced to take an effective pay cut. But something important has changed since the 1970s. A growing economy, by itself, is no longer enough to bring solid pay increases, which are in turn the lifeblood of rising living standards. We now seem to need a major boom.
 As Lawrence Katz, the labor economist and Harvard professor, says, ''What's striking about the last few decades is that unless the labor market is really, really tight, we don't see widespread benefits like we did in the past.''
 If you look at the chart above, you'll notice that inflation-adjusted wages fell throughout most of the 1980s, even though the overall economy was growing nicely. It took the boom (and bubble) of the 1990s to get real wages rising. By the time its effects had fully worn off, in about 2003, pay began stagnating again, despite good economic growth. 
 Only in the last year did the current expansion get strong enough to deliver real pay increases. And for all the talk about how inequality has grown under President Bush -- which it has -- the gains for ordinary workers in late 2006 were truly impressive. For a few months, wages were growing as fast as they had been in the roaring 1990s.
 The problem is that, as far as most families are concerned, the modern economy has little room for error. It has to be firing on almost all cylinders -- adding something like 200,000 jobs a month for at least a couple of consecutive years -- before employers feel competitive pressure to pay their workers more. 
 Even if the economy does bounce back from the mortgage crisis, almost no economist is expecting sustained monthly gains of 200,000 jobs anytime soon. In fact, the housing slump was already causing job and wage growth to weaken before stocks dropped last month. In both June and July, the economy added fewer than 70,000 jobs and in August, it lost 4,000, the first loss in four years. 
 Going forward, the debate is between those who see a continued slowdown and those who see a recession. In either case, wages will probably keep rising for a while because it takes time for a weakening job market to affect paychecks. Sometime soon, though, most workers can probably say goodbye to healthy raises. 
 By now, the reasons that middle-class pay increases are so hard to come by will sound familiar. Technology lets computers do jobs that people once did, and it also allows jobs to be done in low-wage countries on the other side of the globe. As a result, workers, save for the most skilled, have less bargaining power. These trends can't be reversed.
 What's disappointing is that the political response to the changes has been so limp. If anything, government has probably made the situation worse. 
 Just look at schools. Every successive generation over the last century has been more educated than the previous one, measured by the average level of educational attainment. But the gains for men have stopped in recent decades, and for women they have slowed to a crawl, Mr. Katz notes. 
 The United States, the world's leader in producing college graduates 25 years ago, has fallen behind South Korea, Norway and the Netherlands. Our lead over Japan, Australia, England and Canada has shrunk. 
 Remember that this has happened over a 25-year span in which the economic benefits of education have grown enormously. If the government had figured out how to get college graduation rates to rise more quickly -- probably by giving schools more money but also by holding them more accountable -- wages might have increased more quickly, too. 
 Health care is an example on the opposite end of the problem, a place where better policy could make life easier for families coping with weaker wage growth. Medical science can do much more than ever before, but many people aren't receiving the care they need. Given the explosion of diabetes, some epidemiologists worry that today's children could become the first generation in the modern era not to have longer life spans than its parents.
 So I think Americans have the right reading on the situation: we unquestionably live better than we used to, but there are real reasons to worry whether the gains can continue at anything like their recent pace.
 In an ideal world, this issue and all the related subjects -- from universal health care to school choice -- would dominate the domestic side of the 2008 presidential campaign. I'm not sure whether that will happen. But if there is one silver lining in the latest bits of troubling economic news, it's that they make the larger problem harder to ignore.

HEADLINE: What's Good for Children

 BODY:
America's business community was an early advocate of reform and a prime mover in the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, which required the states to improve public schooling for all students. With Congress gearing up to reauthorize the act, business leaders are rightly raising their voices in an attempt to prevent the teachers' unions and their political allies from weakening this important law. 
 Corporate leaders have complained for years about job applicants who don't read, write or think well enough. Faced with poorly educated workers at home -- especially in science -- American companies are increasingly looking abroad, not just for lower-paid workers, but for workers with the training and skills to compete in a globalized economy.
 With those concerns in mind, the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives from the nation's largest companies, spoke out forcefully this week. At a House hearing, the Roundtable's president, John Castellani, cited troubling provisions in a draft reauthorization bill that would allow schools to mask failure in teaching crucial subjects like reading and math by giving them credit for student performance in other subjects or on alternate measures of performances. 
 Mr. Castellani voiced strong support for the accountability principles underlying the original law and warned that the draft would allow too many schools to ''game the system'' by hiding the records of underachieving students. The provisions, he warned, would weaken the process by which schools are identified as in need of improvement and would replace a ''transparent accountability system'' with a tortured and confusing one. As such, the new system could cover up deficits that the current law has clearly exposed. 
 The draft, the work of the House Education Committee chairman, George Miller of California, contains some good reforms as well. But those ideas would be wasted if states, schools and teachers were not held accountable for the quality of the education they provide. Not only do America's businesses need better-educated workers, the country needs better-educated citizens as well. And America's children all deserve a sound education.

HEADLINE: July Trade Gap Shrank Slightly as Exports Continued to Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit narrowed slightly in July as export growth continued to outpace that of imports, the government said Tuesday, suggesting trade could offer a welcome lift to third-quarter economic growth. 
 The July trade gap shrank slightly, to $59.2 billion from an upwardly revised estimate of $59.4 billion in June. Both imports and exports set records in July, but exports have been rising this year at a faster pace.
 ''This is a strong report,'' said Roger Kubarych, chief United States economist with UniCredit Markets and Investment Banking in New York. If the trend continues, he said, it would add close to a full percentage point to gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, continuing a surge from the second quarter.
 The economy needs the lift from trade. Other reports predicted a steeper slide in sales and prices for homes this year, and that is beginning to take a toll on consumer spirits.
 The National Association of Realtors cut its forecast for sales of existing homes for a seventh straight month, to a 5.92 million rate this year, and said prices will probably ease by 1.7 percent, to a median price of $218,200.
 The positive trade figures came a week ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates and may buttress hope that spillover from crises in the housing and credit markets is limited and the central bank needs to lower the benchmark federal funds rate by only a quarter of a percentage point, Mr. Kubarych added.
 Aided by a weak dollar and overseas economic growth, exports increased 2.7 percent in July, to $137.7 billion. It was the fifth consecutive monthly gain. Exports are up 11.3 percent for the year to date, compared with the period in 2006.
 ''The export story, with the strong global economy impacting the U.S. economy, has been a positive trend for the last year or two,'' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
 High oil prices in July helped push total imports to $196.9 billion, up 1.8 percent from June. The average price for imported crude oil in July was $65.56 a barrel. Imports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a record $14.8 billion in July.
 Total imports rose 4.2 percent in the first seven months of 2007, compared with an 11.3 percent gain for exports.
 The faster growth in exports over imports ''suggests a slowing economy,'' said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. ''But the data may add some support to the view that the economy may be slowing but it is not heading into a recession,'' Mr. Kumar added.

HEADLINE: Shopping Centers Begin to Feel Ripples of Housing's Ills

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Not long after the dot-com industry collapsed a few years ago, retailing became the hottest sector in commercial real estate. Online shopping was no longer viewed as a threat to bricks-and-mortar stores, and rising housing values made it easy for people to borrow more money -- and spend it. Shopping centers began changing hands at ever-escalating prices. 
 Two years ago, retail real estate began losing some of its allure for investors as the condo conversion craze took over. More recently, investors have gravitated toward office buildings and hotels.
 Now many people in the retail real estate industry are bracing themselves for a slowdown in spending as the subprime mortgage crisis and the decline in housing values continue to send ripples through the economy. 
 And shopping centers have been caught in the credit squeeze that has transformed the capital markets. Private buyers, who were once able to finance 95 percent or more of the cost of a transaction, are being driven out of the market because such high leverage is no longer available. 
 According to investors, brokers and analysts, deals are taking longer to complete, and prices -- at least for the second- and third-tier properties -- are declining by as much as 10 percent.
 ''What we have seen is a lull in the market, what you might call the calm before the storm,'' said Fritz McPhail, the owner of Blue Ridge Capital, an Atlanta real estate company that specializes in acquiring troubled strip malls. ''We are seeing prices change. We are seeing deals blow up. People are calling us back a second time to see if we want to consider another offer.''
 About 80 percent of the choice regional malls in the best locations are owned by publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Not surprisingly, they are expected to withstand the credit squeeze better than older shopping centers in less desirable settings.
 But even top mall operators are being affected by the tightening lending standards.
 Two real estate investment trusts, the Simon Property Group and Macerich, agreed this year to sell three malls they have jointly owned for nearly a decade -- Lindale Mall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; NorthPark Mall in Davenport, Iowa; and SouthPark Mall in Moline, Ill. -- to a private company that relies on a high degree of leverage. But the buyer was unable to complete the deal. 
 The current debt market could be an obstacle for the Pyramid Companies, the owner of 20 shopping centers in New York State and Massachusetts, including Palisades Center in West Nyack, N.Y. 
 The company announced in April that it was exploring ''strategic alternatives,'' including a sale. Publicly traded companies, which limit the leverage they use to 60 percent, are not likely to be interested in Pyramid because most of the company's properties -- unlike the Palisades Center -- are in ''low-growth or negative-growth markets,'' said Arthur M. Coppola, the chief executive of Macerich. 
 While demand for space remains strong at the high-end regional malls, the average vacancy rate at strip malls, which are generally anchored by supermarkets, has been creeping up for more than two years, even though relatively little new space has been developed, according to Sam Chandan, the chief economist for Reis, a New York research company. 
 Mr. Chandan said the vacancy rate stood at 7.3 percent at the end of June and was expected to rise to 7.6 percent by the end of the year, its highest level since 1995.
 In the second half of the year, he said, about 26.2 million square feet in strip malls will be completed, which would contribute to an oversupply. ''That's the highest level of completions we've seen in many years, and it coincides with the slowdown in the underlying drive for space,'' he said.
 The strip mall vacancy rate has accelerated sharply in some metropolitan areas, including Trenton, Dallas and Oakland, Calif., according to Abigail Marks, an economist at Torto Wheaton Research, a Boston company owned by CB Richard Ellis. 
 In metropolitan areas with strong population growth, like Phoenix and Orange County, Calif., new shopping centers are easily attracting tenants, according to a report by the CoStar Group, a research company in Bethesda, Md. But new centers in several other metropolitan areas -- Memphis, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Tucson, SouthwestFlorida and Nashville -- are having trouble leasing space, CoStar said. 
 And retail chains are closing stores faster than they did in 2005 and 2006. During the first half of this year, Merrill Lynch counted 6,126 closings, an 11 percent increase over the period a year earlier. Store closings are not necessarily bad news for shopping center operators, who are often able to find a new tenant for a space at higher rent.
 Many retail specialists draw a distinction between shopping centers that cater to lower-income shoppers, who are more likely to lose their homes through foreclosure, and centers that serve more affluent customers. ''The upscale mall guys, while not completely insulated, should be better than the lower end,'' said Steve Sakwa, Merrill Lynch's analyst for real estate investment trusts. ''I don't think the credit crunch is really killing the people of Boca Raton.''
 Donald C. Wood, the chief executive of Federal Realty Investment Trust, a Rockville, Md., company that specializes in strip malls in inner-ring suburbs, where there is little land to be developed by competitors, said his company had not experienced an increase in vacancies. The future is likely to be less rosy for property owners in areas ''with less people, with less money and less barriers to entry,'' he said.
 Similarly, retail space in New York and other densely populated cities has continued to command high prices because ''you can't build very much of it,'' said Robert M. White Jr., the chief executive of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm. 
 With some big-box retailers like Home Depot reporting declining sales, shopping centers with such stores, known in the industry as power centers, may take a bigger hit than those whose tenants sell food and other necessities. ''The power centers are seeing the impact directly,'' said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. ''There may be a perception that power centers are riskier than they had been.''
 Like residential mortgages, commercial mortgages are pooled, sorted into risk categories and sold as bonds. 
 In the past several weeks, demand for these bonds has weakened, with investors demanding to be paid more for the risk. As a result, said Pete Bethea, a principal at Burnham Real Estate, a brokerage firm in San Diego, lenders are changing the terms of deals. ''Even if people thought they had their deal locked, there's no such thing,'' he said. 
 Small-scale investors are being shut out, Mr. White of the New York research firm said. ''The trouble in the debt market is having an immediate impact on them,'' he said. 
 As buyers are required to use more of their own equity, prices could fall as much as 15 percent but are not likely to slide much further, said Matthew Ostrower, a senior analyst for real estate investment trusts at Morgan Stanley. He said private equity funds had raised tens of millions of dollars to spend on real estate but were waiting for the gap to narrow between what sellers are asking and what they are willing to pay. ''Where that price is will be the collective decision of all these buyers,'' he said.

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Chancellor Angela Merkel seems to have realized that, contrary to the song lyrics, sometimes it's quite easy being green.
 Mrs. Merkel has shied away from the biggest fight at home: the deep economic restructuring she advocated during her campaign two years ago. And on the matter of the suspected terrorist plot in the heart of Germany, she has remained in the background, apparently happy to cede the limelight to her interior minister, Wolfgang Schauble.
 But in the past month Mrs. Merkel could be found inspecting glaciers in Greenland and calling for new measures to combat global warming at a conference in Kyoto, Japan. It was as if Ronald Reagan had turned into Al Gore after being elected. But the voters loved it, awarding her the highest approval ratings any chancellor has enjoyed since World War II. 
 ''She has learned her lesson,'' said Josef Joffe, the publisher and editor of the weekly paper Die Zeit. ''No more of this neoliberal stuff, no more blood, sweat and tears, no more change.'' 
 Germans seem happy with their plain-spoken physicist-turned-politician. Mrs. Merkel may lack the flamboyance of her new French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has stolen some of her thunder on the international stage, with his post-election flurry of activity. But that seems to play well here.
 ''She doesn't have to make her hands dirty in things that are in critical discussion in Germany, like terrorism and surveillance,'' said Paul Nolte, a professor of contemporary history at Free University of Berlin. And terrorism is not the winning electoral issue in Germany that it can be in the United States -- privacy concerns mean that it can cut both ways. 
 Mrs. Merkel's political instincts appear much sharper than anyone gave her credit for after she barely scraped into office. In the weeks leading to the election that brought her to power in 2005, Mrs. Merkel appeared poised for a solid victory -- at one stage leading by 17 percentage points.
 Instead she eked out a razor-thin margin that forced her into an unwieldy alliance of historic rivals, the so-called ''grand coalition'' of the center-right Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats. That was the day most observers pronounced any radical change for the employment laws, health system and pensions dead on arrival.
 ''They don't have balance of power,'' said John C. Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany now working as a banker in Berlin. ''They have mutual paralysis of power, and they want it that way.'' 
 At heart, local analysts said, the German people did not really want aggressive reforms. They were more than content to let the state care for them, from kindergarten all the way to retirement. 
 ''Maybe people in her own party don't like it, but it's a reality that when we ask, the majority really wants to have a socialistic way of life here in Germany,'' said Reinhard Schlinkert, the chairman of Dimap, a polling firm in Bonn. ''They have not been trained for the last 20 or 30 years to take responsibility for their own lives.'' 
 Mrs. Merkel turned a weak hand into a winning one, governing in the center and leaving well enough alone with an economy on the rise. The rise of global warming as a popular mainstream political issue played to her strength as a scientist but also her experience as a politician. She was minister of the environment from 1994 to 1998 and the German delegate when the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated and drafted. 
 ''She's really motivated,'' said Ulrich Wilhelm, the chancellor's spokesman. ''She shared the views of the scientists already in the late '90s that there is a strong man-made cause and that it can also be altered by a change in human behavior.''
 Mrs. Merkel has also benefited from the resurgence of the German economy, which grew 2.9 percent last year. That is hardly scorching growth for China or India, but for a country that had not grown faster than 1.2 percent in any of the previous five years, it was terrific. 
 Most important to national sentiment here is the ever improving job market. The unemployment rate has dropped to 9 percent, from 12 percent in 2005, the year Mrs. Merkel came to power. Most analysts attribute the jump at least in part to the controversial overhaul of the labor market led by her predecessor, Gerhard Schroder.
 Each summer, the ruling coalition retreats to discuss the agenda for the coming session of Parliament. This summer Mrs. Merkel sounded the ultimate pragmatist's note when she said her goal for the Parliament was ''to do what is doable.'' But she also sounded like the opposite of the small-government Thatcherite that she was sometimes called during the campaign. ''We don't want to leave anyone behind,'' she said.
 Some economists worry that the relatively modest labor market changes have fallen far short of what the German economy needs to assure its long-term competitiveness, and that the government might be well advised to use this time of prosperity to tackle the tough issues. Instead, the long-awaited recovery has led to relief and perhaps even a little complacency.
 Hobbled as Mrs. Merkel appeared at the very outset by the coalition government, few observers could have predicted her current success. She enjoys sky-high approval ratings -- 70 percent or higher in multiple recent surveys. Another recent poll found her trouncing her chief rival, the Social Democrat Kurt Beck, by 42 percentage points. 
 But the poll presumes a direct election for chancellor, which is not the case in Germany. The national election battle set for two years from now plays out instead among the political parties for seats in Parliament. Those polls for the moment show a continued deadlock among the major parties. The much maligned Mr. Beck could be long gone, and popularity for politicians, even Mrs. Merkel, can be a fickle thing.

HEADLINE: Confidence in a Rate Cut Feeds a Rally

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rose sharply yesterday as investors grew more confident that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates next week, even after its chairman gave no clues about the central bank's intentions. The Dow Jones industrials rose 180 points.
 Traders had been hoping the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, would give some indication during a speech to the Bundesbank, the German central bank, about the Fed's next move. 
 Wall Street is looking for a rate cut to help bolster the United States economy and ease problems caused by tightening credit availability.
 Instead, Mr. Bernanke talked about the need for countries around the globe to cooperate toward economic stability. He said ''global imbalances'' occur when countries run up trade deficits or produce big trade surpluses.
 ''Bernanke didn't really say anything about interest rates, but at this point the feeling on Wall Street is that it's mandatory,'' said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist of Weeden & Company, speaking about a rate cut. ''At this point, the market is pricing in not just one rate cut, but a couple, and that's helping to stabilize stocks.''
 Investors nervous that the United States economy will slip into recession got a bit of relief from the Commerce Department's report on the trade deficit. The trade gap narrowed modestly in July to $59.2 billion, from $59.4 billion in June.
 The Dow rose 180.54 points, or 1.38 percent, to 13,308.39.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.79 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,471.49, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 38.36 points, or 1.50 percent, to 2,597.47. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 12.46 points, or 1.62 percent, at 782.27.
 Bonds fell as investors withdrew money to buy stocks, pushing the 10-year Treasury note's yield up to 4.37 percent from 4.32 percent late Monday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 12/32, to 103 1/32.
 The Nasdaq got a boost from ImClone Systems, which along with Bristol-Myers Squibb said the drug Erbitux had been shown to improve the survival rate of patients with late-stage lung cancer. ImClone soared $6.97, or 18.4 percent, to $44.90. Bristol-Myers rose 23 cents, to $28.23.
 The Dow, meanwhile, benefited from strong gains in McDonald's shares, which rose $1.64, or 3.3 percent, to $51.79. The company, one of the 30 that make up the Dow, reported that global sales at restaurants open at least a year had risen 8.1 percent in August.
 Boeing also helped the blue chips advance after it was awarded a $1.1 billion Air Force contract. Shares picked up $2.16, or 2.3 percent, to $97.49.
 General Motors rose $1.33, or 4.6 percent, to $30.54 as investors got a glimpse of new models at the Frankfurt auto show.
 Crude oil rose 74 cents, to $78.23, after OPEC agreed to raise its crude output by 500,000 barrels a day to calm markets unnerved by high energy prices and worried that supplies could grow tight by the end of the year. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about two to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 2.97 billion shares, compared with 2.87 billion on Monday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: A Warning From Bernanke, but No Hint of a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and EDMUND L. ANDREWS. 
Carter Dougherty reported from Berlin and Edmund L. Andrews from Washington.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Sept. 11 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Tuesday that a high savings rate among oil-producing nations and Asian countries continued to help depress interest rates by keeping financial markets flush with cash. 
 But Mr. Bernanke warned against banking on the steady flow of cheap money -- which helped stoke overly lax mortgage lending and the recently punctured housing bubble -- over the long term.
 Speaking in Berlin at a conference sponsored by Germany's central bank, Mr. Bernanke conspicuously avoided the topics that have fixated investors lately: the turmoil in credit markets, the risk of an American recession or the Fed's readiness to lower interest rates at its policy meeting next week. 
 Instead, he gave an almost academic discourse about global trade imbalances and his theory that a ''global savings glut,'' concentrated in the world's poorer countries, had helped keep interest rates low and contributed to the United States' high rate of foreign indebtedness. 
 It was not clear whether the Fed chairman wanted to project a sense of calm ahead of the rate-setting meeting or whether he wanted to avoid sending any false signals on a decision over which Fed officials have differing views.
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told reporters that the credit squeeze and the housing downturn would impose a ''penalty'' on American economic growth. But Mr. Paulson noted American exports had climbed sharply, thanks to strong global economic growth. 
 ''The positive is that the capital markets turmoil is taking place against the backdrop of a very strong global economy,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, to $59.2 billion from an upwardly revised estimate of $59.4 billion in June.
 Wall Street had little obvious reaction to Mr. Bernanke's speech, though stock prices climbed gradually throughout the day, apparently on expectations that the central bank would lower the overnight federal funds rate at least one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent, at its meeting next week. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 1.38 percent, at 13,308.39. 
 The real debate among investors is whether the Fed will cut rates more deeply -- by a half percentage point -- and what clues policy makers will offer about additional cuts before the end of the year.
 Mr. Bernanke did not touch on those issues on Tuesday. But he did caution that the flood of cheap capital from abroad was likely to taper off in the decades ahead, possibly leading to higher interest rates, as countries like China save less and consume more.
 ''The logic of the global savings glut suggests that, as the glut dissipates over the next few decades and thereby reduces the net supply of financial capital from emerging market countries, real interest rates should rise,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke coined the phrase ''global savings glut'' in 2005 to explain the historically peculiar phenomenon of an industrialized world awash in cash from developing countries.
 Some economists now believe that the flood of foreign money, some of it from investors seeking higher yields in the United States, contributed to the speculative bubble in housing prices and the explosive growth in high-risk mortgages that helped finance it. Others contend that the Federal Reserve played a major role as well, by cutting short-term interest rates to rock-bottom lows after the stock market's fall in 2000 and the recession in 2001.
 Mr. Bernanke cautioned that the United States current-accounts deficit was unsustainable over the long term and that the eventual adjustment could prove disruptive.
 Before his speech, Mr. Bernanke met with Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the American mortgage market crisis and the need for greater market transparency. Several German banks have had to be rescued in recent weeks as a result of their losses on American mortgage-backed securities. 
 European policy makers struck a largely upbeat tone on Tuesday, saying the European economy could weather the storm. 
 ''It is important to remark that credit losses were not significant enough to materially impact the soundness of core financial institutions,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, told the European Parliament.
 Partly in response to the turbulence in credit markets, the European Central Bank decided last week to leave interest rates unchanged rather than lifting them as previously planned.
 The European Commission, in a new report on Tuesday, predicted that the European economy would continue to expand at a healthy pace but warned that the turmoil in financial markets had ''tilted the balance of risks clearly to the downside.''
 The forecast said the 13-nation euro area would expand 2.5 percent in 2007, down from a prediction of 2.6 percent earlier this year. The full 27-nation European Union will grow by 2.8 percent instead of 2.9 percent, it said. It also revised its forecast for inflation slightly upward.

HEADLINE: Fund Chief At Harvard Will Depart

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The manager of Harvard's endowment fund for almost two years, Mohamed A. El-Erian, announced unexpectedly yesterday that he was leaving to return to the Pacific Investment Management Company, where he had worked for seven years.
 In a long, if cryptic, statement, Mr. El-Erian said that he was returning to Southern California at the end of the year to be ''closer to our family.'' His wife and young daughter moved to Boston with him when he joined Harvard. He declined to comment further yesterday.
At Pimco, Mr. El-Erian, 49, will step into the newly created position of managing director, co-chief executive and co-chief investment officer in January. In that post he will join the founder, William H. Gross, 63, and the chief executive and chief investment officer, William S. Thompson Jr., 62, as a member of the senior management team. 
 When he left for Harvard, Mr. El-Erian had been managing director and senior portfolio manager, overseeing the $28 billion emerging markets bond fund. He will have broader responsibilities in his new role. But Pimco said in a statement that neither Mr. Gross nor Mr. Thompson planned to step down. 
 Mr. Gross's statement was particularly enthusiastic about Mr. El-Erian's return. ''I am ecstatic,'' he said. ''to have him join Bill Thompson and me.''
 Pimco manages more than $690 billion, which includes the $103 billion Pimco Total Return bond fund.
 The news surprised Harvard insiders and fund managers alike. Winning the plum job as head of the Harvard Management Company, the nation's largest university endowment, had been considered a coup for Mr. El-Erian in October 2005. Harvard officials said at the time that he was chosen because his broad views on global economies would be useful in managing a diverse portfolio.
 Moreover just last month, Harvard reported its results for fiscal 2007, ended June 30. The endowment had a 23 percent return, which took the fund's total to $34.9 billion. That was considered a strong performance, particularly because the size of the endowment presents unusual challenges and because Mr. El-Erian had to rebuild much of the fund's team after the former head, Jack R. Meyer, took several people with him when he left to start a hedge fund, Convexity Capital Management. 
 Certainly Mr. El-Erian's abrupt announcement will raise questions about his decision to leave. 
 At Pimco, Mr. El-Erian made tens of millions, according to several people who know him. Though he was only at Harvard for half of fiscal 2006, he earned $2.3 million. The fiscal 2007 figures are not yet available. 
 An associate who did not want to be identified because he had not been authorized to discuss the matter said yesterday that Mr. El-Erian's wife and daughter were not happy in Boston. 
 Jay O. Light, dean of the Harvard Business School and a board member of the Harvard Management Company, said that he had known of Mr. El-Erian's plan for several weeks and that ''Mohamed has been thinking about this long and hard.'' 
 Mr. Light said that Mr. El-Erian ''has done a great job of building the internal and external platforms; I think he has put in place great people.'' 
 Harvard's performance was crucial in August, a tumultuous month for the markets, because it had an investment in Sowood Capital Management, a hedge fund that lost half its value. Under Mr. Meyer, Harvard had invested $500 million in 2004.
 Despite the Sowood loss, which cost Harvard $350 million, the endowment was up marginally in July. A money manager close to Harvard said that some people were concerned that Mr. El-Erian had not seen the Sowood losses coming, especially since it involved bonds, which is his area of expertise. But Mr. Light said, in relation to Mr. El-Erian's record that ''Sowood was a nonevent.'' 
 And Byron Wien, chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management and a Harvard alumnus contributor and fund-raiser, said: ''In my encounters with Mohamed I was very impressed with his breadth of insight into what was going on in the world and its impact on the financial markets.'' 
 Certainly more instability is not welcome news at Harvard, which faces the challenge of finding another leader for the management company. Mr. Meyer left in 2005 after 15 years, partly out of exasperation over criticism of a compensation program that paid some of his top managers $17 million or more. 
 Finding a leader with enough experience who is willing to work for less than the huge pay that one can make on Wall Street is not easy. And it could mean restructuring much of the management team again if a newcomer has an approach that differs from Mr. El-Erian's. 
 Already yesterday there was speculation about the successor. One name mentioned was Steve Galbraith of Maverick Capital, who was mentioned during the last search. He could not be reached for comment yesterday. 
 Still Mr. Light sounded positive. ''We are in good shape,'' he said. ''There is no doubt about it. The numbers are clear.''

HEADLINE: Synagogue Window Returns for Rosh Hashana

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Amy Milford said seven words''When we reopen, unbelievably, on Dec. 2''-- and then let the sentence trail off.
 The word ''unbelievably'' referred to an undertaking that began in the 1980s and moved one step closer to completion yesterday -- the restoration of the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side. Ms. Milford is the deputy director of the Eldridge Street Project, the nonprofit, nonsectarian cultural organization responsible for the $16 million restoration.
 As she stood on a wooden construction platform inside the 120-year-old temple, glass workers were busy reinstalling the 15-foot-wide rose window over the entrance, on Eldridge Street a few steps south of Canal Street. 
 The window returned to the synagogue just in time for Rosh Hashana. What with all the scaffolding and construction equipment, the services celebrating the Jewish New Year will be held downstairs, as they have been for some years. And once the restoration is complete, said Bonnie Dimon, the director of the Eldridge Street Project, there will be daily tours, art exhibitions and cultural programs.
 The temple, which dates to 1887, now has a tiny congregation, but it has played a vital role in the history of Jewish life in America. It was a spiritual home for thousands of Jews who emigrated from Eastern Europe and worshiped there after settling on the Lower East Side. 
 Over the years, as their descendants moved away and Chinatown pushed closer to the temple, the congregation dwindled and the building deteriorated. Water pouring through the roof had damaged the murals and the wooden benches in the sanctuary. Jeffrey Greene, who has overseen the repainting, said that pigeons fluttered overhead. Outside, time had darkened the tannish brick of the facade.
 The reinstallation of the rose window was less dramatic than the first phase of the restoration, when workers found a long-lost skeleton in a coal ash pile in the basement. There was speculation at the time that the skeleton had been there for more than 30 years.
 The rose window and the stained-glass windows along the sides of the sanctuary were taken out in the 1980s. The glass was dirty and broken in places. 
 But the lead framework that held the glass in place was in worse shape, said Raymond Clagnan, a second-generation stained-glass artisan who has worked on the restoration. The lead had softened over the years, he said, and pieces of the glass had fallen out.
 Mr. Clagnan said the 80 windows in the synagogue held thousands of pieces of glass. He marveled that they were made with only 12 colors, reflecting an economy of design that belied the thrilling result. 
 ''It was very thought out,'' he said.
 The restoration of the rose window was also carefully thought out. He and his colleagues at the Gil Studio in Brooklyn washed each of the glass panels in a shallow tank. Then they re-leaded the windows and, yesterday, began putting them back in place.
 At the opposite end of the sanctuary, glass bricks fill the space once occupied by a second rose window. ''We know there was a hurricane in 1938, and we know the congregation had to replace that window then,'' Ms. Milford said.
 She said the design for its replacement was still in the planning stage. She said it would probably carry two dates -- 5648, for when the synagogue opened, and 5768, for when the restoration was completed.
 She also finished that sentence about the reopening in December, saying the completed building would reflect the ''culture and tradition of Eastern European Jews while remaining responsive to the fact that there's been a sea change in the neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: In Battered New Orleans, a Cop Show Comes Calling

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
On a typically saunalike September night, a raucous party was spilling onto a crowded Bourbon Street. 
 The party had familiar elements, like alcohol and football spirit. Many of the revelers lining the slick, wet street were dressed in team colors. Standing around the entrance of the Bourbon Orleans Hotel, they were toasting the arrival of a tall quarterback with short dreadlocks.
 But the dreadlocks were a wig, the streets had been slicked with a hose, the team colors were all wrong (University of Oregon fans in red, not green?) and that quarterback was an actor. Everything under the hot lights arrayed along Bourbon Street was designed for a scene in ''K-Ville,'' a new television show that is to have its premiere on Monday night on Fox. That's ''K'' as in ''Katrina,'' and the series, while framed in the familiar trappings of a police drama, is very much about the city that was devastated by the hurricane two years ago. 
 For a town still fighting an impression of hopelessness, the arrival of a big-time network television show has been both welcome and somewhat anxiety inducing. It has meant a significant boost to the local economy, plenty of new employment and a chance for New Orleans to reclaim some attention from a nation that seems to have moved on to other concerns.
 But it also means scenes built around abandoned homes, glimpses of still-present piles of debris and story lines that inevitably focus on crime: something that New Orleans continues to have in abundance. The night before the party scene was filmed on Bourbon Street, the real police reported six murders in the city.
 Jennifer Day, the director of the city's office of film and video, addressed the City Council here last week and responded to concerns about what message the series might send. ''Some people said: 'They're going to show devastation. They're going to show crime and negative aspects of the city,' '' Ms. Day said. 
 Some residents are uncomfortable with smaller liberties that the show is taking. One quibble many people mentioned was the title. Nobody here calls New Orleans ''K-Ville.'' The show's creator, Jonathan Lisco, who said he based the title on graffiti he saw, doesn't dispute that. ''It's not a name the community uses,'' he said.
 But city officials have shrugged off the show's title. Ms. Day praised Mr. Lisco and Fox for their commitment to giving New Orleans a chance to show that the city has come back.
 ''You can't deny that the locations are spectacular,'' she said. ''This is what I tell people. For every damaged neighborhood that they show, they also show a luxurious hotel, the beautiful trees and the French Quarter. What I said to the City Council was: It's TV. We all need to take a deep breath. They're showing the good aspects as well. The good definitely outweighs the bad, and we all need to give it a chance. Landing a series like this is the opportunity of a lifetime.''
 Partly for verisimilitude -- because, producers said, no set could ever really look like New Orleans -- and partly because Peter Liguori, the chairman of Fox Entertainment, is a personal advocate for the show, the network is taking the unusual step of shooting entirely on location.
 The stars, Anthony Anderson and Cole Hauser, have taken up residence here, as has the onsite producer, Kelly Manners. ''I brought my wife, my dog, my two cats and moved in,'' Mr. Manners said. Another actor, John Carroll Lynch, spends his days off volunteering with a reconstruction group. ''I've worked on two little houses so far,'' he said.
 Mr. Anderson said the production had been ''welcomed with open arms,'' adding, ''I've never witnessed such spirit as I've seen here.'' He noted that his makeup artist, a native of New Orleans, had only been able to return to the city with her family after she got the job with ''K-Ville.''
 Employment and other economic benefits are at the heart of that welcome. Ms. Day said that 80 percent of the crew on the show is local. ''It takes eight days to film an episode,'' she said. ''Over that eight days a little more than a million dollars is pumped into the local economy.'' 
 For New Orleans, show business is serious business. Several theatrical films have shot in the city this year, including ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Entertainment projects have generated more than $100 million for the city in 2007.
 ''We're looking to diversify beyond tourism,'' said David Bowser, manager of communications in the mayor's office. ''This is a big area for us.''
 The idea for ''K-Ville'' started with Mr. Liguori. ''New Orleans is a very colorful place,'' he said. ''It's run by its own set of rules, and you have the process of rebuilding a city. That's all great fodder for storytelling.'' 
 Mr. Liguori contacted Mr. Lisco, a writer who had created a previous pilot for Fox. Mr. Liguori suggested the idea in a simple phrase: ''Cop show, New Orleans.'' Mr. Lisco, intrigued, visited the city for research, riding along with a police SWAT team.
 All that he encountered -- the abandoned homes in the Ninth Ward, the resumption of fast-lane action on Bourbon Street, what he called ''very aggressive, adrenaline-pumping cop work'' and even murmurings about police corruption -- convinced him ''there was a good stew to work with.''
 The show's two main characters, both flawed policemen, are overt symbols of the city. Mr. Anderson's character was abandoned by his partner during the hurricane. Mr. Hauser plays a criminal-turned-cop trying to remake his life. ''New Orleans is not just a location. It's a character,'' Mr. Hauser said, echoing a sentiment voiced by almost everyone involved in the show.
 When the crew arrived to shoot the pilot in March, the conditions were considerably grimmer than they are now. Mr. Anderson said it was disheartening to come to New Orleans and see it still looked ''like a war zone.'' 
 But, he emphasized, the show was not ''picking on the city.''
 ''It's not about Katrina,'' he said. ''Katrina is the backdrop. It informs the relationships and informs the situation.''
 Mr. Liguori said he hoped ''K-Ville'' would be ''gritty and authentic.'' But Fox doesn't want the show to focus too heavily on the harsher realities. Mr. Lisco said he had ''gotten messages'' from the network and the production studio that the stories could not be too negative, something he said he understood ''from a marketing standpoint.'' 
 In his opinion, ''the aggregate effect is very positive for the city,'' he said. ''I worry more as a creator about ignoring the problems that exist in New Orleans.''
 Ms. Day, who rode out the storm and its aftermath first in Atlanta and then Chicago, said she had wondered how the show would affect her. ''I asked myself: Am I going to like this? Or do I have to like it? I watched the pilot, and I have read some of the scripts. Some aspects of the stories are going to hit really close to home. There are aspects that are very real, and there are aspects that make you roll your eyes and giggle.''
 ''I talk about context,'' she added. ''This is a fictional television show. It's not a documentary. It's not going to tell a comprehensive story. It's a story line loosely created around the backdrop of a postdisaster community. New Orleans people should rootfor the show to work.''

HEADLINE: Euro Hits New High; Oil Nears $80 a Barrel

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The dollar fell to a new low point against the euro yesterday and oil prices surged to a record, suggesting that a weaker American economy would be accompanied by higher prices for energy and other imported products.
 As of late yesterday, the euro traded in New York at $1.3908, up from $1.3832 late Tuesday; the European common currency has risen 5.4 percent against the dollar so far this year and about 1 percent this week.
 Crude oil prices rose more than 2 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settling at $79.91 a barrel, after briefly trading above $80 -- a day after OPEC said that its members would increase production by a modest amount. 
 Taken together, these moves in the currency and commodities markets signaled more trouble for the American economy.
 Stock trading was light yesterday, and most indexes were modestly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended essentially flat, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined a little more than 0.1 percent. Nasdaq and smaller-capitalization stocks were lower. Treasuries were down slightly, and the yield on the 10-year note rose to 4.41 percent, from 4.37 percent on Tuesday. 
 Gold prices, little changed yesterday, have also surged in recent days as fears of an economic decline mounted and the dollar weakened. Gold futures are up 5.7 percent so far this month, to $714 an ounce in New York.
 Though the dollar has been falling against other currencies for much of the year, it has weakened significantly since Friday, when government data showed that businesses reduced net employment by 4,000 in August and that job growth had been weaker in June and July than previously thought. 
 Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, when it meets on Tuesday. There is even talk of a cut as much as a half-point.
 Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign currency analyst at CMC Markets in New York, commented, ''The payroll report was seen as a macroeconomic justification.''
 Currencies are influenced by many factors, chief among them expectations for interest rates and inflation. If rates were to fall in the United States and remain unchanged in Europe, as many investors are expecting, traders will probably bid up the exchange value of euros. 
 ''The dollar is not in a great position,'' said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. ''The confidence level is eroding in the face of the credit market crisis, which is very much subprime related and mortgage market related. And it is now complicated by the fact that the real economy is slowing.''
 For much of the year, the dollar has also been falling against the British pound and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Japanese yen is up about 4 percent against the dollar so far in 2007, though it has lost some ground in the last few days.
 The weakening dollar has been a boon to exporters whose goods and services will become more competitive on the world market. 
 Exports have been among the brightest spots in the American economy this year, growing 11.4 percent in the first eight months from the corresponding period of 2006. By comparison, imports were up 4.6 percent.
 The depreciating dollar has made imports more expensive. Energy commodities are expected to be chief among these.
 Oil prices, already near records set two months ago, have surged anew. The decision on Tuesday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, a relatively small quantity when compared with total production, appeared to make little difference. 
 Yesterday, prices were also reacting to a government report that showed that crude oil inventories fell in the United States by 2.1 percent last week.
 More broadly and in the longer term, many analysts say that oil prices are poised to go higher because global demand for energy, led by China and India, is growing far faster than overall production, especially among oil producers that are not members of OPEC.
 ''The combination of robust long-term demand growth and lagging non-OPEC supply suggests that strong support for oil prices is set to remain a feature of the markets beyond 2010,'' Adam Sieminski, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research note.
 Those higher prices, along with the increase in the prices of other imports, will provide another source of worry for the American economy and consumers. It could also complicate the Fed's task, said Dustin Reid, a senior currency strategist at ABN Amro in Chicago. If inflation surges, policy makers would have a harder time justifying a big or prolonged series of rate cuts.
 ''At some point, you are going to have the potential of importing inflation from around the globe,'' Mr. Reid said. ''And that's likely to keep the Fed on guard.''

HEADLINE: Wailing The Losses After Katrina

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
Terence Blanchard's first set at the Jazz Standard on Tuesday started with his unaccompanied trumpet solo, orderly and open-ended. 
 Then the trumpet playing spilled into ''Fred Brown,'' a scrimmage of a tune, moving through different rhythms and band strategies as it tossed along. Mr. Blanchard's quintet was expanding its harmony on the fly, and making sudden room for the individual players' expression -- especially that of the pianist Fabian Almazan, a young Cuban who has recently joined the band. He found his own area of serenity in the music, making a choosy, minimal improvisation, all of it sounding like something that could be sung. 
 What followed couldn't have been more different. It was music from Mr. Blanchard's new record, ''A Tale of God's Will (A Requiem for Katrina),'' which grew out of the slow, sad themes he composed for ''When the Levees Broke,'' Spike Lee's film about Hurricane Katrina's devastation of New Orleans. Though Mr. Blanchard expanded the film's music to make the album, it still sounds like a soundtrack, geared toward dislodging particular emotions. 
 In the film, sentimental music complements brutal images, almost softening the blow. On the record, without visuals, the sentimentality grows too rich. And in a club, with the slow music backed by orchestral sound-washes cued from a digital sampler, the music seemed twice removed from its initial function.
 The band -- also including the saxophonist Brice Winston, the bassist Derrick Hodge and the drummer Kendrick Scott -- played two of the record's longer pieces, ''In Time of Need'' and ''Ashe.'' These were about loss and the confusion that follows it, but in their sweep they finally felt almost impersonal.
 This is an excellent band, though, and a few judicious performances shined through. ''Ashe,'' in particular, was buoyed once by Mr. Almazan, who put a sensitive touch and modern classical harmonies in the service of the tune, and again by Mr. Blanchard, who played a bright, lyrical solo elegant and flexible, and with a crucial economy of notes. 
 Performances by Terence Blanchard continue through Sunday at the Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan; (212) 576-2232 or jazzstandard.net.

HEADLINE: Why the Hungry Refuse Help

 BODY:
As many as 1.3 million New Yorkers, about one-quarter of them children, do not have enough to eat. These are precisely the people, many from working families, whom federal food stamps are supposed to help. But bureaucratic hassles imposed by the city may be discouraging hundreds of thousands of eligible New Yorkers from getting the help they need. 
 A study by the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit group that advocates for the poor, found that of 9,500 recipients surveyed, more than 5,800 had their benefits cut off within 20 months of enrollment. The vast majority remained eligible for food stamps, but, in most cases, they simply did not show up to get their aid renewed. Many said they could not deal with the paperwork and long waits, or get time away from work or children to reapply at a city office. 
 The city's Human Resources Administration, which manages the program, disputes the findings. Official statistics, however, show that something is seriously wrong with the program. While poverty levels in New York City remained fairly constant, the number of people receiving food stamps fell in July by nearly 7,000. That was the fourth decline in the last five months. 
 If the moral imperative to address hunger in the shadow of privilege isn't enough, the economics should be. By failing to maximize enrollment -- anti-hunger groups say about 500,000 eligible people are not receiving food stamps -- the city is losing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from Washington. With fewer New Yorkers receiving the benefit, more are forced to turn to soup kitchens and other emergency food sites, which the city spends millions to support.
 Food stamp participation has increased under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but it had fallen significantly under his predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, who did all he could to discourage enrollment. Mr. Bloomberg listened to critics, and the city has streamlined the initial application process, expanded office hours and generally cut red tape. That's a good start.
 Now it's time for a more aggressive approach. Allowing reapplication by telephone would help. The mayor should also consider requiring recipients to reapply only every 12 months, which is the federal standard, rather than every six. Of course, applicants should continue to be carefully screened. Since most errors on benefits are the fault of city workers, not applicants, better training may be needed. The zeal to fight fraud should not push people deeper into hunger.

HEADLINE: Indexes Barely Budge, But Energy Shares Rise

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stock indexes ended little changed yesterday as a rise in oil prices lifted energy shares, but a disappointing forecast from Texas Instruments raised concerns about the technology sector's profit outlook. 
 Trading was light and volatile ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, when policy makers are expected to cut interest rates. 
 Investors are betting on a deep cut in the benchmark rate, according to the futures markets, but some economists say that the Fed could move more conservatively.
 Energy shares extended gains in afternoon trading, after crude oil for October delivery breached $80 a barrel for the first time before settling back at $79.91.
 The chip maker Texas Instruments was among the top drags on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after it was less enthusiastic about revenue prospects than other technology bellwethers, which have forecast robust demand.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 16.74 points, or 0.13 percent, at 13,291.65. The S.& P. 500 was up 0.07 point at 1,471.56. The Nasdaq composite index was down 5.40 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,592.07.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury notes traded down 11/32 in price, at 102 22/32, for a yield of 4.41 percent, versus 4.37 percent late Tuesday.
 After the close, McDonald's raised its annual dividend by 50 percent as part of a plan to return up to $17 billion to shareholders through 2009. Its shares advanced to $52.75 in extended trade after closing at $51.20.
 Also after the bell, shares of Target rose 2.5 percent, to $64.33, after the company, the big discount retailer, said it had hired an investment bank to advise it in a review of options for its credit card assets.
 During the regular session, shares of Texas Instruments fell 60 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $35.12, after it narrowed its target range for revenue in the third quarter late on Tuesday.
 Near-month oil prices gained $1.68, or 2.15 percent, to settle at $79.91 a barrel after earlier hitting $80.18. Government data showed United States crude inventories fell much more than expected last week, stoking concerns about supplies.
 Exxon Mobil advanced 0.8 percent, to $87.65, and was among the stocks giving the biggest lift to the S.& P.
 Shares of airlines, big users of fuel, fell. US Airways declined the most, shedding 4 percent to end at $29.89 a share.
 Some big manufacturers declined as well with oil's jump. Alcoa was down 1.6 percent, at $33.65.
 Among gainers, Apple. shares rose 1 percent, to $136.85, after UBS lifted its price target on the stock to $182 from $175, on expectations that many more products could be introduced in coming months. 
 UBS also raised its recommendation on Amgen, citing ''benign'' proceedings on the drug maker's anemia treatments at the Food and Drug Administration. Amgen shares rose 3.3 percent, to $55.64.
 Trading volume was well below average on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.29 billion shares changed hands. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about nine to seven.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Cash Rescues Draw Rebuke From Banker In Britain

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
In an unusual public display of discord, the British central bank criticized other central banks yesterday for injecting cash into the financial system to help stabilize credit markets, saying that such a policy amounted to a bailout of investors who made bad decisions. 
 Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, also hinted that the credit crisis could make further interest rate increases unnecessary -- if the recent sharp increase in borrowing costs ended up hurting consumer demand. That, he said, would reduce the prospects of inflation, despite the run-up in the prices of a wide variety of commodities, including crude oil and wheat. 
 The main thrust of his written testimony to Parliament, however, was a sharp warning about ''moral hazard'' -- a term used to describe the downside of policies that effectively rescue investors when their bets turn out wrong.
 ''The provision of such liquidity support undermines the efficient pricing of risk by providing ex-post insurance for risky behavior,'' Mr. King wrote. ''That encourages excessive risk-taking and sows the seeds of a future crisis.''
 Over the last month, as investors refused to buy securities backed by potentially shaky American mortgages, the world's central banks have stepped in to provide short-term lending capability to the financial system.
 The European Central Bank, which initiated the effort on Aug. 9, has added 250 billion euros ($348 billion) to the market, and yesterday it continued its effort by lending 75 billion euros ($104 billion) for three months. The Federal Reserve and the Japanese central bank have also added liquidity, and on Aug. 17 the Fed cut the rate at which it lends money directly to banks by a half-point.
 But the Bank of England has taken only a modest part in this effort, injecting $:4.4 billion ($8.9 billion) into the system since the crisis began a month ago. Instead, it has reminded banks that they can always borrow at a ''penalty rate'' of one percentage point above a benchmark rate that is now 5.25 percent -- a pointed message that those who speculate and lose have to pay some price.
 The British bank might be expected to be among the most concerned about the credit crisis because the British economy -- and particularly greater London -- depends heavily on a financial services industry that is now at the center of the storm.
 But some analysts maintain that the bank is relying on measures taken in the United States and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. To the extent that British banks need pounds sterling, this view has it, they can simply borrow in dollars or euros and convert them, freeing the Bank of England from the task and allowing it to occupy the moral high ground.
 ''The country that should have been most active,'' said Stephen Jen, global head of currency research at Morgan Stanley in London, ''has also been a free rider.''
 And since most of the mortgage-backed securities are denominated in dollars, the need to borrow in pounds will be limited, analysts said.
 Still, Mr. King has turned into the most prominent critic of those in the financial markets who have been clamoring for cheap money. Such market participants see more liquidity as the solution for investors who borrowed heavily to buy the securities that have lost value. But Mr. King's fear is that cheap money will encourage investors to create anew the kind of financial house of cards that is now tumbling down.
 ''If risk continues to be underpriced,'' he said, ''the next period of turmoil will be on an even bigger scale.''

HEADLINE: European Carmakers Bet That the U.S. Is Ready for Diesel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Sept. 12 

 BODY:
Two decades after diesel cars all but vanished from American roads in a cloud of sooty smoke, are Americans ready to give them another try?
 That is a big question at the Frankfurt Motor Show this week, as European carmakers roll out ''clean diesel'' vehicles -- their answer to the call for more efficient, climate-friendly cars. 
 Betting that diesel power will become an alternative to the hybrids popularized by Toyota and other Japanese carmakers, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen all plan to sell new diesel automobiles in the United States in the coming year, and many of them are on show here. 
 A lot of Americans recall diesel, circa 1983, as a dirty fuel that made cars noisy and hard to start on freezing winter mornings. But the technology, European car executives say, has advanced since then, with the latest generation of diesel engines virtually indistinguishable from gasoline engines in performance. They emit less carbon dioxide because they burn fuel more efficiently.
 ''We are well on the way to giving CO2 emissions the priority needed,'' the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Dieter Zetsche, said. 
 Europeans are experimenting with hybrids, too, but they no longer appear worried that Toyota and its Prius have cornered the market on climate consciousness -- in part, some here say, because drivers have become more aware of the virtues of diesel power and the limitations of hybrids.
 ''The first round was won by the Japanese, but we're getting closer,'' said Porsche's chairman, Wendelin Wiedeking, who no longer rules out the idea of some day producing a diesel Porsche. 
 Like most German executives, Mr. Wiedeking sees a place for both hybrid and diesel-powered vehicles. ''We have to confront hybrids,'' he said, noting that Porsche planned a hybrid version of its Cayenne sport utility vehicle. Americans will soon be able to choose from an array of German diesels: three Mercedes sport utility vehicles, and its E-class sedan; and several BMW models. Volkswagen, which has sold a diesel version of its Jetta in the United States for several years, plans to introduce a new Jetta with a cleaner engine, as well as a diesel version of its new compact S.U.V., the Tiguan.
 Its chairman, Martin Winterkorn, even mused about putting a diesel engine into the Phaeton, Volkswagen's flagship luxury sedan, whose gasoline version has never sold well in the United States.
 His lieutenant, Stefan Jacoby, the president of Volkswagen of America, said: ''The best way to convince customers is to let them drive the cars. Diesel is affordable, which hybrids are not.''
 Today, fewer than 3 percent of passenger vehicles in the United States are diesel, compared with more than 30 percent in Europe. Last year, more than half of all new cars sold in Europe were diesel-powered. In Britain, BMW said it increased the diesel share of its cars to 70 percent from 7 percent in three years.
 Given the Japanese lead in hybrids, some analysts say that the Europeans are making a virtue of necessity.
 ''This is what the Europeans have got,'' said Graeme Maxton, an independent auto analyst in Hong Kong. ''They don't have hybrids or hydrogen. This is their only card, so they're going to push it.''
 Mr. Maxton predicted that with a slowing economy and fragile consumer confidence in the United States, it would be an uphill struggle for the European companies to make major inroads with diesel now.
 But the Europeans are not the only ones pushing the technology. General Motors and Ford plan to sell more pickup trucks with diesel engines, and G.M. will produce a new diesel engine at a plant near Buffalo.
 Gregg Sherrill, chief executive of Tenneco, an auto parts company that supplies exhaust systems to American, European, and Japanese makers, said, ''Pickups will be one wedge to bring diesel back into the U.S., while the European carmakers will be the other.'' 
 Citing a survey commissioned by Tenneco, Mr. Sherrill said policy makers in the United States recognized the potential of diesel engines as a way to curb emissions, although they view hybrids as the No. 1 option.
 Much of the innovation in European diesel technology has been animated by the need to abide by tighter restrictions on emissions in the United States, particularly on nitrogen oxide, which contributes to urban smog and is viewed as a major drawback of diesel.
 German carmakers use a treatment process in the exhaust system that cuts nitrogen oxide emissions. Volkswagen calls its approach BlueMotion; Mercedes promotes BlueTec.
 Mercedes began selling its E-class cars with a BlueTec engine in the United States in 2006, but was hampered because it did not meet emissions standards in five states, including New York and California. Next year, the company said, it will be able to sell its diesel models in all 50 states.
 Mercedes executives said Americans would accept diesel engines as long as their performance matched that of gasoline engines. But in what may be an implicit acknowledgment that diesel power has some image problems, the cars will carry badges on their trunks saying BlueTec, not diesel.
 And in case ''clean diesel'' cannot overcome diesel's old reputation in the United States, Mercedes showed something here called DiesOtto -- a prototype of a hybrid gasoline-diesel engine that it says combines the best of both.

HEADLINE: Harvey Schultz, 66, Head Of Environmental Agency

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Harvey W. Schultz, New York City's commissioner of environmental protection during the last of Mayor Edward I. Koch's three terms, died in Brooklyn on Sept. 6. He was 66 and lived in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. 
 The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Nanette Rainone, said.
 Mr. Schultz was chosen to lead the Department of Environmental Protection in 1986. During his four years as commissioner he dealt with several major issues, including a federal ban on dumping sewage in the ocean; imposition of city restrictions on water use during a drought in 1989; and a 10-year program to install water meters in all residences. 
 He was also at the forefront of an unsuccessful 1987 proposal by Mr. Koch (similar to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's congestion-pricing plan) to reduce pollution in Manhattan by charging a $10-a-day fee on vehicles entering the borough below 59th Street.
 Earlier, Mr. Schultz held several senior positions in the City Planning Department: director of economic development, director of the Brooklyn office and director of land-use planning and environmental management. From 1977 through 1985, he was an executive assistant to Howard Golden, the Brooklyn borough president.
 Mr. Schultz was later president of a development company that built 7,500 homes in the Rockaways; a partner in several real estate consulting companies; and a senior partner with Muss Development, a real estate company.
 Born in Brooklyn on Nov. 12, 1940, Mr. Schultz was the son of Milton and Ruth Klein Schultz. In the 1960s, he earned an undergraduate degree in political science and then a master's degree in city planning, both at Hunter College.
 Besides his wife, Mr. Schultz is survived by his sister, Sharon Price; three sons, Jason, Matthew and Daniel; and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: In the Bronx, a Film School With a Down-to-the-Ghetto Name

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
It was in many ways a typical film-school scene. On a recent hot afternoon, a group of eager young students crowded around a big-time director, asking for advice about backlighting and the best way to establish a scene of anarchy.
 But the students quizzing David O. Russell, the director of ''Three Kings'' and ''I Huckabees,'' weren't enrolled at New York University or Columbia or any other august institution.
 They were from the Ghetto Film School, an unaccredited training program in the South Bronx that operates in the summer and on weekends during the school year. It gives teenagers a rigorous introduction to filmmaking and, despite the humblest of origins, has built up an enviable roster of Hollywood donors and supporters inside city government. Since early July the school's 19 students, ranging in age from 14 to 20, have been studying the likes of Antonioni and John Huston, running through camera exercises and working on six-minute films in two cramped classrooms in a city recreation center in Mott Haven, where the ceilings periodically thump with the sounds of the weight room directly overhead. 
 The school's ambitions, however, reach far beyond the ghetto. Tonight the students' work will be shown at Lincoln Center. And the school is opening a spacious annex near its original location, financed by a $1.2 million grant from the city. Ghetto Film is also working with the Department of Education to develop a cinema-themed high school that would join the elite ranks of specialized schools like the La Guardia High School for the arts.
 The heart of the Ghetto Film School is Joe Hall, 43, a former Bronx social worker who left for Los Angeles in 1999 to follow his cinematic dreams. He enrolled in the graduate film program at the University of Southern California, but quickly became disillusioned: The students were almost all white and wealthy, and most had family connections to the movie business. The smart, talented children he knew from his social-work days, he said, seemed completely shut out of this world.
 ''I thought, 'We need to get the kids of the South Bronx into these places,' '' Mr. Hall said. 
 Returning to the Bronx, he opened the Ghetto Film School in a Hunts Point storefront in the summer of 2000. From the beginning his methods were contrarian. The school was in the impoverished and crime-scarred South Bronx, but students were admitted based on enthusiasm and aptitude, not economic need. 
 The origins of the school's name indicate the students' hunger to be challenged. When he was designing the course, Mr. Hall asked a group of neighborhood teenagers what they would want in a film school. 
 ''One said, 'I don't want to come into a place and find out someone is trying to raise my self-esteem,' '' Mr. Hall said. ''Another said, 'Yeah, it's not like we want a ghetto film school.' Everyone started laughing, and I thought, 'What if we could co-opt a negative term and throw it back out there, do the exact opposite?' ''
 Not everyone loves the name. ''It's sort of limiting,'' the director Jim Jarmusch said with a slight wince after his Ghetto Film lecture last month. But he added: ''It's not the name that attracted me. It's the fact that here's another place for new blood.'' 
 And the name does capture the street-smart pragmatism that the school encourages. ''We steal shots,'' said Alvy Johnson, a 24-year-old former student now in Columbia's graduate film program, referring to the practice of shooting without proper permits. ''That Ghetto Film guerrilla style, it pumps you up.'' 
 For the first few years the school operated as a summer course with a budget of up to $40,000. But after Mr. Russell found out about it through a chance encounter with a former Ghetto Film staff member, its fortunes changed. Intrigued, Mr. Russell joined the school's board and became its rainmaker.
 ''Everyone in Hollywood should tithe,'' Mr. Russell said. ''So I went around with a basket to the studio I was working with, and I got my filmmaker friends to be on the board.''
 Among those filmmaker friends who donate to Ghetto Film or lecture there are Spike Jonze, Harvey Weinstein, Sofia Coppola and Mr. Jarmusch. The school, a nonprofit, has expanded to operate year-round, with a budget of just under $1 million.
 Focused on narrative storytelling -- no documentaries allowed -- the Ghetto Film curriculum begins with an intensive nine-week summer course; students are paid a stipend of $500 through grants from the city and corporate sponsors. They return in the fall, on weekends and after school, to study the basic structure of the film industry. In the spring they collaborate on a short film, which is shot in foreign locations, to which they travel as a group. So far Ghetto Film trips have included Paris, Mexico City and Germany. 
 Students come from throughout the city, though the majority are from the Bronx. Most are minorities, and many are poor. At their session with Mr. Russell, they took turns delivering quick pitches for their six-minute movies. Most were typical teenage stories of romantic angst and family tensions. But others had harsher themes, like Theresa Dilworth's ''Reap the Reapers'' (gang violence), Brian Neris's ''Last Gift'' (police violence) and Nia Fields's ''Moments in Love,'' which features a self-performed abortion.
 And for some students, the idea of ghetto life is all too real. Ariel Morales, a 17-year-old who lives on the Lower East Side, said he wanted Ghetto Film to help lift him out of a cycle of poverty and crime. ''I just want to be successful and break that code that my family has,'' he said, ''the code of not going nowhere.''
 The long-term goal for the Ghetto Film School, Mr. Hall said, is to shepherd students from an early age through college and into a professional career. The school finds work for the students as interns or production assistants on films, and it has a production company for graduates, Digital Bodega. The city's $1.2 million grant will pay for professional-grade editing equipment for Digital Bodega at its new space, a loft in the southernmost tip of the Bronx.
 Ghetto Film already works with a nearby city school, the New Explorers High School for Film and Humanities, assisting faculty members and operating after-school programs. And if its proposal is accepted by the Department of Education, a cinema high school could open as early as 2009. 
 Planned for 600 students, the new institution would screen applicants according to academic criteria yet to be determined, Education Department officials said. Mr. Hall said that in addition to a core curriculum of standard academic subjects, the school would offer electives like screenwriting, film history and production. 
 The proposal has not yet been accepted, but Education officials say they have been working closely with Mr. Hall on the plan. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has promised to create more elite public schools, and several have already opened, though some critics say another specialized high school is not what the city's 1.1 million students most need.
 ''A cinema school would provide a more targeted, artistic-focused school that's in a discipline that we know is of interest to kids,'' said Garth Harries, who heads the Education Department's Office of New Schools. ''And we know that the partners, the Ghetto Film School folks, have a really strong track record of working on projects in the film industry, particularly with minority kids.''
 If the proposal is accepted and the school is created, Mr. Hall might remain as an adviser, but would not be its principal. Ghetto Film would remain a separate organization and continue to teach filmmaking to young people in the Bronx. 
 Part of its success in attracting donors and supporters, film executives say, is attributable to the industry's self-interest in making its talent pool more diverse. And Hollywood is always searching for new stories.
 ''There's a history of the ghetto producing things that seep into the popular culture,'' said Evan Shapiro, general manager of the Independent Film Channel and a board member of the school. ''That is what is represented at Ghetto Film School. There's something that the Bronx can give to the world.''

HEADLINE: Child Mortality at Record Low; Unicef Predicts Further Drop

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
For the first time since record keeping began in 1960, the number of deaths of young children around the world has fallen below 10 million a year, according to figures from the United Nations Children's Fund being released today.
 This public health triumph has arisen, Unicef officials said, partly from campaigns against measles, malaria and bottle-feeding, and partly from improvements in the economies of most of the world outside Africa. 
 The estimated drop, to 9.7 million deaths of children under 5, ''is a historic moment,'' said Ann M. Veneman, Unicef's executive director, noting that it shows progress toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goal of cutting the rate of infant mortality in 1990 by two-thirds by 2015. ''But there is no room for complacency. Most of these deaths are preventable, and the solutions are tried and tested.''
 Interestingly, Unicef officials said, the new estimate comes from household surveys done in 2005 or earlier, so they barely reflect the huge influx of money that has poured into third world health in the last few years from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Gates Foundation; and the Bush administration's twin programs to fight AIDS and malaria. For that reason, the next five-year survey should show even greater improvement, they said.
 ''We feel we're at a tipping point now,'' said Dr. Peter Salama, Unicef's chief medical officer. ''In a few years' time, it will all translate into a very exciting drop.''
 The most important advances, Unicef said, included these:
 Measles deaths have dropped 60 percent since 1999, thanks to vaccination drives.
 More women are breast-feeding rather than mixing formula or cereal with dirty water.
 More babies are sleeping under mosquito nets.
 More are getting Vitamin A drops.
 In 1960, about 20 million children died annually, but the drop since then has been steeper than 50 percent because the world population has grown. If babies were still dying at 1960 rates, 25 million would die this year.
 There are still wide disparities. The highest rates of child mortality are found in West and Central Africa, where more than 150 of every 1,000 children born will die before age 5. In the wealthy countries of North America, Western Europe and Japan, the average is about six.
 The most rapid progress has been made in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Central and Eastern Europe, and in East Asia and the Pacific. 
 Despite the improvement, two sets of countries have worsened, Unicef said: those in southern Africa that have been hit hardest by AIDS, and those that have been at war recently, like Congo and Sierra Leone.
 The improving economies of India and China have helped pull world figures upward. More girls are getting education and jobs, they marry later and they have fewer children, more of whom survive. 
 Also, because malnutrition is an underlying factor in 53 percent of all child deaths, anything that feeds children -- whether that means large-scale aid during famines or simply better seeds and fertilizer -- reduces deaths.
 Among countries that made particularly rapid progress since 2000 are the Dominican Republic, Vietnam and Morocco, which all cut child deaths by more than one-third. 
 Madagascar cut its deaths by 41 percent despite going to the brink of civil war in 2002, and Sao Tome and Principe managed to cut its deaths by 48 percent. 
 Domingos Ferreira, a minister counselor at Sao Tome and Principe's mission to the United Nations, was pleasantly surprised to learn that his country -- two islands in the crook of West Africa -- had bested the world. 
 He guessed that credit was due to a national antimalaria campaign that had drained swamps, sprayed houses and provided mosquito nets. ''Malaria used to be the first source of killing in our lives,'' he said. ''And now I hear that the hospital beds on Principe are empty for the first time.''
 In Madagascar, Dr. Salama said, the difference was Vitamin A drops, which drastically reduce the chances that a child will die of measles, diarrhea or malaria.
 In general, Ms. Veneman said, the countries that did best concentrated on extending simple measures to rural areas, and focusing on inexpensive prevention rather than expensive care. 
 Ethiopia, many of whose doctors and nurses emigrate, trained 30,000 community health workers for tasks like weighing babies, advising on breast-feeding, giving shots, testing for malaria and handing out mosquito nets.
 Success, Ms. Veneman said, ''is not just linked to money, it's linked to setting priorities.''

HEADLINE: A Home Loan Trap

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Homeowners whose loan rates are soaring may want to head for the exits. Many of them, though, will find no way out. If they sell their home or refinance, they will face a penalty of thousands of dollars for paying off their loans early. 
 Timm Larson is in just such a predicament. Two years ago, he refinanced his home outside Minneapolis with a loan at a low interest rate that has since risen sharply. The monthly payment is eating up nearly half of their family income of about $45,000 a year. 
 Mr. Larson wants to move into a traditional loan, but can't see how. He would have to pay the lender a $9,000 exit fee.
 ''We don't have any money,'' Mr. Larson said in a phone interview from his three-bedroom house in St. Francis, Minn. ''We are barely making our house payments.'' 
 According to the Center for Responsible Lending, these exit fees, called prepayment penalties, were added to more than two-thirds of the adjustable-rate loans. Those loans initially carry a very low interest rate, known as a teaser because it is below the market rate and rises sharply over time.
 The lenders say the trade-off is the only way to offer low monthly payments initially because otherwise borrowers would flee when rates adjust upward and make the loan a losing deal. The fees usually equal several months' interest, and they decline over a few years before disappearing altogether.
 Homeowners often think they can keep up with their rising payments or that they will simply refinance later. But the penalties can dash that hope, even if market conditions and their personal circumstances allow it. 
 Now state governments, regulators and members of Congress are considering whether to rein in prepayment penalties, as consumer advocates suggest. ''Borrowers should not be penalized for paying off their debt,'' said Ellen Harnick, senior policy counsel to the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group in Durham, N.C. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said this week that he would introduce legislation to eliminate the penalties and make other changes in home lending practices. 
 ''About 70 percent of subprime loans have costly prepayment penalties that trap borrowers in high-cost mortgages, mortgages that strip wealth rather than build it, and these penalties keep borrowers from shopping for a better deal,'' Senator Dodd said in a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee early this year. When interest rates were high in the 1970s, states took steps to protect consumers from onerous prepayment penalties. Such fees generally disappeared from standard loans. In the late 1990s, though, subprime loans to people with weak credit blossomed, and with those loans came a resurgence in prepayment penalties. 
 A number of states limit the penalties, but only state-regulated banks are generally subject to those restrictions; mortgage companies and national banks are not. 
 One state, Wisconsin, actually reversed course and allowed prepayment penalties by state-chartered institutions last year, just as the housing bubble was about to burst. Lenders contended that with lower initial payments, many more people would be able to afford homes and it would level the playing field among lenders.
 ''You want to give pause before banning prepayment penalties,'' said Kurt Pfotenhauer, senior vice president for government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''They save consumers' money by lowering their interest rates.''
 Mr. Larson and his wife would seem to be good candidates now for a traditional loan. They both have steady jobs: he trims trees, she waits tables. Their fateful refinancing was used to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt accumulated when they traveled to Thailand, his wife's native country, for their wedding. 
 The $205,000 loan, which the Larsons signed in February 2005, required them to pay only interest at first, or $11,400 a year, with the 5.6 percent rate to reset after two years. Mr. Larson knew there was a prepayment penalty, but thought it expired in two years; it was actually three years. Now the Larsons' payments have climbed to $19,000 annually, at a new rate of 9.3 percent. 
 ''It was a loan made with no regard for whether it would be affordable when the rate increased,'' said Jordon Ash of Acorn Financial Justice Center, an organization in St. Paul that is trying to help the Larsons. The mortgage broker who advised the Larsons could not be found, and phone calls to the company, Ace Mortgage, were not returned.
 Mr. Larson worries that his creditworthiness is sinking as the couple struggle to make the monthly payments. By the time the penalty expires, he may not be able to refinance.
 ''I had good credit,'' he said. ''Now it is going down because we can't keep up. I feel like I am drowning.''
 Experts say that many borrowers do not really understand the implications of prepayment penalties -- if they are aware they have them at all -- and fall prey to sophisticated marketing. In a 2002 lawsuit by Acorn on behalf of a group of borrowers against Household Finance, Acorn said that lenders referred to the practice as ''closing the back door'' by making it too costly for borrowers to get out of loans with rising rates.
 The art of finding borrowers was carefully honed, according to the lawsuit. Among the techniques was sending a check and telling recipients they could have access to a small loan by cashing it. Those who did went on a hot list of prospects in a strategy referred to as target practice, according to the suit. 
 The penalty ''is just an added fee that means more money to the lenders,'' said Melissa A. Huelsman, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in predatory lending law. ''It is one piece of paper that a borrower signs in a stack of 50 papers. For many people, even if they saw the words, they wouldn't understand them.''
 That was the case for Gertrude Robertson, a 91-year-old widow and nurse's aide living in Seattle who took out an adjustable-rate mortgage of $450,000 in January. 
 Even at her age, Mrs. Robertson was earning $3,500 a month, largely by caring for another elderly woman. Then the woman died. Mrs. Robertson's income was reduced to her monthly Social Security payment of $1,500. Meanwhile, her loan ballooned to $475,000. Unable to make the payments, Mrs. Robertson is listing her home for $510,000.
 Mrs. Robertson's mortgage includes a prepayment penalty of $14,400. A sale at her asking price would not only wipe out any equity but require her to write a check for about $8,600 to cover the penalty and other costs. 
 Mrs. Robertson says her broker did not give her time to study the loan documents. ''Some words I don't understand,'' she said. ''When I heard the lady I used to work for tell someone that I was the 'epitome of cleanliness,' I went home and cried. I thought I was going to be fired.' I didn't know what it meant.'' 
 Last week, Ms. Huelsman persuaded a court in California to waive the prepayment penalty for Mrs. Robertson. She is seeking to have other fees thrown out as well. The loan was made by New Century Financial, now in bankruptcy protection. 
 The loan servicer, HomeEq, prefers to work one-on-one with customers and does not comment on individual cases, a HomeEq spokeswoman said. 
 A study by the Center for Responsible Lending shows that borrowers in minority neighborhoods received a disproportionate share of loans with prepayment penalties. The Pew Hispanic Center reported in 2002 that African-American families had a median net worth of just under $6,000. Hispanic families had nearly $8,000. For white Americans, the median net worth was $88,651.
 Waiting out the expiration of a penalty, especially a short one, does not sound so bad -- until home prices turn south. 
 That is what happened to Dorinda Weisman, a social worker in Elk Grove, Calif. In 2005 she borrowed $353,000 from Pacific American Mortgage to buy a home in Sacramento with a small down payment. The prepayment penalty, of $9,000, expired in just a year.
 ''One of the things I always wanted was to own a house,'' Ms. Weisman said in a telephone interview. ''I was a single parent, and my son is a hemophiliac. I had been living in a middle-class African-American neighborhood that went downhill after the drugs came in.''
 By the time the penalty expired, her house had declined in value. Refinancing was no longer possible. 
 Her interest rate had shot up to 9.8 percent from 4.75 percent. She says about 85 percent of what she brings home -- her salary is $60,000 as a social service consultant with the state government -- now goes to the mortgage.
 She is trying to negotiate a new loan with the help of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit home ownership organization based in Jamaica Plain, Mass. 
 ''Like a lot of people, the adjustable ate up her equity,'' said her mortgage broker, Antonio Cook of Toneco Financial. ''She's got to ride it out and sacrifice. I tell people, 'I don't care if you eat bologna sandwiches, just pay your bills on time.' If she can ride it out, things start coming up good.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about homeowners who face steep prepayment penalties on their mortgages gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the surname of a Seattle lawyer who commented on the complexity of mortgage contracts. She is Melissa A. Huelsman, not Helmsman. The article also gave an incorrect spelling in some copies for the given name of a homeowner who says he cannot afford to refinance his house because of a $9,000 prepayment penalty. He is Timm Larson, not Tim.

HEADLINE: Investors Fear Fund-Raiser Has Taken $40 Million

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
New details emerged yesterday about the finances of the mysterious Democratic fund-raiser Norman Hsu, with the revelation that a private equity fund representing about 100 investors in New York gave him $40 million this year for a loan pool he said would generate a high rate of return.
 The investors were notified this week that their money might be in jeopardy, in light of disclosures that Mr. Hsu defrauded investors in a Ponzi scheme 16 years ago in California and faced accusations that he engaged in similar conduct more recently, a Manhattan lawyer for the fund said. 
 The lawyer, Seth Rosenberg, said that managers of the investment fund tried in recent days to cash checks from Mr. Hsu but that they were returned because of insufficient funds. The concerns about the fate of the investment were first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal.
 Mr. Rosenberg represents Source Financing Investors, a fund with about 100 participants that is managed by Joel Rosenman, who has said he met Mr. Hsu through a mutual acquaintance five years ago. Mr. Hsu told potential investors that he was pooling money to make short-term loans to private-label fashion designers in the United States to buy garments made in China, and that typical returns for someone who invested in the pool exceeded 40 percent.
 Source Financing Investors sent a letter to its investors this week saying that it was concerned about what had happened to the $40 million entrusted to Mr. Hsu, and that it had notified the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which is investigating. Mr. Rosenberg said fund managers were shocked by the discovery of Mr. Hsu's past legal troubles.
 ''Obviously, people with a proven history of success in finance wouldn't have invested unless they believed it made economic sense,'' he said. ''They had every reason to believe these were authentic financial transactions that related to real business deals.''
 Mr. Hsu, a major bundler of campaign contributions for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, was arrested last week after skipping a court appearance related to the 1991 fraud case. It was the second time he had vanished, the first being in 1992 when he was due to be sentenced to up to three years in prison on the fraud conviction, but fled and went on to start a new life as a businessman and later as a political fund-raiser in New York. He turned himself in last month after news accounts revealed an outstanding warrant for his 1992 disappearance.
 Since then, further disclosures have raised questions about the nature of his businesses and how he was able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Democratic campaigns. Mr. Hsu presented himself as an apparel executive, but little public information was available for his company, Components Ltd., which accepted the $40 million investment from Source Financing Investors. 
 Financial records for Components Ltd. reviewed by The New York Times show that in 2003 it paid more than $100,000 to nine people who later made campaign contributions to Mrs. Clinton and other candidates. The records revealed a pattern of transactions -- a flurry of transfers and checks, some of which bounced, totaling about $600,000 in a single month -- that was similar in many respects to what was described in court records relating to the Ponzi scheme for which Mr. Hsu was convicted.
 Yesterday, an investor in California whose name was found in the financial records said she feared that $40,000 she had invested with Mr. Hsu was gone. The woman, who described her concerns on condition that she not be identified, said that she initially reaped impressive returns -- paid out every two to three months -- on her investments, but that she had recently been unable to find out what had happened to her money.

HEADLINE: Four State Judges Sue Over Lack of Pay Raises

BYLINE: By WINTER MILLER

 BODY:
Four New York judges filed a lawsuit yesterday against Gov. Eliot Spitzer and other state officials, claiming their constitutional rights have been violated because they, and all judges in the state, have not received a rise in pay since 1999. 
 The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said that under the State Constitution a judge's compensation ''shall not be diminished during the term of office,'' which is effectively what has happened as a result of inflation and cost-of-living increases. 
 The four judges who filed the suit are Patricia M. Nunez of New York City Criminal Court, Michael L. Nenno of Cattaraugus County Family Court, Susan R. Larabee of New York City Family Court and Geoffrey D. Wright of New York City Civil Court.
 George Bundy Smith, a partner at Chadbourne & Parke, the Manhattan law firm that is representing the judges, said, ''It saddens me today to feel compelled to be an advocate for judges who have waited so long for a simple pay raise.'' Mr. Smith, who served as a New York State judge for 31 years, added, ''Nevertheless, I and others have reached the point where we feel we have no other alternative.''
 The issue of judicial pay has long been a matter of contention in Albany, where two attempts to pass salary increases since 2005 have withered in the Legislature, primarily because its leaders have sought to link raises for judges with those for lawmakers. Governor Spitzer has opposed that, although he has said he believes judges deserve higher pay. 
 Mr. Spitzer's press secretary, Christine Anderson, said yesterday, ''The governor fully supports pay increases for judges and has submitted legislation to provide that increase,'' but she added, ''He believes that any such increase should be provided through the legislative process rather than through litigation.''
 Mark Hansen, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who supports twinning legislative and judicial pay raises, said that the Senate had passed a bill this year calling for the raises but that the Assembly had not. Referring to the judges who filed the suit, he said, ''We feel they should be urging the Assembly to pass the bill.'' 
 The maximum judicial salary in the state is $136,700 annually, and the plaintiffs want to raise that to $165,000, which is the annual salary for federal district judges. It is the amount being sought for state judges by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, who has proposed linking raises for the judges and the Legislature.
 While deflecting comments about this lawsuit, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's press secretary, Dan Weiller, said, ''Judge Kaye made recommendations on how to address this issue of judicial pay, and we support those recommendations.''
 The salaries of state judges are ranked 12th nationally, but the figure drops to 49th when cost-of-living factors are taken into account, according to a study by the National Center for State Courts.
 While Judge Kaye has said that litigation might be the only recourse if Albany did nothing, the director of communications for state courts, David Bookstaver, speaking on her behalf, said she did not support the judges' suit. ''She believes at this juncture it is in the best interest of the judiciary, since we have a positive open dialogue and progress in Albany, not to tie the issue up in protracted litigation,'' he said.
 To avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, Judge Kaye has said she will recuse herself if the suit comes before her.
 Jeff S. Korek, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, said he sympathized with the judges filing the suit. ''The morale of the bench has been terrible,'' he said. ''This may be the only venue for a remedy.''

The anticorruption drive led by Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, which shook the institution and contributed to his downfall, remains hampered by weak management, internal distrust and employee resistance to combating fraud, a panel of outside experts concluded Wednesday.
 The panel, led by Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, recommended that the bank's new president, Robert B. Zoellick, work with the bank board to overhaul its antigraft operations and instill more confidence among bank employees and affected countries. 
 ''This is not an easy problem,'' Mr. Volcker said in an interview on Wednesday. ''By far the most important thing is getting the entire bank on board with the importance of an anticorruption effort. This goes against decades of grain in the other direction. There's been outright conflict in the bank as to whether to have an anticorruption function.''
 The long-awaited report said it was impossible to quantify the losses from bid-rigging, bribes, poor quality of goods and services and other problems of graft in the operations of more than $20 billion a year in lending to poor countries. 
 ''There is, however, a general sense that the losses are substantial,'' it said. Current and former officials at the bank say that some form of fraud affects as much as 40 percent of the bank's programs. Corruption was a signature issue of Mr. Wolfowitz, a former deputy defense secretary under President Bush who was forced to resign from the bank in May after the disclosure that in 2005 he had arranged for a pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza, his female companion and a bank employee at the time.
 His actions related to fighting corruption, like suspending aid to countries without consulting the bank's board, ruptured his ties with the staff and directors. One effect was that the board and Mr. Wolfowitz agreed to bring in Mr. Volcker last year to examine the anticorruption efforts.
 Mr. Zoellick welcomed the report for its ''excellent and I hope most useful'' recommendations, and he indicated that he would probably put most of them into effect. Aides close to the new president say that whether anticorruption efforts succeed will depend as much on his personal efforts to heal rifts at the bank as on managerial changes.
 In an interview, Mr. Zoellick said many of the Volcker proposals were in line with plans he and his staff had already generated. ''The most important recommendation is that anticorruption efforts are a vital function of the bank and need to be incorporated into everything we do,'' he said.
 By all accounts, Mr. Volcker, who had investigated the United Nations oil-for-food scandal in which Iraq siphoned off money from its oil sales, had to navigate many contentious charges and countercharges. Many of them focused on the activities of the institutional integrity unit led by Suzanne Rich Folsom, a Wolfowitz appointee and onetime Republican Party activist.
 Many bank employees charged that under Ms. Folsom, the anticorruption campaign was waged selectively and unfairly against employees and countries and that it was intended to carry out the agenda of a conservative Republican distrustful of the bank's mission.
 Supporters of Ms. Folsom said, on the other hand, that they had been constantly stymied by bank employees who saw corruption as minor and as an acceptable cost of doing business in poorly governed countries.
 The Volcker report, while exonerating the anticorruption team of unfairness or political motivations, said a ''siege mentality'' in the institutional integrity unit led to ''excessive secrecy'' about its activities and a refusal to share its findings with colleagues and people in the affected countries.
 In general, the report said the bank had done a poor job in following up findings of corruption with remedial action in many countries, and it recommended that Mr. Zoellick select a top manager to oversee efforts to work with countries and regional bank officials to root out graft once it is uncovered. It also called for an outside panel of advisers to evaluate antigraft activities. 
 In a significant rebuke to Mr. Wolfowitz, the panel also recommended that the head of the integrity unit not serve as a counselor in the president's office, as was done under Mr. Wolfowitz. Critics had charged that Mr. Wolfowitz and his top aides received information on corruption from Ms. Folsom that was not shared with colleagues, leading to financing decisions that rewarded or punished countries for political reasons, and to retaliatory actions against personnel without due process.
 In the interview, Mr. Volcker said he and his investigators had found no evidence that the bank acted in favor of or against any country based on political motivations. ''These questions of bias and so forth, we've found no substantiation of them,'' he said. But he added that the follow-up on corruption charges was ''cumbersome'' and ''slipshod.''
 The panel also recommended that the anticorruption drive be carried out by a more diverse staff, a reference to the criticism that, under Mr. Wolfowitz, nearly 40 percent of the staff and most of the unit's leaders were American.
 A major question left by the report, especially among the bank's 10,000 employees, was the future of Ms. Folsom's leadership. Top aides to Mr. Wolfowitz have left the bank, and many bank employees have openly hoped that Ms. Folsom will follow.
 But the report praised the operation of the integrity unit, and implicitly the performance of its director. Going further, Mr. Volcker said in the interview that she had done an outstanding job and that he had found no evidence to back up the charge that she had exhibited favoritism.
 Mr. Zoellick also said he had no intention of removing Ms. Folsom, and Ms. Folsom, a lawyer with experience in corporate ethics matters, issued a statement praising the Volcker report and said she would not resign. ''I am dedicated to the work of this department and the mission of the institution,'' she said.
 However, two people close to Ms. Folsom said that after the battles over Mr. Wolfowitz, and after being vindicated by the Volcker report, they would not be surprised if she left this year. 
 The panel also recommended that the integrity unit discontinue investigations into sexual harassment -- Mr. Volcker said it was a ''chronic problem'' at the bank -- and other forms of personal misconduct, which it said had been a distraction and a focus of bitterness among bank employees. These charges should be investigated by a unit in the human resources division, the report said.

HEADLINE: A Diner for Rent, With Many Memories to Tell

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

 BODY:
When it opened on the corner of 43rd Street and 11th Avenue in 1962, the Market Diner was one of the biggest of its kind in New York City. It became known as a late-night hangout for Frank Sinatra and Kate Smith, the place the Westies gang dropped by during a break from dismembering victims, and even the spot where Jerry Seinfeld and his friends Kramer and Newman met a dealer for black-market shower heads.
 No one is there now. It sits behind a chain-link fence. A random corn plant has sprouted through the cracks in the parking lot. Inside, the revolving dessert display case still has its mirror-ball finish, and one can almost hear the clink of rob roys against manhattans after being passed through the little window from the bar. 
 The diner's closing in spring 2006 left some neighbors crying in their egg creams, wondering who will rent the corner lot in Hell's Kitchen, in a quickly evolving area with an increasing number of high-rise apartment buildings. The owners are seeking almost half a million dollars a year in rent. 
 Possible tenants include high-end restaurateurs, a graphic design firm and a skate shop, said Stephen May of the Winick Realty Group, which is representing the owner, the Moinian Group, a developer. So far, all those who have expressed an interest also say they would use the building, though it is likely to be refurbished, he said. Present zoning does not permit another high rise on the corner, Mr. May said. 
 ''For years and years we went there,'' he said, reminiscing about coming into the city from Yonkers, where he knew children of the extended Zelin family, who owned a handful of Market and Munson Diners across the city.
 During a recent visit, Mr. May, 48, pointed out booths covered in ever-so-faux black and white snakeskin. Globular light fixtures hang over the counter, covered in an extruded orange version of candied ginger. The kitchen smells as if it needs a dose of steel wool. And a lone black umbrella, the ghost of Everyman, hangs from the hat rack. 
 It was the kind of place, some say, where if you asked for a special known as the Happy Waitress, all you got was a gruff, ''She quit,'' followed, in short order, by an open grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato, plus fries on the side.
 A former paramedic who now works at Metropolitan Lumber and Hardware up 11th Avenue at 46th Street, and who would give her name only as Marie, recalled rough nights on the ambulance -- after a few too many trips to Bellevue -- that were best cured by a stop at the Market Diner. 
 ''You could go over there for scrambled eggs and bourbon,'' she said. ''You could smoke in there, too. Scrambled eggs and bourbon. Gimme a coffee with a shot.''
 A co-worker of hers at Metropolitan Lumber, Milton Molina, leaned far back in his chair and reminisced: ''It was the last place to have banana cream pie. I've searched for banana cream pie since the day they closed.''
 But Cynthia Bernot, who was walking her dog on 11th Avenue, remembered contracting a case of food poisoning in the diner, forcing her to leave a celebration later in the Hammerstein Ballroom. 
 ''I was so sick I had to leave the Joey Ramone birthday party, the first one after he died, and Debbie Harry was on and I didn't even care,'' she said. ''It was the tomato sauce, on the pasta. I could never go back there.''
 For drivers, the diner had one crucial claim to fame.
 ''At one time it was the only diner on the island of Manhattan that had its own free parking in front, so it was very popular with cab and limo drivers,'' said Kenny Kramer, the inspiration for the Kramer character on ''Seinfeld,'' who gives weekend tours of the neighborhood. He includes the diner because it was used in the episode when the Seinfeld gang purchased a black-market shower head so powerful it was used only for circus elephants.
 T. J. English, the author of ''The Westies'' (Putnam, 1990) and a former cabdriver himself, said the diner was a major hangout for the notorious Hell's Kitchen gang in the 1970s and early 1980s. The parking lot was the site of a shooting in the early 1970s by Francis (Mickey) Featherstone, who went on to become the gang's second-in-command and the eventual informer who helped bring the group down in 1988.
 In 1978, members of the gang went to the diner to take a break from dismembering Rickey Tassiello, a debtor and friend of Mr. Featherstone's, in an apartment on 10th Avenue, an event that made Mr. Featherstone sick to his stomach, Mr. English said.
 ''They cut the body up and bagged it in big jumbo plastic bags, to dispose of the body, but first they went to the Market Diner and had a bite to eat,'' Mr. English said. Mr. Featherstone got drunk there, and then the gang dumped the body in the East River. 
 Asher Zelin, 72, one of the partners who ran the diner, remembers the gang as respectful of the place. 
 ''If they had any trouble amongst themselves -- if a Jersey crowd came over, like an anti-Westies gang -- they made sure any arguments were outside in the street,'' said Mr. Zelin, who is retired in Delray Beach, Fla. ''So there was no mark against the diner, so it wouldn't lose its license, because if it lost its license, they'd have no place to hang out. As bad as these people were, they were protective of their hangout.''
 Smaller skirmishes would break out at times, when words were exchanged between ''people in tuxedos and gowns in one booth, and some of these bad-news guys two booths away,'' he said. A squad car usually hung around outside between 4 and 6 a.m., he recalled.
 Saul Zelin, 84, Asher's cousin, remembers having very good police protection. 
 ''We always fed the police at half price, and there were a lot of police always around the diner,'' said Saul Zelin, who lives in Hewlett, on Long Island. 
 He concluded, ''Fortunately, we were very lucky -- we had no murders, and that was quite a thing for that area, under those circumstances.''
 The diner was known for its famous clients, as well as for its infamous ones. Asher Zelin collected menus signed by Bette Midler, Frank Sinatra and Diane Keaton. He remembers closing off the back room for celebrities and their entourages, especially Sinatra. 
 ''That was the big thing, at 3 or 4 or 5 a.m., when the bars closed,'' he said. ''That was back in the days when drinking was the thing. Guys came in pretty loaded, to be honest with you. They were exciting times.''
 The men behind the cash register became a bit famous themselves. Saul Zelin remembers being recognized by a chauffeur in Mexico City. ''We became almost like celebrities, but we never got rich there,'' he said. ''It's a tough business. We wouldn't want our children to go in it.''
 Some of the waitresses who worked there recall the Zelins treating them like family, even putting them up in hotels during various blackouts and snowstorms. 
 Margie Walker Gleeson, 57, whose mother, Joan, and three sisters all worked at the diner at various times, remembers serving Geraldo Rivera, who was dressed as a priest with a group of undercover cops. ''I guess they were on an assignment,'' she said. She remembers another customer siphoned gas into her car when she had to get home after the blackout of 1977. 
 ''You felt like a family, really,'' she said. ''I think that happens in a lot of diners.''
 Through the years, the diner attracted tipsy Jersey boys on their way home from a night in the city; Rudolph W. Giuliani, who used it for campaigning as well as eating; and transvestites who frequented an adjoining bar.
 The Zelins sold the diner in 2004 to the current owners of the property, and it continued operating as a diner until last year.
 In the face of economic pressures, other vintage diners have been sold and moved. The Munson Diner, which had stood six blocks north of the Market Diner, was moved to Liberty, N.Y., in May 2005. The Moondance Diner, at Grand Street and Avenue of the Americas, arrived in La Barge, Wyo., last month for a second life in the hash-slinging business. The Market Diner property is not for sale, just for rent.
 Since small-restaurant owners are being priced out of the market, Mr. English said, Hell's Kitchen is particularly vulnerable to losing its continuity. 
 ''Losing the Market Diner is losing what are the last vestiges of Hell's Kitchen, as it existed in the '60s, '70s and on into the '80s,'' Mr. English said. ''There are very few places of that era left.''
 He added, ''This is one less place for older people in the neighborhood to hang out, to have some familiar link to the history of the neighborhood.''

PERSON: Fred Spira 

HEADLINE: Fred Spira, 83, Dies; Made Photo Gadgets Accessible

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Fred Spira, a photo historian and collector of photographic gadgets who is credited with helping standardize modern camera equipment and making it accessible to amateurs, died Sept. 2 at his home in Whitestone, Queens. He was 83.
 The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, his son Jonathan said.
 Mr. Spira was the owner of Spiratone, a photographic accessories business that he started in 1941 as a film-development lab in the bathroom of his parents' apartment in Manhattan. By the late 1950s the company had grown into a multimillion-dollar business, occupying a vast loft space on West 27th Street and a showroom on the ground floor. It sold lenses, filters, lighting and darkroom equipment, but not cameras. 
 Because of his business success and his unremitting advocacy, Mr. Shira was able to persuade major producers to standardize photographic accessories and to make them more affordable. Amateur and professional photographers awaited each gadget catalog as if they were children waiting for a Christmas toy catalog.
 In a 1979 article in Popular Photography, John Durniak, a former photo editor at Time magazine and The New York Times, wrote: ''Henry Ford did not invent the automobile and Fred Spira did not invent photography, yet both these men have had almost as much influence on their respective fields as the original inventors. What Ford did to our economy and culture with the concepts behind the Model A and Model T, Spira has done to photography with his accessory lenses, close-up attachments and processing machines.''
 Mr. Spira was responsible, Mr. Durniak wrote, for the widespread use of the fish-eye lens, which can take a wide, hemispherical image; and for the proliferation of lenses that can be switched from one camera to another. He also got his system of interchangeable lens mounts accepted by makers in Japan, the United States and Russia. 
 In 2001, with his son Jonathan and Eaton S. Lothrop Jr., Mr. Spira (pronounced SPEE-rah) wrote ''The History of Photography as Seen Through the Spira Collection'' (Aperture), tracing the technological development of photography.
 The study is based on Mr. Spira's collection of about 10,000 books, articles and documents written by or about prominent figures in photographic history -- among them George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company; Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre, inventor of the daguerreotype, for which images were exposed directly onto a mirror-polished surface; and William Henry Fox Talbot, inventor of the positive-negative photographic process. 
 The collection also includes about 20,000 photographic devices, some of which were in use only briefly. Many of those ephemeral devices, which experts refer to collectively as photographica, were used to illustrate the book. Among the more fascinating examples: 
 One of the earliest photographic images, a daguerreotype of a country road, taken in 1840. The image was unusual for its time because it captured an outdoor scene rather than a long-posed portrait of an individual.
 A Praxinoscope, a coin-operated, table-top device from the 1880s that played tunes in time with rotating, slightly varying images, giving the viewer a sense of motion. 
 An 1858 image of a clock salesman's slotted traveling case, showing 16 clocks and their prices. It is the first known instance of the use of photography as a selling tool.
 A camera called a Pistolgraph, made by Thomas Skaife in the late 1850s, that looked like a pistol.
 And of course the book includes photos of modern equipment, including the first digital camera model, the Kodak DCS, which was introduced in 1991.
 Sigfried Franz Spira was born in Vienna on Aug. 7, 1924, the only child of Hans and Paula Back Spira. After emigrating to the United States, he changed his name to S. Franklin Spira, but he preferred to be called Fred. 
 Besides his son Jonathan, of Bayside, Queens, Mr. Spira is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Marilyn Hacker; and another son, Greg, of Kingston, N.Y.
 Mr. Spira's father, a Jew, had been a banker in Vienna. When the bank failed in 1929, he and a Christian friend opened a camera store. As the Nazis made inroads into Austrian politics even before they invaded, 14-year-old Franz Spira was barred from attending high school. He began working in the camera store -- but only in the back, out of sight with his father. 
 In 1939 he boarded a Kindertransport, one of the trains that rescued Jewish children by taking them out of the country. He was sent to England. Then, joined by his father in May 1940, he arrived in New York. His mother arrived later that year.
 The small photo laboratory that Mr. Spira and his father ran out of their Manhattan apartment was eventually ordered closed by the Fire Department. It had become profitable thanks to word of mouth among Jewish immigrants on the West Side and by advertisements in photo magazines. 
 In 1946 the Spiras opened their store on West 27th Street. In the early 1950s Spiratone became one of the first photo-supply companies to import Japanese accessories into the United States. 
 Mr. Spira retired in 1987, and the business, which by then had been acquired by another company, closed in 1990. 
 ''There will always be some form of recording of light images,'' Mr. Spira wrote in his book. ''What shape it will take in the future has yet to be determined.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 19, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Sept. 14, 2007, about a photo historian and innovative dealer in photographic equipment misspelled his surname at one point. He was Fred Spira, not Shira. It also misspelled his given name at birth and referred to him incorrectly in recounting how he was barred from attending high school in Austria because his father was a Jew. He was born in Vienna as Siegfried Franz Spira, not Sigfried, and was known in his youth as Siegfried, not Franz. (After emigrating to the United States, he changed his name to S. Franklin Spira but preferred to be called Fred.). Mr. Spira's son Jonathan brought the errors to the attention of The Times last year and again last month; this correction was delayed because editors and a reporter did not follow through on the complaint.

 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'INFINITE ISLAND: CONTEMPORARY CARIBBEAN ART,' through Jan. 27. This large show, with 45 artists and a collective of designers, photographers and architects from the Dominican Republic adding to the count, fills two floors of temporary exhibition space, and care has been given to the selection. Several of the most substantial pieces were commissioned for the occasion. Organized by Tumelo Moshaka, associate curator of exhibitions at Brooklyn, it's an in-house job, a labor of love, though an uneven one. Too much work treads ground already covered by other art over the years. But what's good is really good, and the very existence of a show about identity politics, out of mainstream fashion in 2007, is cause for serious reflection. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RICHARD POUSETTE-DART,' through Sept. 25. The youngest member of the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart (1916-1992) helped break the ice for the movement, only to be omitted from its histories. This show, while too small to make sense of his enormous output, confirms his originality, but also that he did his best work after 1960, when he extended his Ab-Ex origins into an eccentric hybrid of Minimal and Op Art that is alternately hallucinatory and kitschy. His late paintings don't so much hang on the wall as float in front of it, looking like either planes of granular light or slabs of jeweled stucco. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'EXCELLENCE AND ELEGANCE: DECORATIVE ARTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY QING COURT,' through Nov. 25. The consummate ambition that Chinese artists brought to diminutive scale is a striking feature of this small show of art from the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial line. The Qing were both conservatively antiquarian and expansively cosmopolitan, and those trends can be seen in the European-inflected versions of ancient Chinese forms in this show. (See above.) (Cotter)
 * THE MET: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'EL MUSEO'S BIENAL: THE (S) FILES,' through Jan. 6. You feel the growing pains and attempts to stretch out in the fifth edition of ''The (S) Files'' (short for ''The Selected Files).'' The show provides a survey of 51 emerging artists based in New York and from this year's invited guest country, Ecuador. Some of the works distinctly consider location, displacement and identity. Others are less concerned with issues that make for good biennial panel discussions and more interested in mining older art -- Surrealism, Minimalism and Postminimalism -- and employing craft techniques. Many of the artists in ''The (S) Files'' have appeared in other local survey shows, which raises the criticism often leveled at biennials: that in trying to cover the waterfront of contemporary art, they end up making the waterfront look, from every angle, increasingly the same. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'REPICTURING THE PAST/PICTURING THE PRESENT,' through Nov. 5. Modern and contemporary artists reconsider both the picture book and standard narrative in works that use mythology, history and current events as their source material. Several pieces, like those by Max Beckmann, Christian Boltanski and William Kentridge, mine the 20th century's major conflicts. Religion enters in a variety of guises, as in James Ensor's ''Entrance of Christ Into Brussels'' or versions of ''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'' by Odilon Redon and Tim Rollins & K.O.S. (Kids of Survival). The legacy of slavery is addressed in Glenn Ligon's lithographs and Kara Walker's ''Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated),'' which will also complement the retrospective of Ms. Walker's work that opens at the Whitney in October.

 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'THE ABSTRACT IMPULSE: FIFTY YEARS OF ABSTRACTION AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY, 1956-2006,' through Jan. 6. This exhibition illuminates the troubled history of abstraction at the academy over the last half-century, with a selection of 47 paintings, sculptures and works on paper by its members, many only recently elected, who took part in movements like Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and Kinetic and Op Art. Drawn almost entirely from the museum's collection, it may not be an outstanding group of artworks, but it helps to explain how this once-celebrated museum and school lost much of its prestige. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Jan. 13. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher B. Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject of ''organizing chaos'' is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Caohe seems to have dropped the accent on his first name in most sites Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitiello. (See above.) A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'PETER YOUNG: 1963-1977,' through Sept. 24. This ebullient show retraces the rapid rise of a maverick abstract painter who made it big and then took a pass, leaving town to settle eventually in Bisbee, Ariz. With the dot as his main staple, he worked in an array of styles, mixing Color Field, Minimalism and Process Art as he pleased. There are near-Photo-Realist images of streaming galaxies; luscious motifs derived from folding bare canvas onto painted canvas; chunky necklaces made of acrylic paint; and quirky, geometric line paintings stretched on tree branches. The show is a blast from the past that singes the present. (See above.) /A Museum of Modern Art Affiliate, (718) 284-7084, (Smith)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'GENERATION 1.5,' through Dec 2. Generation 1.5 refers to people who emigrate during their adolescent years, whose identity is shaped by both their old and new cultures. Some of the works in this exhibition address this process; elsewhere the show floats into general meditations on globalization and cultural dislocation. Lee Mingwei's ''Quartet Project,'' a sound and video installation, uses monitors playing a performance of Dvorak's ''American Quartet.'' Seher Shah's drawings combine lotus patterns, Mecca cubes and Western architectural motifs, and works by Rirkrit Tiravanija and Emily Jacir explore the successful contemporary artist as a globalized citizen. The show is emblematic of the museum's program, which is increasingly devoted to reflecting the borough's extreme diversity, but risks turning the immigrant experience into a platitude. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'IL LEE: BALLPOINT DRAWINGS,' through Sept. 30. A selection of drawings -- striking indigo and black ink abstractions, all done exclusively in ballpoint pen, on paper and canvas -- makes up this engrossing show by the veteran Korean artist Il Lee. The centerpiece is a 50-foot drawing that took two and a half months and 400 to 500 ballpoint pens to complete, with the artist working on sections at a time that were propped up against the wall in his Brooklyn studio. It is a sweeping, rhythmical abstraction in blue, recalling the Italian Futurist paintings of Giacomo Balla, combined with elements of traditional Asian ink and wash painting. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Genocchio)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'MIDNIGHT'S DAYDREAM,' through Oct. 28. The three artists in this show were artists in residence at the Studio Museum of Harlem in the last year, but their work represents very different approaches. Titus Kaphar is the classicist, taking European and American portrait paintings from the 18th and 19th centuries and reconfiguring them into strategic compositions. Wardell Milan II is the archetypal collagist, photographing arrangements of art reproductions, family photos and images cut from magazines. Demetrius Oliver is the Conceptualist, working in the trickster vein of David Hammons and Duchamp. All three, however, actively confront race and (art) history, which often seems a mandate for young black artists. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Schwendener)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions seen lately at the Whitney. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (See above.) (Smith)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: ABSTRACT PAINTING IN THE FIFTIES' This show comes loaded with associations: Gertrude Stein and Hemingway, Gershwin's tone poem. (The Met also mounted a show of paintings last year titled ''Americans in Paris: 1860-1900.'') Paintings here echo what was popular in New York in the 1950s. Although the canvases aren't as large, the gestures are big, and bold colors, splatters and drips abound in works by Al Held, Norman Bluhm, Seymour Boardman, Shirley Jaffe, Joan Mitchell and Sam Francis. One artist who ran against the Abstract Expressionist tide is Ellsworth Kelly, whose horizontal collage with hard-edged stripes makes him seem less like an American in Paris than a painter forecasting Daniel Buren -- or what the French would do in the 1960s. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com, through Sept. 29. (Schwendener)
 KOREAN FUNERARY FIGURES: COMPANIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO THE OTHER WORLD' What makes this somewhat unusual for a show of mortuary art is that the kkoktu, or figures adorning funeral biers, were created for ordinary citizens rather than for aristocrats or the wealthy. They're also rather fun and friendly. Brightly painted clowns, acrobats and animals were meant to accompany the dead into the next world, to ease the journey and provide consolation for the mourners. Among the 74 kkoktu are versions of ''The Guide,'' riding an animal; ''The Guard,'' who protects the soul from evil spirits; ''The Caregiver'' (generally women); and ''The Entertainer,'' as well as a replica of a funeral bier modeled on a late-18th-century original from Tongyoung, South Kyongsang Province. The Korea Society, 950 Third Avenue, (212) 759-7525, koreasociety.org, through Nov. 20. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'DOCUMENTA 5' This art extravaganza occurred in Kassel, Germany, 35 years before this summer's 12th incarnation, and its achievements tend to be shrouded in myth. As the first lavish international exhibition to play up Minimal and Conceptual art, it upset lots of people, including not a few Minimalists and Conceptualists. Centering on the exhibition's distinctive orange three-ring catalog, this meticulous show revisits its publications, press coverage, controversies and various byproducts, like a shopping bag by Joseph Beuys. It is highly educational and unexpectedly riveting. Specific Object, 601 West 26th Street, Room M285, (212) 242-6253, specificobject.com, through Oct. 8. (Smith)
 MATT KEEGAN: 'ANY DAY NOW' AND JEDEDIAH CAESAR: 'THREE VIEWS FROM SPACE' In side-by-side first shows with this gallery, two young artists appear to be diametric opposites. Making frequent use of an X-Acto knife, Matt Keegan favors surgical precision in various uses of language, complex printing and dry wall. Jedediah Caesar is big on dumb, random matter: quantities of trash compressed into large chunks of cast resin that are then sliced, balanced between beautiful and tacky. A great deal of oddly satisfying, intelligently focused details accumulate in the overlap between the artists. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com, through Sept. 29. (Smith)
 'THE LATH PICTURE SHOW' The title signals that a certain predominance of wood -- raw, finished, real, fake -- among the efforts of 20 contemporary artists. It is deployed in assorted forms to cheerfully crowded nearly carnivalesque effect. There is leaning, stacking, signage, old-fashioned carpentry, as well as photography and installation. Unless you count Robert Melee's colorful, wall-size variation on rec room decor (and parquet flooring), painting is absent. In other words, playing on Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 movie, this is the show beyond ''The Last Picture Show.'' Friedrich Petzel Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9467, petzel.com, through Sept. 22. (Smith)
 'MAKERS AND MODELERS: WORKS IN CERAMIC' This show of ceramic sculptures by 30 artists is beyond timely, even if the choices are at times too Gladstone-centric and cautiously mainstream. There are several outstanding efforts, among them Rosemarie Trockel's wryly beautiful day bed, Anne Chu's toasty ''Hellish Spirits'' (life size) and Andrew Lord's ambitious experiment in ceramic outreach. Kai Althoff, Anish Kapoor, Liz Larner, Rebecca Warren and, of course, the great Ken Price reward attention, as do newcomers like Gert and Uwe Tobias, Klara Kristalova and, the show's biggest splash, William O'Brien. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com, through Oct. 13. (Smith)
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31.

 Last Chance
 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 'MICROWAVE, FIVE' Where most galleries reveal their ''program,'' or general slant, with more or less candor in summer group shows, ''microwave, five'' is like a manifesto. A few veteran artists who work with obsessive precision, like Yayoi Kusama and Tom Friedman, offer some historical grounding. Younger artists include Ken Solomon, whose hand-painted postage stamps sent through the mail are here, as well as Xawery Wolski and Gloria Ortiz-Hernandez. Missing is Yuken Teruya, a maker of virtuosic tree sculptures cut out of paper bags, and one of Ms. Bienvenu's most popular artists and probably the best representative of this meticulous aesthetic. Josee Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, joseebienvenugallery.com; closes Saturday. (Schwendener)
 'PACKEDSOCKDRAWER' This is a strong candidate for best 2007 summer show title, even if, by no fault of its own, the recently closed ''NeoIntegrity,'' at Derek Eller, with nearly 200 artists, felt more like a packed sock drawer. The compactness of the show's title is echoed in both the works and the installation of Steve McCall's abstract, biomorphic paintings; David Moreno's photographs with concentric-circular compositions; Gary Batty's minute filigrees drawn on thick, cream-colored, handmade paper; and Tamara Zahaykevich's petit, colorful wall-mounted sculptures made with foam board, tape and glue. The caveat with a great show title is that you're tempted to stretch it out to the work, which here means comparing it to footwear, but we won't go there. Feature Inc., 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, featureinc.com; closes on Thursday. (Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'THE DONNER PARTY,' Jim Shaw's ''Donner Party'' merges the saga of the ill-fated Donner-Reed Party, westbound settlers trapped in the High Sierras in the winter of 1846 to 1847, with Judy Chicago's benchmark feminist installation ''The Dinner Party.'' The central element is a ring of miniature covered wagons that mimics the dining table in Ms. Chicago's work, with 27 sculptures assembled from items purchased in thrift stores. It may seem like a work based on sick, twisted, juvenile humor (O.K., it is -- but that's Mr. Shaw's allure), yet ''The Donner Party'' also contemplates how myths -- national or, in the case of Ms. Chicago, individual -- are forged and perpetuated, and it serves as a cautionary tale for taking them too seriously. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Sunday. (Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA' Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Cash to Get By Is Still Pawnshop's Stock in Trade

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The gold hoop earrings were $250, more than a third of Michelle Maynard's rent. She bought them anyway, and treasured them, but wore them for only two months.
 One rainy afternoon in April, she decided to give up the earrings to get something back, and took them to Jay Rosado. He examined them for a moment, then set them on a scale. Minutes later, Ms. Maynard was handed $80. 
 Mr. Rosado runs a pawnshop in the South Bronx. It is easy to think the worst about someone who walks into a New York City pawnshop, long supposed to be a den of thieves, addicts and the downtrodden, and the swindlers who take advantage of them. But the New Yorkers who frequent pawnshops often want something as legitimate as it is simple: quick cash to help get by.
 Ms. Maynard, 44, used the $80 to buy groceries, a MetroCard to get to and from work on the subway, and a dinner of pizza for her three sons. She needed the money because she had given her father all she had -- she makes $19 an hour as a social worker -- to let him take the boys to Walt Disney World. She covered some of the expenses; her father paid the rest. 
 The boys -- 13, 11 and 9 -- had no idea that they would soon be headed to Disney World. They also had no idea that their mother had pawned some of her favorite jewelry to enable them to go.
 The shelves and safes in Mr. Rosado's pawnshop are stocked with such secrets: Ms. Maynard's hoop earrings, the diamond-studded watch that Danny Bautista turned in to pay parking tickets on his truck, the two gold bracelets Martin Baez gave up to pay his cable bill. 
 Pawnshops thrive in the Bronx; 65 of the city's 162 licensed pawnshops are there, the most of any borough, according to the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. The stores have multiplied not only in the Bronx but across the city and the country.
 The number of pawnshops in the United States has grown to about 12,000 today, from 4,800 in 1986, according to John P. Caskey, an economics professor at Swarthmore College who is the author of ''Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor.'' The increase is part of the spread of check-cashing outlets and other alternative financial services that have become ad hoc banks for the so-called unbanked -- the millions of Americans who do not have a bank account.
 New York City recently began to offer needy residents no-fee starter accounts and $50, through a partnership with eight banks and credit unions. 
 In the South Bronx, where census data puts the median household income at $21,088, the pawnshop is a neighborhood institution. It is where people with jobs but neither checking nor savings accounts seek cash for an unexpected bill. Where people with debt or bad credit go for an immediate loan of a few hundred dollars without a credit check. Where people go to put their jewelry to work for them, sometimes pawning the same item over and over again.
 ''Most of the people that come in here live paycheck to paycheck,'' said Mr. Rosado, 40, the co-owner of Mr. Pawnbroker, at 1016 Longwood Avenue.
 ''They're all working-class people,'' he said. ''They can't manage their money properly, or because of the economy the way it is, they can't seem to catch a break. Pampers, light bills, the rent is due, car payment, oil bill. It's for a mountain of things.''
 To spend time behind the counter of Mr. Pawnbroker is to glimpse the commerce of the city at its most primitive and fluid. For a place filled with small, precious things, the pawnshop and its customers carry heavy burdens. The story of Ms. Maynard's earrings and their eventual fate -- like the hundreds of thousands of other items that pass in and out of the city's pawnshops each year -- illustrates the murky ground between financial help and sentimental regret, between luxury and necessity, that the stores occupy.
 A Shop With a Difference
 Mr. Rosado's establishment is nothing like the seedy stereotype of a New York City pawnshop. It is a brightly lighted storefront in Longwood, near the hum of the Bruckner Expressway.
 On a wall behind the bulletproof glass that separates the public area from the back office, Mr. Rosado keeps pictures of his wife and three children. He seems prepared for the worst (16 digital security cameras, a panic button to summon the police, a center counter reinforced with a steel plate) but eager for the best (decorating for Christmas, inviting friends and relatives for visits). 
 Mr. Rosado -- his given name is Radames, but everyone calls him Jay -- is a husky, goateed former construction worker, a Bronx-born New Yorker who, in June, took his first vacation in 11 years. He and his wife, Ana, were married on Valentine's Day 2004; the next day, he was back at the shop. He has fired two workers over the years, one of whom was a young woman who regularly showed up late and who happened to be his eldest daughter.
 He got his first job when he was 9. He pestered his father to buy him a pair of sneakers, and his father, a building superintendent, took him not to a shoe store, but to a grocery. His father wanted him to earn the money for the shoes by running errands at the store. 
 Mr. Rosado stumbled into this line of work. He had struck up a friendship with the owner of a Bronx jewelry store, which led to his working at and eventually managing a pawnshop on Southern Boulevard. ''I thought I'd work there for like a week or so,'' Mr. Rosado said. He stayed about nine years before opening his own shop in 2003. 
 Many of Mr. Rosado's customers on Southern Boulevard followed him to Mr. Pawnbroker. His one business is for two kinds of patrons: those interested in buying jewelry and those interested in pawning it.
 The front of the shop is for buyers. It resembles a typical jewelry store, with rings, necklaces, earrings and other pieces laid out in glass counters, on the walls and in a window display. Mr. Rosado deals only in jewelry, as do most pawnshops in the city. 
 On display in recent months were a $500 necklace, a $6,500 diamond engagement ring and an elaborate rendering of the Last Supper on a hollow 10-karat gold medallion. There was a diamond-encrusted charm in the shape of a grenade and another with the skull logo of the comic book character the Punisher. There were earrings with images of Jesus Christ and rings emblazoned with the flag of Puerto Rico.
 Help for Life's Ups and Downs
 Like much of New York, the pawnbroker and his customers are locked in a daily game of winning and losing. Someone brings a piece of jewelry to Mr. Rosado. He determines its worth and gives the customer a cash loan, usually about one-third of the item's resale value. The item sits in one of Mr. Rosado's three safes in the back office, waiting. 
 The customer has four months to pay back the loan and interest. The National Pawnbrokers Association, of which Mr. Rosado is a member, says that the typical pawnshop loan is $75 to $100. State law limits interest rates charged at pawnshops to 4 percent per month for four months. Mr. Rosado charges 3 percent of the original loan per month.
 With Mr. Rosado's rates, someone who received a $100 loan would owe $119 in four months -- $12 interest plus a $5 service fee and a $2 vault charge. In other states where pawnshops flourish, like Florida and Texas, the interest rates are much higher. As a result, the number of licensed pawnshops in New York City is considered low by industry standards.
 If a customer does not repay the loan after an additional two-month grace period, Mr. Rosado takes ownership of the item.
 The customer's loss is also measured in more subtle, personal ways.
 One day, a young man in need of money walked into Mr. Pawnbroker and pawned the medallionwith the image of the Last Supper. It was round and encircled with cubic zirconias, and the man pawned it reluctantly, Mr. Rosado said. The medallion sat in the back office for months. The man never returned. 
 Mr. Rosado eventually put it out for display, and a woman from the neighborhood bought it for $650. ''She wears it every day,'' Mr. Rosado said. 
 The cheapest items at Mr. Pawnbroker are 25-cent sweets in the candy dispensers that occupy one of the shop's corners. The most valuable item sits on a spinning mirror in the window display, bathed in light.
 It is a palm-size, intricately detailed 14-karat gold motorcycle that Mr. Rosado spent a month building. The headlight has a tiny diamond in the center. He is so proud of the item, a replica of a custom-made motorcycle featured on the reality television series ''American Chopper,'' that he put a close-up snapshot of it on his business cards. He figures the piece is worth $10,000, but is reluctant to sell it at any price. Someone offered $20,000 for it, but Mr. Rosado said he turned the offer down.
 The public area glitters like a 24-karat mirage. At first glance, the jewelry seems out of place in the South Bronx, home to some of the city's highest rates of unemployment, crime, drugs and poverty. But the desire for pricey jewelry is as prevalent among the tenements of the South Bronx as it is in any neighborhood of the city.
 The pawnshops, jewelry stores, retail businesses and residents seem to feed off one another, in an endless cycle of buying, selling, bartering and pawning.
 The hoop earrings Ms. Maynard pawned did not travel far: she had bought them at a jewelry store on Southern Boulevard blocks from Mr. Rosado's pawnshop, which is within walking distance from her apartment on Longwood Avenue.
 Paying Bills and Going Broke
 Late one Friday afternoon in April, a 59-year-old woman who lives around the corner from Mr. Rosado's shop stepped inside, pawned one of her necklaces, walked down a few doors to the dry cleaners and paid for her clothes with some of the cash she had just received. ''You pay all your rent, you pay all your bills, and then you're broke,'' explained the woman, a day care center cook who did not want to give her name.
 Another day, a 30-ish woman came in looking for a diamond ring that she said her brother, a drug addict, had stolen from their mother's house. Mr. Rosado, who keeps a computer copy of customer IDs, found the ring and showed it to her. Seeing it, she calmed down, and said she would work it out with her brother.
 Mr. Rosado examines jewelry for signs that it was pulled or yanked off someone's wrist or neck, and he often turns away people whose demeanor, items or stories of how they came to possess the jewelry make him suspicious. One man tried to pawn a $120,000 Breitling watch, and he refused it.
 ''You can't trust a person 100 percent,'' Mr. Rosado said.
 All but a handful of the borough's 65 pawnshops are concentrated in the 16th Congressional District, which includes the South Bronx and several neighborhoods to the north. According to 2005 census figures, it is the poorest Congressional district in the country, with 41.6 percent of the population living below the federal poverty level. Here, the ancient symbol of pawnbroking-- three hanging gold balls -- is almost a common sight.
 Some of Mr. Rosado's customers frequent several pawnshops in the area. Others visit only Mr. Rosado. These loyal regulars drop in often, and have become as close to their pawnbroker as some people are to their priest or rabbi. He has attended about a dozen funerals for his customers.
 He has also, for his regulars, kept jewelry for months after the six-month holding period, making it easier for them by giving them more time and by freezing the interest. 
 When Mr. Rosado opened his pawnshop in 2003, Leticia Flores was his first customer. She had been one of his steady clients at the pawnshop on Southern Boulevard. ''I always asked for him,'' she said. ''I never gave my jewelry to nobody else but him.'' 
 Ms. Flores used to work for Teamsters Local 202, and over the years amassed an extensive collection of jewelry -- more than $80,000 worth. She once pawned some of it to help her sister pay her mortgage, and to pay the lawyer after her husband was sent to jail. There were other reasons, too, she said. ''Let's say if it was near Christmas and I didn't have enough money, I would pawn my jewelry and then go shopping'' 
 Ms. Flores has not pawned anything in a long time. Back in 2003, after Mr. Rosado opened, she pawned her engagement ring for about $650. It was not because she needed the money. It was to welcome him to the neighborhood.
 Life From Behind a Counter
 From Monday to Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Mr. Rosado sits in a tall chair behind the counter watching, listening to, guiding and occasionally arguing with his clients. One customer recently pawned about 50 items to help pay her mortgage. Another pawned jewelry for a bus ticket to Connecticut. One man needed cash to send to his son in Puerto Rico for his birthday. 
 Martin Baez, 45, pawns his jewelry weekly. One day a few months ago, he traded two gold bracelets -- one of them a gift from his deceased mother-in-law -- for $170. ''Right now, I got to pay a cable bill,'' he said. ''As long as I get that paid off on the first, I'm covered.''
 Danny Bautista, 30, left an expensive watch that was a gift from his girlfriend. He received $450, money that went to pay off parking tickets. About three months later he picked up his watch, paying a total of $504.50, and said he did not plan to come back. ''I regret doing it,'' he said of pawning the watch, ''and I don't want to do it again.'' 
 One day, a young woman brought in a 14-karat gold chain. As she took it out of her purse, she told Mr. Rosado that she had found it. Then she changed her story and said it was hers. Mr. Rosado declined it, and the woman left.
 ''We're not allowed to take anything that's been found, stolen,'' Mr. Rosado said. Some customers, like Ms. Maynard, tell him nothing about why they need the money.
 Ms. Maynard said she did not have a credit card or bank account, and said that Mr. Rosado did her a favor when he lent her $80 for those hoop earrings.
 ''I'm glad it was there, because I needed that money,'' she said. ''I wasn't in the street. I didn't have to ask anybody for money, even family.'' 
 She pawned the earrings in early April. In July, she had not returned to pay off the loan and the interest. ''I just don't have the money to get them out,'' Ms. Maynard said in front of her apartment building, a short walk from where her earrings sat -- and remain still -- in a drawer in Mr. Rosado's safe.

HEADLINE: Seeking Clues to a Son's Death and a War's Meaning

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

DATELINE: Viewed from one angle 

 BODY:
straight on, from the ground level of its busy plot -- ''In the Valley of Elah'' might be mistaken for a tidy crime procedural. A retired military police officer named Hank Deerfield (played by Tommy Lee Jones with his usual brisk, gruff economy) learns that his son Mike (Jonathan Tucker), an Army specialist recently returned from Iraq, has gone AWOL from his base in New Mexico. 
 Before long, the young man's charred and dismembered remains are found in the desert, and Hank joins Emily Sanders, a local detective played by Charlize Theron, in trying to figure out who could have done such a terrible thing to his boy. 
 As in an episode of ''Law & Order,'' suspicion veers one way and then another as new information comes to light. Was it drug dealers? Gang members? Soldiers from the young man's own squad? Was Mike himself guilty of terrible things? Paul Haggis, the writer and director, obeys the rules of the whodunit genre by providing answers to some of the basic, literal questions at the center of the film. And considered strictly as a crime drama, ''In the Valley of Elah'' is a bit pedestrian, with a few too many set pieces, extraneous subplots and predictable turns. 
 But an air of irresolution nonetheless lingers around it, a sorrowful, frustrated sense that the deepest mysteries cannot be contained within any narrative framework. Underneath its deceptively quiet surface is a raw, angry, earnest attempt to grasp the moral consequences of the war in Iraq, and to stare without blinking into the chasm that divides those who are fighting it from their families, their fellow citizens and one another. 
 This is not to say that the detective story, suggested by the actual murder of Specialist Richard Davis in 2003, is entirely beside the point. Rather, the mechanics of the plot -- the forensic discoveries, the squabbles over jurisdiction between military and civilian authority, the rounds of paperwork and the squad-room arguments -- serve as the scaffolding for a more unsettling, open-ended inquiry. Much as Hank wants to know what happened to Mike the night he died, his real quest is to find out who his son was, and what happened to him in Iraq.
 The only clues he has are some JPEGs his son e-mailed to him, the memory of a desperate late-night phone call from the war zone and some smeary, scrambled video recovered from Mike's cellphone. These hectic, unfocused clips stand in jarring, pointed contrast to the neatly composed frames and carefully paced shots that make up most of Mr. Haggis's film, and they pose an agonizing challenge: How do you extract meaning from such chaos?
 To his great credit, Mr. Haggis tries to coax an answer out of his story rather than imposing one on it from the start, as he did in ''Crash.'' That film, which owes its best-picture Oscar to the dedication of its cast and the obviousness of its themes, turned racial intolerance into fodder for a self-righteous, schematic allegory. 
 While ''In the Valley of Elah'' has its share of overreaching and throat clearing -- including clumsy references to the biblical story of David and Goliath, the source of its title -- it is mostly free of moral grandstanding. (A brief scene in which Hank gives voice to some of his half-buried ethnic bigotry is more credible than any of the similar moments that make up most of ''Crash.'') 
 Not that the message of ''In the Valley of Elah'' is ambiguous or unclear. The message is that the war in Iraq has damaged this country in ways we have only begun to grasp. For some people this will seem like old news. Others -- in particular those who pretend that railing against movies they haven't seen is a form of rational political discourse -- may persuade themselves that it is provocative or controversial. 
 But however you judge the movie's politics, and whatever its flaws, there is something inarguable, something irreducibly honest and right, about Mr. Jones's performance. Hank exists on a continuum with the other lawmen he has recently played, in particular the Texas sheriffs in ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,'' which he directed, and Joel and Ethan Coen's ''No Country for Old Men,'' which will be released later this fall. 
 Like them, Hank carries around an innate sense of right and wrong, and Mr. Jones's creased face, at once kindly and severe, is a manifest sign of his old-school temperament. Hank is the kind of man who shines his shoes every night, says grace before each meal and makes his motel-room bed according to military standards. 
 It's unlikely that a veteran M.P., whose service covered at least some of the Vietnam years, would entertain the illusion that all fighting men are Boy Scouts. But it is clear that Hank has both a general fondness for soldiers and a father's assumption that he knows his own son. That may be part of why the grisly nature of Mike's fate, and the possibility that some of his buddies were responsible for it, disturbs him so much. Something, he suspects, has gone terribly wrong with the institutions and the men he has always loved and trusted.
 At every point, as Hank nags and pushes Emily in her investigation, the movie registers the panic and dread that he fights to keep down. These feelings come through to some extent in the reactions of his wife, Joan (Susan Sarandon), whom he tries to protect, but more decisively, and more hauntingly, through the moods Mr. Haggis creates (with the crucial assistance of Roger Deakins, the cinematographer responsible for the movie's austere, washed-out look, and Mark Isham, who wrote the eerie, sparingly applied musical score). 
 Almost no violence takes place on screen, but there are times when ''In the Valley of Elah'' feels almost like a horror film. Its steady crescendo of suspense builds toward the revelation -- and vanquishing -- of some unspeakable, monstrous evil.
 But since the monster has no identifiable physical shape, it is not so easily defeated. While there are killers, liars and sadists to be found in this movie, there are not really any villains. And there is no reassuring conclusion. If it is anguished, even despairing, ''In the Valley of Elah'' is also compassionate. At heart it is a somber ballad about young men who remain lost in a dangerous, confusing place even after they come home.
 ''In the Valley of Elah'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are some violent scenes and a general atmosphere of brutality and fear.

HEADLINE: Warning Signs, Defining Moments

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
When Annie Cox is unsure if the economy is headed south -- a question on the minds of many on Wall Street and Main Street these days -- she keeps an eye on the orders for beverages at the diner she runs in Oklahoma City.
 In recent weeks, Ms. Cox said she had seen a slight drop-off, leading her to believe that business could slow in coming months. ''When they start ordering water instead of tea or Pepsi, that means they're cutting back,'' said Ms. Cox, who runs the 1950s-style restaurant, Sherri's Diner, that is named after her mother.
 Leon Tuberman, the chief executive of the Barn Furniture Mart in Southern California, is similarly wary. Despite widespread troubles in the housing market, business is down only about 5 percent. But Mr. Tuberman said he was not replacing the five employees who left the store voluntarily in the last six months, because he suspected that spending would remain sluggish.
 Across the nation, the impact of the turmoil in the housing and credit markets on the broader economy has been relatively modest so far. But just as some of Ms. Cox's customers are becoming more cautious and Mr. Tuberman is holding back on hiring, many people are preparing to hit some economic headwinds. 
 Whether that caution on the part of consumers and business translates into little more than a modest economic slowdown or turns into a full-blown recession will depend on a variety of factors. But perhaps the most important are whether jobs remain plentiful and consumers keep spending. 
 That is what was so ominous about the government's report last week that businesses reduced total employment by 4,000 jobs in August and that payroll gains for previous months were being lowered. Another important labor market indicator -- the share of the working-age population that reports holding a job -- has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two years. And consumer spending, while it continues to grow, has slowed in recent months. 
 ''Large numbers of people are leaving the job market,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''That is not just a sudden bout of laziness, but it's a response to reduced labor market activity.''
 Mr. Hatzius and his peers on Wall Street now put the risk of a recession at about one in three, which is significantly higher than earlier this year but far from a sure thing.
 They note that in recent years consumer spending was led higher by the torrid boom in housing, especially in big states like California, Florida, Arizona and New York. Now, as home prices fall, loans are harder to get and home equity borrowing is tapering off. As a result, consumer spending is likely to suffer.
 Those downward pressures, though, are being offset by a robust global economy that is providing a significant lift to exports, corporate profits and real wages, which finally picked up in the last year after stagnating for much of the decade. Optimists note that consumer spending is unlikely to slow as long as hourly wages are perking along at a nominal annual pace of about 4 percent, about 1.5 percentage points above the inflation rate. 
 ''There clearly is a problem in mortgages,'' said David Kelley, an economist at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company in Boston. But ''outside the mortgage market, we don't really see the consumer stopping spending.''
 Consumer spending has often defied dour predictions. There was no decline in spending during the recession of 2001, even as job losses mounted and business sentiment sank after the technology bubble burst. That is one reason the downturn was so mild compared with the harsher recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. 
 Economists also note that spending by higher-income consumers has a far more significant impact on the economy than purchases by those who are less well- off, a group that appears to be most vulnerable to declining home prices, resetting mortgages and job loss. 
 ''There are essentially two consumer economies right now, and they parallel the split between the very rich and everybody else,'' said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich, the consumer research firm based in Norwalk, Conn. ''There is one part of the consumer economy that is unlikely to be affected at all by the recent events in the financial markets. Those are the people making the loans. The people taking the loans, however, are the people who are affected.''
 Mr. Tuberman sees that bifurcation in his furniture business.
 Even as a number of competitors and distributors have gone out of business, Barn Furniture's sales have held up, he says, because it receives most of its orders from repeat and longtime customers, who are drawn to his traditional wood products.
 But new customers are hard to find. 
 ''When someone refinances a home and they have extra money, they buy new furniture; when somebody buys a new home, they buy new furniture,'' said Mr. Tuberman, whose family has run the store since the 1940's. ''When their adjustable-rate mortgage just increased by 40 percent, they don't buy furniture.''
 The downturn in housing is visible far and wide. Tex Pitfield, who owns a petroleum distributing business outside Atlanta, says he is not renewing the leases on 4 of his 20 trucks because business has slackened, especially in areas directly connected to residential real estate.
 ''We are not running any fuel to the construction companies for new home sites, the guys that put in the sewer lines and the utilities,'' he said. ''Big block stores are down in consumption and retail consumption is down.''
 Some of that may be related to rising energy prices -- oil prices this week topped $80 a barrel and the average price of gasoline nationally is $2.81 a gallon, up about 20 cents from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 In much of the country, Americans cannot change their driving habits easily or in the short term. But consumer behavior experts say gas prices could force people who may already be stretched thin by debts to cut back. Families facing a higher house payment or the loss of a job will probably go out less, buy fewer clothes or spend less on entertainment.
 ''From one week to the next, to fill up your car could cost $30 or $50 -- and for a lot of families, that's either the cable bill or a night out to eat,'' said Phil Rist, executive vice president of BIGresearch, a consumer research firm in Worthington, Ohio. ''The fact that they don't know where gas prices are one week to the next, that creates trepidations.''
 Mr. Smith of Yankelovich echoed the sentiments of Ms. Cox in Oklahoma City in highlighting how consumers may change their spending: ''Some of our restaurant clients joke that they know when the economy is starting to head down by dessert sales,'' he said.
 Consumers always start by eliminating the purchases they see as unnecessary. ''They begin to eat out differently. They eat out less. Often they trade down to lower-priced restaurants. And they quit buying all the extras like dessert.''
 For her part, Ms. Cox is confident that her business will survive even if customers stop buying dessert. After all, she's seen worse.
 ''We made it through the last two recessions just fine,'' she said. ''You just have to be resourceful.''

SECTION: Section F; Column 0; Escapes; HAVENS DEEP CREEK LAKE IN MARYLAND; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1325 words

HEADLINE: High-End Rustic on a Plateau in the Alleghenies

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
WASHINGTONIANS of means tend to buy their second homes at the seashore. But increasingly they are heading to Deep Creek Lake, a mountain resort region in the Allegheny Mountains of far western Maryland for relief from traditional urban stress, humidity and Washington's own particular brand of political ennui.
 What draws them is the serpentine, 13-mile-long lake, on which are some 3,100 docks and slips, to which are tethered as many as 5,300 boats. Deep Creek Lake is the largest artificial body of water in the state, created in 1925 when a Pennsylvania utility flooded the natural creek to generate electricity.
 The lake, in Garrett County, quickly became a vacation spot for the affluent of Pittsburgh, who built log cabins on its shores. When the completion of Interstate 68 in 1991 cut the drive from Washington to three hours, real estate agents say, the number of Washingtonians flocking to the area surged -- along with home prices. 
 Laura and John Domingues, who live in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, found their lot by the lake three years ago, paying $180,000 for .64 acre one block from the water. (Because much of the county is unincorporated, many people don't live in a town; you're either near the water or you aren't.)
 ''We just fell in love with the place and started looking for property,'' said Mrs. Domingues, 42, the marketing director for an investment firm. They are now in search of a builder.
 ''I can see myself sitting at the piano four or five hours a day, cooking a gourmet meal two hours a day, and going for a hike,'' said Mr. Domingues, 54, a malpractice lawyer in Rockville, Md. ''I can see myself retiring in this area.'' 
 If so, he will join many other boomers who first came as weekenders, then found themselves settling in for good. 
 One such group of half a dozen couples call themselves the Geezers. They get together every Wednesday night for double-nickel (55 plus) discount pizza at Uno's on Route 219, or senior night at the Garrett 8 Cinema. They are in the process of shifting their lives (or have already shifted them) from the Washington area to the mountaintop, the high plateau that describes Garrett County, Maryland's westernmost county.
 Fred and Erin Peacock, who count themselves as Geezers, started with weekends, then retired to the lake. They still keep a condo in Columbia, Md., midway between Washington and Baltimore, but go there less and less. ''The truth is, it's like a motel I stay at when I visit my kids,'' Ms. Peacock said. ''Fred never wants to go back.'' They live in a 2,600-square-foot log-sided house they bought in 2002 for $208,000 in Yough River Estates. 
 Similarly, Dennis Friedman, 58, a cardiologist who lives in the Washington suburb of Potomac, Md., thrives on getaways to the lakefront home he bought in 1983 for $320,000. ''I'm somewhere between a visitor and a local now,'' he said. 
 The Scene
 Upscale rustic defines life here, a style that arrived before the highway and the lake. In the 1870s, the B & O Railroad's president, John W. Garrett, for whom the county is named, built the Deer Park Hotel as a retreat for his Gilded Age buddies. The 1884 Queen Anne Victorian train station, now a gift shop, in the county seat, Oakland, is a remnant of that era. Garrett County today is divided culturally and economically between the lake people and everyone else. The latter includes coal miners and farmers, and Amish communities around Grantsville in the north and Pleasant Valley to the south. Working people don't frequent the lake, except as seasonal employees.
 The lake is all about water sports, like Jet-Skiing and powerboating. There are also tamer pontoon boats and a few sailboats. On a mountainside that overlooks Deep Creek, the Wisp Resort has a golf course and downhill skiing in season. The Adventure Sports Center, a 1,700-foot-long water course on top of Marsh Hill, is nearby. 
 There are also three state parks that have trails for hiking and cross-country skiing. The area is busiest from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but the population swells again in mid-October during the Autumn Glory Festival, which includes banjo and fiddle championships and antiques and art shows. This year's festival will run from Oct. 10 to 14. 
 Oakland, a few miles south, is the region's cultural hub. It has its own community theater and free summer concerts. And the urban influx has contributed to its modest gentrification, with a community art gallery, a bookstore, a coffee shop, a few boutiques and antiques shops. 
 ''Second-home owners and transplants are our very own clientele,'' said Greg Elliott, a transplant from around Baltimore who owns Studio 24E, a shop that carries high-end handbags, Versace sunglasses and jewelry priced in the thousands. 
 Across the street, Englander's Pharmacy has been turned into an antiques store but has kept its fountain and its lunch counter. A few miles north of Oakland, the Arrowhead Market sells The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, along with the local Oakland Republican. The Fireside Deli and Wine Shop sells fancy sandwiches and wine, with a Saturday wine tasting. Even Foodland has a fine-foods section. 
 Pros
 Summer temperatures are at least 10 degrees cooler than in the cities to the east, and opportunities for outdoor activities are abundant. Scenery runs from the merely restful -- glades bathed in morning mist -- to spectacular mountaintop views and lake sunsets. With the Interstates, Deep Creek is remote yet accessible. 
 Cons
 The Deep Creek region has few designer shops and no malls. Sophisticated palates might find the area cuisine lacking, and Sunday liquor sales are illegal. For those who don't own lakefront property, access to the water is limited.
 The Real Estate Market
 Prices fall into three categories, with lakefront the costliest, followed by lake access (with dock rights), and lake area, said Ed King, an agent with Long & Foster. In August, there were 18 properties listed for $1 million or more. In the exclusive Reserve community, lakefront lots alone have sold for $1 million, with one on the market for $2.1 million.
 Lakefront property is so valuable that residential trumps commercial. In 2001, Doug McClive sold his restaurant, McClive's, to a developer who built water-access condos that now sell for $600,000. And most of the old lakeside cabins became teardowns.
 In general, the second-home market has held up reasonably well, real estate agents say, especially at the high end on the lakefront. But starts for new homes are down 40 percent in 2007 from 2006, and there have been some price cuts on lake area properties, which sell for between $200,000 and $500,000. 
 Although construction off the lake has lagged, new homes are still rising on the ridge above it, with ''ski-in, ski-out'' models being built by the Wisp resort. 
 LAY OF THE LAND
 POPULATION Garrett County, Md., with Deep Creek Lake at its center, has 29,859 residents, according to a 2006 Census Bureau estimate. 
 SIZE Garrett County is 648 square miles. Deep Creek Lake covers 3,900 acres, with 69 miles of shoreline. 
 WHO'S BUYING Professionals and executives from the Washington area, as well as Baltimore and Pittsburgh.
 GETTING THERE The Deep Creek Lake area is about a three-hour drive from Washington. There is a small county-owned airport that recently expanded its runway to 5,000 feet to accommodate small private jets.
 WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING Good Timber Bed & Breakfast (2159 Mayhew Inn Road, Oakland; 301-387-0097; www.goodtimber.net) is a large yet intimate log lodge near a secluded lake cove. Rates are $165 to $220 a night, and include afternoon appetizers and wine (except Sundays), and a full breakfast. The Oak and Apple Bed & Breakfast (208 North Second Street, Oakland; 301-334-9265; www.oakandappleinn.com) is in a Victorian a short walk from the center of town. Rates are $100 to $130 a night, with full breakfast.

HEADLINE: Discount Weekend at Big Home Builder

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., struggling like other home builders, is offering six-figure discounts on some of its properties this weekend as it tries to draw interest in a slumping market. 
 The sales blitz involves dropping prices by more than 20 percent on some of its prime real estate.
 The discounted properties include a three-bedroom condominium by the Hudson River in West New York, which has been reduced $240,000, or 22 percent, to $862,000 this weekend. A 25 percent discount is being offered on a two-bedroom home in Jackson Township, N.J., which lowers its price tag to $300,501.
 Hovnanian is making the discounts during the worst housing downturn in 16 years, which has sharply cut earnings for the company and other national home builders. Tight credit, fueled by a meltdown in the subprime mortgage industry this year, has sidelined potential buyers.
 Last week Hovnanian, based in Red Bank, N.J., reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss.
 This weekend's sales, announced Sept. 5, involve thousands of homes in 19 states.
 No other major builder is having a sale of such magnitude, but swollen inventories are likely to lead to more discounting, said Sam Chandan, chief economist at Reis Inc., a real estate research company.
 ''The downward adjustment in prices, whether for new homes or existing homes, is going to be far more severe than what many people thought earlier this year,'' Mr. Chandan said.

HEADLINE: Experts Question Study On Youth Suicide Rates

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON and BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
Last week, leading psychiatric researchers linked a 2004 increase in the suicide rate for children and adolescents to a warning by the Food and Drug Administration about the use of antidepressants in minors. The F.D.A. warning, the researchers suggested, might have resulted in severely depressed teenagers going without needed treatment. 
 But the data in the study, which was published in The American Journal of Psychiatry and received widespread publicity, do not support that explanation, outside experts say. 
 While suicide rates for Americans ages 19 and under rose 14 percent in 2004, the number of prescriptions for antidepressants in that group was basically unchanged and did not drop substantially, according to data from the study. Prescription rates for minors did fall sharply a year later, but the suicide rates for 2005 are not yet available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 ''There doesn't seem to be any evidence of a statistically significant association between suicide rates and prescription rates provided in the paper'' for the years after the F.D.A. warnings, said Thomas R. Ten Have, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
 In the report published last week, the authors analyzed data on suicides and antidepressant use over several years in the United States and the Netherlands. They argued that drug regulators may have created a larger problem by requiring pharmaceutical companies to place warnings on antidepressants, scaring away patients and doctors. The F.D.A. warning label says that a potential side effect in young people is an increase in suicidal thoughts and behavior. 
 ''The most plausible explanation is a cause and effect relationship: prescription rates change, therefore suicides change,'' said Dr. J. John Mann, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and a co-author of the study. 
 But Dr. Ten Have and other experts, while noting that it may still turn out that a reduction in prescriptions is leading to increased suicides among young people, said that the new study neither proved nor disproved this. Instead, some experts say, the study illustrates why suicide trends are so difficult to understand -- and why this debate has been so polarizing and confusing.
 In an interview, Robert D. Gibbons, a professor of biostatistics and psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the lead author of the journal article, acknowledged that the data from the United States that he and his colleagues analyzed did not support a causal link between prescription rates and suicide in 2004. ''We really need to see the 2005 numbers on suicide to see what happened,'' he said. 
 But Dr. Gibbons defended the paper, saying that when taken in the context of previous studies that linked falling antidepressant use to increased suicide rates, ''this study was suggestive, that's what we're saying.''
 Other experts, however, said that the problem with such studies is precisely that they are suggestive rather than conclusive and are open to interpretation. Suicides are rare and uniquely personal events that can be driven by many factors: worsening depression or other mental illnesses, breakups or job loss, lack of drug or psychiatric treatment, even easy access to guns. 
 In calling for the labeling change on antidepressants, F.D.A. scientists based their decision on data from drug makers' clinical trials, considered the gold standard in medical research. Those trials have shown that young patients who took antidepressants were about twice as likely than those on placebos to report suicidal thoughts or attempts, though the numbers in both groups were small. 
 Yet none of the youngsters in the trials, most of which ran for no more than a month or two, actually committed suicide. And most psychiatrists with long experience using antidepressants in children say the benefits far outweigh any risk. 
 In studies of data collected before 2004, Dr. Gibbons, Dr. Mann and others found clear associations between prescription patterns and suicide rates. For instance, prescription rates for patients from ages 10 to 24 rose steadily in the 1990s, while the suicide rate in that age group fell 28 percent from 1990 to 2003, according to a government report released last week. 
 In another study, researchers at Columbia University, analyzing data from 1990 to 2000, found that for every 20 percent increase in the use of antidepressants among adolescents, there were five fewer suicides per 100,000 people each year. Psychiatric researchers have found similar patterns among some age groups in other countries, including Sweden, Japan and Finland.
 But many uncertainties remain. While the suicide rate for adolescents has fallen over the last decade, it has remained largely unchanged for the overall population, though prescriptions for psychiatric medicines have risen sharply in all age groups. Adjusted for the demographic changes, about 11 Americans per 100,000 killed themselves in 2004, the same as in 1994. 
 Demographics can play a role: White people kill themselves about twice as frequently as African-Americans and Hispanics, so as the population becomes more diverse, the suicide rate ought to drop, all else being equal. And suicide rates also appear to be negatively correlated with economic growth, which was exceptionally strong from 1994 to 2000. Advances in medicine also mean more lives can be saved now. 
 With so many potentially confounding factors at play, interpreting the relationship between prescription rates and suicides is difficult, said Andrew Leon, a professor of biostatistics at Weill Cornell Medical College who has served on F.D.A. panels studying suicide risk and antidepressants.
 ''These kinds of studies are very important in giving us a sense of the rates of disease and death in a population and how those may correspond to other things,'' Dr. Leon said. ''But what they don't do is tell us whether the two trends are directly related.''

HEADLINE: Paths of Resistance in the East Village

BYLINE: By JOHN STRAUSBAUGH

 BODY:
FOR a long time the East Village was an urban frontier. The upper half of the Lower East Side, stretching from Houston Street north to 14th Street, and from Third Avenue and the Bowery to the East River, it was a toehold in America for generations of new immigrants -- Irish, German, Jewish, Ukrainian, Puerto Rican and others -- and a magnet for artists, bohemians, radicals and reformers. It has often been ravaged by grueling poverty and neglect. But it was also an area of intense cultural activity that changed the world.
 Beginning in the 1980s and accelerating in the 2000s, new waves of affluent ''immigrants'' came to tame the frontier. Condominium towers reared up from blocks of old tenements. Many tenements themselves were renovated, with expensive rents and lofts worth more than a million dollars. Artists' studios and corner bodegas gave way to chic shops and trendy bistros.
 The East Village has been dragged up-market, but isn't going without a fight. The photographer and videographer Clayton Patterson has documented the changes since he came here from Calgary, Alberta, in 1979. Mr. Patterson, also the editor of ''Resistance,'' a sprawling collection of essays on the contentious politics of East Village real estate, recently took me on a tour. 
 We began in Tompkins Square Park, a focal point in the neighborhood's history, which before the 1800s was soupy swampland and marshes. The East River shoreline was where Avenue C is now; everything east of that was built on progressive stages of landfill -- including, amazingly, rubble from bombed London, shipped across the Atlantic after World War II to form part of the foundation for the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
 The park was opened in 1850. Poor immigrant families lived crowded into dilapidated shanties and later the brick tenements that still surround it. They came to the park for a breath of air and to protest their dreadful living and working conditions. 
 In 1857, a year of bank failures and economic panic, they were attacked by police while protesting the lack of jobs and food. In 1863 the park was a staging area for the deadly Draft Riots that inflamed much of Manhattan. In 1877 5,000 locals who had gathered to hear Communist speakers preach revolution tussled with police and National Guardsmen.
 During the Vietnam War many antiwar rallies were staged in the park, and the Grateful Dead gave a concert there in 1967. Wigstock, the annual drag festival, began there in 1985. At that time the park was used around the clock. Homeless people camped in one corner, drug dealers had another, and neighborhood families shared the rest with punks and anarchists.
 On the night of Aug. 6, 1988, the New York Police Department met with resistance trying to enforce a new 1 a.m. curfew. Mr. Patterson videotaped for more than three hours as a melee spilled out to the streets. Police batons cracked heads, bottles flew, and mounted officers galloped up Avenue A in bizarre cavalry charges.
 As dawn broke over the littered and bloody streets, protesters attacked the 16-story Christodora House, facing the park at East Ninth Street and Avenue B. The Christodora, built with charitable donations and opened in 1928 as a high-rise settlement for poor immigrants, had fallen into the city's hands in the 1960s and had been abandoned. Renovated and reopened as luxury condominiums in 1986, it was a looming symbol of ''yuppiefication'' for the protesters, who smashed the glass doors and dragged a potted tree from the lobby into the park.
 Behind the construction shed on Avenue B between Seventh and Eighth Streets stands another symbol of change: St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church, begun in 1848 by neighborhood Irish dock workers. Once serving a thriving parish, it was closed in 2001 by the Archdiocese of New York, which cited structural damage (an ugly crack scars the Eighth Street wall) and a dwindling congregation. Gutted, its pews and stained-glass windows smashed, it awaits its fate as preservationists -- helped by a celebrity or two, including Matt Dillon -- have fought in court to save what's left from the wrecking ball.
 Behind the Christodora on East Ninth Street sits the massive, crumbling hulk of the former Public School 64, closed in the 1960s. It also waits forlornly, as preservationists have wrangled in court with a developer who wants to build a 19-story high-rise on the site.
 In the 1960s and '70s, the area between Avenues A and D became largely Hispanic, known as Loisaida (Nuyorican for Lower East Side) and Alphabet City. Neglected by slumlords and city services, the neighborhood had one visible sign of real estate activity: the arson that routinely destroyed abandoned buildings, which were then razed to leave debris-strewn lots.
 In the early 1970s local residents began to create community gardens on many of those city-owned lots. The city auctioned off a number of the lots to private developers in the 1980s and '90s, but other gardens were saved and now operate under the auspices of the Parks Department.
 The enormous weeping willows at La Plaza Cultural, on the corner of Avenue C and Ninth Street, are fed by the same underground springs that once made the area a swamp. One of the largest and lushest gardens, the Sixth Street and Avenue B Community Garden, was begun in 1983 with a few small plots of vegetables among the rubble of demolished tenements. Today, one of its founders, Joanee Freedom, told me that there are about 90 plots, where neighbors grow everything from string beans and cucumbers to ferns indigenous to this once marshy area. A speckled koi chases goldfish in an artificial pond, and there's a small stage for cultural events and weddings.
 The garden is also noted for the ''Tower of Toys,'' the lofty, gravity-defying wooden spire erected by the garden's longtime gatekeeper, Eddie Boros, who lived all his life in an apartment around the corner until his death last April.
 In the 1980s and '90s, squatters commandeered more than 30 abandoned buildings, some because they could no longer afford the rents in the neighborhood, others as a political stand against gentrification. Mr. Patterson filmed the small armies of riot police and armored vehicles that the mayor, then Rudolph W. Giuliani, sent rumbling down the streets to evict squatters.
 ''It looked like the Russians invading Budapest in 1956,'' Mr. Patterson recalled.
 In 2002 the city made it possible for occupants of 11 remaining squats to develop their homes as low-income co-ops. The defiantly scruffy See Skwat (155 Avenue C, between 9th and 10th Streets) still displays a handmade placard on its fire escape declaring, ''This Land Is Ours -- Not For Sale.'' Interestingly, and tellingly, it is sandwiched between a cafe and a bar, Rico and Royale.
 There are also still signs of earlier groups that lived and struggled in the neighborhood. Walking west along Sixth Street, past long rows of still-standing tenements, Mr. Patterson noted that for much of the 19th century, the area was known as Kleindeutschland, ''Little Germany,'' the largest German enclave outside Germany itself. On June 15, 1904, about 1,200 people from St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church (323 Sixth Street, between First and Second Avenues, the site of the Community Synagogue since 1940) died when the steamship the General Slocum, taking them on a day trip up the East River, burned. It was the deadliest disaster in the city before Sept. 11, 2001. It traumatized the community and hastened residents' flight to uptown areas like Yorkville.
 They left a few wonderful buildings behind. On Second Avenue between Eighth and Ninth Streets stand the magnificent Freie Bibliothek and Lesehalle and, next door, the Deutsches Dispensary, now the Ottendorfer branch of the New York Public Library, and Stuyvesant Polyclinic. Completed in 1884, their facades feature sculptured terra cotta putti, owls, globes and portraits of famous Germans.
 From the 1950s through the '80s, the East Village was home to Beats, then hippies, punks and post-punks. It earned the name East Village to distinguish it from the older Greenwich, or West, Village. Artists' studios and galleries, performance spaces and music clubs bloomed on every street.
 There's nothing to see there now, but in 1959 the artist Claes Oldenburg had a studio at 46 East Third Street, while next door at 48 was the Artist's Studio, where Jack Kerouac stood on a ladder and read from ''On the Road'' to an audience that included Allen Ginsberg and Amiri Baraka, then known as LeRoi Jones.
 St. Marks Place, then as now, was ''the most commercial strip, and the gateway from West to East,'' Mr. Patterson explained. In the '60s the Bridge Theater, formerly at 4 St. Marks Place, held performances by Yoko Ono and the Fugs; Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin founded the Yippies in a basement apartment at 30 St. Marks Place; and at the Polish hall known as the Dom (19-25 St. Marks Place), Andy Warhol presented the Velvet Underground. That site is now apartments and shops.
 In the early 1980s Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibited at 51 St. Marks Place, and Gracie Mansion had a gallery across the street at No. 54, now the site of a new midrise building.
 ''A lot of artists did important work in the East Village,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''They were here because they could afford to live and work here. They can't anymore. Now it's the American Montmartre. Tourists come to see where that culture was.''
 One surviving artist, Jim Power, has adorned scores of lampposts in the neighborhood with his mosaics since the mid-'80s. You can spot them all along St. Marks Place, from Tompkins Square Park to Astor Place. Mr. Power is homeless. He and his dog, Jesse Jane, sleep on the same sidewalks he beautifies. 
 And that shuttered, anonymous spot at 315 Bowery (between First and Second Streets)? Less than a year ago it was CBGB, the birthplace of punk rock in the '70s. Standing outside, John Holmstrom, the publisher and editor of the scene-building magazine Punk, remembered that in 1975 he was ''a little nervous about coming down to the Bowery, because it was a very dangerous neighborhood.''
 ''But I really wanted to see the Ramones,'' he added. ''And it was great.'' He soon moved to St. Marks Place ''because I wanted to be in walking distance of CBGB.'' 
 CBGB closed in October 2006; its founder, Hilly Kristal -- who named the club CBGB & OMFUG, for the kind of music he wanted to present: ''country, bluegrass, blues and other music for uplifting gourmandizers'' -- died last month at 75. But hey, you can have your picture taken under the street sign for Joey Ramone Place (East Second Street), and buy a T-shirt at the CBGB souvenir shop on St. Marks Place.

HEADLINE: More Help Needed for Tougher Times

 BODY:
If the job market weakens further, more Americans may soon need to turn to unemployment compensation. And many of them will be shocked at the system's painful inadequacies. To ensure fairness and avert a crisis, Congress should act now to reform the ailing program. 
 Ostensibly, most workers have unemployment insurance because their employers pay a federal unemployment tax on their behalf -- $56 per employee per year -- and state unemployment taxes as well. On average, benefits replace about a third of a worker's previous weekly earnings and run out after 23 weeks. 
 In practice, however, only about one-third of jobless workers qualify to collect benefits. Women, especially, are routinely denied because many states' rules disqualify groups that are largely female, including low-income employees, part-timers and trailing spouses -- including military wives who leave their jobs when a husband must relocate. Those gaps came about because the program -- a joint federal-state effort -- has been largely unchanged for decades, even as the work force and economy have changed dramatically. 
 Both the House and Senate are now considering bills that would allocate $7 billion over five years to states that enact sensible and needed reforms to their programs. The money would come from extending a surtax on employers that expires this year and accounts for about $14 of the per-person federal unemployment tax. Extending the surtax is so uncontroversial that even President Bush's latest budget assumes it will happen. 
 Attaching strings to the money is important because in the past, states have used federal unemployment funds primarily to lower employers' taxes, not to broaden coverage. 
 The most important provision in Congress's bills calls on states to update a rule that denies compensation to some 300,000 low-wage workers. When today's system was adopted 30 years ago, the states devised eligibility formulas based on a person's previous earnings and hours worked. But they did not count the last three to six months of work history because in a precomputer age, those records were often unavailable. Today, 31 states still omit the most recent data, which often disqualifies low-income people from receiving benefits because without that information they are not deemed to have worked enough to qualify. Under the bills, states would be required to count the latest work history if they want to receive new federal funds. 
 To get even more federal money, states would have to enact two more reforms from a menu of reforms that includes better coverage for part-time workers, families with children, workers who enter retraining programs and the long-term unemployed.
 Lawmakers should move ahead quickly with this wise and much-needed legislation.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Price Closes Above $80

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Crude oil closed above $80 a barrel for the first time on Thursday, breaking a longstanding psychological barrier just days after oil producing nations tried to bring prices down by promising to increase output.
 The record close capped a recent run-up that had sent oil nearly 10 percent higher in nine business days, potentially a fresh drag on the economy at a time when it appears to be weakening because of problems in the housing market.
 Traders and other energy experts warned that the recent jump would raise prices of heating oil and gasoline in coming weeks, though many were skeptical that oil would stay above $80 for long. Crude prices normally drop at the end of the summer driving season. 
 They are going the other way -- up 18 cents Thursday, to close at $80.09, on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- in part because traders fear that stormy September weather in the Gulf of Mexico will disrupt production.
 ''This is a historic day,'' said Daniel Yergin, an energy historian and consultant. ''This price reflects the fact that there is a lot of risk in the market, whether you are looking at Nigeria or Iraq or even in the Western Hemisphere.''
 Oil prices have soared nearly fourfold since 2000 because of several factors: increased demand from China and India, declining production in Venezuela and Mexico and supply disruptions resulting from political crises in the Middle East and Africa. 
 Gasoline prices have periodically spiked in recent years because of high crude prices and disruptions and tight capacity at American refineries.
 A fast-moving but relatively weak hurricane, Humberto, formed in the gulf and hit Texas and Louisiana Thursday morning, causing power disruptions and shutdowns at three refineries in Texas. The shutdowns are expected to last only a day or two, but traders said they remained concerned that other storms could disrupt oil production in the gulf. September is the peak month for hurricanes.
 ''It could have been a lot worse,'' said Michael Rose, director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Mr. Rose said he thought the $80.09 close was close to ''the crescendo top'' and within the next couple of months ''I think we'll go back to the 70s and then test the upper 60s.''
 Recent price swings in crude oil came after some hedge funds and other traders pulled out of the market, distracted by a credit squeeze. But many traders jumped back into oil in recent days as they sensed that prices might move higher.
 Not only are storms threatening production in the gulf, but the oil market was generally not encouraged by an announcement this week from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC said it would raise output by a relatively modest 500,000 barrels a day to put some downward pressure on prices, a tactic that has not worked so far.
 Energy analysts said the situation would be more worrisome if the summer driving season were not over. Gasoline demand has dropped in the last three weeks.
 ''Once the latest storm threat passes, we may see pump prices drop with the autumn leaves,'' said Tom Kloza, an analyst with the Oil Price Information Service. 
 But traders said all bets were off if a serious hurricane hit the gulf, as Rita and Katrina did two years ago, crippling production and sending prices soaring. Traders expressed concern about a new Atlantic storm that the National Hurricane Center is calling Tropical Depression 8. Its path is unpredictable, but energy experts said as long as it gathered strength it would add to the pressure on energy prices.
 Crude oil broke briefly through $80 during the day Wednesday after the Department of Energy reported that American crude and gasoline inventories as well as refinery activity had fallen more sharply than expected. Wednesday's close of $79.91, though falling shy of the psychologically important $80 mark, was itself a record.
 The October gasoline futures contract rose 3.04 cents, to almost $2.05 a gallon. The national average price for unleaded gasoline was $2.82 a gallon last week, 20 cents higher than a year ago. 
 Heating oil futures have climbed more than 10 percent to record levels in the last month, and energy experts predicted they would keep rising over the next few days.
 Mr. Rose of Angus Jackson and other analysts, however, said that gasoline and heating oil should follow the price of crude downward this fall. ''I think that by the time this all filters through, crude oil, heating oil and unleaded gasoline will all be lower in the next two months,'' Mr. Rose said.
 Mr. Yergin said he believed that Persian Gulf suppliers would soon pump additional oil, relieving tight markets. He said some OPEC members were reluctant to pump too much oil at a time when the economy is weakening for fears of causing a collapse in the price of oil similar to one that occurred a decade ago. 
 Oil producers are well aware that if they allow the price of oil to get too high, they could help tip the economy into recession. 
 As high as oil prices appear to many consumers, experts noted that they are nowhere near the levels reached during the supply crisis in early 1980. Adjusted for today's dollars, a barrel of oil then sold for the equivalent of almost $102.

HEADLINE: For Fed, a Question Of Whom to Rescue, And When to Dive In

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
When policy makers at the Federal Reserve meet to set interest rates on Tuesday, their debate is likely to be less about whether to reduce rates than about how much. 
 The meeting is also likely to be a defining moment for Ben S. Bernanke, who has not had to wrestle with a major economic upheaval since he took over as Fed chairman in February 2006. Wall Street, frightened by the turmoil in credit markets and in housing, is betting on the Fed to cut rates deeply. But Mr. Bernanke wants to know if the overall economy is on the brink of a recession, and the evidence on that is far from decisive. 
 Investors now assume that the central bank will reduce the overnight federal funds rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent. Fed officials have not tried to dissuade anyone from that assumption. But there is a possibility that the central bank will go further, reducing its benchmark rate by half a percentage point and signaling further reductions later this year. 
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have said they do not want to be rescuers of investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. 
 Fed officials are also mindful of their experience in 1998, when a financial collapse in Russia led to a panic in credit markets but not a slowdown in the overall economy. The central bank reduced rates twice in response to market fears, but the panic subsided almost as quickly as it began.
 ''Monetary policy's unswerving focus should be on pursuing the Fed's mandated goals of price stability and full employment,'' Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech Monday. ''Past experience does show that financial turbulence can be resolved more quickly than seems likely when we're in the middle of it.'' 
 In practice, the line between rescuing financial markets and rescuing the overall economy is far from clear. Mr. Bernanke faces big risks, either by acting prematurely and giving investors the impression the Fed will shield them from risk or by acting too slowly and allowing a recession to set in.
 Nearly a month after the Federal Reserve took its first steps to make money available for financial institutions rocked by problems with subprime mortgages, the panic in credit markets has relaxed slightly but conditions remain far from normal, according to industry executives.
 New data on Thursday suggested that investors' fears about buying commercial paper -- securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and business loans -- might be easing, one of the reasons the stock market was rising Thursday. 
 The Fed reported that the volume of commercial paper declined by $8 billion for the week that ended Wednesday, a much smaller fall than in the four previous weeks, when investors first began to panic about subprime mortgages. Over the four weeks that ended Sept. 5, the volume of commercial paper shrank by an average of $74.6 billion each week.
 But Steven Wieting, an economist at Citigroup, cautioned that recent signs of a recovery in the commercial paper market have been fleeting. 
 That bodes ill for the slumping housing market, which depends on the availability of capital for mortgages. Sales of new and existing homes remain weak, inventories of unsold homes are at their highest levels in years, and delinquencies are rising.
 The overall economy, by contrast, has yet to show signs of serious damage.
 The most disturbing sign of emerging trouble came in the Labor Department's employment report for August, which estimated that the nation lost 4,000 jobs last month -- the first monthly decline in four years. More worrisome, the Labor Department reduced its previous estimates for employment growth in June and July by a total of 81,000 jobs.
 Kurt E. Karl, chief United States economist at Swiss Re Economic Research and Consulting, estimates the odds of a recession at ''35 percent and rising,'' but he predicted that the Fed would reduce its federal funds rate by only a quarter of a percentage point. 
 Yet, in a flurry of recent speeches, several Fed officials have made it clear they see a risk that the current housing problems and the credit squeeze could infect the rest of the economy. 
 Mr. Bernanke, who spent most of his career as a professor at Princeton and who favors a steady rules-based approach to monetary policy, has nonetheless carefully signaled that the Fed would not necessarily wait to act until it had irrefutable evidence of a looming downturn.

HEADLINE: Credit Fears Ease, and Markets Climb

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced solidly yesterday, led by strong gains among the blue chips and the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, which signaled a possible thawing in the credit markets with the announcement that it had lined up $12 billion in additional financing. 
 ''It appears that this credit crunch may not be as bad as some people thought,'' said Kent G. Croft, president of Croft Leominster Investment Management, crediting the Countrywide news with lifting overall investor sentiment.
 While he warned further examples of credit distress were likely to pop up, he said much of the intransigence in the credit markets could ease as fear dissipates. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 133.23 points, or 1 percent, to 13,424.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 12.39 points, or 0.84 percent, to 1,483.95, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 8.99 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,601.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.45 points, or 0.31 percent, to 780.35.
 Government bond prices fell sharply as stocks advanced and investors grew more confident they could move out of the safest bets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite to the price, jumped to 4.48 percent from 4.41 percent late Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note fell 14/32, to 102 8/32.
 Wall Street shrugged off a record close in crude oil prices, which edged up 18 cents, to $80.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The closing price was the first ever above $80.
 The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that the outstanding volume of commercial paper fell by a much smaller amount this week than in the previous four weeks -- $8.2 billion, to $1.917 trillion -- a signal that the corporate short-term commercial paper market could be stabilizing.
 Countrywide shares rose $2.31, or 14 percent, to $18.93 after the company added to its borrowing capacity. In recent weeks Countrywide has borrowed $11.5 billion and sold a $2 billion stake to Bank of America to keep its retail banking and mortgage businesses running.
 The news helped lift the financial sector, which has struggled because of anxiety about the credit markets. Shares of Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs rose about 3 percent, and Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers rose about 5 percent.
 Wall Street also applauded apparent progress in Detroit. Shares of General Motors rose $3.04, or 10.1 percent, to $33.29, after a Wall Street Journal report that union officials might go along with a plan to form a health care trust fund that the union would control. The plan could allow United States-based automakers to shed billions in costs. Ford shares also rose on the news, closing up 42 cents, or 5.6 percent, at $7.92.
 McDonald's shares advanced $3.10, or 6.1 percent, to $54.30. McDonald's increased its dividend 50 percent Wednesday, a day after reporting stronger-than-expected sales for August.
 Advancing issues outnumbered those declining by about two to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 2.87 billion shares, compared with 2.90 billion on Wednesday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: A Surge, and Then a Stab

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
To understand what's really happening in Iraq, follow the oil money, which already knows that the surge has failed.
 Back in January, announcing his plan to send more troops to Iraq, President Bush declared that ''America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' 
 Near the top of his list was the promise that ''to give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis.'' 
 There was a reason he placed such importance on oil: oil is pretty much the only thing Iraq has going for it. Two-thirds of Iraq's G.D.P. and almost all its government revenue come from the oil sector. Without an agreed system for sharing oil revenues, there is no Iraq, just a collection of armed gangs fighting for control of resources.
 Well, the legislation Mr. Bush promised never materialized, and on Wednesday attempts to arrive at a compromise oil law collapsed. 
 What's particularly revealing is the cause of the breakdown. Last month the provincial government in Kurdistan, defying the central government, passed its own oil law; last week a Kurdish Web site announced that the provincial government had signed a production-sharing deal with the Hunt Oil Company of Dallas, and that seems to have been the last straw.
 Now here's the thing: Ray L. Hunt, the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil, is a close political ally of Mr. Bush. More than that, Mr. Hunt is a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a key oversight body. 
 Some commentators have expressed surprise at the fact that a businessman with very close ties to the White House is undermining U.S. policy. But that isn't all that surprising, given this administration's history. Remember, Halliburton was still signing business deals with Iran years after Mr. Bush declared Iran a member of the ''axis of evil.'' 
 No, what's interesting about this deal is the fact that Mr. Hunt, thanks to his policy position, is presumably as well-informed about the actual state of affairs in Iraq as anyone in the business world can be. By putting his money into a deal with the Kurds, despite Baghdad's disapproval, he's essentially betting that the Iraqi government -- which hasn't met a single one of the major benchmarks Mr. Bush laid out in January -- won't get its act together. Indeed, he's effectively betting against the survival of Iraq as a nation in any meaningful sense of the term.
 The smart money, then, knows that the surge has failed, that the war is lost, and that Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia. And I suspect that most people in the Bush administration -- maybe even Mr. Bush himself -- know this, too.
 After all, if the administration had any real hope of retrieving the situation in Iraq, officials would be making an all-out effort to get the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to start delivering on some of those benchmarks, perhaps using the threat that Congress would cut off funds otherwise. Instead, the Bushies are making excuses, minimizing Iraqi failures, moving goal posts and, in general, giving the Maliki government no incentive to do anything differently. 
 And for that matter, if the administration had any real intention of turning public opinion around, as opposed to merely shoring up the base enough to keep Republican members of Congress on board, it would have sent Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq, to as many news media outlets as possible -- not granted an exclusive appearance to Fox News on Monday night.
 All in all, Mr. Bush's actions have not been those of a leader seriously trying to win a war. They have, however, been what you'd expect from a man whose plan is to keep up appearances for the next 16 months, never mind the cost in lives and money, then shift the blame for failure onto his successor.
 In fact, that's my interpretation of something that startled many people: Mr. Bush's decision last month, after spending years denying that the Iraq war had anything in common with Vietnam, to suddenly embrace the parallel.
 Here's how I see it: At this point, Mr. Bush is looking forward to replaying the political aftermath of Vietnam, in which the right wing eventually achieved a rewriting of history that would have made George Orwell proud, convincing millions of Americans that our soldiers had victory in their grasp but were stabbed in the back by the peaceniks back home.
 What all this means is that the next president, even as he or she tries to extricate us from Iraq -- and prevent the country's breakup from turning into a regional war -- will have to deal with constant sniping from the people who lied us into an unnecessary war, then lost the war they started, but will never, ever, take responsibility for their failures.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Success Allows Gradual Troop Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush contended on Thursday night that his plan to begin withdrawing some troops from Iraq gradually was based on a principle he called ''return on success,'' saying that progress made so far could be squandered by the deeper and speedier reductions that the war's opponents have demanded.
 Mr. Bush called for an ''enduring relationship'' with Iraq that would keep American forces there ''beyond my presidency,'' arguing that a free and friendly Iraq was essential to the security of the region and the United States. He cast the war in Iraq as a vital part of a strategy in the Middle East to defeat Al Qaeda and counter Iran. 
 Evidently sensitive to how lower troop levels might be seen -- by enemies abroad and critics at home -- he emphasized in his address that early drawdowns were now possible only because the strategy of sending more troops to Iraq eight months ago had worked. He did not once use the word withdrawal. 
 ''The more successful we are, the more American troops can return home,'' Mr. Bush said, trying once again to win support for a war in Iraq that remains deeply unpopular. 
 The speech was the first time since the war began four and a half years ago that Mr. Bush had outlined a plan for troop reductions, to bring levels down from the current high of 169,000. He held out the prospect of more reductions but committed only to a plan that would withdraw by next July the additional combat units he ordered there in January, leaving a main body of more than 130,000 troops intact.
 In the Democratic response, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a West Point graduate, said that Mr. Bush was making the case for an ''endless and unlimited military presence in Iraq,'' and he vowed that Congress would prevent it.
 ''Once again, the president failed to provide either a plan to successfully end the war or a convincing rationale to continue it,'' said Mr. Reed, an author of a Democratic proposal that would withdraw most combat troops by next spring, but still leave a significant force in Iraq to provide training and security.
 Mr. Bush's 18-minute address culminated several weeks of political stagecraft that included several speeches and a presidential trip to Iraq but also relied heavily on Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, to make the public case for a strategy overseen by the commander in chief.
 While promoting progress in Iraq, Mr. Bush conceded that his vision for Iraq would be a difficult one to achieve. That acknowledgment was punctuated with macabre timing by the assassination on Thursday of a Sunni sheik, Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, who had led a group of tribal leaders into an alliance with the United States and who had met the president during his trip to Iraq only 10 days ago.
 The White House clearly sought to maximize the political benefits from the announcement of a troop reduction, which some military officials said would have had to happen anyway unless the administration took the politically unpalatable step of extending troops' tours in Iraq to longer than 15 months. The first 5,700 troops affected by the pullback would leave Iraq this year -- ''by Christmas,'' Mr. Bush said -- and roughly 18,000 more would do so by mid-July 2008.
 Still, other forces of what came to be called ''the surge'' could remain and new ones could be sent, administration and military officials said Thursday. As a result, the number of troops in Iraq could be higher in the summer of 2008 than it was in the fall of 2006 before the surge began, a fact likely to infuriate Mr. Bush's critics and upset even some Republican supporters.
 Mr. Bush's approach sets the stage for a legislative clash beginning next week in the Senate as Democrats renew their efforts to put together a bipartisan coalition to win approval of legislation forcing a change in policy in Iraq. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Mr. Bush was ''trying to run out the clock on his failed strategy and leave the hard decisions to the next president.''
 Many Democrats, including the presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, have said some American military presence should continue in Iraq beyond Mr. Bush's presidency. But his critics take it for granted that Mr. Bush envisions a presence much bigger and longer than the Democrats would endorse. 
 Mr. Bush, in his remarks, seemed to hope that by beginning a withdrawal, it would mollify those who were increasingly alarmed by the size and cost of the commitment and unite Americans behind the war in a way they have rarely been from the start. ''The way forward I have described tonight makes it possible, for the first time in years, for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together,'' he said.
 That seemed unlikely.
 Democratic leaders did not wait for the formal remarks before they began to render a judgment. ''He wants an open-ended commitment with an open wallet by the American people,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
 As he has in previous addresses, the president sought to recast, or at least rephrase, the war's overarching purpose. While the war began with an American invasion of Iraq, Mr. Bush said the United States and Iraq's current government had the same ''moral and strategic imperatives'' -- to forge an alliance with political, economic and military ties.
 ''We must help Iraq defeat those who threaten its future and also threaten ours,'' he said, citing the role played in Iraq by Iran and its allies, and by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the home-grown Sunni militant group that American intelligence agencies have concluded is foreign-led. The extent of its links to Osama bin Laden's network is unclear.
 ''If we were to be driven out of Iraq, extremists of all strains would be emboldened,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Al Qaeda could gain new recruits and new sanctuaries. Iran would benefit from the chaos and would be encouraged in its efforts to gain nuclear weapons and dominate the region. Extremists could control a key part of the global energy supply.''
 At times, Mr. Bush offered a more upbeat assessment of conditions in Iraq than others have, including a flurry of reports that preceded Thursday's speech. At times, his view seemed even rosier than General Petraeus's did. 
 His descriptions noted positive developments -- ''Ordinary life is beginning to return,'' he said -- while leaving out the grim realities of life in the shadow of death, without basic regular electricity or other services. 
 He warned that pulling out of Iraq could cause ''a humanitarian nightmare'' but did not acknowledge that millions of Iraqis have already been displaced or have fled to neighboring countries. 
 He noted that Iraq's government was ''sharing oil revenues with the provinces'' without mentioning that discussions on a draft law to institutionalize the process -- a key benchmark dictated by Congress -- appear to have collapsed.
 Mr. Bush and other officials had pointed to the new alliance with the Sunni tribes in Anbar Province as one of the most hopeful developments in Iraq since the ''surge'' began. The national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, told the president of Sheik Abdul Sattar's death just as Mr. Bush finished his daily political briefing on Thursday morning.
 This week's testimony of General Petraeus and the American ambassador in Iraq, Ryan C. Crocker, had elated White House officials, who by midweek said they felt they would easily avoid any significant defections by Republican lawmakers and thus face no real legislative constraints in how the administration conducts the war.
 Some Republican strategists, in fact, expressed concern that Mr. Bush even gave Thursday night's speech, suggesting, on condition of anonymity to shield themselves from retribution, that it would have been better to let the general have the last word.
 Still, it has been clear this week that the Democrats have too few votes to impose any real constraints on Mr. Bush's policy, leaving the war's harshest critics frustrated and angry. With so many troops remaining in Iraq well into 2008, the debate over the war is likely to intensify during the presidential campaign.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, on Thursday night expressed confidence that the Republicans could continue to block any effort to set a withdrawal date, and he said he believed that most of his colleagues were satisfied with the president's approach.
 ''The plan General Petraeus has laid out meets a demand that many of my members have been looking for, which is some sign of success that will allow us to reduce our forces in the near future,'' Mr. McConnell said.
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, on his way back from a two-day trip to Iraq, continued to herald signs of success he saw. But Mr. Boehner himself became part of the bitter debate over Iraq, saying in response to a question posed on CNN that ''the investment that we're making today will be a small price if we're able to stop Al Qaeda here.''
 Democrats seized on the remark, accusing him of demeaning the death toll in Iraq, which as of Wednesday stood at 3,765, though aides said he referred only to the financial costs.

HEADLINE: Call for Early Vote May Backfire for Greek Ruling Party

BYLINE: By ANTHEE CARASSAVA

DATELINE: ATHENS, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
Just a month ago, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis called for early parliamentary elections, when his center-right New Democracy party seemed a shoo-in for victory.
 Greece's moribund economy was on the rebound. After three and a half years of sometimes painful changes, the nation had one of the fastest rates of growth in Europe. 
 But much has changed since then, and that is affecting the elections on Sunday. Fires in August tore through forests parched by two months of intense heat, killing at least 65 people, charring half a million acres of farmland, and throwing the government's reflexes into question.
 ''The fires shocked the nation,'' said Theodore A. Couloumbis, vice president of Eliamep, a research organization in Athens. ''They left many Greeks wondering 'if neither the conservatives nor Socialists can prevent such calamity, then who can we turn to?' ''
 With polls indicating that as many as 12 percent of Greece's 10 million voters are undecided, Mr. Karamanlis's conservatives and Pasok, the Socialist party he defeated in 2004 after almost 20 years of uninterrupted Socialist rule, appear to be in one of the toughest races in recent memory. But in those surveys, neither New Democracy nor Pasok polled more than 40 percent, raising the likelihood that the winner will have to share power in a coalition or struggle to govern with a thin majority in the 300-seat Parliament.
 Mr. Karamanlis and his change-minded administration have built a record of economic discipline, slashing the budget deficit. A sharply reduced majority for the conservatives may imperil their hopes to make other changes, including privatizing ailing state enterprises and revamping the social security system.
 Yet discontent with the government's handling of the fires has given little help to the Socialists, despite the thumping campaign style of the party's usually mild-mannered leader, George A. Papandreou.
 The standoff offers the chance for a far-right party to break into Parliament by amassing more than 3 percent of the vote, the threshold for entering the legislature. The Popular Orthodox Rally, which was founded by a politician whom Mr. Karamanlis expelled in 2000 for his extremist statements, has struck a chord among disgruntled voters with a medley of xenophobia, nationalism and anti-American views. 
 Last week, the party leader, Giorgos Karatzaferis, softened his stance, denying accusations of racism and of sympathy for anti-American terrorists at large in Greece.
 He and the Socialists have accused the prime minister of covering up a bond-trading scandal, of tolerating cronyism and of responding ineptly to the fires.
 But Mr. Karamanlis responded with handouts to fire victims, and by offering packages of higher pensions and tax breaks. He also has threatened to hold new elections this fall if his party fails to win an outright majority. 
 ''Voter frustration may continue to linger,'' said Anthony Livanios, president and chief executive of Alpha Metrics, a polling agency in Athens. But, he said, ''Most voters will have to size up to reality and pick the best show of leadership before them.''

HEADLINE: Multiple Audiences, Multiple Messages

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush addressed three very different audiences on Thursday night, and he had to hope that each would hear a different message.
 To an American public overwhelmingly searching for an exit from Iraq, Mr. Bush said that he was now ready to take his first, halting steps toward drawdown -- even if what he described as a ''return on success'' was more akin, in the eyes of his critics, to a recognition that he has run out of additional forces to sustain the troop buildup he began this year, and now has no other choice.
 To Iraq's leaders, who failed to take advantage of what the Bush administration characterized in January as their last chance to reach political reconciliation, Mr. Bush's message was that America would stay for the long haul. But he also warned, once again, that time was running out to hold the country together. 
 And to the insurgents who have fought to force the United States out of Iraq -- and most important to the mullahs in Tehran -- Mr. Bush sent a declaration that the United States was not leaving, and that it would be a force to reckon with for years. He sent the same message, his aides said, to Iraq's Sunni neighbors, who fear that if America throws in the towel the result could be greater chaos, and the rise of Iran as the regional power, perhaps backed by nuclear arms. 
 Mr. Bush's speech was the culmination of a monthlong, highly orchestrated game plan to change the political debate in Washington and the country. But in the end, the speech once again raised the question of what America's mission in Iraq really is -- and how long it will last.
 It also exemplified the balancing act likely to consume the last 16 months of Mr. Bush's presidency, as he tries to hold together wavering members of his party with promises of drawdowns as soon as conditions allow while still talking about a role in Iraq and the region modeled on America's five-decades-long presence on the Korean Peninsula. 
 Many times in recent months, he has told visitors to the White House that he needs to get to the Korea model -- a politically sustainable American deployment to keep the lid on the Middle East.
 That, of course, is a goal very different from the ''victory'' Mr. Bush was touting less than two years ago. But as strategies have come and gone, Mr. Bush's language has changed. From a promise four years ago that ''we'll stand down as they stand up'' -- only to discover that the Iraqi forces were not ready to stand up -- Mr. Bush has pledged to use political progress to bring about security, then to use security of the population to bring about political compromise.
 On Thursday night, he talked about ''success,'' not victory, and suggested that the road ahead would be inching, province-by-province progress that would ultimately allow the United States to focus on training Iraqi units, pursuing Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and containing Iran.
 ''The more successful we are, the more American troops can return home,'' he said. But it is a promise Americans have heard before, and Mr. Bush offered no timelines. 
 ''He wanted to frame this week about a choice,'' said Peter Feaver, a former senior official on the National Security Council who helped draft the troop increase strategy and has returned to teach at Duke University. ''One choice is a withdrawal driven by progress on the ground, and it will be slower than you want. Or you can have withdrawals based on partisan politics, and the results will be faster, but the consequences more dire.'' 
 In framing the debate that way, Mr. Bush appears, at least for now, to have changed the dynamic in Congress. Democrats like the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who a few weeks ago was dismissing plans for gradual drawdowns as ''weak tea,'' are now talking about trying to legislate slower timetables. But some Democrats advising Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have privately expressed fears that Mr. Bush is essentially leaving it to the next president to take the responsibility for a rapid pullout -- and the blame for whatever chaos or civil war may ensue. And even some moderate Republicans have little interest in talking to voters about an enduring troop presence in Iraq or the region, for fear it suggests that there really is no end in sight. 
 That points to a tactical political victory for Mr. Bush, which is very different from the question of whether he can realize the goal he once described so optimistically: a free, unified Iraq. 
 For four years now, a president who was once brimming with optimism about Iraq has been forced to dial back his ambitions, and on Thursday night he even appeared to dial back on how quickly the Iraqi government must achieve the goals that, eight months ago, he insisted were the purpose of the troop increase. This time, Mr. Bush's underlying message was that Iraq would operate on its own clock -- and that Americans should not expect to have leverage over its decisions.
 ''Guess what, this is Iraq,'' one senior administration official told reporters on Thursday afternoon as they pressed him on whether Mr. Bush had abandoned hope of bringing about change in the time frames he had discussed in January. Another senior official argued that the White House had taken an overly America-centric approach. ''It turned out that we could get a lot done in the provinces without passing oil-revenue laws,'' the official said.
 But to Mr. Bush's critics, the speech showed how a president who committed too few troops at the start of the conflict now has failed to give those who remain what Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, on Thursday night called ''clear and achievable missions.''
 In January, the mission was to create the political space for the Iraqis to reach hard compromises. In Thursday night's speech, Mr. Bush acknowledged that those compromises never happened at the national level and said, ''In my meetings with Iraqi leaders, I have made it clear that they must.'' But as the ambassador to Iraq, Ryan C. Crocker, said in his testimony this week, at this point that is more a function of hope than strategy.
 Mr. Bush was more specific about his vision of keeping troops in the region, presumably in Iraq, for years. Iraq's ''success will require U.S. political, economic and security engagement that extends beyond my presidency,'' he said. And in addressing the Iraqi people, he added, ''Have confidence that America does not abandon our friends, and we will not abandon you.''
 When Eisenhower made a similar assurance to South Koreans in 1952, it was intended as a message not only to North Korea, but also China and the Soviet Union.
 On Thursday, the assurance seemed aimed largely at Iran as a warning that Mr. Bush had no intention of leaving an Iran with oil, clout and nuclear ambitions as the greatest beneficiary of a war in which very little has gone as planned, and in which the victory he once saw on the horizon no longer seems a sure bet.

HEADLINE: In Bush's Words: Assessing the War Today, and the Risks to Avoid Tomorrow

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 -- Following are excerpts from a transcript of the address that President Bush delivered Thursday night from the Oval Office.
 Good evening. In the life of all free nations, there come moments that decide the direction of a country and reveal the character of its people. 
 We are now at such a moment. 
 In Iraq, an ally of the United States is fighting for its survival. Terrorists and extremists who are at war with us around the world are seeking to topple Iraq's government, dominate the region, and attack us here at home. If Iraq's young democracy can turn back these enemies, it will mean a more hopeful Middle East and a more secure America. This ally has placed its trust in the United States. And tonight, our moral and strategic imperatives are one: We must help Iraq defeat those who threaten its future and also threaten ours. 
 Eight months ago, we adopted a new strategy to meet that objective, including a surge in U.S. forces that reached full strength in June. This week, Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker testified before Congress about how that strategy is progressing. In their testimony, these men made clear that our challenge in Iraq is formidable. Yet they concluded that conditions in Iraq are improving, that we are seizing the initiative from the enemy, and that the troop surge is working.
 The premise of our strategy is that securing the Iraqi population is the foundation for all other progress. For Iraqis to bridge sectarian divides, they need to feel safe in their homes and neighborhoods. For lasting reconciliation to take root, Iraqis must feel confident that they do not need sectarian gangs for security. The goal of the surge is to provide that security and to help prepare Iraqi forces to maintain it. As I will explain tonight, our success in meeting these objectives now allows us to begin bringing some of our troops home.
 Since the surge was announced in January, it has moved through several phases. First was the flow of additional troops into Iraq, especially Baghdad and Anbar Province. Once these forces were in place, our commanders launched a series of offensive operations to drive terrorists and militias out of their strongholds. 
 ...Throughout Iraq, too many citizens are being killed by terrorists and death squads. And for most Iraqis, the quality of life is far from where it should be. Yet General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker report that the success in Anbar is beginning to be replicated in other parts of the country...These gains are a tribute to our military, they are a tribute to the courage of the Iraqi security forces, and they are the tribute to an Iraqi government that has decided to take on the extremists. 
 Now the Iraqi government must bring the same determination to achieving reconciliation. This is an enormous undertaking after more than three decades of tyranny and division. The government has not met its own legislative benchmarks, and in my meetings with Iraqi leaders, I have made it clear that they must. Yet Iraq's national leaders are getting some things done. For example, they have passed a budget. They are sharing oil revenues with the provinces. They are allowing former Baathists to rejoin Iraq's military or receive government pensions. Local reconciliation is taking place. 
 The key now is to link this progress in the provinces to progress in Baghdad. As local politics change, so will national politics. 
 Our troops in Iraq are performing brilliantly. Along with Iraqi forces, they have captured or killed an average of more than 1,500 enemy fighters per month since January. Yet ultimately, the way forward depends on the ability of Iraqis to maintain security gains. According to General Petraeus and a panel chaired by retired Gen. Jim Jones, the Iraqi Army is becoming more capable, although there is still a great deal of work to be done to improve the National Police. Iraqi forces are receiving increased cooperation from local populations. And this is improving their ability to hold areas that have been cleared. 
 Because of this success, General Petraeus believes we have now reached the point where we can maintain our security gains with fewer American forces. He has recommended that we not replace about 2,200 Marines scheduled to leave Anbar Province later this month. In addition, he says it will soon be possible to bring home an Army combat brigade, for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by Christmas. 
 And he expects that by July, we will be able to reduce our troop levels in Iraq from 20 combat brigades to 15. 
 General Petraeus also recommends that in December, we begin transitioning to the next phase of our strategy in Iraq. As terrorists are defeated, civil society takes root, and the Iraqis assume more control over their own security, our mission in Iraq will evolve. Over time, our troops will shift from leading operations, to partnering with Iraqi forces, and eventually to overwatching those forces. As this transition in our mission takes place, our troops will focus on a more limited set of tasks, including counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi forces. 
 I have consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other members of my national security team, Iraqi officials, and leaders of both parties in Congress. I have benefited from their advice, and I have accepted General Petraeus's recommendations. ...The principle guiding my decisions on troop levels in Iraq is ''return on success.'' The more successful we are, the more American troops can return home. And in all we do, I will ensure that our commanders on the ground have the troops and flexibility they need to defeat the enemy.
 ... The way forward I have described tonight makes it possible, for the first time in years, for people who have been on opposite sides of this difficult debate to come together. 
 This vision for a reduced American presence also has the support of Iraqi leaders from all communities. At the same time, they understand that their success will require U.S. political, economic, and security engagement that extends beyond my presidency. These Iraqi leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with America. And we are ready to begin building that relationship -- in a way that protects our interests in the region and requires many fewer American troops. 
 The success of a free Iraq is critical to the security of the United States. A free Iraq will deny Al Qaeda a safe haven. A free Iraq will counter the destructive ambitions of Iran. 
 ... If we were to be driven out of Iraq, extremists of all strains would be emboldened. Al Qaeda could gain new recruits and new sanctuaries. Iran would benefit from the chaos and would be encouraged in its efforts to gain nuclear weapons and dominate the region. Extremists could control a key part of the global energy supply. Iraq could face a humanitarian nightmare. Democracy movements would be violently reversed. We would leave our children to face a far more dangerous world. And as we saw on September the 11th, 2001, those dangers can reach our cities and kill our people. 
 Whatever political party you belong to, whatever your position on Iraq, we should be able to agree that America has a vital interest in preventing chaos and providing hope in the Middle East. We should be able to agree that we must defeat Al Qaeda, counter Iran, help the Afghan government, work for peace in the Holy Land, and strengthen our military so we can prevail in the struggle against terrorists and extremists. 
 ... Some say the gains we are making in Iraq come too late. They are mistaken. It is never too late to deal a blow to Al Qaeda. It is never too late to advance freedom.

HEADLINE: Why Well-Placed Officers Differ on Troop Reduction

BYLINE: By DAVID S. CLOUD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 

 BODY:
The view of the way forward in Iraq that President Bush articulated on Thursday night was the same one that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, has outlined in Washington all week. 
 It holds that the military effort there is showing signs of success, that too fast a withdrawal would be foolhardy, and that while the future will be difficult and full of setbacks, it is possible to envision that the American strategy will pay off in the future.
 But that vision, which defers a firm decision on steeper reductions in the force, remains deeply unpopular to some current and retired officers, who say the White House and its battlefield commander are continuing to strain the troops, with little prospect of long-term success. 
 It is the second time in 10 months that Mr. Bush has opted for higher troop levels in Iraq than are favored by some of his senior military advisers. Among those who supported a smaller troop increase than the one Mr. Bush ordered last January were members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Now, some of his advisers would prefer setting a faster timetable for drawing the force back down.
 Some even suggest that Mr. Bush's portrayal of the strategy as relying heavily on recommendations from General Petraeus has been more than a little disingenuous, given that it was unlikely that a battlefield commander would repudiate his own plans.
 ''This approach can work for brief periods in many places, but it's not a good long-term solution,'' said Douglas A. Macgregor, a retired Army colonel and a critic of the Bush administration's handling of Iraq. He called General Petraeus's testimony ''another deceitful attempt on the part of the generals and their political masters to extend our stay in the country long enough until Bush leaves office.''
 General Petraeus told lawmakers during two days of Congressional testimony this week that his plan for reducing the American presence in Iraq by five combat brigades through mid-July was ''fully supported'' by Adm. William J. Fallon, the chief of Central Command and the senior American commander in the Middle East, as well as by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 The general said, ''There has been no recommendation I am aware of that would have laid out by any of those individuals a more rapid withdrawal.'' 
 He acknowledged though that he and other top-ranking officers had begun ''discussions about the pace of the mission transition,'' a debate that remains unresolved and is likely to flare up again early next year, during a promised further review of additional troop cuts. 
 Among active-duty officers, the voices of skepticism about Mr. Bush's approach have been more muted, but they have been significant. The officers who have pushed for deeper cuts have questioned whether his timetable -- a drawdown to 15 combat brigades next July, from 20 now -- would allow the Army to meet its minimum goal of giving soldiers at least a year at home for every year they are deployed.
 Even before General Petraeus appeared before Congress this week, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, last week questioned the significance of what his colleague had achieved. 
 General Casey, who was General Petraeus's predecessor as the top commander in Iraq, said that while the decision to send additional forces had produced a ''tactical effect'' and brought ''a temporary and local impact on the security situation,'' the ''$64,000 question'' was ''whether the opportunities created by the military could be taken advantage of by the Iraqi political leadership.''
 ''I think a smaller force will cause Iraqis to do more faster,'' General Casey added, speaking at a breakfast sponsored by Government Executive magazine.
 Advisers close to General Petraeus say General Casey's comments were hardly those of a disinterested observer, given that he was effectively dismissed from his post in Iraq as conditions worsened during his tenure.
 But his critique goes beyond deeper. He and others on the Joint Chiefs of Staff contend that the current force levels in Iraq cannot be sustained, given the current size of the Army.
 Among Mr. Bush's other senior military advisers, differences about how deep the cuts should go appeared to have been set aside with the decision to postpone further decisions until next spring. 
 Admiral Fallon was said by some officers to believe that only by giving the Iraqi government a clearer sense that the American troop commitment was limited would the Iraqis take steps aimed at achieving reconciliation.
 He also worries about having enough forces in reserve to handle contingencies outside Iraq and in Afghanistan. 
 Adm. Michael G. Mullen, the current chief of naval operations, who takes over as chairman of the Joint Chiefs next month, has also raised concerns about force levels, though he also cautions against a withdrawal before the current strategy is allowed to work.
 The deeper doubts voiced by General Casey about the prospects for Iraqi reconciliation are shared by the retired general John P. Abizaid, who led the Central Command until January. 
 ''It was clear that putting additional troops in would gain temporary security,'' General Abizaid said in a rare interview on Tuesday with The Associated Press. 
 ''What was not clear to me was what we were going to do diplomatically, economically, politically and informationally to make sure that we moved forward in a way that wasn't just temporary.''

HEADLINE: What to Own If Economy Turns Sour

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
CONCERN about a recession seems to have swelled in recent days with each speech made by a Federal Reserve official enumerating signs of economic weakness. Their aim may be to telegraph the Fed's intention to cut interest rates next week in a pre-emptive strike against a recession, but if you doubt that one can be staved off, there are steps you can take to inoculate your portfolio.
 A true recession, typically defined as an extended period in which the economy shrinks, is rare, but when one comes along, it almost always decimates stocks. Earnings fall sharply, and share prices tend to fall even further as investors anticipate slowed growth. 
 Not every stock will fall in a recession, but very few will rise. Investors who hold a significant portion of their wealth in stocks through a recession risk seeing their net worth diminish.
 ''I don't think there's a way to recession-proof a portfolio,'' said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. ''There's only a way to mitigate risk.''
 That way is to shed shares of companies whose products and services people are most able to do without or delay purchasing, known as consumer discretionaries. They include makers of cars and electronics, as well as airlines and hotel companies.
 Mr. Levkovich, who does not consider a recession imminent, said providers of essentials can be a haven.
 Citi has buy ratings on the food producer ConAgra and on Allergan, which makes Botox and other medical and cosmetic items.
 Walter T. McCormick, lead manager of the Evergreen Fundamental Large Cap fund, recognizes a wider set of needs. His list includes tobacco products, alcohol and communication.
 If a recession were on its way, he said, he would put money into large defensive businesses like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the British liquor company Diageo, Verizon, AT&T, the tobacco seller Altria, and two makers of household and personal-care products, Procter & Gamble and Clorox.
 ''All of these pay pretty good dividends and will continue to grow through thick and thin and have products that people use all the time,'' Mr. McCormick said.
 P. Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at the New York fund manager TIAA-CREF, said he considers the odds of a recession to be less than 50 percent. Before seeing employment data take a turn for the worse last week, he was more optimistic. Finding investments that hold their own in a recession will be especially difficult, he predicted.
 ''Where do you hide?'' Mr. Hammond asked. ''Do interest rates have a long way to go down? I don't think so. Do stocks have a long way to go up? In the short run, who knows?''
 IF stocks and the traditional sanctuary of bonds are ruled out, then what? Mr. Hammond's suggestion is to consider a nontraditional refuge: real estate.
 That idea might not sit well with homeowners trying to stave off foreclosure, but he was referring to offices, industrial buildings and rental apartments, not single-family homes. 
 ''We haven't overbuilt in the last 10 years the way we have with condos and single-family homes in some areas,'' Mr. Hammond said. If a recession hits, ''we may not have a huge run-up in office demand, but we have not had a huge run-up in supply.''
 A recession may even give a lift to apartment prices, he added, ''as people who would have bought homes start to think about rentals.''
 For those interested in real estate, Mr. Hammond suggested real estate investment trusts, portfolios of properties that trade on stock exchanges.
 But before investing in real estate, he said, consider whether making wholesale portfolio adjustments to anticipate a recession is a sensible move. 
 ''We really believe that you shouldn't be thinking about the next recession,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''You should be thinking about the next four full cycles.''
 The timing and duration of recessions are notoriously difficult to predict. To come out ahead, ''you've got to be right twice,'' he pointed out. ''You've got to be right to get out of stocks, and you've got to be right to get in again. That's a pretty hard call to make.''

HEADLINE: Thompson, Seeking a Theme, Takes On a Tricky Issue: Entitlements

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
As Fred D. Thompson moves around the country delivering his folksy stump speech, he routinely makes his way through a laundry list of top concerns: national security, immigration reform, federalism and activist judges, among others.
 But he seems most energized when he discusses the ballooning cost of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, and what he calls a need for more fiscal responsibility and less government in Washington. It is a recurring campaign theme of his. 
 Mr. Thompson, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, made his greatest plea for the presidency, for instance, at the end of such remarks this week at a stop in Greenville, S.C., saying: ''We're going to be going through the Social Security surplus before long, along with the pork barreling and spending and the regular stuff that's going on now, we're seeing a demographic change.'' 
 ''No politician wants to face up to it,'' he said. ''We've got to send a message to Washington that we are better than that. And you can do that by electing a president who will blow the whistle on that irresponsibility for what it is -- and I am that man.''
 Audiences usually break into enthusiastic applause at this point, adding spark to a kickoff campaign tour that some analysts have seen as lackluster. But political analysts and others say Mr. Thompson's focus on issues like entitlements and spending could be risky and, if discussed honestly and in-depth, carries the potential of alienating large segments of the population: the elderly who benefit from such programs and the workers whose payroll taxes may be increased to support baby boomers in their retirement.
 ''It's a treacherous track on the entitlement question,'' said Michael Franc, vice president of government relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ''Voters tend to gravitate toward the free-lunch rhetoric and believe the unbelievable.''
 Experts agree that the current path of entitlements is economically unsustainable given the demographic shifts under way in American society. The first wave of baby boomers will be eligible for early retirement next year, marking a turning point, analysts say, that will eventually force hard choices, including whether to require workers to pay more into the Social Security and Medicare systems and whether to scale back benefits for retirees or raise the age at which retirees are eligible for benefits.
 Mr. Thompson has been characteristically vague when it comes to detailing a strategy to combat the looming crisis, although in a recent interview with The Washington Post he said he would have opposed the recent prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, calling it ''a $17 trillion add-on to a program that's going bankrupt.'' Pressed for more specifics, his campaign offered few details yesterday.
 Washington has been reluctant to touch Social Security, which last went through major changes in 1983, after a bipartisan commission tried to assure its long-term solvency through a mix of benefit reductions cuts and tax increases. Experts say another fix is now needed.
 ''The dilemma candidates now face is that if you tell the truth about the hard choices and where you stand, you might not get elected,'' said David R. Gergen, professor of public service at Harvard University and an adviser to Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. 
 ''But if you don't tell the truth and manage to win, you can't govern,'' Mr. Gergen added. ''It's clear Thompson is trying to reach the conservative base and say, I care about your concerns.''
 The problem is not just Mr. Thompson's. Other candidates, Republican and Democratic, are also doing a delicate dance around the issue. But it is perhaps most acute for Mr. Thompson because he is positioning himself as the small-government conservative in the race.
 He proclaims the fact that he voted for tax cuts while in the Senate, and against bills that he said included wasteful spending, including one farm measure. He voted for the No Child Left Behind education bill, a stance that has caused him some regret on the campaign trail. (He has said that at the time he did not realize what the ultimate outcome would be.)
 Mr. Thompson often cites the future burden of government spending, but usually with broad generalizations. In Greenville last week, he said, ''One thing that concerns me is that while our attention is there and our economy right now is good, so many in Congress are busily at work -- and that in itself ought to make you concerned -- they're busily at work spending the money of future generations.''
 At another point he said, ''I wonder what these kids would say, I wonder what the unborn would say if they had a seat at the table, what they would say to us, what they would think about us.''
 To some extent, Mr. Thompson cannot afford not to talk about such issues. ''Basically the whole game for any Republican right now is base mobilization,'' said Jack M. Burkman, a Republican strategist and lobbyist. ''Whoever gets their base out the best on Feb. 5 is going to be the nominee. Those are hot-button issues for different parts of the base.''
 But going forward, Mr. Thompson will probably be pressed to outline his plan for dealing with entitlement spending.
 ''What does he stand for?'' asked Stephen Hess, a professor at George Washington University who has worked for two Republican presidents. ''Being for small government ain't sufficient in the Republican Party.''

HEADLINE: Fluke on the Brink

 BODY:
Of all the ingredients of a successful summertime party-boat fishing trip in the Northeast -- beer, ice, sunscreen and fluke as big as doormats -- only one comes in limited supplies. Like many other species, fluke have been overfished for decades. A serious test of whether the federal government can finally change that, and protect other species as well, is at hand. 
 Last year Congress revised the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the basic law regulating fishing in national waters, to give it sharper teeth. Although catch limits for vulnerable species have been in place for years, they are too generous and are routinely exceeded. The revised law gives scientists a much greater say in establishing firm catch limits to ensure that overfished species recover within a finite period, generally 10 years. 
 Seven years into its recovery plan, the fluke population is only about halfway to the goal of 197 million pounds set for 2013. Fishery managers must now find a way to make up tens of millions of pounds of fluke in about five years. That means much lower quotas, and acute pain in the fishing industry. 
 A scientific panel of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, one of the regional councils that manage fishing in federal waters, concluded in July that the 2008 fluke quota would have to be about 12 million pounds to give the species a decent shot at recovering on schedule. The council is instead endorsing a quota of nearly 16 million pounds, trying to balance the fate of the fluke with the economic needs of those who catch them.
 Fishing interests, unsurprisingly, want an even bigger catch. Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey argues that the 2013 goal is unreachable, and that next year's quota should be 17.5 million pounds. That gives his state's fishing boats a short-term breather, but would leave the fluke recovery dead in the water.
 It is easy to sympathize with the hard-working fishermen who say that drastically lower quotas would be devastating and who insist that there are still plenty of fluke out there. But at some point overfishing has to stop. Rejecting the sound conclusions of scientists would undermine the revised federal law in its first real test and could push the fluke populations into potentially irreversible decline. The National Marine Fisheries Service must decide next month on the 2008 quotas. It should keep the fluke catch within the lowest range of what the best available science recommends.

HEADLINE: A Good Time to Sharpen Furniture Shopping Skills

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
IT may seem odd to mention now, with a housing slowdown upon us and recession fears suddenly real, but it is a great time to buy furniture.
 Even before the housing bubble burst, the furniture industry was in the throes of consolidation, as an influx of imports from the Asia spurred price competition that cut profit margins and forced many mom-and-pop stores to close and discount retailers like Costco to jump in.
 For consumers, that means lower prices at the big-box furniture store. 
 ''Discounting is the name of the game today,'' said Leonard B. Lewin, author of ''Shopping for Furniture: A Consumer's Guide.'' 
 Three decades ago, he said, consumers could count on sales twice a year, in July and August and in January and February. ''Now there are sales every day of the week,'' Mr. Lewin said. ''There isn't a store in town that isn't routinely discounting 40 percent off the manufacturer's suggested retail price.''
 Last year, the top 100 furniture stores posted a 6.6 percent increase in sales, to about $32 billion, according to Furniture Today, an industry publication. That was down from an 8.3 percent gain in 2005. 
 Ashley Furniture HomeStores supplanted Rooms to Go as the top store chain in 2006, according to the ranking. 
 The government reported yesterday that sales at furniture stores rose 0.5 percent in August from July as overall retail sales edged slightly higher on the strength of auto sales. Economists are keeping a close eye on consumer spending, which has slowed this year in the face of higher gasoline prices and the cooling housing market.
 The discounting trend is even more pronounced in the home furnishings market, according to a recent report from Morgan Keegan & Company, a brokerage firm based in Memphis. Sales have remained weak this year at companies like Pier 1 Imports, Bombay, Williams-Sonoma, Kirklands and Cost Plus World Market. Discounting is likely to continue through the end of the year, the report said.
 Even Bed Bath & Beyond, which has gained market share at the expense of competitors, is feeling the ill effects of recent economic trends.
 A sale is what brought Frances Auerbach of New York City to the new Raymour & Flanigan Furniture store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan in August. She found an accent chair she wanted on sale and bought it.
 On a return visit this week to schedule a delivery date, she sat in the chair again, pleased with her purchase. ''I have difficulty in finding a chair, so I'm excited. This is just perfect for my back,'' she said. 
 ''Consumers are smart,'' said Vicky D'Agostino, director for communications at Raymour & Flanigan. They use the Internet and circulars to compare and research brands, construction and size. 
 Larry Gallagher, Raymour & Flanigan's president for metropolitan New York, added: ''Yes, we have sales, but the real draw is the quality merchandise that consumers can get sooner than expected.'' Raymour & Flanigan, ranked 11th by Furniture Today, offers three-day delivery for all furnishings.
 To be sure, buying furniture can be fraught with pitfalls, including financing and delivery. 
 ''Shopping for furniture is treacherous,'' James Hood, editor of ConsumerAffairs.com, wrote in an e-mail message. ''The only 100 percent sure way to get what you pay for is to buy the items you want off the floor, load them into your truck or van and take them home with you.''
 With a little planning, consumers can minimize the potential for bad outcomes by following the advice of the specialists:
 RESEARCH Approach furniture buying as you would car buying, Mr. Lewin said. Research brands and retailers, and examine rankings and quality reports. Do your homework on the Internet, but don't necessarily buy there. If you do, he said, pay with a credit card and make sure you understand the return policy.
 ROOM PLANS Raymour & Flanigan and other retailers now offer online room planning tools on their Web sites (raymourflanigan.com).
 Steve Street, the chief executive of Icovia Inc., which has created the room planning software, says it allows consumers to enter the dimensions of a room, add door widths, place windows and drop furniture into the room and move items around as they wish.
 After registering at the retailer's site, buyers can save their designs, e-mail them and go to the store and change the plan on a store computer once they see the furniture. ''Design and fit are the major questions they need answered before they buy the product,'' Mr. Street said. 
 Icovia is also working with property managers. Prospective buyers of condominiums at Number 5 NYC in Midtown, for instance, can use Icovia's Interactive Space Planner to view floor plans and see how the space would look furnished with items from the Ligne Roset catalog.
 STORE VISIT The biggest mistake people make is they don't really test how well the item sits, Mr. Lewin, the author, said. If it's a couch or chair, sit on it for as long as you can, he said. ''Everybody is in a hurry, but hold off ordering until you can come back and see if it feels good.''
 Come prepared with measurements. ''When you're out spending thousands of dollars, you should have a plan with precise schematics and dimensions,'' he said, both square feet and cubic feet to account for higher ceilings.
 Don't just look at the furniture, he said, ''heft it,'' pick up an arm to see if it's heavy. Lighter-weight material might be of lesser quality. Look at the pattern match. Fabric is a big clue to the care that went into production, he said. If the item is a table or dresser made of wood, examine the finish. Check the drawers and the back panels. If it has cardboard components, quality may be an issue.
 What you see in the showroom may not be what you get, Mr. Hood of ConsumerAffairs.com wrote. To avoid this, he writes, find a furniture warehouse, outlet or resale center that stocks the kind of furniture you want. ''Many of these are open only on weekends. It might sound silly, but it's the surest way of getting what you want, and, if you're careful, can be the most economical way of getting good quality furniture.''
 DELIVERY Heeding Mr. Hood's advice means no problems on the receiving end. Many consumers write to ConsumerAffairs.com to relate delivery nightmares, he said. 
 ''Delivery problems are horrendous and getting worse,'' he writes. ''Deliveries are often late, the crews are often ill-trained, rude and incompetent -- and sometimes larcenous. The furniture that is delivered may not be what you ordered, it may be damaged or it may not fit through the door.
 ''If any of these occurs, it's just the beginning of a long series of frustrating conversations with customer service,'' he said.
 LAYAWAYS AND FINANCING Many stores still offer layaway plans, which allow you to pay off the furniture before it is delivered. Retailers also have many buy-now, pay-later financing arrangements that are tailored to a consumer's credit history and financial standing. 
 Pay cash or use a credit card, Mr. Wood said. ''Layaway or other store-based financing is almost always a mistake. It's a good way to lose all of your money, in the case of layaway,'' when a furniture store declares bankruptcy or goes out of business. Financing plans often cost more than consumers expect, he added.
 Just like car dealers, retailers lure buyers with no-interest financing over longer periods. At Raymour & Flanigan, buyers who qualify can finance $1,000 a year, interest free, for up to four years. Borrowers must make monthly payments, and there is no prepayment penalty.
 Still, experts say, if consumers miss a payment on these finance plans or fail to pay off the balance on the due date, they are often hit with double-digit interest rate charges that some stores back-date to the time of purchase.
 It is a personal choice, Mr. Lewin says, but still consumers should recognize that they are changing rooms much more frequently today -- every couple of years instead of every decade. If consumers are buying now and paying later, they may need to get rid of the furniture before it is paid off, because of lifestyle changes. ''The smart shopper spends what they can afford. Period.''
 This week, Christopher McCall of Brooklyn returned to Raymour & Flanigan in Manhattan to arrange delivery for furniture he bought for his mother. He said he spent about $15,000 during the opening sale. Asked about financing, he smiled and said: ''I wish. I paid cash.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose Slightly In August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Retail sales posted a modest gain in August, helped by the biggest jump in auto sales in more than a year. But concerns remained that spending could falter as the housing downturn and turbulence in the financial market weigh on consumer confidence.
 The Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales increased 0.3 percent in August from July, when sales were up 0.5 percent. The strength last month was led by a 2.8 percent jump in auto sales, the biggest increase since July 2006. 
 Still, the increase in retail sales was about half what had been expected. In another sign of weakness, industrial production in August edged up by just 0.2 percent.
 It was the poorest performance in three months, reflecting a 0.3 percent drop in output at American factories, the first decline in manufacturing after five consecutive increases.
 A separate report Friday showed that consumer confidence, as measured by the RBC Cash Index, fell to 71.1 in early September, a sharp drop from an August reading of 89.3. It was the worst showing for the survey, done by the polling firm Ipsos, since May 2006.
 The gain in industrial output followed much stronger increases of 0.5 percent in July and 0.6 percent in June.
 The drop in manufacturing output was accompanied by a decline of 0.6 percent in mining, the category that includes oil production.
 These declines were offset by a 5.3 percent surge in output at utilities, reflecting a hotter-than-usual August.
 The government also said that the current account, the broadest measure of trade, totaled $190.8 billion in the second quarter, down 3.1 percent from $197.1 billion in the first three months of the year.
 The trade improvement supported the view of economists that America's trade deficit, after setting records for five consecutive years, should finally begin to decline in 2007, helped by stronger overseas growth and a weaker dollar, which increases the competitiveness of American products.
 Inventories held by businesses on shelves and back lots rose by 0.5 percent in July, the Commerce Department said Friday, while sales at all levels of production were up 1.1 percent.
 The weaker-than-expected rise in August retail sales added to worries that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, could falter in coming months.
 ''We expect a clearly slowing trend,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''Lower confidence and the accelerating housing collapse will hurt.''
 The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, and there is a widespread belief that the central bank will cut a crucial interest rate for the first time in four years, hoping that cheaper credit will give the economy a boost.
 Financial markets have been roiled since early August by rising worries that loans to consumers and businesses are becoming harder to obtain as banks and other lenders tighten standards.
 The credit tightness began with rising defaults on subprime mortgages, home loans provided to borrowers with weak credit. Those problems have spread to other lending areas and disturbed global financial markets.
 The retail sales performance would have been much weaker without the big gain in auto sales in August. Excluding autos, retail sales would have fallen by 0.4 percent, the poorest showing in nearly a year.
 Part of the in August came from a 2.4 percent drop in sales at gasoline stations, reflecting declining prices.
 With oil at a record above $80 a barrel, however, analysts predicted that gasoline prices would start climbing again and that consumers would have less money to spend on other items.
 Sales at department and general merchandise stores edged up 0.3 percent in August, reflecting strong back-to-school sales.
 Sales at furniture stores were up 0.5 percent but sales declined by 1 percent at hardware stores.
 Sales at specialty clothing stores dropped by 0.1 percent.

HEADLINE: With Powdered Wigs and Powerful Ideas, They Changed the Way the World Is Run

BYLINE: By JOHN STEELE GORDON

 BODY:
THE GREAT UPHEAVAL:
 America and the Birth of the Modern World, 1788-1800.
 By Jay Winik. 
 Illustrated. 659 pages. Harper. $29.95
 The late 17th and especially the 18th century are remembered as the Age of Enlightenment, when an extraordinary burst of intellectual activity transformed Western civilization through advances in science and philosophy. In politics men like Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire and Rousseau thought deeply and wrote extensively about how people should be governed and who should do the governing.
 But until the late 18th century, their work had been almost entirely theoretical, for ancient monarchies ruled, and constitutions were unwritten. Except in Britain, where the aristocracy ran Parliament, power almost always flowed from the top down. 
 That began to change in 1789, as men on both sides of the Atlantic tried to turn intellectual theory into political reality. In that year the United States Constitution went into effect with the inauguration of George Washington, and the French Revolution began with the fall of the Bastille. 
 The two events were intimately interconnected. French help had been crucial to victory in the American Revolution, but it bankrupted the French government, and the ensuing fiscal crisis led directly to the collapse of the ancien regime. Lafayette, presented with the keys to the Bastille, sent one to George Washington. With the help of Thomas Jefferson, then minister to France, Lafayette would write a draft of the Declaration of the Rights of Man. Tom Paine, whose ''Common Sense'' was a major spark to the American Revolution, came within inches of losing his head to the guillotine in the French one.
 The results of trying to turn political theory into political fact in France and the United States, however, could hardly have been more dissimilar. The United States still lives under the Constitution it established in 1789. In 1801 John Adams, defeated in an election, peacefully turned the presidency over to Jefferson, a transfer of power virtually without precedent in human history. 
 The French Revolution produced only what Margaret Thatcher tartly described as ''a pile of corpses and a tyrant.'' Since 1789 France -- still trying to make theory work in practice -- has been through three kingdoms, two empires and five republics. 
 Jay Winik's new book, ''The Great Upheaval,'' describes these world-changing events and many others, especially in Catherine the Great's Russia and Poland. Catherine, who corresponded with Voltaire and other philosophers, was an absolute monarch first and an enlightened one second. When revolution threatened, she brutally suppressed it. None of Louis XVI's dithering for her. Poland tried to establish a new government with an American-inspired Constitution in 1791. For its troubles it was wiped off the map by its neighbors, as Russia, Austria and Prussia divvied up the country among themselves.
 Mr. Winik vividly portrays the tumultuous times in which America embarked on the great experiment, testing whether a continent-size country could successfully establish representative government. (Montesquieu, for one, had thought republics only suitable to city-states.) 
 Meanwhile, Europe plunged into a war that would go on, with one brief truce, for nearly 25 years. But while absolute monarchs would last into the 20th century, the genie was out of the bottle. What America had started -- government of the people, by the people and for the people -- would slowly spread around the world, and power would begin to flow up, not down.
 Mr. Winik, author of the altogether excellent ''April 1865,'' about the end of the American Civil War, commands the material on events and personalities in this country. But he seems less sure of himself when dealing with Europe. For instance, he writes that the British crown ''approached the German House of Hesse to make use of mercenary Hanoverians.'' The Landgrave of Hesse made a good living renting out his army to larger countries. But George III was already the sovereign Elector of Hanover. He could hire Hanoverians himself. 
 Mr. Winik describes France in 1783, after the British defeat in the American Revolution, as ''the globe's mightiest empire.'' The French empire in 1783 consisted of a few sugar islands in the West Indies, and France was broke. He also lists little Denmark, Holland and Portugal as being among the great powers of Europe.
 Of more moment, Mr. Winik devotes considerable space to Catherine the Great's wars against the Ottoman Empire. But these wars have little, if anything, to do with his subject: the new political world being born in the wake of the American and French revolutions. They were simply good, old-fashioned wars of aggression by a rising power against a declining one. 
 Further, he wildly overstates Catherine's importance in the American Revolution. Robert Middlekauff's ''Glorious Cause,'' the best comprehensive one-volume history of the revolution, doesn't even mention her.
 ''The Great Upheaval'' is a long book and, I'm afraid, it seems it, with far too many capsule histories behind peripheral events (like the building of Versailles 100 years earlier, and even the Salem witch trials of the same era) and biographies of peripheral figures. This 659-page book would have been a better one at 400 pages.
 Missing from this book, however, is any mention of England's Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which the power of the monarch was decisively curbed, and Parliament became an equal player. It was a singularly important moment in the history of the development of representative government, one the American founding fathers were deeply imbued with, so its omission is very strange indeed.
 And the author has a frequent tendency toward the hyperbolic that someone should have curbed. ''Within essentially a single generation,'' he writes, ''arguably greater progress had been made politically than in all the millennia since the beginning of time.'' That, frankly, is ridiculous. 
 There is much to admire in ''The Great Upheaval,'' which tells an important story and, when it sticks to the subject, tells it well, for Mr. Winik is a gifted writer. I just wish that ''The Great Upheaval'' did not so often give the impression that the author was being paid by the word.
 John Steele Gordon is the author of ''An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power'' (HarperCollins, 2004).

HEADLINE: Banks Try Easing Into A $26 Billion Debt Sale

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Banks financing the purchase of the First Data Corporation by the equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts made several concessions on the debt sale yesterday as they tried to lure skittish investors.
 The seven banks, led by Credit Suisse and Citigroup, plan to sell only $5 billion in loans at this point to finance the $26 billion deal, which includes $24 billion in debt. Much of the rest will be sold later to avoid flooding the market. 
 With more than $330 billion in deals in the pipeline, investors and bankers have waited to see how the First Data sale would unfold. Because of its size, the deal is widely seen as an important indicator of whether the credit markets, which froze over the summer, have begun to thaw. 
 ''Everyone is sort of sitting back and waiting for the first deal to come,'' Manny Labrinos, an analyst at Nuveen Investments, said.
 When the banks meet with investors on Monday at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, they are expected to offer the loan at 96 cents on the dollar, or a 4 percent discount, with an interest rate of 2.75 percent over the London interbank offered rate. The firms have reserved the right to sell an additional $3 billion in loans by the end of the year. In addition, the banks must sell $9 billion in bonds.
 ''It's a good start to break the logjam,'' said Matthew Eagan a vice president and portfolio manager at the investment firm Loomis Sayles. ''Whether this gets done remains to be seen, but it's nice to see investment banks finally show their cards.'' Over the last two years, banks have rushed to finance private equity deals, collecting lucrative fees along the way even as they discarded traditional investor protections. But as concerns over subprime mortgages spilled over into the corporate sector this summer, investors grew wary of the high-yield loans and bonds at the heart of leveraged buyouts. 
 Before, banks counted on reselling their loans to buyout firms in the debt markets, quickly recouping their investment. Now, they face the possibility of holding much of the debt.
 This week, banks involved with the Allison Transmission buyout -- including Citigroup -- sold about $1 billion out of $3.5 billion in loans to finance the deal for the company, an auto parts maker.
 ''Every point is coming out of the bankers' hides,'' said Andrew Feltus, a senior vice president and portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments. ''But the banks put themselves in this corner.''
 The Allison deal appears to have provided a blueprint for the much larger First Data sale. Beyond the 4 percent discount on the loans, banks in both deals have broken up the total loan portion of the debt offering.
 ''They've learned from large deals that have been struggling lately,'' said Chris Donnelly, who tracks leveraged finance for Standard & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data. ''They've incorporated what has worked into this deal to give it its best chance at success.''
 Both the Allison and First Data offerings included what amounts to a buyer's protection plan against further price cuts on the loans. Under what is known as a most-favored-nations clause, if the banks sell a second slice of loans at a greater discount this year, they will refund the difference to buyers of the first round of loans.
 While the banks have made compromises to help move the loans off their books, the private equity firms so far appear not to have budged. Despite entreaties from its banks to make changes to their financing agreements, Kohlberg Kravis has agreed to only a few changes. 
 They include a covenant limiting to 7.25 times earnings the amount of senior secured debt First Data can take on; analysts described that as lenient to the private equity firm.
 Even the current pricing struck some analysts as potentially unappetizing to investors. Analysts for KDP Advisors, a high-yield research firm, had projected a discount of 94 cents or 95 cents on the dollar.

HEADLINE: Sheik's Allies Vow Revenge for His Killing

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Ali Hamdani contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Anbar, Diyala and Salahuddin Provinces.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Tribal sheiks in flowing robes, American military commanders in pressed uniforms and senior members of the Iraqi government gathered Friday at the sprawling desert farm of a prominent Sunni Arab tribal leader who was assassinated Thursday.
 In an event saturated with tribal traditions, the mourners eulogized their lost leader, Sheik Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, also known as Abu Risha, who had gathered the Anbar tribes and worked with the Americans to fight jihadist militants in the province. And they sent a stark message to his killers: the men of Anbar will hunt them down.
 ''Revenge, revenge, Anbar people,'' came the chants from Sheik Sattar's guest house. ''Where can he hide or run away, he who is wanted by us.'' 
 ''All of Anbar is Abu Risha, so Abu Risha has not been killed,'' said his brother, Sheik Ahmed Abu Risha. ''I pledge to you, my brothers and my cousins, that I will follow the road that was taken by Sheik Abu Risha. We will follow it until we kill the last terrorist in Iraq.''
 The Interior Minister said he would form a police brigade named after Sheik Sattar and give it the mission of hunting down his killers. Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, who attended the funeral, said the government would support the Anbaris' fight against extremists and give the province money for economic development.
 Sheik Sattar had organized the tribes into the Anbar Awakening Council, which worked closely with the American military and formed units that now serve as local security forces to fight militants who terrorized and killed civilians. The effort was so successful in reducing violence in the province that American commanders have sought to replicate it elsewhere in Iraq.
 The extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq, another name for Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown extremist group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign-led, claimed responsibility on Friday for the bombing that killed him.
 In a statement posted on jihadist Web sites, the group said it had killed Sheik Sattar because of his work with the Americans and his effort to fight its brand of Islam. The group said it had planned the assassination for a month.
 In the Internet message, the group pledged to hunt down all those who work with the Americans. ''Let them know that the swords of the mujahedeen are after them,'' said the Web posting, which called Sheik Sattar ''one of the dogs of the carrier of the cross, Bush.''
 Sheik Sattar died in a bomb blast near one of his farms on the outskirts of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which in Iraq in recent years has been a period marked by an increase in violence. Killed with him were a trusted bodyguard, Sattar al-Nemrawi, and a 15-year-old nephew, Sachir. 
 He was killed a day before the first anniversary of the Anbar Awakening Council that he formed.
 Sheik Sattar's brother, who was chosen within hours to succeed him as head of the council, and seven of his cousins carried the coffin to his family guesthouse, where tribal leaders typically receive dignitaries. Sheik Sattar, while beloved by many, was also controversial among some Anbaris because he was seen as taking credit for the ''awakening'' movement when many others had been critical to its success. 
 In attendance at the funeral, in addition to tribal leaders and government ministers, were Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the second-ranking American officer in Iraq, and Brig. Gen. John R. Allen, the deputy Marine commander in western Iraq. One of the colonels who had worked closely with Sheik Sattar choked up when he tried to answer a reporter's question. ''Yes, we lost him,'' was all he could say.
 Elsewhere in Iraq, the sheik was remembered at Friday Prayer at Sunni and Shiite mosques. In Najaf, a city holy to Iraqi Shiites, Sadr al-Deen al-Qubbanchi, a senior Shiite cleric, lauded him as an Iraqi hero. ''This leader will remain a symbol of unity of the Shiite and Sunnis, and will remain a symbol of people of Iraq generally and Anbar especially,'' he said.
 Although Sheik Sattar had faced multiple attempts on his life, he was reluctant to acknowledge the danger he faced. A few hours before he was assassinated, he was leaving the mosque he had built at his compound and saw coffins lined up in the courtyard. ''He asked me to move them away,'' said Thamir al-Chlaibawi, one of his security guards. 
 ''He said, 'No one is going to get killed anymore. We don't need these coffins.' Then he went to his farm, and only a few hours later we heard a very big explosion and he was dead.''
 Sheik Sattar was buried near his father and brothers, who had also been killed by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
 Separately, the American military said that four American soldiers died in Diyala Province on Friday when an explosion occurred near their vehicle.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the funeral of a Sunni Arab tribal leader who had organized tribes to work closely with the American military in Anbar Province and who had been assassinated included an erroneous name in the list of those who attended the funeral. Brig. Gen. John R. Allen, the deputy Marine commander in western Iraq, was out of the country and was not present.

HEADLINE: Irreconcilable Differences in Bible's Interpretations

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
''How to Read the Bible'' is a most unusual how-to book. For one thing, it is more than 800 pages long and has 971 endnotes. It is true that all the familiar figures and events of the Hebrew Scriptures or Old Testament are here: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and the prophets. 
 But the book, written by James L. Kugel and just published by the Free Press, also propounds a stark and challenging thesis, namely that contemporary Bible readers are confronted with two radically different ways of approaching Scripture and that both approaches are impressive and admirable -- and fundamentally incompatible. 
 Professor Kugel, it should be noted, is a rare master of both approaches. Now teaching in Israel, he was for years one of the most popular teachers at Harvard. When attendance at his introductory Bible course (often running more than 900 students) finally edged ahead of a similarly popular course in economics, The Harvard Crimson headlined ''God Beats Mammon.'' 
 A decade ago, he published ''The Bible as It Was,'' a provocative and much-lauded study of early biblical interpretation. 
 Professor Kugel is also an Orthodox Jew who found himself ''hooked'' on modern biblical studies despite the fact, as he said in a recent lecture in Manhattan, that much about those studies seemed calculated ''to destroy the whole fabric of traditional Jewish piety.''
 ''How to Read the Bible'' incorporates the fruits of his university teaching, his research and his years of personal reflection on his faith and scholarship. 
 The book highlights not only the familiar dramatis personae of the Bible, but also two groups who have struggled mightily with biblical texts. He calls them the ''ancient interpreters'' and the ''modern scholars.'' 
 Over the last 150 years, modern biblical scholars have revealed the Bible as an amalgam of often conflicting texts composed from different sources by different authors and with different agendas often far from the spiritual and moral concerns of traditional Judaism and Christianity or of today's believers. 
 Are the first chapters of Genesis the powerful story of God's creation and of humankind's tragic fall? Or are they, as much modern scholarship suggests, a tissue of inconsistencies, some serving to promote the priestly class's case for keeping the Sabbath on the seventh day, others reflecting the transition from a society of hunters and gatherers to one based on agriculture? 
 Was the story of God's destruction of the Tower of Babel really an ancient lesson about human hubris? Or, as modern scholarship would have it, was it a critical jab at Babylonian city dwellers by Israelite country folk, plus a kind of ''just-so'' story to explain the multiplicity of local languages? Modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of many biblical episodes. Pointing to parallel passages in the writings of other Near Eastern peoples, scholars have cast doubt on the Bible's uniqueness. 
 Fundamentalists try to discredit this scholarship. Apologists try to mold and squeeze it to fit traditional understandings of the Bible. Professor Kugel does neither. Instead, he explores exactly where those traditional understandings came from. Writing between about 300 B.C. and A.D. 200, these sages, scribes and teachers effectively recast the Bible's meaning in terms that came to dominate the way it was read by both Jews and Christians right up to recent times. 
 The names of most are unknown. Others, like the historian Josephus, Philo of Alexandria and the New Testament writers (who were obviously reinterpreting Hebrew Scriptures) are well known. Other ancient interpretations are found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, many apocryphal books and rabbinic midrash.
 These interpreters differed wildly in their efforts, sometimes highly fanciful, to resolve inconsistencies or apparent contradictions in the Bible's texts, to offer moral justifications for biblical behavior and draw lessons for their contemporaries. That was most obvious, of course, in the differences between Jews and Christians. 
 But Professor Kugel argues that they all converged on four assumptions about the Bible. 
 They believed, first, that deeper meanings lay behind biblical texts, that the Bible was a book of instruction about the world and how to serve God in it, that it was somehow ''seamless'' and harmonious despite surface conflicts and, finally, that it was of divine origin. 
 On the basis of these assumptions, these early interpreters engaged in nothing less than ''a massive act of rewriting,'' Professor Kugel writes: ''The raw material that made up the Bible was written anew not by changing its words but by changing the way in which those words were approached and understood.'' It was the Bible of these interpreters that, in his view, actually constituted the Bible for Jews and Christians for two millennia. 
 Charles Augustine Briggs, a 19th-century pioneer of modern biblical scholarship, declared that by sweeping away the ''rubbish'' of centuries of biblical interpretation, modern scholars would finally ''recover the real Bible.'' Professor Kugel admires the audacity and genius of scholars like Briggs, but he believes that in their contempt for the ''rubbish'' of ancient interpretation, modern scholars have let the ''real Bible'' elude them. They have been left, instead, with ''the raw material that made up the Bible.'' 
 ''How to Read the Bible'' runs through the entire Hebrew Scriptures, matching modern scholarship and ancient interpretation. The journey is fascinating enough to render frustrating the author's conclusion. Although he admired both approaches, Professor Kugel writes, they are ''quite irreconcilable.''
 Is this conclusion as unavoidable as he makes it sound? Modern minds still seek deeper meanings and still want relevant instructions for living. As for the ancient worry about seamlessness, modern minds, sensitized to multiple perspectives, often find more coherence in contrasting accounts than perfectly harmonized ones. 
 The ancient interpreters' boldness in rewriting was motivated and justified, Professor Kugel writes, by a fresh apprehension of God and the corresponding need to flesh out the command, found in the Book of Deuteronomy and elsewhere, ''to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul.'' Is it so impossible that modern scholarship, too, could be put to that service?

HEADLINE: Shares Steady on Rate-Cut Hopes

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street finished little changed yesterday after a strong week as investors looked past weaker-than-expected economic readings and focused on the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates next week.
 Stocks initially fell sharply yesterday after the government reported that August retail sales excluding automobiles had declined sharply. The report suggested that consumers were reducing spending, an unwelcome development that some on Wall Street hope can be reversed by a rate cut. Some investors regarded the readings as supporting the case for a rate cut when Fed policy makers meet Tuesday.
 The session began with unease over the Bank of England's decision to grant emergency funding to Northern Rock, a lender that was at risk of a liquidity crisis. The need for the bailout renewed concerns about tightness in the credit markets. 
 At the session's end, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.64, or 0.13 percent, to 13,442.52, giving the blue-chip index an advance of 2.5 percent for the week, its best showing since April.
 Broader stock indicators also showed modest gains yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.30, or 0.02 percent, to 1,484.25, and the Nasdaq composite index edged up 1.12, or 0.04 percent, to 2,602.18.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.14, or 0.40 percent, to 783.49.
 For the week, the S.& P. rose 2.2 percent, while the Nasdaq added 1.4 percent.
 Government bond prices were almost unchanged yesterday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to 102 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 4.46 percent, from 4.49 percent.
 Stocks took a hit early after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.4 percent in August, excluding vehicle sales. Wall Street had been looking for a gain, excluding autos. Over all, including autos, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month.
 In another report that perhaps stirred unease about the economy, industrial production in August edged up by just 0.2 percent, the weakest advance in three months. The figure reflects a 0.3 percent decline in output from American factories.
 Although a cut would make some borrowing less expensive, not all costs would come down. Some adjustable-rate mortgages, many of them due to reset this fall from their low initial rates, are tied to benchmarks other than the federal funds rate, like the London interbank offered rate, which last week hit multiyear highs.
 ''Everyone expects the Fed to cut,'' said Denis J. Amato, chief investment officer at Ancora Advisors. ''I guess one of our concerns is the feeling the market has that either the Fed or the government can legislate prosperity. The Fed can sometimes dampen volatility, but they can't create prosperity by pumping money into the system.''
 Mr. Amato said the Fed must balance concerns about cutting rates to ease some of Wall Street's unease about credit with a need to keep inflation in check and the dollar relatively strong.
 ''Our concern,'' Mr. Amato said, ''is that the Fed is sort of in a box, because if they cut too fast they run the risk of weakening the dollar.'' 
 If rates decline, investors could take money out of Treasuries and seek higher-yielding assets.
 The focus on the Fed and other economic issues has led investors to appear little concerned this week by record oil prices. Light crude fell 99 cents yesterday, to settle at $79.10 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil closed above $80 a barrel for the first time Thursday.
 Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about nine to seven on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a light 1.2 billion shares compared with 1.27 billion traded Thursday.

HEADLINE: Double Warning That a Recession May Be on the Way

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE employment statistics and the bond market are combining to send out a warning that has been heard only rarely in the past two decades: A recession is coming in the United States. 
 The two charts show the double warning. Both charts warned of an economic downturn before the 1990 and 2001 recessions, and they are doing so again.
 While each has arguably registered false warnings, they have never done so together.
 The first chart shows the difference between the yield on two-year Treasuries and the Federal Reserve's target rate for federal funds -- the rate on loans between banks. In normal times, the Treasury rate is usually higher. 
 In bond market jargon, the opposite condition is an inverted yield curve. And when it is very inverted, the recession warning is sent.
 At the widest spread this week, on Monday, the yield on two-year Treasuries was down to 3.854 percent, while the fed funds target rate was 5.25 percent. That difference, of 1.396 percentage points, is the largest since early January 2001.
 It was also in January 2001 that the Fed surprised the market with a 50-basis-point -- or half a percentage point -- reduction in the target rate for fed funds. That move briefly cheered the stock market, but did not prevent the recession that began in March.
 The second chart shows the six-month changes in the number of people with jobs, as reported by the Labor Department's household survey. In a growing economy, with the labor age population rising, the number of jobs almost always increases.
 But not now. The August employment figures, reported last week, showed 145,794,000 people with jobs, or 125,000 fewer than in February. When that number goes into negative territory, it is a warning of a slowdown.
 As can be seen from the chart, the job warning was sent out in July 1990, the month in which the recession began. A warning of the 2001 recession arrived in July 2000, but few took it seriously.
 To be sure, there have been just two recessions in two decades, which is not enough to validate any set of forecast tools. But if one arrives, there will be criticism that the Federal Reserve was too slow to cut interest rates as it ignored the threat of an inverted yield curve, and that it focused on inflation for too long.
 ''With the core inflation rate comfortably close to 2 percent, and the Treasury market begging for ease for over a year, if it turns out to be a recession, it will also be a policy error,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist of ITG.
 As the charts show, sometimes one indicator or the other has seemed weak when no recession followed. The job number looked bad in 1995, but there was no confirmation from the interest rate indicator.
 Similarly, in 1998 the interest rate indicator came close to sounding a warning amid the fears brought on by the rescue of a large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
 But the difference between the rates never quite reached 1.3 percentage points, and in any case the employment figures remained strong.
 Now both look weak. That is no guarantee of a recession, but it may help to explain why the Fed is expected to change course and reduce the federal funds rate next week.

HEADLINE: Our Health Care Crisis (1 Letter)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Health Care America Wants'' (letters, Sept. 10) highlighted arguments of readers who advocate for the flawed and extremely controversial single-payer system. 
 After reading their submissions, I'm convinced that these writers are oblivious to the problems that accompany government-run care.
 Virtually all countries with a single-payer model have been plagued by perilous problems, including substandard care, long waiting lists, loss of physicians, forced outsourcing and health care rationing. 
 More important, the supposed administrative savings occur in the first year. After that, we still have a higher than inflation trend in the cost of health care and nothing to address that.
 The bottom line is that single-payer ignores the fundamental issue: this is not a ''health insurance'' crisis, it's a ''cost of health care'' crisis.
 An approach is needed that addresses the poor lifestyle habits of Americans, which drive the cost of health care. Until then, we will always be facing a health insurance crisis.

HEADLINE: Credit Crisis Hits Lender In Britain

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Depositors of a big British mortgage lender, Northern Rock, rushed to withdraw money on Friday after the bank, unable to raise financing because of the tight credit market, turned to the Bank of England for an emergency loan.
 Nervous investors also dumped Northern Rock shares, which fell 31 percent.
 The bailout, analysts said, was the latest indication that the turmoil that began in the subprime market in the United States had expanded into other areas. 
 While other European banks have been hurt by investments in financial vehicles backed by subprime loans, Northern Rock said it had limited subprime exposure. 
 Instead, the bank ran into trouble because the tighter credit undermined its business model, which relied on financing mortgages by raising money in the capital markets, rather than depending on consumer deposits.
 ''The problems are potentially much wider now,'' said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm in London. ''This means we have to worry about a wider range of institutions that aren't directly involved in this credit crisis but are in a way innocent bystanders.''
 The bailout came two days after the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, warned that moves by other central banks, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have pumped additional liquidity into the system, could encourage ''excessive risk-taking'' by rewarding bad behavior. 
 The Bank of England emphasized Friday that Northern Rock would have to pay a premium to market interest rates for its emergency credit line, offered under the bank's role as ''lender of last resort.''
 ''Northern Rock is solvent, exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book,'' the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury said in a joint statement. But those words did not mollify some Northern Rock customers. Account holders lined up at many of the bank's 70-plus branches, many of them reportedly withdrawing large sums.
 Outside a branch in central London, Constance Hackford, a manager at an interior design company, weighed joining a line of about two dozen people. ''I can't imagine the Bank of England is going to let it fail -- can they?'' she said.
 A spokesman for Northern Rock said Friday that the bank did not have any estimates yet of how much money had been withdrawn. 
 One reason Northern Rock customers may be nervous is that there is less protection for account holders in Britain than in the United States in case a bank fails. Deposits are insured up to $:31,700, or about $64,000, compared with up to $100,000 in the United States.
 Adam J. Applegarth, chief executive of Northern Rock, said account holders should not worry. ''I'm a depositor with Northern Rock,'' he said in a conference call. ''Knowing that we have an uncapped facility with the Bank of England -- you don't get better than the Bank of England.'' Because Northern Rock -- and, perhaps, other British mortgage lenders -- will have to pay more to raise money for loans, they will have to pass along higher rates to consumers, analysts say. That could cause a slowdown in lending, they added, which could act as a drag on the country's housing market, which has soared over the last decade.
 ''Costs for first-time borrowers, already stretched in the affordability stakes, will rise substantially,'' said Paul Mortimer-Lee, an economist at BNP Paribas. ''First-time buyer activity seems pretty certain to show a sharp fall, which, since the whole market rests on the shoulders of the first-time buyer, is like throwing a spanner in the works of the whole market.''
 There have been some signs of a slowdown. A survey released this week by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, a real estate group, showed that prices in August fell in more areas of Britain than they rose. Several banks have increased lending rates.
 Mr. Applegarth said Northern Rock would cut back on issuing new loans, as well as cutting costs through a hiring freeze and other steps. The bank on Friday downgraded its profit outlook for this year and next year.
 He said the bank, whose level of residential lending in the first eight months was 55 percent higher than a year earlier, had been more aggressive than some of its rivals in using ''wholesale funding'' rather than deposits to back its loans. 
 Northern Rock said it had $:75 million ($152 million) in direct exposure to the subprime market, with $:200 million ($405 million) in exposure to collateralized debt obligations, some of which is exposed to the subprime market. 
 Together, that represents less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the bank's total assets, it said. 
 Northern Rock approached the central bank, Mr. Applegarth said, because of the ''astonishing'' conditions in the markets that it had used to raise financing, and because ''we could see no end to this in the short term.'' 
 Some analysts said Northern Rock could become a takeover target while others said the bank could emerge intact, assuming that credit problems ease. 
 While repossessions of homes have been rising in Britain, analysts said that Northern Rock has a generally sound mortgage portfolio. Fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the bank's mortgage loans are more than three months in arrears, Northern Rock said; that is less than half the British industry average.
 ''We think there is a strong bank here, but with a vulnerability, which is its sources of funding,'' said Matthew Taylor, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded some of the bank's credit ratings Friday.

HEADLINE: Mayo Clinic Proposing A Universal Health Plan

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The Mayo Clinic jumped into the national debate on improving health care yesterday, calling for every individual to have basic universal insurance as a step toward gradually replacing the current employer-based system.
 But Mayo, in a proposal hammered out over 18 months by a panel of more than 400 health policy experts, is not advocating a government-run single-payer system. Instead, it suggested that private insurance companies be required to offer standard plans with many options, like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan available to government workers. 
 Applicants for this insurance could not be turned down, under the Mayo plan. 
 The policies would be paid for by individuals, in some cases with help from employers. Lower-income people would get government help on a sliding scale.
 Mayo, the big Minnesota-based physician and hospital group, is sending its recommendations to the presidential candidates and all members of Congress. 
 Coincidentally, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to offer her own health care proposals in a campaign speech scheduled for Monday. 
 ''Mayo's timing is pretty good; next year will be too late,'' said Andrew Mekelburg, an executive in Washington for the big telecommunications company Verizon Communications, which spends $3.5 billion annually on health care for 900,000 employees, retirees and dependents.
 Mr. Mekelburg, who took part in the Mayo project, said the recommendations had ''a pretty good chance'' of winning serious consideration from policy makers. ''Mayo is extremely well respected,'' he said.
 Dr. Denis Cortese, the clinic's chief executive, said that under the proposals, employees could keep their individual policies when they changed jobs, an important issue for workers. One in four changes jobs each year, and 47 million Americans of all ages do not have health insurance.
 ''It would be nice for our employees to have the portability feature, the freedom to move,'' Dr. Cortese said. For the Mayo Clinic, which has 47,000 employees, ''this would be an option we could live with very nicely,'' he said.
 Executives of several large employers who took part in the Mayo discussions agreed that rising medical costs and the aging of the baby boomer generation were pushing the current system toward a crisis. But they said they were not ready to abandon their current health plans for employees.
 ''We do not believe in relinquishing the employer-sponsored health care system,'' said Anthony C. Wisniewski, a Mayo panelist who is executive director of health care policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 Linda M. Dillman, another participant, who is an executive vice president in charge of health and environmental issues at Wal-Mart, said health care should be a shared responsibility. 
 ''The employer has a role to play,'' she said. ''The government has a role, especially for those who are financially unable to provide their own health care, and we think individuals also have a responsibility.''
 Another Mayo panelist, Stuart M. Butler, said ''Mayo understands that the era of traditional employer-sponsored insurance is ending and we need to think about the employer's role evolving into a different model.'' Mr. Butler is a health policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, a politically conservative research center in Washington. 
 Under the Mayo proposal, Mr. Butler said, ''smaller employers would no longer sponsor coverage but would contribute to plans that their employees could select'' from an outside insurer. 
 David Cutler, a Harvard economics professor who has advised Senator Barack Obama on health care issues, was another of the Mayo participants. He defended the idea of government subsidies for lower-income people. ''Even someone with a $50,000 income would need help paying for insurance that now costs $11,000 or $12,000 a year,'' Mr. Cutler said. 
 He noted that Mr. Obama and another Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, had both put forth health plans that would encourage individuals to join insurance purchasing groups and pool their buying power to get better coverage.
 Another participant in the Mayo project, Helen Darling, the president of the National Business Group on Health, whose members are large employers, said her group would meet in Washington next month to discuss health care issues.
 ''Looking forward 5 to 10 years, most people agree that we don't have a sustainable system,'' she said. ''What not everybody agrees on is the solution.''

HEADLINE: Mexico Enacts a Tax-Overhaul Bill

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
President Felipe Calderon won his first major legislative victory Friday when the Mexican Congress passed a comprehensive tax bill aimed at one of Mexico's biggest economic problems: its meager tax take and miserly public spending. 
 The bill will raise corporate taxes on many companies, including some that backed Mr. Calderon in the presidential election last year. It will also give back more money to the country's cash-short oil monopoly and impose a gasoline tax that will go to state governments. 
 The fiscal bill was part of a complicated legislative trade in which Mr. Calderon's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, agreed to an overhaul of electoral laws in return for support for the tax package from opposition leaders. Congress also approved the electoral changes Friday. 
 The president's deft handling of negotiations with Congress was a high point in his administration and stood in sharp contrast to the performance of his predecessor, Vicente Fox, who failed to get any major economic changes through the legislature.
 It also cemented Mr. Calderon's political position after he won a razor-thin election last year against a leftist rival who has never conceded defeat. 
 ''It's more than symbolic,'' said Joydeep Mukherji, the sovereign analyst for Mexico at Standard & Poor's in New York. ''Less than 12 months ago, there were serious questions about whether Calderon would be able to govern for the whole six years, now the whole political panorama is quite different.'' 
 When Mr. Calderon took office, he pledged to raise spending for the half of the population that is mired in poverty. But he faced declining oil revenue, which provides almost 40 percent of the national budget, as production at the state oil monopoly, Pemex, has begun to slip. 
 To deliver on his promises, Mr. Calderon needs to raise the country's tax collection. At less than 11 percent of the gross domestic product, Mexico's tax take is one of the lowest in the Americas. Evasion is widespread, from blue-chip companies that use multiple tax loopholes to the hundreds of thousands of street vendors who crowd city streets. 
 Mr. Calderon's original tax proposal aimed to raise tax collection by 3 percent of gross domestic product, to about 14 percent, by the end of his term in 2012. After lobbying by business and other adjustments by Congress, most analysts expect the new tax bill will add about 2.5 percent. 
 By international standards, the change is still modest, and it will not generate enough to pay for much of Mr. Calderon's social agenda, analysts say. Indeed, much of the extra revenue -- an estimated $10 billion next year -- will be used to plug the gap created by falling oil revenue and to keep pace with rising health and pension commitments as Mexico's population ages. 
 Still, an agreement on taxes from the fractured Congress was seen as an important legislative step in a nation that has not approved any significant economic measure in a decade. 
 The economy has grown barely faster than the population since the beginning of 2000. Despite much hand-wringing over Asia's rise, Mexico has failed to take any steps -- like freeing up the state-controlled energy companies or streamlining its cumbersome legal system -- that would bolster its competitiveness. 
 ''Mexico is an undertaxed country, not an overtaxed country,'' said Damian Fraser, the head of Latin America research at UBS Securities in Mexico City. ''There's a broad consensus that Mexico needs to raise more money in taxes.'' 
 Analysts said that Mr. Calderon would now need to use the momentum from passing the tax bill to tackle other problems, perhaps by negotiating with the strong public unions in education, the energy companies and the national health service. 
 ''What people will be looking for is whether this can be a catalyst for greater efficiency and focus,'' Mr. Mukherji said. 
 The centerpiece of the bill is a new corporate tax that will plug most loopholes. The tax, based on sales rather than profits, will start at 16.5 percent next year, rising to its maximum rate of 17.5 percent in 2010. Mr. Calderon's government had originally proposed a phased-in application of the tax to reach 19 percent. 
 The bill also cuts taxes on Pemex to give it an additional $3 billion next year. Output at the oil monopoly is beginning to slide because the money it has needed to develop new oil fields has been diverted to public spending. 
 The bill also levies a 2.5 percent tax on cash deposits above about $2,200, a first attempt to attack the tax evasion in the underground economy, which some experts say employs a quarter of the work force. 
 A gasoline tax of 5.5 percent will go to state governors, the majority of whom are members of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which supported the bill along with Mr. Calderon's PAN. The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution voted against most crucial measures of the bill. 
 But all three parties approved the electoral changes, which sharply cut public funding for election campaigns and prohibit private television and radio advertising for candidates. 
 As part of the deal to get the fiscal measure approved, Mr. Calderon's party agreed to opposition demands to replace all the commissioners of the Federal Electoral Institute. The left accused the commission of favoring Mr. Calderon's election by failing to stop illegal advertising that backed him and by not allowing a full recount of the results. 
 By bringing the left to the negotiating table on the electoral reform, Mr. Calderon has managed to wring a tacit acknowledgment of his legitimacy. Analysts say this may bode well for his plans to revamp labor, energy and judicial laws.

HEADLINE: Fed's Ex-Chief Attacks Bush On Fiscal Role

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve for nearly two decades, in a long-awaited memoir, is harshly critical of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the Republican-controlled Congress, as abandoning their party's principles on spending and deficits.
 In the 500-page book, ''The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World,'' Mr. Greenspan describes the Bush administration as so captive to its own political operation that it paid little attention to fiscal discipline, and he described Mr. Bush's first two Treasury secretaries, Paul H. O'Neill and John W. Snow, as essentially powerless. 
 Mr. Bush, he writes, was never willing to contain spending or veto bills that drove the country into deeper and deeper deficits, as Congress abandoned rules that required that the cost of tax cuts be offset by savings elsewhere. ''The Republicans in Congress lost their way,'' writes Mr. Greenspan, a self-described ''libertarian Republican.'' 
 ''They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose'' in the 2006 election, when they lost control of the House and Senate. 
 As officials leave the Bush administration, there is no shortage of criticism of this White House: Disenchanted hawks are writing that Mr. Bush has abandoned the certainties of the first term and taken too soft a line on North Korea and Iran; from the other side of the spectrum, former officials are telling tales about how the administration bent rules on torture or domestic spying. 
 But Mr. Greenspan, now 81, is in a different class, by dint of his fame, his economic authority and his service across party lines. His critiques are likely to have more resonance among Mr. Bush's base.
 His book was provided to The New York Times by his publisher, Penguin Press, under an agreement that nothing would be reported until its publication date, on Monday. But The Wall Street Journal, saying it had purchased a copy from a retailer, published excerpts on its Web site on Friday night, freeing other news organizations to do the same. 
 Much of the book concerns Mr. Greenspan's reflections on markets, globalization and the media's fascination with the thickness of his briefcase on the way to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. 
 He praises President Bush for letting the Fed stay independent of political pressure, saying he was scrupulous in not trying to interfere with monetary policy -- which he contrasts sharply with the pressure exerted by his father, George H. W. Bush, in the early 1990s. For years, the first President Bush has blamed Mr. Greenspan for contributing to his defeat in 1992 by failing to prevent a recession by cutting interest rates.
 Of the presidents he worked with, Mr. Greenspan reserves his highest praise for Bill Clinton, whom he described in his book as a sponge for economic data who maintained ''a consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth.'' 
 It was a presidency marred by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he writes, but he fondly describes his alliance with two of Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretaries, Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, in battling financial crises in Latin America and then Asia. 
 By contrast, Mr. Greenspan paints a picture of Mr. Bush as a man driven more by ideology and the desire to fulfill campaign promises made in 2000, incurious about the effects of his economic policy, and an administration incapable of executing policy. 
 The White House is clearly not eager to get into a public argument with Mr. Greenspan, whom President Bush reappointed to a fifth term in May 2004. But they pushed back at Mr. Greenspan's central themes.
 ''The Republican leadership in the House and Senate kept to our top number,'' Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, said. Veto threats worked, he said, to keep spending within caps set by the White House. ''We're not going to apologize for standing up the Department of Homeland Security and fighting terror.'' 
 Mr. Greenspan described his own emotional journey in dealing with Mr. Bush, from an initial elation about the return of his old friends from the Ford White House -- including Mr. Cheney and Donald H. Rumsfeld, secretary of defense -- to astonishment and then disappointment at how much they had changed.
 ''I indulged in a bit of fantasy, envisioning this as the government that might have existed had Gerald Ford garnered the extra 1 percent of the vote he'd needed to edge past Jimmy Carter,'' Mr. Greenspan writes in his memoir. ''I thought we had a golden opportunity to advance the ideals of effective, fiscally conservative government and free markets.''
 Instead, Mr. Greenspan continued, ''I was soon to see my old friends veer off in unexpected directions.'' He expected Mr. Bush to veto spending bills, he writes, but was told that the president believed he could control J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the Republican speaker of the House, better by signing them. 
 ''My friend,'' he writes of Mr. O'Neill, ''soon found himself to be the odd man out; much to my disappointment, economic policymaking in the Bush administration remained firmly in the hands of the White House staff.'' 
 He was clearly referring to the political team led by Karl Rove at the White House. Mr. Rove was a neighbor of Mr. Greenspan in a leafy enclave near the Potomac River, but the two men almost never had a conversation. 
 In responding to Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Fratto of the White House disputed the accusation that Mr. O'Neill's economic arguments were ignored. ''Just because you don't carry the day doesn't mean your views weren't considered,'' Mr. Fratto said.
 Though Mr. Greenspan does not admit he made a mistake, he shows remorse about how Republicans jumped on his endorsement of the 2001 tax cuts to push through unconditional cuts without any safeguards against surprises. He recounts how Mr. Rubin and Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, begged him to hold off on an endorsement because of how it would be perceived.
 ''It turned out that Conrad and Rubin were right,'' he acknowledges glumly. He says Republican leaders in Congress made a grievous error in spending whatever it took to ensure a permanent Republican majority. 
 Mr. Greenspan has critics as well, and they are likely to weigh in as soon as the book is published. Though he publicly disagreed with Mr. Bush's supply-side approach to tax cuts, urging Congress to offset the cost with savings elsewhere, he refrained from public criticism that could have shifted the debate. His willingness to criticize now, 18 months after leaving office, may open him to the accusation of failing to speak out when it could have affected policy. 
 Today, Mr. Greenspan is indignant and chagrined about his role in the Bush tax cuts. ''I'd have given the same testimony if Al Gore had been president,'' he writes, complaining that his words had been distorted by supporters and opponents of the cuts. 
 Mr. Greenspan, of course, had been the ultimate Washington insider for years, and knew full well that politicians cited his words selectively to suit their agendas. He was also legendary for ducking delicate issues by, as he once said, ''mumbling with great incoherence.''
 Mr. Greenspan's memoir describes at some length the monetary policies that many economists say fostered the extraordinary economic boom of the 1990s. In what is widely regarded as a brilliant insight, Mr. Greenspan became convinced the United States could grow faster than generally thought because productivity was climbing much faster than the official statistics implied. 
 Mr. Greenspan writes briefly about what may become a more troubling legacy, the housing bubble, and now the bust, that was fueled by low interest rates and risky mortgages in the last six years.
 Some economists argue that Mr. Greenspan deserves considerable blame, because the Fed slashed interest rates to rock-bottom lows and kept them there for three years after the stock market collapse and the recession in 2001.
 The Fed was ''a prime culprit in creating the crisis,'' wrote Steve Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine, in a just-published commentary. But other economists, including critics of Mr. Greenspan, say the housing bubble resulted from much broader forces, including a dramatic drop of interest rates around the world and an explosion of mortgages that required no money down, no income verification and deceptively low initial teaser rates.
 Mr. Greenspan generically defends the Fed's action, writing: ''I believed then, as now, that the benefits of broadened home ownership are worth the risk. Protection of property rights, so critical to a market economy, requires a critical mass of owners to sustain political support.''
 The book appears in stores on Monday, the day before the Fed is expected to lower interest rates in an effort to prevent the collapsing housing market from taking the rest of the economy down with it.

HEADLINE: The Literature Of Capitalism

BYLINE: By HARRIET RUBIN

 BODY:
One of the most influential business books ever written is a 1,200-page novel published 50 years ago, on Oct. 12, 1957. It is still drawing readers; it ranks 388th on Amazon.com's best-seller list. (''Winning,'' by John F. Welch Jr., at a breezy 384 pages, is No. 1,431.) 
 The book is ''Atlas Shrugged,'' Ayn Rand's glorification of the right of individuals to live entirely for their own interest. 
 For years, Rand's message was attacked by intellectuals whom her circle labeled ''do-gooders,'' who argued that individuals should also work in the service of others. Her book was dismissed as an homage to greed. Gore Vidal described its philosophy as ''nearly perfect in its immorality.'' 
 But the book attracted a coterie of fans, some of them top corporate executives, who dared not speak of its impact except in private. When they read the book, often as college students, they now say, it gave form and substance to their inchoate thoughts, showing there is no conflict between private ambition and public benefit.
 ''I know from talking to a lot of Fortune 500 C.E.O.'s that 'Atlas Shrugged' has had a significant effect on their business decisions, even if they don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's ideas,'' said John A. Allison, the chief executive of BB&T, one of the largest banks in the United States. 
 ''It offers something other books don't: the principles that apply to business and to life in general. I would call it complete,'' he said.
 One of Rand's most famous devotees is Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence,'' will be officially released Monday. 
 Mr. Greenspan met Rand when he was 25 and working as an economic forecaster. She was already renowned as the author of ''The Fountainhead,'' a novel about an architect true to his principles. Mr. Greenspan had married a member of Rand's inner circle, known as the Collective, that met every Saturday night in her New York apartment. Rand did not pay much attention to Mr. Greenspan until he began praising drafts of ''Atlas,'' which she read aloud to her disciples, according to Jeff Britting, the archivist of Ayn Rand's papers. He was attracted, Mr. Britting said, to ''her moral defense of capitalism.''
 Rand's free-market philosophy was hard won. She was born in 1905 in Russia. Her life changed overnight when the Bolsheviks broke into her father's pharmacy and declared his livelihood the property of the state. She fled the Soviet Union in 1926 and arrived later that year in Hollywood, where she peered through a gate at the set where the director Cecil B. DeMille was filming a silent movie, ''King of Kings.''
 He offered her a ride to the set, then a job as an extra on the film and later a position as a junior screenwriter. She sold several screenplays and intermittently wrote novels that were commercial failures, until 1943, when fans of ''The Fountainhead'' began a word-of-mouth campaign that helped sales immensely. 
 Shortly after ''Atlas Shrugged'' was published in 1957, Mr. Greenspan wrote a letter to The New York Times to counter a critic's comment that ''the book was written out of hate.'' Mr. Greenspan wrote: '' 'Atlas Shrugged' is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should.''
 Rand's magazine, The Objectivist, later published several essays by Mr. Greenspan, including one on the gold standard in 1966.
 Rand called ''Atlas'' a mystery, ''not about the murder of man's body, but about the murder -- and rebirth -- of man's spirit.'' It begins in a time of recession. To save the economy, the hero, John Galt, calls for a strike against government interference. Factories, farms and shops shut down. Riots break out as food becomes scarce.
 Rand said she ''set out to show how desperately the world needs prime movers and how viciously it treats them'' and to portray ''what happens to a world without them.''
 The book was released to terrible reviews. Critics faulted its length, its philosophy and its literary ambitions. Both conservatives and liberals were unstinting in disparaging the book; the right saw promotion of godlessness, and the left saw a message of ''greed is good.'' Rand is said to have cried every day as the reviews came out. 
 Rand had a reputation for living for her own interest. She is said to have seduced her most serious reader, Nathaniel Branden, when he was 24 or 25 and she was at least 50. Each was married to someone else. In fact, Mr. Britting confirmed, they called their spouses to a meeting at which the pair announced their intention to make the mentor-protege relationship a sexual one. 
 ''She wasn't a nice person, '' said Darla Moore, vice president of the private investment firm Rainwater Inc. ''But what a gift she's given us.''
 Ms. Moore, a benefactor of the University of South Carolina, spoke of her debt to Rand in 1998, when the business school at the university was named in Ms. Moore's honor. ''As a woman and a Southerner,'' she said, ''I thrived on Rand's message that only quality work counted, not who you are.'' 
 Rand's idea of ''the virtue of selfishness,'' Ms. Moore said, ''is a harsh phrase for the Buddhist idea that you have to take care of yourself.''
 Some business leaders might be unsettled by the idea that the only thing members of the leadership class have in common is their success. James M. Kilts, who led turnarounds at Gillette, Nabisco and Kraft, said he encountered ''Atlas'' at ''a time in college life when everybody was a nihilist, anti-establishment, and a collectivist.'' He found her writing reassuring because it made success seem rational.
 ''Rand believed that there is right and wrong,'' he said, ''that excellence should be your goal.''
 John P. Stack is one business executive who has taken Rand's ideas to heart. He was chief executive of Springfield Remanufacturing Company, a retooler of tractor engines in Springfield, Mo., when its parent company, International Harvester, divested itself of the firm in the recession of 1982, the year Rand died. 
 Having lost his sole customer in a struggling Rust Belt city, Mr. Stack says, he took action like a hero out of ''Atlas.'' He created an ''open book'' company in which employees were transparently working in their own interest.
 Mr. Stack says that he assigned every job a bottom line value and that every salary, including his own, was posted on a company ticker daily. Workplaces, he said, are notoriously undemocratic, emotionally charged and political.
 Mr. Stack says his free market replaced all that with rational behavior. A machinist knew exactly what his working hour contributed to the bottom line, and therefore the cost of slacking off. This, Mr. Stack said, was a manifestation of the philosophy of objectivism in ''Atlas'': people guided by reason and self-interest.
 ''There is something in your inner self that Rand draws out,'' Mr. Stack said. ''You want to be a hero, you want to be right, but by the same token you have to question yourself, though you must not listen to interference thrown at you by the distracters. The lawyers told me not to open the books and share equity.'' He said he defied them. '' 'Atlas' helped me pursue this idiot dream that became SRC.''
 Mr. Stack said he was 19 and working in a factory when a manager gave him a copy of the book. ''It's the best business book I ever read,'' he said. ''I didn't do well in school because I was a big dreamer. To get something that tells you to take your dreams seriously, that's an eye opener.''
 Mr. Stack said he gave a copy to his son, Tim Stack, 25, who was so inspired that he went to work for a railroad, just like the novel's heroine, Dagny Taggart.
 Every year, 400,000 copies of Rand's novels are offered free to Advanced Placement high school programs. They are paid for by the Ayn Rand Institute, whose director, Yaron Brook, said the mission was ''to keep Rand alive.''
 Last year, bookstores sold 150,000 copies of the book. It continues to hold appeal, even to a younger generation. Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, who was born in 1958, and John P. Mackey, the chief executive of Whole Foods, who was 3 when the book was published, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.
 The book's hero, John Galt, also continues to live on. The subcontractor hired to demolish the former Deutsche Bank building, which was damaged when the World Trade Center towers fell, was the John Galt Corporation. It was removed from the job last month after a fire at the building killed two firefighters.
 In Chicago, there is John Galt Solutions, a producer of software for supply chain companies like Tastykake. The founder and chief executive of the company, Annemarie Omrod, said she considered the character an inspiration. 
 ''We were reading the book,'' she said, when she and Kai Trepte were thinking of starting the company. ''For us, the book symbolized the importance of growing yourself and bettering yourself without hindering other people. John Galt took all the great minds and started a new society.
 ''Some of our customers don't know the name, though after they meet us, they want to read the book,'' she went on. ''Our sales reps have a problem, however. New clients usually ask: 'Hey, where is John Galt? How come I'm not important enough to rate a visit from John Galt?' ''

HEADLINE: Politics Starts at the Water's Edge

 BODY:
IT is rare for world leaders to be selected on the basis of their foreign policy acumen or experience. Most leaders are chosen over rivals because of skills in domestic politics. 
 Consequently, those who shape international affairs are best understood first as politicians and only later perhaps as statesmen. Understanding how leaders come to and stay in office is far more important to our grasp of major events in international politics than traditional ideas about the balance of power or polarity. 
 Ronald Reagan's successes illustrate this central claim. Mr. Reagan needed to run on a peace plan in 1980: a telephone survey taken by the Gallup Poll during the primaries had found that 46 percent of those questioned thought President Jimmy Carter would be more likely to keep the country out of war, while 31 percent thought Mr. Reagan would. Despite widespread expectations that he would favor abandonment of nuclear arms control negotiations with the Soviets, Mr. Reagan in fact supported continued talks, although under revised terms. 
 Mr. Reagan's proposals in 1980 fundamentally challenged conventional economic and strategic assumptions. Mr. Reagan told voters that American leaders, including President Carter, had for decades completely misunderstood the cold war. But Mr. Reagan's masterstroke was to present himself as a man of peace. 
 Mr. Reagan told voters that they should separate his strategy of rearmament from his objective of mutual cooperation with the Soviet Union. This was the heart of his interpretation of the conservative slogan ''peace through strength.'' While Mr. Carter labored to appear strong on defense, Mr. Reagan presented a more muted version of his own foreign policy and defense plans. Speaking at a Veterans of Foreign Wars gathering in Chicago on Aug. 18, 1980, he expressed in peaceful terms his call for a military buildup.
 ''Actually, I've called for whatever it takes to be so strong that no other nation will dare violate the peace,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''World peace must be our No. 1 priority. It is the first task of statecraft to preserve peace so that brave men need not die in battle. But it must not be peace at any price. It must not be a peace of humiliation and gradual surrender.''
 Speaking to a crowd in Cincinnati two months later, Mr. Reagan unleashed one of his most thorough attempts to portray himself as a man of peace and Mr. Carter as a hapless warmonger.
 ''The president of the United States seems determined to have me start a nuclear war,'' he said. ''Well, I'm just as determined not to. As a matter of fact, his foreign policy, his vacillation, his weakness is allowing our allies throughout the world to no longer trust us and our adversaries to no longer respect us. There's a far greater danger of an unwanted, inadvertent war with that policy than there is with someone in there who believes that the first thing we should do is rebuild our defensive capability.''
 Mr. Reagan recast the national debate to his advantage, redefining the political mainstream to exclude his key opponents while placing himself in the newly defined core. Mr. Reagan entered the post-1976 electoral scene arguing, in essence, that the debate over how best to coexist with the Soviet Union was the wrong debate, on the wrong problem. He contended that the issue was not how to coexist, but rather how to defeat the Soviets peacefully, bringing an end to the cold war and the global Communist threat.
 Mr. Reagan decided not to raise his ideas about a Strategic Defense Initiative during the 1980 campaign. He suppressed his opinions not because he had doubts about their merits, but because he believed that expressing them would diminish, rather than expand, his coalition of support. Thus, while he may have told the truth to voters as he saw it, he left out those elements of his outlook that were likely to hinder his mission to persuade voters to support him.
 A politician following Mr. Reagan's model for campaigning would engage in almost a positive method of negative campaigning. There is no need to slur the opponent's character or good intentions, nor even the opponent's competence to manage affairs as conventionally understood. Rather, the candidate highlights the inadequacy of the rival's understanding of what the real problems are. 
 While every seeker of the presidency since the end of World War II had debated how best to live with the Soviet threat (encirclement, mutually assured destruction, flexible response, detente, etc.) Mr. Reagan was the only major-party candidate for president who argued that the Soviet threat could be defeated, rather than simply managed. 
 It did not matter for his electoral prospects that hindsight would show him to be right. What mattered was that he could persuade voters to dismiss his rivals as archaic thinkers who did not understand the real problems of the day. That his success made it possible to spend the Soviet government into a rapid collapse was a bonus that few voters saw at the polls.
 Radical, extraordinary changes in foreign policy can result from political campaigns that are run largely on domestic issues. Along with Mr. Reagan's 1980 campaign, Boris Yeltsin's focus on internal Soviet and Russian questions during his campaigns from 1989 to 1991 nonetheless catalyzed the end of the cold war. Domestic political maneuvering, more than grand strategy, contributed to the most important international political change of the latter half of the 20th century -- and arguably, of modern history.

HEADLINE: The Nightmare Is Here

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
We've heard from General Petraeus, from Ambassador Crocker, and on Thursday night from President Bush. What we haven't heard this week is anything about the tragic reality on the ground for the ordinary citizens of Iraq, which is in the throes of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
 President Bush may not be aware of this. In his televised address to the nation he warned that a pullout of U.S. forces from Iraq could cause a ''humanitarian nightmare.'' 
 A trusted aide should take the president aside and quietly inform him that this nightmare arrived a good while ago.
 When the U.S. launched its ''shock and awe'' invasion in March 2003, the population of Iraq was about 26 million. The flaming horror unleashed by the invasion has since forced 2.2 million of those Iraqis, nearly a tenth of the population, to flee the country. Many of those who left were professionals marked for death -- doctors, lawyers, academics, the very people with the skills necessary to build a viable society.
 The Iraq Ministry of Health reported that 102 doctors and 164 nurses were killed from April 2003 to May 2006. It is believed that nearly half of Iraq's doctors have fled. The exodus of health care professionals in a country hemorrhaging from the worst kinds of violence pretty much qualifies as nightmarish.
 While more than two million Iraqis have fled to other countries, another two million have been displaced internally. According to the Global Policy Forum, a group that monitors international developments:
 ''Most of these internally displaced persons, or I.D.P.'s, have sought refuge with relatives, or in mosques, empty public buildings, or tent camps. ...I.D.P.'s live in very poor conditions. Public buildings are particularly unsanitary, often overcrowded, without access to clean water, proper sanitation and basic services, in conditions especially conducive to infectious diseases.''
 Iraqis are enduring most of their suffering out of the sight of the rest of the world. International relief organizations and most of the news media are largely kept at a distance by the insane levels of violence.
 Access to safe drinking water is a problem in much of the country. (The World Health Organization was asked to help with a recent outbreak of cholera in parts of Kurdistan that is believed to have been caused by polluted water.) Sanitation facilities are routinely crippled by violence and sabotage. The economy, like the country's infrastructure, is in shambles.
 The worst aspect of the nightmare, of course, is the rain of death that has descended on Iraq since the U.S. invasion. Controversy has surrounded virtually all attempts to estimate the number of civilian casualties, but no one disputes that the toll is staggering.
 The U.S. government has behaved as though these dead Iraqis were not even worth counting. In December 2005, President Bush casually mentioned ''30,000, more or less'' as the number of Iraqis killed in the war. The White House later said there were no official estimates of Iraqi deaths.
 We shouldn't be so cavalier. Based on all available evidence, it seems unreasonable to believe that fewer than 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed thus far. Many very serious scholars believe the total is much higher.
 As for the number of wounded and disabled Iraqis -- men, women and children who have lost limbs, or been paralyzed or otherwise maimed in air, rocket and bomb attacks -- no one has a real grasp of the size of the problem.
 ''Just considering the number of the dead and the number of displaced, this is probably the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world,'' said James Paul, the executive director of Global Policy Forum, which recently compiled an extensive report on the war and occupation. ''This is the biggest displacement of people in the Middle East in a very long time.''
 The effect on children of the carnage, the dislocations and the deteriorating quality of daily life has been profound. Conditions in Iraq were dire for children even before the war. One in eight died before the age of 5, many from the effects of malnutrition, polluted water and unsanitary conditions.
 Now, more than four years after the invasion, huge numbers of Iraqi children are finding themselves orphaned, homeless, malnourished, and worse.
 According to Unicef, the U.N.'s children's agency: ''Many children are separated from their families or on the streets, where they are extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Most children have experienced trauma but few receive the care and support they need to help them cope with so much chaos, anxiety and loss.''
 These are just a few of the things you won't hear much about from the American officials in Washington who profess to care so deeply about the people of Iraq.

HEADLINE: The Jane Fonda Effect

 BODY:
Nuclear Energy
 If you were asked to name the biggest global-warming villains of the past 30 years, here's one name that probably wouldn't spring to mind: Jane Fonda. But should it?
 In the movie ''The China Syndrome,'' Fonda played a California TV reporter filming an upbeat series about the state's energy future. While visiting a nuclear power plant, she sees the engineers suddenly panic over what is later called a ''swift containment of a potentially costly event.'' When the plant's corporate owner tries to cover up the accident, Fonda's character persuades one engineer to blow the whistle on the possibility of a meltdown that could ''render an area the size of Pennsylvania permanently uninhabitable.'' 
 ''The China Syndrome'' opened on March 16, 1979. With the no-nukes protest movement in full swing, the movie was attacked by the nuclear industry as an irresponsible act of leftist fear-mongering. Twelve days later, an accident occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in south-central Pennsylvania. 
 Michael Douglas, a producer and co-star of the film -- he played Fonda's cameraman -- watched the T.M.I. accident play out on the real TV news, which interspersed live shots from Pennsylvania with eerily similar scenes from ''The China Syndrome.'' While Fonda was firmly anti-nuke before making the film, Douglas wasn't so dogmatic. Now he was converted on the spot. ''It was a religious awakening,'' he recalled in a recent phone interview. ''I felt it was God's hand.''
 Fonda, meanwhile, became a full-fledged crusader. In a retrospective interview on the DVD edition of ''The China Syndrome,'' she notes with satisfaction that the film helped persuade at least two other men -- the father of her then-husband, Tom Hayden, and her future husband, Ted Turner -- to turn anti-nuke. ''I was ecstatic that it was extremely commercially successful,'' she said. ''You know the expression 'We had legs'? We became a caterpillar after Three Mile Island.''
 The T.M.I. accident was, according to a 1979 President's Commission report, ''initiated by mechanical malfunctions in the plant and made much worse by a combination of human errors.'' Although some radiation was released, there was no meltdown through to the other side of the Earth -- no ''China syndrome'' -- nor, in fact, did the T.M.I. accident produce any deaths, injuries or significant damage except to the plant itself. 
 What it did produce, stoked by ''The China Syndrome,'' was a widespread panic. The nuclear industry, already foundering as a result of economic, regulatory and public pressures, halted plans for further expansion. And so, instead of becoming a nation with clean and cheap nuclear energy, as once seemed inevitable, the United States kept building power plants that burned coal and other fossil fuels. Today such plants account for 40 percent of the country's energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. Anyone hunting for a global-warming villain can't help blaming those power plants -- and can't help wondering too about the unintended consequences of Jane Fonda.
 But the big news is that nuclear power may be making a comeback in the United States. There are plans for more than two dozen new reactors on the drawing board and billions of dollars in potential federal loan guarantees. Has fear of a meltdown subsided, or has it merely been replaced by the fear of global warming?
 The answer may lie in a 1916 doctoral dissertation by the legendary economist Frank Knight. He made a distinction between two key factors in decision making: risk and uncertainty. The cardinal difference, Knight declared, is that risk -- however great -- can be measured, whereas uncertainty cannot. 
 How do people weigh risk versus uncertainty? Consider a famous experiment that illustrates what is known as the Ellsberg Paradox. There are two urns. The first urn, you are told, contains 50 red balls and 50 black balls. The second one also contains 100 red and black balls, but the number of each color is unknown. If your task is to pick a red ball out of either urn, which urn do you choose?
 Most people pick the first urn, which suggests that they prefer a measurable risk to an immeasurable uncertainty. (This condition is known to economists as ambiguity aversion.) Could it be that nuclear energy, risks and all, is now seen as preferable to the uncertainties of global warming?
 France, which generates nearly 80 percent of its electricity by nuclear power, seems to think so. So do Belgium (56 percent), Sweden (47 percent) and more than a dozen other countries that generate at least one-fourth of their electricity by nuclear power. And who is the world's single largest producer of nuclear energy?
 Improbably enough, that would be . . . the United States. Even though the development of new nuclear plants stalled by the early 1980s, the country's 104 reactors today produce nearly 20 percent of the electricity the nation consumes. This share has actually grown over the years along with our consumption, since nuclear technology has become more efficient. While the fixed costs of a new nuclear plant are higher than those of a coal or natural-gas plant, the energy is cheaper to create: Exelon, the largest nuclear company in the United States, claims to produce electricity at 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with 2.2 cents for coal. 
 Nuclear enthusiasm may be on the rise, but it can always be dampened by mention of a single word: Chernobyl. The 1986 Ukrainian disaster killed at least a few dozen people directly and exposed millions more to radiation. A new study by the economists Douglas Almond, Lena Edlund and Marten Palme shows that as far away as Sweden, in areas where the wind carried Chernobyl fallout, babies who were in utero at the time later had significantly worse school outcomes than other Swedish children. 
 But coal, too, has its costs, even beyond the threat of global warming. In the United States, an average of 33 coal miners are killed each year. In China, more than 4,700 coal miners were killed last year alone -- a statistic that the Chinese government has trumpeted as a vast improvement.
 The accident at Three Mile Island ruined one of the two reactors on the site. The other one, operated by Exelon, continues to quietly churn out electricity for 800,000 customers. Outside the plant's training center is a small vegetable garden enclosed in chain-link fencing: corn, tomatoes, beets. Its output is monitored to detect radiation. Although the garden was badly in need of watering during a recent visit, the vegetables were otherwise fine.
 Inside, Christopher Crane, the chief operating officer of Exelon Generation, held forth on the barriers that the nuclear industry must clear before new plants can be built. Among them: the longstanding issue of how to dispose of spent fuel and whether the public has shaken its fear of new nuclear reactors. Crane sat in a conference room within the T.M.I. compound. The view outside was bleak: large, windowless buildings; fencing topped by razor wire; bulletproof sniper stands. Security at all nuclear plants has been heightened since 9/11. If you didn't know better, you would think you were looking at a maximum-security prison.
 This similarity suggests an answer to Crane's point about public acceptance of new nuclear construction. There was a time when people didn't want new prisons built in their backyards -- until they decided that the risk was relatively low and that the rewards, in jobs and tax dollars, were substantial. Will nuclear plants ultimately get the same embrace? The market seems to think so -- Exelon stock has tripled in the past five years -- but it may all depend on what kind of thrillers Hollywood has in the pipeline.

HEADLINE: Where the Deals Are

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
FOR more than a year, home buyers who have been looking in the suburbs of Manhattan have struggled to reconcile market rhetoric with metro-area reality. Technically, the overstocked and sluggish market gave them the upper hand. But when it came to actual negotiations, sellers were clinging tightly to the past, and many scoffed at price reductions of more than a few percentage points. 
 Now, after a nearly nonexistent spring selling season and a summer marred by stock-market jitters, buyers and sellers are closer to a meeting of the minds. Real estate agents and market watchers throughout the region report that houses are selling at prices 5 to 18 percent lower than a year ago. When a property draws multiple bids these days, agents say, it's usually because it's in fantastic condition and priced for the current market.
 ''Homes that have come on the market in the last two or three months have started at prices that are more conservative,'' said Savo Fries, manager of the Houlihan Lawrence offices in Yorktown and Croton-on-Hudson, both in Westchester County. ''Sellers are finally more willing to listen.'' 
 Even in the most exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Conn., where the median sale price has remained relatively flat this year at around $2 million, sellers impatient with the market are entertaining lower offers.
 ''There is an awful lot on the market that is languishing, particularly in the $1.5-million-to-$3.2-million range,'' said Nancy Healy, a partner in Shore and Country Properties. ''You're not going to get a huge discount, but for properties that have been sitting, they will at least listen to you now.''
 Bargain hunters are likely to find sellers far more receptive elsewhere in the metropolitan area -- but not everywhere. Prices in some towns are falling more steeply than in others. While it's difficult to generalize across such a broad market, one overriding factor appears to be driving the differences: the proximity to Manhattan. 
 Jeffrey G. Otteau, president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, N.J., picked out the pattern while analyzing the unsold housing inventory in towns on and around the commuter rail lines into New Jersey. Communities directly on the rail lines and fairly close to the city, like Maplewood, Montclair and Chatham, tend to have less than six months' worth of inventory, a level more characteristic of a rising market than a falling one. Some towns still on rail lines but farther out have slightly higher levels, and those off the rail lines altogether, including Caldwell, Belleville and Harding, more consistently show 6 to 12 months of inventory, an indicator of a downward market. 
 Mr. Otteau surmises that metro-area suburbs are reverting to their pre-1980 dependence upon Manhattan for high-paying jobs. Since 2000, he noted, rising housing costs in the suburbs coupled with the slow rate of job growth outside the city, particularly in high-salaried occupations, have contributed significantly to a trend: more residents who are United States citizens left New York, New Jersey and Connecticut than moved in. 
 In New Jersey from 2000 to 2006, for example, the number leaving the state exceeded the number who moved in by nearly 278,000, according to census data.
 Because the Manhattan economy remains strong and its roaring housing market has yet to slow, housing demand is being driven outward along the rail lines. The towns least accessible to the city, however, are more vulnerable. 
 ''We've returned to a market where Manhattan is once again king,'' Mr. Otteau said. 
 Mr. Otteau has not analyzed inventory levels across the region, but interviews with real estate agents and appraisers suggest the same pattern fits. There are exceptions, of course. Proximity to Manhattan cannot compensate for the socioeconomic challenges facing Newark, for example; it shows a housing inventory of 16 months. And towns an hour or more from Manhattan but close to smaller employment centers, like Stamford or White Plains, are less affected by their distance. 
 Take Basking Ridge, N.J., in Somerset County. Although it's a 90-minute rail commute from Manhattan on New Jersey Transit's Gladstone branch, Basking Ridge shows just four months of housing inventory, most likely because of the concentration of high-paying employers close by. Its housing market is currently oversupplied with four-bedroom colonials in the $600,000-to-$1-million range, but newly built houses costing more than $1.2 million are still selling quite well, said Michael Lattmann, a sales associate with Burgdorff ERA Realtors. 
 ''Properties that have held their value have made updates,'' like renovations or new appliances, Mr. Lattmann said. ''Others are down anywhere from 8 to 15 percent -- effectively, you're paying for that update.'' 
 Town-by-town differences aren't evident in the countywide data gathered by multiple listing services. Agents interviewed made their own calculations for individual towns based on the most current multiple listing data available and on their personal experience.
 For the most part, housing prices in areas at the outer edges of commuter territory, and especially off a rail line, appear to be under considerable downward pressure, particularly at the upper end of the market. 
 Southbury, Conn., about 80 miles from Manhattan just off Interstate 84, had about 150 houses on the market earlier this month, about a year's supply, according to David Nyman, an associate broker with Century 21 Home Services. At least 25 of those listings were priced above $850,000, far more than the market could absorb in a good year, never mind a year in which the market for New Yorkers buying second homes ''has totally dried up,'' Mr. Nyman said. 
 Just below Southbury, in northern Fairfield County, Newtown's inventory ''just keeps climbing and climbing,'' said Valda Thompson, sales manager for the local William Raveis office.
 Checking the number of listings earlier this month, Ms. Thompson let out a squawk. ''Holy cow!'' she exclaimed. ''There are 327 homes on the market, not including condominiums, which is absolutely incredible. We're back in a market like the '80s, where it did take six months to sell a house.'' 
 The slower market worked to the benefit of Elise Sher, who recently closed on a newly built 5,800-square-foot home in a new subdivision in Southbury. The price -- just over $1 million -- wasn't such a great deal compared with prices in Houston, where Ms. Sher and her family had lived. 
 But she acknowledged that the builder gave her and her husband a host of add-ons, including a $20,000 appliance package and a larger patio, without increasing the price. ''Basically, everything I asked for I got,'' she said. 
 Similar houses in the area were priced at $1.2 million to $1.3 million, ''but the builders were just holding out,'' she said. ''Our builder told me he would not have worked with a buyer like this a year ago. He said he had sold a similar house close to a year ago for $150,000 more.'' 
 Likewise, builders in Orange County, N.Y., which has seen a wave of new construction over the last few years, are adjusting their designs downward to put them in lower price ranges. The houses at Oxford Landing, a luxury development in Blooming Grove, in southeast Orange, were originally going to start in the $800,000 range, but the builder has added a slightly smaller model with less expensive exterior finishes that will sell for $600,000 to $700,000, said Matthew Rand, managing partner for the Rockland and Orange County operations at Prudential Rand Realty. 
 At the Fairways, a gated development of town houses and single-family homes priced from $380,000 to $750,000 in Wallkill, the developer, Martin Ginsburg, has put off opening the project's second phase because of the slow market, but he hasn't lowered prices yet. ''The very fact that our pricing is comparable to what it was a year ago is an incentive,'' he said. ''Our costs have gone up, even though our prices haven't. Our margins are disappearing.''
 Ron Valure, the owner and principal broker at Viking Realty in Middletown, said that so much new construction in Orange County is languishing that ''builders left and right are flipping the lots now, just selling off the lots, where a year and a half ago, you never saw that.'' More than 700 lots were for sale earlier this month, though not all have been approved for building, he said. 
 In Putnam County, the median sale price of a single-family home dropped 9 percent, to $398,500, during the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. 
 Although that figure overstates price declines in the Brewster and Carmel market, said Donald A. Mituzas, the Brewster office manager for Prudential Serls Prime Properties, market pressures are evident in the appearance of short sales -- sales of distressed properties in which the lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed. He said he had recently shown four or five such properties in a single weekend.
 Ellen and Joseph Mazzei negotiated what they felt was a very good deal on a house in Carmel that was in foreclosure. They spent months looking at houses in nearby Mahopac last year, only to become frustrated with sellers' unwillingness to negotiate. 
 They had sold their house in Carmel relatively quickly by lowering the price early on, but in Mahopac, prices still seemed ''too high for the condition of the homes,'' Ms. Mazzei said. 
 Raeann Mazzei, Mr. Mazzei's aunt who is an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence, helped them find the house they bought from the bank that owned it. It's a contemporary, built in 1989; it has a new kitchen, but other improvement projects, like the master bath renovation, were left unfinished. 
 The house was listed at $525,900. The Mazzeis offered $475,000 and eventually agreed to pay $485,000, an amount that would have bought only what they considered junk in Mahopac, Ms. Mazzei said. They closed in January. 
 In Yorktown Heights, situated between the Hudson and Harlem Lines of the Metro-North Railroad in northern Westchester, sale prices are down about 12 percent from the height of the market, agents said. The oversupply is highest at the upper end -- above $600,000 -- where there is less demand. Those homeowners ''have competition not only in their own town, but the surrounding towns,'' said Robert Mulvey, vice president for sales at Century 21 Mulvey. 
 In pricier Chappaqua, on the Harlem Line about 10 miles to the south, a decline in the median sale price of about 6 percent in the last year has opened up an ''under $1 million'' category. ''We have 18 properties on the market between $800,000 and $900,000'' said Sena Baron, an associate broker in Houlihan Lawrence's Chappaqua office. ''Two years ago, we had six. It's a new price range.'' 
 On Long Island, the median sale price on single-family homes in Manhasset, on the North Shore in Nassau County, is also down about 6 percent, according to Judi Lovecchio, branch manager of Coach Realtors' Manhasset office. The fairly stable market there has benefited substantially from its proximity to Manhattan -- it's the second Nassau County stop on the Port Washington branch. ''The train line makes a big difference,'' Ms. Lovecchio said. ''You're there in 26 minutes, and there's a million of 'em every day.'' 
 Farther out along the high-priced North Shore, prices are coming down more sharply. Figures supplied by Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, the Manhattan appraisal company, showed declines in median sale prices of 10 to 18 percent in many North Shore localities during the first half of the year compared with the same period last year.
 But the shift there appears to be less tied to commuting times. Joyce Styne, an executive vice president at Century 21 Laffey Associates, said prices were dropping sharply on some shoreline properties, the reason being that they rose so quickly during the housing boom. The market was still so hot in the East Hills and Roslyn area in August 2006 that it took just under 60 days to sell a house. This August, Ms. Styne said, the average number of days on the market was closer to 190. 
 The North Shore was similarly affected in the late 1980s and early 1990s after the downturn in the defense industry, said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, an influential business group. At that time, she said, prices at the higher end, ''where there's more room to adjust,'' dropped by some 20 percent. 
 Roberta Feuerstein, a sales associate with Shawn Elliott, said that in the Dix Hills and Melville area in Suffolk County, just over the Nassau border, prices have come down about 10 percent. Some homeowners are having to reduce their prices by much more, she said, but those houses are usually the ones that were most grossly overpriced.
 Not all sellers have come around to the new reality. ''We have homes overpriced by $300,000 or $400,000 out of just pure insistence,'' she said.

HEADLINE: For Rich Mexicans, Parallel Lives in U.S.

BYLINE: By EUGENE L. MEYER

 BODY:
ANA LUISA SANCHEZ MACCISE, a Mexican citizen, is neither seeking a path to American citizenship nor living a fitful undocumented existence. Yet she lives and works in Houston, where she sends her son to a local private school. She has another home in Mexico City, where her husband still works. He visits his family in Houston regularly. 
 Mrs. Maccise is among a small but growing group of Mexican citizens who are creating parallel lives in this sprawling city north of the border; Dallas and San Antonio are other cities of choice. 
 Their motives are more than economic. They are also seeking a safe haven for themselves and their families, away from the threats of kidnapping, ransom and even murder that are routinely directed at wealthy Mexicans. 
 ''Right now in Mexico City, the situation is not good because of safety problems,'' said Mrs. Maccise, who is 43. ''You can be robbed anytime in any restaurant. You can't drive a nice car. You can't wear a nice watch. So I really like the U.S. because I feel free.''
 Mrs. Maccise lives and works in Houston on a business visa issued as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. A treaty provision allows visas for those making a significant investment in a new business and also for those with Mexican companies doing business in the United States, along with their spouses and children. 
 United States State Department statistics, not broken down by city, show a national increase in the most popular business visa, to 72,613 last year from 57,721 in 2002. 
 Making the move from Mexico to Houston is both a cultural and logistical challenge, and an industry of professionals has grown up around the need for real estate agents, immigration lawyers, bankers and others to ease the way. 
 Mariana Saldana, a broker and owner at the Uptown Real Estate Group, is in no small part responsible for Mrs. Maccise's life in Houston. Ms. Saldana, 56, directed her to an immigration lawyer and helped her to rent space in the Galleria, a shopping mall in Houston, where Mrs. Maccise runs a franchise of the Tane jewelry store. Tane specializes in expensive handmade jewelry and silver and gold art from Mexico. Ms. Saldana even arranged for telephone and cable service for Mrs. Maccise.
 Hoping to cement her client relationships, she also provides additional assistance. ''We're one stop,'' she said. ''If you need a Mercedes, I send you to a Mercedes dealer. A Porsche, I send you to a Porsche dealer. We're like a concierge company. We have gardeners, a pool guy, everything they need. They don't have to pick up the phone.''
 Ms. Saldana has helped potential buyers find private schools for their children and even called a locksmith when a client forgot her key when taking her child to a community pool. 
 She said 80 percent of Uptown Real Estate's business is with Mexicans who have a net worth of up to $100 million. Many pay cash for their homes and are unaffected by market cycles. 
 Mexicans prefer Houston, according to Ms. Saldana, because luxury homes there cost less than those in California, Miami or even Mexico City. And from Houston, there are some 40 daily flights to Mexican cities, with at least 20 to Mexico City, a two-hour trip.
 ''I sometimes go to Mexico for lunch and come back on the 5 p.m. flight,'' said Wilka Varela Toppins, a Puerto Rican-born Houston lawyer who works closely with Ms. Saldana to help Mexicans establish businesses in this country. This year, she said, she has helped to open more than 35 companies from Mexico City, versus about 20 in 2006.
 ''They're here and they're there,'' she said of her clients living and working in both Mexico City and Houston. ''They travel back and forth. They're not interested in becoming U.S. citizens or renouncing Mexican citizenship. They just want to do trade, live here, pay taxes, be responsible residents, and be safe.'' 
 Mrs. Maccise opened her store, where one piece of handmade jewelry sells for $17,000, six years after her first Houston real estate purchase, a condominium near the Galleria, used for weekend shopping trips. She is now living in her third home, which she bought last year for $1.3 million, having sold her first two properties through Ms. Saldana. Situated in the Royal Oaks, a gated golf community, her four-bedroom house overlooks the 12th hole. 
 Like many upscale communities attractive to wealthy Mexicans, Royal Oaks has a high brick wall, multiple locked gates and car patrols. It is what Mexican buyers say want when they move north, based on what they already have at home. 
 ''We're so used to having it, coming here, without all this you don't feel O.K., even though you are O.K.,'' said Aldo Novi, an architect and builder who lives in the Woodlands neighborhood, where he is building homes in the gated community of Carlton Woods. 
 CURRENTLY, Mr. Novi is building a $1 million home for Alejandro Chaoul, 38, who has lived in Royal Oaks for four years with his wife and children. Mr. Chaoul, who works for the Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex and travels back and forth, would like to move to Carlton Woods, where he and his family can live in a larger house in what he regards as an even more secure community. 
 ''I really want to stay in the States,'' he said. ''My main reason is my kids. In Mexico, you can get kidnapped pretty easily. You can't take them to the supermarket or grocery store because you maybe turn around and lose them.''
 ''Seguridad'' (Spanish for security) in Houston is what Ms. Saldana includes in her advertisements in Mexican magazines. Also, through word of mouth -- her ''best advertising,'' she says -- she finds other clients. 
 But she offers much more than property. For those needing financing for a home or a business, Ms. Saldana refers her clients to bankers she knows. Among them is Mexican-born Ana M. Kennedy, a senior loan officer for Chase Home Lending, which has a special program for international clients without a credit history in the United States.
 ''Their credit can be ascertained from their own country,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''They are exceptional borrowers with superb qualifications.''
 On a recent weekday, Ms. Saldana spent 12 hours with Fernando Sanchez de Orando, 40, of Mexico City, who is planning to open a Houston branch of his family's newsprint brokerage business. After a two-day search, Mr. Sanchez contracted to buy a $1 million home in the Woodlands. 
 ''I like the United States, Texas and Houston,'' he said, ''and my family and I want to make a change. We are looking for a better quality of life for us and the children.''

HEADLINE: Big Man Off Campus

BYLINE: By BILL PERKINS. 
Bill Perkins, a Democrat, is a state senator who represents Harlem.

 BODY:
WE have an affordable housing crisis in New York City. And yet imagine what would happen if a publicly operated affordable housing agency got the go-ahead to seize a parcel of land on Columbia University's campus to build apartments for low-income residents of Harlem. 
 Sounds absurd, doesn't it? But why? After all, eminent domain laws let government entities condemn private property for things that are a benefit to the public, like the construction of a highway or a water-treatment plant. 
 But what conventional opinion doesn't find absurd is that Columbia University, a private entity, has contemplated invoking eminent domain to seize private property and expand its campus in West Harlem.
 For now, Columbia insists eminent domain would have only a minimal role in its 17-acre growth plan since the university already holds title to most of the properties within its development footprint.
 Such assurances, however, do little to ease public concern. In August, Community Board 9 voted to overwhelmingly oppose Columbia's expansion plan unless the university disavows the possibility of using eminent domain among other conditions. 
 This brings me back to my original question: Why is the notion of taking Columbia's land for a public use like affordable housing laughable while the inverse is viewed as wholly reasonable? 
 It all comes down to the distorted values of what constitutes ''public good'' as understood through our eminent domain laws. When powerful interests so twist and bend the law to match preconceived notions of ''public benefit,'' then the most reasonable proposal begins to seem the most absurd, and vice versa.
 Perhaps the absurdity resides in the law itself, and how it is applied. Clearly we need to shift our thinking about the appropriate use of eminent domain. Unfortunately, we've become comfortable slanting the law in favor of the ''big guy's'' interests over those of the ''little guy.''
 Take, for instance, the United States Supreme Court's ruling two years ago in Kelo v. City of New London. The court ended up narrowly siding with New London, Conn., in its use of eminent domain to condemn houses and businesses for economic development purposes associated with a Pfizer research site nearby. Here, again, a public entity -- New London -- served as the armor for a land grab by private interests. And the court accepted it.
 A similar kind of shell game is apparent in Columbia's proposed expansion, with New York State potentially supplying the public shield. In 2004, Charles Gargano, then the chairman of New York's Empire State Development Corporation, signed onto a letter by Columbia officials requesting that the corporation serve as the public agent of its West Harlem property condemnation plan.
 I support discussions between Columbia and community leaders about ways the university's expansion can benefit residents of Harlem, especially young people, through the construction of a community center or the development of student recruitment programs. But concessions like these can in no way justify the taking of private property.

HEADLINE: Washington's Black Majority Is Shrinking

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Much has changed since Ben's Chili Bowl opened some 50 years ago on a bustling strip known as America's Black Broadway for its thriving black-owned shops and theaters.
 The diner was a popular hangout for black bankers, doctors and blue-collar workers. Jazz greats Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald could be found enjoying milkshakes and sausages called half-smokes, smothered in chili, after performing at nearby clubs.
 Now, the crowd at Ben's can be mostly white, reflecting a neighborhood metamorphosis characterized by new condominiums and Starbucks. ''Sometimes you look around and wonder, 'Where are all the black people?' '' said Virginia Ali, who opened the diner with her husband, Ben, in 1958. 
 Across Washington the black population is declining and whites and other ethnic groups are moving in. 
 The change is shaking up city politics, reshaping neighborhoods and displacing longtime residents. 
 The black population peaked at 71 percent in 1970 as tens of thousands of white residents left Washington for the suburbs, according to the Census Bureau, but by 2006, blacks had fallen back to 57 percent of the population.
 The white population, which had plunged from 65 percent in 1950 to 27 percent 30 years later, is growing. By 2006, the census estimated that 38 percent of Washington residents were white. The Asian and Hispanic populations are also growing. 
 Analysts attribute the shift to lower-income and middle-class blacks leaving for the suburbs as young white professionals and others able to afford expensive housing are moving in. The newcomers are being lured by a robust economy, new condominiums and a chance to escape increasing highway congestion.
 ''The city today is occupied by a lot of singles and childless couples who have put incomes together,'' said Robert Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. ''I don't think it's a straight-on white gentrification; it's more affluent as a whole.''
 Neighborhoods in other cities have gentrified in recent years, but the change in Washington is significant, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Frey said the city could cease to have a black majority by 2015, although he said blacks would still be the largest ethnic group.
 The city's racial diversification is reflected in local politics. Adrian M. Fenty, who became mayor in January, is black, but many of his appointees are not. The police and fire chiefs are white, as is the city administrator. The new chancellor of the city's public schools is Korean-American. Under previous mayors, those positions had been held by blacks. 
 Kenneth Carroll, 47, a writer who has lived in Washington all his life, said the changes have meant a loss of what he believes once defined the District of Columbia, a sense of pride among black residents that came from their majority status. That pride was instilled in everything, from political activism to music, which included homegrown artists like Chuck Brown. 
 ''A lot of blacks saw D.C. as sort of the mecca,'' said Mr. Carroll, who is black. ''You came here for education, to get a good job.'' 
 But businesses and residents fled after the riots of 1968 that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Then came the cocaine epidemic of the 1980s. Buildings were razed to make way for a subway line.
 Now, many neighborhoods are booming. In Columbia Heights, cranes dot the skyline as workers finish construction on a huge retail complex. Condominiums nearby are listed for sale at $300,000 and up.
 Near the new convention center on the edge of downtown, Shirley Williams is trying to hold on to the apartment she has lived in for 33 years. Her landlord recently agreed to sell to a developer who plans to demolish the building. 
 ''I've been here through all the rough times and now that it's getting better they want me to leave,'' said Ms. Williams, who worked as a teacher's assistant before she retired. ''I don't think that's right.'' 
 Jim Graham, a council member who represents racially mixed neighborhoods, said city officials had worked to preserve thousands of low-income housing units in a red-hot housing market. ''If I wanted to live in a neighborhood where everybody looked and acted like me, I have many choices,'' said Mr. Graham, who is white. ''I like a diverse neighborhood.''
 In May, 56,463 families -- the most ever -- were on a waiting list for vouchers for subsidized housing, according to the latest statistics from the city's housing authority.
 Signs of frustration have appeared. A local blog has posted complaints about graffiti that reads: ''Go Home Rich White People.'' 
 At Ben's Chili Bowl, however, Ms. Ali said she was pleased to see the city recovering. She said she was nostalgic, though, for the days when U Street felt like a family.
 ''You lose the closeness of an ethnic community, '' she said.

HEADLINE: 'I Had to Work, Because If I Didn't, There Wouldn't Be Food on the Plate.'

BYLINE: Interviewed by EMILY BRADY. 
Interviewed by EMILY BRADY

 BODY:
JASON MONEGRO, West Bronx
 DeWitt Clinton High School
 BORN Jan. 9, 1990
 RIGHT now, life is confusing and a little stressful. This is the age that a lot of people consider you a young adult. That means a lot of responsibilities, a lot of depending on yourself and not on your parents. 
 Since my mom is divorced and unemployed, she has her hands full with my younger sister, who is 15, and my baby sister, who was born in 2004. I helped her out with the rent. It was around $900 a month. I would make $400 and change. I paid $300 for rent and $100 for groceries. 
 The job that I had was with my grandfather working after school and on weekends in a bike rental shop in Central Park. My grandfather needed help and he doesn't trust people, so he'd rather have his family with him. Basically, I would repair bikes, make sure that they are returned, and give bike tours. For a time I liked it, but I wanted bigger and better things, so I stopped. I worked from when I was 15 until January of this year. 
 My mom had a lot of bills back then. I have two older brothers; they already grew up, and my three older sisters moved out and have their own families. At that time, it was just me, my mother and my two little sisters. All of my paycheck would be for food and rent. 
 I really didn't care. I wasn't very materialistic. I was the man of the house. I was raised in a Christian house and my mom has Christian rules and Christian morals. Material things, clothes and things like that, are the least we should worry about, because when we go to heaven, we're not going to have any of those things, and we're not going to worry about them.
 Right now, my dad is in prison. I really don't know why, but what they told me is that they found him with a big amount of drugs. 
 I looked up to him. Half of my morals I got from him. He was a hard-working man, sweet and kind, and he had a good heart. If anybody on the block needed food or money or anything, it didn't matter if he had to pay bills the next week, he gave it to them. 
 He's been locked up for the past four years in upstate New York. I don't know where exactly. I visited him two years ago. That's when I got the courage to be the man of the house, because no one else was present at the time.
 I was an honor student until I got to high school. Unfortunately, I started hanging out with the wrong crew, and education-wise I started going downhill. I started cutting class. I was having all of these personal issues, family issues. School at the time wasn't the last thing in my head, but it wasn't as important as wrestling and work. Work at the time was a duty. I had to work, because if I didn't, there wouldn't be food on the plate. Wrestling is just my passion. 
 I'm into freestyle wrestling. It's been my passion since I was little. I started when I was 8. I like the adrenaline. I love the attention and I love seeing the smiles. The sport at first seems brutal and the people violent and unprofessional, but when you train for it, you learn that it's all about finesse and precision and that it's a very serious sport. There's also acting involved. They call me Vargas. I'm part of a tag-team called SPIC. It's an acronym for Spanish Political International Cartel. 
 I want to be a professional wrestler. I make $40 an hour with SPIC, but it's only one show a month and I still need another job. I have that dream to take my wrestling to an arena in Manhattan or somewhere big. My other goal is to get enough money to buy a center where anyone who's interested could train for free, to give back to the community. 
 Recently, my aunt bought a house down in Kissimmee, Fla. My mom decided to move there because everything is cheaper down there and it's more economical. I decided to go in April because it was better for me educationally and to help her out, because she needed a man of the house. I came back after a month. It's a nice place, but it's not my home. 
 I'm staying with my sister right now. She's helping me out, but in a way I'm helping her out too. She's 23 and she's a single mother; she has a 6-year-old and a 2-year-old. She works nights at the front desk of a hotel in Manhattan, so I baby-sit and she gives me like 20 or 40 bucks. Tomorrow she has to go work, so she'll leave at 5 or 6 p.m. and I'll pick up the kids from day care, take them home, feed them, bathe them, whatever. 
 I'm looking for a job. I'm really good with my hands, so I'm looking for a job in maintenance or something like that. I'm trying to go back to high school, but since I already left this year, I didn't finish the year because I was officially discharged, so going back now would be a total waste of time. Either I take the G.E.D., which I really don't want to do, or I go back to Florida and try and get my own place and finish school there. 
 I could make a novel out of my life. I don't even know what I would call it, but my life has been crazy, let's put it that way.

 BODY:
DAVID HELENE, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn
 Packer Collegiate Institute
 BORN July 9, 1990
 I LIVE on Clinton Street in Cobble Hill. My dad's a furniture designer and my mom's a literary agent. Cobble Hill is a neighborhood that has just sprung up. Smith Street used to be a shabby, run-down street, and now there are all these restaurants. Court Street has become better, too. Like, Joya, you know, the Thai restaurant? It's a really hip place, and you notice that lots of 20-year-olds go there, and people just out of college. 
 I don't go to Park Slope much. I have friends who live there, but I think the kids who go to Berkeley Carroll are kind of cocky. The partying is also way more intense there than over here. They drink a lot more than we do, and I've heard that the drug use may be a little more. 
 Occasionally I'll go to TriBeCa to hang out, because I have friends who live there. Going into the city is more fun than going deep into Brooklyn. Otherwise, I prefer to hang around here and go to parties in the neighborhood, or go to my friend's house, because he has a full floor dedicated to just hanging out, with a pool table and all that. 
 Culturewise, the Upper East Side, or the Brearleys of the world, those kids do a lot of drugs. They do drugs that kids from Packer, where I go, don't touch. Like heroin. 
 I have a story about my friend Brian, one of my best friends, who came to Packer in freshman year of high school. He lives in Manhattan. He was a wreck. He would come from the city, and he'd call me and he'd say, ''Yeah, I don't really recognize where I am.'' I'm like, ''Well, where did you come from?'' He said, ''I was on the J train.'' I said, ''What were you doing on the J train?'' He's like, ''I'm at Atlantic Avenue.'' I'm like: ''Is there a huge mall around you? You're not even close. You need to come back up on the 4.''
 I feel really safe in the neighborhood. I've never really had an altercation. 
 One time this year, some kids started talking trash to my friend, and we started yelling back, and I ran and got some bats, and they just turned around and walked in the other direction. So that's like the closest I've ever gotten to getting into a fight.
 I'm a lifer at Packer. I started when I was 3 years old. These days, a lot of my friends have gotten into the mind-set: ''I'm not going to college, I'm freaking out that I'm not getting in.'' Our year is the most competitive year in the history of college applications. Or something like that. Some statistic that isn't really helping the stress levels for most kids. 
 MOST kids at Packer are liberal. I think a lot of us are blindly liberal, because a lot of people my age aren't politically aware. I know that Bush cut taxes, but I need to learn more about economics to understand the effects. During the year, I don't have time to read a newspaper, because I go from school to sports, then go home and do my homework. I'm trying to work on that. 
 Most of my friends listen to rap and hip-hop. I don't think many of my friends listen to pop, except for maybe Justin Timberlake. It's a downloading culture. I do have some friends who use the iTunes music store, but generally most of my friends do not use legal methods for obtaining their music. It's not really surprising. It's not like an album is cheap these days. 
 I don't think Brooklyn slang is that different from Manhattan slang. But I'm not used to a lot of the slang my friends use. Months ago, I first heard, ''There are mad heads here.'' I was like, ''Where did that come from?'' For a while they were saying, ''That's type funny.'' I was like: ''What? What do you mean by that?'' It means ''very funny.'' Or they were like, ''That's dumb stupid.'' I'm like, ''That's redundant.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: September 23, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A first-person article last Sunday, based on a transcription of an interview with a 17-year-old who lives in Brooklyn and attends Packer Collegiate Institute, included comments by the teenager that there were drinking at the Berkeley Carroll School in Park Slope, and drug use at Berkeley Carroll and at schools on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Those remarks were unsubstantiated and based in part on hearsay, and should not have been included in the article.

HEADLINE: Should Fed Tread Lightly On Rates?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to cutting interest rates, a little may go a long way. As the debate heats up over whether the Federal Reserve will lower rates by a quarter- or half-percentage-point on Tuesday -- no cut at all has been all but dropped from consideration -- one investment adviser thinks the smaller option is better. 
 ''The Fed is caught between enormous pressure to do something and mostly internally generated pressure not to be seen giving in'' to Wall Street interests demanding a big cut, said P. Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at the New York fund manager TIAA-CREF. One reason that he finds a quarter-point cut more prudent is that if central bankers opt for a half-point move and the markets continue to fare poorly, what do they do for an encore?
 ''The Fed needs to have some more ammo,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''We're not dealing with high interest rates here. The Fed does not want to over-cut.''
 The Fed is not expected to cut too too much. While a growing number of investment professionals seem to think that a half-point move is likely, a Bloomberg News poll of economists continues to anticipate a quarter-point reduction in the key federal funds rate, to 5 percent.
 Whether that will please the shaky stock market is another story. Mr. Hammond contends that traders would react less favorably to a quarter-point move.
 Futures contracts ''are pricing in a big drop'' in rates in coming months, he said. If that drop does not get off to a rousing start on Tuesday, ''the markets could be very disappointed.''
 But while stocks could tumble if the Fed makes the smaller cut, Mr. Hammond says only the larger one would spark a small rally. And even if a half-point cut did help the markets on Tuesday, it might prove less beneficial in the long run, in his view, because it would send the wrong message to trading firms whose risk-taking helped land the markets in the mess they have been in lately.
 ''We all need to be reminded in financial services that when the markets are bad, it doesn't mean the U.S. economy is bad,'' he said. ''We're not the center of the universe.''
 DATA WATCH The Fed and the markets may get some good news just before the rate decision on Tuesday. Wholesale prices, excluding food and energy items, are estimated in the Bloomberg poll to have risen by a modest 0.1 percent in August, the same as July. The next day, August core consumer prices are forecast to show a 0.2 percent rise, also matching the July number.
 A report on Wednesday on housing market conditions is expected to show more of the weakness to which investors have grown accustomed. Housing starts and building permits are both forecast to have fallen last month.

HEADLINE: While in the Kitchen, Stir the Stew and Surf the Web

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DREAM kitchens may soon include a computer along with the latest refrigerator or oven. That way people gathered at the family hub can satisfy their digital needs along with nutritional ones.
 Hewlett-Packard's new TouchSmart IQ770 PC ($1,699 at Circuit City) is designed for that kitchen of the future, where people turn on the computer along with the coffeepot, and then check the screen for the weather, ball scores and the family calendar as they breakfast.
 The calendar on the TouchSmart is easy to use. Entries can be written on the touch-sensitive screen with a finger or stylus, or entered on a keyboard, so that everyone knows what's ahead during the day, from the dentist at 9 a.m. to the PTA at 7 p.m. 
 The computer also has a high-definition TV receiver, a DVD player and a 19-inch screen that moves up and down as well as tilting, so that people having a snack at the counter or a nearby table can watch their favorite show or video Putting a computer in the kitchen is not a new idea. Neiman Marcus, the department store, included an ad for a Honeywell kitchen computer, priced at $10,600, in its 1969 Christmas catalog, said Dag Spicer, senior curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. 
 The ad featured a woman in need of a computer to manage recipe quantities and carried the slogan, ''If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can compute.'' But Mr. Spicer said the marketing campaign failed. ''As far as we know, Neiman Marcus didn't sell a single computer.''
 The latest generation of kitchen computers may be more successful, and not just because the ads are less patronizing. The difference instead may lie in the spread, and speed, of broadband connections and the way that, in turn, is changing people's computer habits. 
 ''Forty-seven percent of all American adults have a broadband connection at home as of early 2007,'' said Mary Madden, a senior research specialist at the Pew Internet and American Life Project. That connection has prompted people to do more and more on the computer, from video-watching to discarding phone books and cookbooks in favor of online research. ''Once people get that always-on connection,'' she said, ''they do more of everything online.'' 
 Much of this home Internet activity is happening not in the study, but in shared living spaces, she said. Seventy-four percent of teenagers who use the Internet at home, for instance, do so in a shared space.
 Hewlett-Packard's new computer is designed for these communal spots, said Amy Clark of Granger, Ind., who was sent a TouchSmart for review on her Web site, www.momadvice.com. She put it in the kitchen-dining area, and it promptly became a family focal point. In the morning, she checks the calendar; in the evening, she and her husband watch movies on it. ''It also helped reduce some clutter,'' she said. The family also downloaded hundreds of CDs that were once scattered around the house on it.
 The touch-sensitive screen on the TouchSmart is optically driven -- it has two cameras that track hand positions, so that people can use their fingers to play computer solitaire or chess, for instance, if they don't want to use the mouse or keyboard. Gloved hands work well, too, as do hands with a bit of left-over spaghetti sauce on them. The screen comes clean with Windex.
 People taken with the idea of a computer in the kitchen don't necessarily have to buy one from a manufacturer like Hewlett-Packard. They can economize by assembling one from components. Bill Ekhardt, a Presbyterian pastor taking time off to care for his three preschool-aged children in Des Moines, did just that -- after first trying to make do in the kitchen with a laptop. That didn't work, as the laptop could easily be pulled down from the counter and wrecked by the children, he said.
 SO when he upgraded his desktop computer in the study, he decided to recycle the leftovers to make a reasonably childproof kitchen computer. He installed the processor from his old computer in a kitchen cupboard, and mounted the monitor on an arm that he bought online. 
 The mounting arm swings out above the kitchen counter. 
 ''I angle the screen down so the kids can see it, or angle it up so that I can see it from where I'm cooking,'' he said. 
 He uses the computer to check the weather, or catch an occasional headline, e-mail messages or a streaming radio show. The arm was about $70 at www.newegg.com; the wireless keyboard and mouse, about $30.
 His 2-year-old son Asher gets to watch the occasional entertainment on the monitor, but there are conditions. 
 ''I let him play 'Thomas the Tank Engine,' '' a preschool video game, said Mr. Ekhardt. ''But only if he takes a good nap first.''

HEADLINE: A Hunt for Big Game Yields a Trophy by G.M.

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
ERROL, N.H.
 WE are hunting moose in northern New Hampshire, a predatory band of three adults and two children in the new Buick Enclave.
 Nicely equipped in all other respects, our 2008 Enclave lacks a gun rack, but that is not a problem on this hunt. While this state does allow moose hunting -- a pursuit that strikes me as presenting all the challenge and peril of bagging a dairy cow -- we are just hoping for a moose sighting to amuse a pair of visiting nephews from the suburbs of Cleveland.
 The newest member of the Buick family, the Enclave went on sale in the spring, in part to fill the void created by the dismissal of the Rainier, Terraza and Rendezvous models, Buick's entries in the S.U.V., minivan and crossover market segments. Expecting one vehicle to replace three might seem like a daunting assignment, but the Enclave is intended to attract buyers who spend more and are import-minded. In any case, the combined sales of the three pink-slipped Buicks amounted to only about 71,000 last year. 
 The name Enclave suggests upper-class luxury, peace and quiet. Frankly, I prefer the name suggested by a colleague -- the 2008 Buick Gated Community -- because that seems even more protective and exclusive. Whatever you call it, the Enclave is quite good, though not perfect. But it certainly provides quiet and soothing family transportation and is a pleasing alternative to a trucklike S.U.V.
 The Enclave shares its car-type mechanical underpinnings, including a six-speed automatic transmission and 3.6-liter V-6 engine, with two cousins in the General Motors family, the GMC Acadia and the Saturn Outlook. The Enclave has three rows of seats, is available in seven- or eight-passenger configurations, and is aimed at competitors like the Acura MDX and Lexus RX 350.
 Prices begin at $32,790 for a front-wheel drive CX; the fancier CXL starts at $34,990. All-wheel drive adds $2,000. 
 The Buick is the most expensive of G.M.'s crossover triplets, although the amount of standard equipment varies among the three. The Acadia starts at $29,845 and the Outlook at $28,340. The fanciest Outlook, with all-wheel drive, is $150 less than the least-expensive front-drive Enclave. The front-drive Enclave CX I tested had options that included a Bose stereo and a DVD player ($1,980); the total on the window sticker was $36,260.
 As dusk enveloped our hunting party, we cruised through Errol here in the northeast corner of the state, an area with a reputation as a moose-rich environment. Some 30 miles of roaming had not resulted in a single moose sighting, but we traveled in comfort. The Enclave's suspension provides a splendid buffer against rough two-lane roads and the cabin is quiet.
 The Enclave gets more soundproofing than its cousins. This reflects G.M.'s idea that a quiet interior should be a virtue of all Buicks; noise isolation has become a main selling point for Lexus, a brand Buick hopes to compete against. 
 We also had a pleasing amount of room. During our week in the Enclave we routinely carried five adults and two children on hourlong drives without anyone being uncomfortable, even when two adults shared the third row with a child. There was enough room behind the third row (19 cubic feet) to carry duffel bags and a small cooler.
 The cabin's design showed that G.M. was successful in its effort to upgrade its interiors, apparently after concluding that this is where people sit and it should look nice. But there were some minor problems.
 Rear visibility wasn't good because of the huge roof pillars in the back. A ''smart slide'' feature for moving the second-row captain's chairs forward (to allow easier entry to the third row) was balky. A strap used to release the seatback and allow it to fold forward proved a real hazard; pulling it sent the seatback slamming forward at great speed, whacking anybody in its path. 
 The good news for families is that all Enclaves have curtain air bags to provide head protection in a side-impact crash for all three rows and skid-correcting electronic stability control.
 There is also OnStar, which now offers turn-by-turn route guidance, a feature I found easier to use than many traditional navigation systems. Call OnStar and give the operator an address, and audible and written instructions are sent to the vehicle. The system worked well even in Boston, one of America's great navigational challenges.
 Toting all this around is an independent suspension that is quite a trickster. During my first miles around town it seemed as if the steering was a little too light and the suspension too soft. It was easy to conclude that the Enclave was sloppy. But my attitude changed as I drove New Hampshire's zigzag two-lanes, steadily increasing speed as I gained confidence in the Buick's handling. Yes, the body leans a little, but the Enclave corners quite well for such a big vehicle.
 G.M.'s engineers get no points for being weight-watchers. With all-wheel drive, the Enclave weighs about 5,000 pounds, a considerable load for an engine rated at 275 horsepower and 251 pound-feet of torque. The six-speed automatic was developed with Ford, which uses it on vehicles including the Edge and the 2008 Taurus. 
 With seven people on board, the powertrain did an adequate job, though at times the transmission was slow to downshift, leaving the driver waiting for acceleration. Ford seems to have done a better job of programming the transmission for its vehicles.
 For the front-drive model I tested, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates fuel economy at 16 miles a gallon in the city and 24 on the highway. Those figures were calculated under the new 2008 formula, which is intended to be more realistic than previous estimates.
 The Enclave has four-wheel disc brakes. Initially, the brake pedal seems firm and reassuring. But it loses some resistance about midway, slightly undermining confidence.
 A dozen or so miles north of Errol, as dusk fades to darkness, we admit to failure in our moose hunt and decide to head home. A small dirt road looks like the perfect turnaround spot, and I pull in. 
 There, maybe 100 feet away, chomping on some greenery, is a moose. The moose looks up and continues its buffet, assuming we have come in peace. See what I mean about the challenge of shooting a moose?
 Clearly the moose is not impressed with us or the Enclave. I, on the other hand, have grown to like it, and it has been so long since I liked a Buick that the experience is slightly disorienting. This big wagon offers families comfort, competent handling and a solid package of safety features. 
 Our hunt successful, the nephews wonder whether they may turn on the DVD player, and if there is a shortcut home. No, the house is a couple of hours away, but in the Enclave that's not a bad thing. 
 INSIDE TRACK: Wow. This is a Buick?

HEADLINE: What's New In the Old Country?

BYLINE: By MARK BLANKENSHIP

 BODY:
THE Troubles are over, but the trouble has just begun. 
 That could be the tag line for ''Rock Doves,'' a savage drama by the Northern Irish playwright Marie Jones that receives its world premiere Sunday at the Irish Arts Center in Midtown Manhattan. Set in present-day Belfast, it depicts four outsiders -- including a transvestite and a homeless man -- enduring the aftermath of the Belfast Agreement, which ostensibly ended paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland in 1998. Of course declaring peace isn't the same as having it, and as she's hiding from the hostility in her neighborhood, a prostitute named Bella declares, ''Compared to what's going on out there, we're normal.''
 Its thorny view of peacetime makes ''Rock Doves''' an obvious fit for the arts center, which was founded in 1972 to demonstrate the breadth of Irish life and culture through classes, film, music, dance, the visual arts -- and theater. 
 The center's leaders say they especially want their programming to reflect watershed recent events -- like the nation's economic boom and the restoration of Northern Ireland's government -- that are pushing Ireland into a new age. 
 Pauline Turley, vice chairwoman of the center's board, said such developments weren't always reflected in the cultural works that appear in New York. ''For a lot of people their exposure to Irish culture in the mainstream is the drunken Irish priest or some other stereotype,'' she said. ''To have a place that celebrates so much more about being Irish is important. Our challenge is to see Irishness in all its complexities.''
 That's partly why the center staged ''The Blowin of Baile Gall'' in 2005. Featuring an African character who joins a local construction team, Ronan Noone's drama explores the tension created by an influx of immigrants to Western Ireland, a subject little discussed in the United States. 
 In a telephone interview, the actor Gabriel Byrne, who has advocated on the center's behalf with the Irish government, said that such performances can be much more than entertainment. ''The danger of Irish culture becoming stuck in the notions of the 19th century is very real,'' he said. ''Irish-American culture is in danger of dying if it doesn't get the chance to reflect the new Ireland.''
 Mr. Byrne added that a ''new self-confidence'' created by Ireland's recent prosperity -- a report from the Bank of Ireland cited a 19 percent increase in the nation's net wealth in 2006 over the previous year -- has pushed the Irish to reinvigorate their cultural representation abroad.
 In its current state, though, the Irish Arts Center can hardly support such ambition. Tucked away on West 51st Street near 11th Avenue, a block in the Clinton neighborhood where boarded-up windows abound, its 99-seat theater and unassuming classrooms hardly match the grandeur of, say, Scandinavia House on Park Avenue. ''We want to succeed,'' Ms. Turley said, ''but we're almost afraid to be too successful, because we simply don't have the capacity.''
 International efforts are under way to build a new home. Mr. Byrne, who said he wants the center to include meeting and social space, said he would meet with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland this month to discuss expansion plans. 
 Christine Quinn, the New York City Council speaker and Irish-American herself, has also championed growth. ''For the Irish Arts Center to become a permanent part of the cultural infrastructure,'' she said, ''we need to make sure it has a physical space that reflects the contribution that Irish people have made and continue to make to New York.''
 As for the center's programming, the city has committed to increasing its support to $40,000 next year from $6,000 this year. Aidan Connolly, the center's executive director, also said that the Irish government, which provided about 4 percent of the center's $693,000 budget this year, had urged him ''to apply for greater levels of funding for programming.'' 
 Still, the money must develop projects people want to see. A study by the center suggests that its patrons crave old-fashioned fare as much as political art. ''There's clearly a population of our supporters and audiences who are very interested in things like traditional Irish music,'' Mr. Connolly said, adding that classes on step dancing and the Irish language are among the center's most popular.
 Besides, strong work about the current Irish moment may not always be easy to find. Ciaran O'Reilly, producing director of the Irish Repertory Theater, one of New York's most respected nonprofit theater companies, said he also wants to stage the ''voice of the new Ireland,'' though he hasn't found the ideal play to reflect it. ''Maybe it takes time to gain that perspective,'' he said.
 ''People like to think the place they came from will always be there, but in a way -- and it's a sad thing -- the bigger cities are becoming more homogenized,'' Mr. O'Reilly added. ''If people don't remember their heritage, it gets lost, and I think the theater's job is to heighten our sense both of what is and what was.''
 Mr. Connolly said the center's traditional programming could help awaken New Yorkers to the culture's future. ''Whatever it is that's hooking people into Irish arts, that's great,'' he explained. ''As long as they're interested, we can take that opportunity to stretch their consciousness and take them in a new direction.''

 BODY:
DOMINION OF MEMORIES: Jefferson, Madison, and the Decline of Virginia. By Susan Dunn. (Basic Books, $27.50.) Virginia's ''brilliant, forward-looking, transforming leaders,'' Dunn writes, ''created a nation'' and then controlled the executive branch for 32 of the first 36 years of America's constitutional government. Virginia was once the wealthiest and most populous state, but by the early decades of the 19th century, its soil had been depleted by primitive farming methods; its schools were ''miserable,'' according to Jefferson; and its roads were ''execrable,'' a disgruntled visitor said. Its constitution preserved elitist government long after most states had expanded suffrage, and its plantation aristocracy deliberately hindered the economic dynamism that was modernizing the North. 
Slavery's role in the decline of the South is an old story, but Dunn, a professor of humanities at Williams College, finds fresh insights by making a case study of Virginia. She emphasizes the significance of lesser-known figures like Thomas Roderick Dew, who in 1832 published an essay that laid the intellectual groundwork for an uncompromisingly pro-slavery ideology, and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, who anticipated secession with an 1836 novel envisioning a Southern rebellion. Dunn's chief aim, though, is to show the complicity of Jefferson and Madison in Virginia's stagnation. Both men strained against plantation dogma, Jefferson because of his egalitarian creed and Madison because of a wavering faith in the national government he'd helped design. Yet they both acquiesced as states' rights radicals adduced anti-Federalist pronouncements by the two founders to trump moderate opponents. ''The seeds of Virginia's decline had been adroitly planted in fertile soil by the great patriarchs themselves,'' Dunn concludes. 
 1001 NIGHTS IN IRAQ: The Shocking Story of an American Forced to Fight for Saddam Against the Country He Loves. By Shant Kenderian. (Atria, paper, $15.) An Iraqi of Armenian descent who moved to Chicago with his mother after his parents separated, Kenderian describes himself as ''a guy with really bad timing.'' He certainly picked an inauspicious moment to visit his father in Iraq: September 1980, seven days before Saddam Hussein attacked Iran. Trapped behind closed borders, Kenderian evaded military service by attending college. But after graduating in 1985, he chose enlistment over execution and began a three-year stint in the Iraqi Navy. His luck was no better in the sequel. After the Iran war, Kenderian's green card was in the middle of being processed when Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. The bulk of ''1001 Nights in Iraq,'' describing his life as a soldier during the Persian Gulf war, is the stuff of a standard battle memoir: comradeship, bad food, sleepless nights and boredom interrupted by violence. But this account is distinguished by Kenderian's wry humor and peculiar predicament. With his deep faith in Christianity and America, he was even more reluctant than most of Hussein's conscripts. Facing a hopeless fight against an American warplane, Kenderian's unit surrendered. As a P.O.W., he charmed his guards with his distinctively American ingenuousness; he even fell in love. Kenderian was eventually allowed to return to America, where his fortunes improved strikingly. He became an engineer, a father and a citizen. And he caught another break when he was broadcast reading from this book, which was originally self-published, on ''This American Life.'' 
 TORTURE: When the Unthinkable Is Morally Permissible. By Mirko Bagaric and Julie Clarke. (State University of New York, cloth, $53.50; paper, $17.95.) This book will convince you either that utilitarian principles justify torture in certain circumstances or that scholars in thrall to a hypothesis can rationalize almost anything. Bagaric and Clarke, who teach law at Deakin University in Australia, offer a forthright defense of a practice whose proponents often resort to euphemism. The authors draw a distinction between ''consequential moral theories,'' which judge an act based on its outcome, and ''nonconsequential'' theories, which judge an act intrinsically and are the basis for the concept of universal human rights. Bagaric and Clarke reject this latter view, declaring that ''absolute right'' theories ''lack a coherent foundation.'' These approaches are not always in opposition, they note, since human rights can function as ''shortcuts'' in performing a ''utilitarian calculus.'' To evaluate when the ends justify the means of torture, Bagaric and Clarke have devised a quasi-mathematical formula involving factors like ''the number of lives at risk'' and ''the immediacy of the harm.'' But how reliable is their ethical calculator? Rather than trusting individuals to determine when torture would maximize happiness, many enlightened societies have opted for a blanket prohibition. Such moral absolutes have a utilitarian purpose: they act as restraints against shortsighted arguments for sanctioning barbarity in the name of expediency.
 THE SHORT BUS: A Journey Beyond Normal. By Jonathan Mooney. (Holt, $25.) After being classified as learning-disabled in third grade, Mooney rode the ''short bus'' with other special-ed students, a stigma so mortifying he later contemplated suicide. But he persevered, graduating from Brown University and writing a book with David Cole called ''Learning Outside the Lines.'' In his latest book, Mooney travels coast to coast in a dilapidated short bus to interview people ''who had once been labeled 'abnormal' or 'disabled.' '' These portraits are endearing. He meets an eccentric, possibly autistic man who has befriended a group of mathematicians; a blind and deaf girl who curses in sign language; and a former fisherman who is considering gender reassignment. Mooney makes some discordant attempts at philosophizing in this chatty narrative (his epigraph is from Foucault: ''The judges of normality are present everywhere''). And although he thinks the ''medical model'' of treating developmental disabilities is dehumanizing, he is vague about the ''community care'' approach he favors. Mooney, who suggests that reading remediation is a waste of time in some cases, suffered as a child not just because he was ostracized but also because he simply wanted to read and couldn't. It's not necessarily more compassionate to tolerate disabilities than to try to correct them. But it feels like bullying to pick on this book's limitations. Mooney's target audience is not policy makers but his fellow misfits, and his boundless empathy will surely console those who also face the worst that cruel schoolchildren and the educational bureaucracy have to offer.
 REVENGE OF THE DONUT BOYS: True Stories of Lust, Fame, Survival and Multiple Personality. By Mike Sager. (Thunder's Mouth, paper, $16.95.) Like his journalistic precursors Tom Wolfe and Hunter S. Thompson, Sager writes frenetic, off-kilter pop-sociological profiles of Americans in all their vulgarity and vitality. But compared with the new journalists, who celebrated the subjectivity of the narrator, Sager is a relatively self-effacing observer. He writes with flair, but only in the service of an omnivorous curiosity. In the articles collected here -- published between 1985 and 2006, mostly in Esquire magazine, where Sager is a writer at large -- the famous, almost famous and not famous all get the same Sager treatment. He is teasingly affectionate (Tom Araya of the heavy-metal band Slayer speaks like ''a mixture of Valley doper, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and mambo king'') and meticulous (he's the kind of reporter who notes his subject's shoe size). He defies expectations in pieces that lesser writers would play for satire or sensationalism: Newark teenagers who steal cars for fun, a group of professional beach volleyball players who go on strike, a Frederick's of Hollywood model who wants to lock in a husband while she's still young. Sager's celebrity interviews -- Roseanne Barr describing her multiple personality disorder, Ice Cube pondering race and fame -- are sympathetic but not fawning. The book's closing selection, in which Sager talks to other people named Mike Sager (a police captain, a meteorologist, a politician), is not, as it might seem, narcissistic. His conclusion ought to be read instead as a Whitmanesque ode to teeming humanity's mystical unity: ''Call us all Mike Sager.''

HEADLINE: Mileage Ratings Are Still Estimates, Though Closer to Reality

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
SOME Americans are skeptical of almost anything the government says. But even the most cynical citizens find it hard to dispute a much-repeated statement from one federal agency: Your actual mileage may vary. 
 The disconnect between the Environmental Protection Agency's fuel-economy numbers on new-vehicle window stickers, where that cautionary note is printed, and the mileage that owners actually record is well known. In part, the disparity is a result of federal testing standards that no longer represent traffic conditions in the United States. 
 But starting with the 2008 models, shoppers can have more faith in the window stickers that they study in dealership showrooms; for the first time since 1984, the E.P.A. is revising its method for calculating fuel economy to better reflect realities of the road.
 Comparing vehicles that are unchanged from their 2007 specification, consumers will see lower miles-per-gallon estimates on the 2008 versions. The E.P.A. says city mileage estimates for most vehicles will drop about 12 percent, on average, and highway estimates about 8 percent, for 2008 models that are mechanically unchanged from their 2007 counterparts. Mileage estimates for hybrid vehicles will drop as much as 30 percent. 
 Cheer up -- this doesn't mean that a 100-mile trip will cost more, only that the agency is admitting that the estimates have been optimistic.
 ''The old labels were broken,'' said David Friedman, research director for the vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group. 
 ''The driving cycles just don't represent the way people actually drive,'' he said, referring to the speeds and road conditions simulated in the test. ''The hardest acceleration in the driving cycles they were using was the equivalent of going from zero to 60 in 18 seconds. 
 ''What the E.P.A. is doing is definitely a step in the right direction,'' Mr. Friedman said.
 The agency adopted the new calculations last December, but automakers were given until Sept. 1 of this year to comply. Because 2007 models with the old window stickers and mileage ratings will be sold for a while alongside 2008 models with the new stickers and ratings, some confusion is inevitable. 
 The gap between government estimates and actual mileage is no small matter for consumers, especially when gas prices are high. The AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association, released a 2006 study in which 36 out of 41 vehicles it looked at fell short of the E.P.A. estimate by an average of 4 miles a gallon, or almost 16 percent. 
 David Champion, the auto testing director for Consumer Reports, said that when the E.P.A. figures don't match up to real-world driving, the owners may be spending hundreds of dollars more in operating costs each year than they were led to believe. 
 In its October 2005 issue, Consumer Reports published an analysis that showed fuel economy could be half as much as the fuel economy rating, based on comparing the E.P.A. ratings with the mileage that Consumers Reports testers measured for 303 cars and trucks over the 2000 to 2006 model years.
 ''We think that the new mileage is much closer to reality, much closer to our numbers than in the past,'' Mr. Champion said. 
 When the E.P.A. revised rating methods in 1984, it lowered the city fuel economy figure by 10 percent and the highway fuel economy by 22 percent. In addition to other changes, the E.P.A. has adjusted the city and highway tests downward again.
 Mr. Friedman of the scientists' group describes the new formula the E.P.A is using as ''smarter markdowns.'' The 2008 numbers, which take into account results from three tests already used in certifying emissions compliance, involve higher speeds, air-conditioning use and colder outdoor temperatures. 
 While the current highway test has a top speed of 60 m.p.h. and an average speed of only 48, the emissions driving cycle calls for a maximum speed of 80 m.p.h., an average of 62 -- and more aggressive acceleration. As in the past, automakers test their own cars and provide the data to the environmental agency, though the E.P.A. conducts spot checks at its laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 There are also differences between what the E.P.A. is doing this year with 2008 models and what automakers will be required to do for 2011 models. At that time, the companies will be required to run vehicles through the three additional emissions tests (in addition to the current city and highway driving cycles) and use the data from specific vehicles to calculate fuel economy. Both the old and new regulations include provisions for averaging results in cases where one engine may be shared among several vehicles.
 For 2008 models, what consumers will see on window stickers -- which are being redesigned to feature fuel-cost information more prominently -- is a far bigger mileage drop for high-mileage vehicles than for S.U.V.'s.
 The biggest hits in terms of miles per gallon are going to be taken by hybrids. But many hybrid owners already know that it is hard to match the window sticker in normal driving.
 In the past, Toyota Prius owners have used online forums to both boast and complain about their mileage. Some have said their mileage was closer to 30 m.p.g. and asked what they were doing wrong, while drivers who claimed to get 50 m.p.g. were offering tips to attain the higher mileage.
 When people see new fuel-economy figures for hybrids that are lower than those published in the past, will they switch to gasoline-only versions of models that are available both ways?
 ''That's the problem we face,'' said John German, manager of environmental and energy analysis for Honda. Mr. German spent 13 years at the E.P.A., where he worked on developing the emission testing cycles that are being used as part of the new formula.
 But, Mr. German says, drivers should compare the Civic Hybrid with a conventional Civic and look at the gallons saved. ''It's not really going to change under the new system,'' he said. ''You are still going to save the same amount of dollars with the new ratings as you did under the old ratings.''
 Toyota says that once the dust settles on the label change, consumers will again see that the Prius is the most fuel-efficient vehicle in its class.
 Despite the redesigned window stickers, some information will not show up there, like the mileage of a flexible-fuel vehicle running on E85. The only mileage figures potential buyers will see is the fuel economy when the vehicle is running on gasoline. Because ethanol contains less energy per gallon than gasoline, an engine must burn more ethanol to go the same distance.
 More changes are coming in 2010 that will apply to 2011 models. For the first time, vehicles with a gross weight rating (vehicle weight plus the maximum cargo capacity) of 8,500 to 10,000 pounds, which includes large S.U.V.'s like the Hummer H2, will have to post mileage figures on the window sticker. 
 But in some ways the closer-to-reality mileage figures will be little more than window dressing. The corporate average fuel economy that automakers must attain will still be based on the old mileage numbers. Under the law, each automaker must maintain minimum fleet averages for its cars and trucks to avoid financial penalties. Likewise, the revised figures will not be used to determine whether a vehicle is subject to a gas-guzzler tax penalty; that assessment will also continue to be based on the old test regime.
 In effect, while the government is admitting that the old method used to estimate fuel economy was unrealistic, it isn't forcing automakers to take action on the shortfall in mileage promises. 
 ''At the end of the day this helps remind everyone how bad our fuel economy is,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Part of what people need to see is that we are in a lot more trouble than we thought.''

The effect of the rules change, which is intended to present more realistic mileage numbers, can be seen in this sampling of vehicles that are mechanically unchanged from 2007 to 2008. Chart shows bar graph of various cars on the market.

HEADLINE: Navigating a Path Through a Turbulent Housing Market

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
IF you're considering wading into the housing market as a buyer, seller or borrower, be prepared for choppy water and even an occasional rogue wave. Summer may be just about over, but hurricane season, at least in housing, continues. 
 Home prices are falling. Some lenders are going out of business. Others are phasing out certain loans, including so-called subprime and no-documentation mortgages, making financing tougher to get. And over the last six months, mortgage rates have risen, especially on the big loans that are popular in costly cities like New York and San Francisco. 
 On top of that, the Mortgage Bankers Association announced earlier this month that, in the second quarter of this year, a rising number of borrowers had fallen so far behind in their payments that they were entering foreclosure. The number of people entering foreclosure has been rising since the first quarter of last year, according to the association. 
 All the upheaval has turned lenders cautious, said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate, finance and economics at Columbia University. ''We're really seeing a real pullback in credit,'' he said. ''If that doesn't reverse itself in the coming weeks and months, we're going to see a sharp decline in the housing market.'' 
 With prices falling, home sellers might have to accept lower prices than they had hoped for, Professor Mayer said. People who had planned to refinance might find themselves with fewer options for a new loan or, in the worst case, none at all, he said. Buyers might find it tougher to qualify for a mortgage. Even people with good credit might find that lenders are demanding more documentation or eyeing their home appraisal more carefully. 
 Until earlier this year, the economy was awash in mortgage money. Home prices had waxed, interest rates had waned and lenders were offering up loans with a beguiling variety of terms and options, making it easier for people to qualify.
 ''Banks were practically giving out loans at the drive-up window,'' said Paul S. Havemann, a vice president at HSH Associates, a Pompton Plains, N.J., company that tracks mortgage rates, terms and trends. Even people with bad or limited credit histories -- so-called subprime borrowers -- were finding banks eager to compete for their business. 
 If you've followed the tumult on Wall Street in recent weeks, you know that the woes of subprime borrowers have rippled through the economy, buffeting banks and hedge funds. A few big lenders, like Countrywide Financial, have landed in financial trouble, and banks like Washington Mutual have laid off staff.
 At the same time, real estate prices have faltered. At the end of June, the latest period for which data is available, 15 of the 20 major metropolitan housing markets tracked by the S&P/Case-Shiller Housing indices were seeing declining prices, compared with a year earlier. 
 Climbing mortgage rates could continue to push down housing prices. Within the last couple of weeks, yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which tend to be a barometer for longer-term mortgage rates, have been falling, said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president with HSH Associates. 
 ''The downward draft in Treasuries is exerting downward pressure on mortgage rates, but not as much as normal,'' he said. That's because investors remain uneasy about the mortgage market, he said. 
 Still, despite the upheaval, much of the mortgage market has been relatively stable, Mr. Gumbinger said. About half of the mortgages made in the United States are owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and other government-chartered guarantors. These companies buy loans from lenders, securitize them and sell the securities to investors. Guaranteed loans must hew to strict underwriting standards and so far have shown no problems, he said. 
 Many home buyers shouldn't have trouble getting mortgages, though they will pay higher rates than they would have done a few months ago, he said. As of Friday, the average nationwide rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage conforming to Fannie Mae standards was 6.37 percent, up from 6.16 percent in March, Mr. Gumbinger said. 
 Rates for 30-year jumbo mortgages -- that is, loans too big to be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and the other guarantors -- had gone higher, reaching 7.26 percent on average, up from 6.36 percent in March, he said. 
 Rising rates hurt anyone who needs a mortgage -- all else being equal, they mean that you must buy a cheaper house -- but they could be especially painful for people who signed up for an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) over the last several years and are now hoping to refinance. 
 IF, for example, you took a so-called 3/1 adjustable-rate mortgage in 2004, when their benchmark interest rates dropped to 40-year lows, your monthly payment may soon jump, if it hasn't already, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. A 3/1 ARM offers an interest rate that is fixed for the first three years and then adjusts annually. 
 ''Somebody who got in at 4.5 percent in 2004 could now be looking at 7.25 or 7.5 percent,'' Mr. McBride said. On a $200,000 loan, that equates to a difference of about $400 a month. If mortgage rates continue to increase, payments could swell next year, too. 
 What are your options if you're worried about rising rates? 
 Risk-tolerant home buyers still might consider an ARM. The initial rates on these loans are often, but not always, lower than those for fixed-rate ones. On Friday the national average rate on a one-year ARM was 6.35 percent, according to HSH Associates, about the same as the rate for a 30-year conforming mortgage. Lenders also offer ARM's with initial fixed-rate periods of one, five, seven and even 10 years. 
 Be aware that borrowing via an ARM means, in essence, betting either that interest rates will be steady or fall once your loan begins to adjust, or that you'll be able to refinance. 
 That risk makes sense for people who are sure they will move before the adjustments begin. ''If you don't need that 30-year protection, there's no point in paying for it,'' said David C. Schneider, president of the home loans group at Washington Mutual in Seattle. ''And you need to understand that you do pay for it.'' Over the life of a loan, a higher interest rate can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in additional payments. 
 As is typically the case in financial matters, it pays to shop around when seeking a mortgage. At the moment, 30-year fixed-rate loans are a better deal than many shorter-term ARM's, Mr. Gumbinger said. The Federal Reserve, in a pamphlet on adjustable-rate loans, cautions that consumers should ''keep in mind that brokers are not required to find the best deal for you unless they have contracted with you to act as your agent.'' 
 Allen Fishbein, director of housing and credit policy at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, said, ''Borrowers assume that brokers and lenders won't make them a loan that they can't repay. What we found with the subprime meltdown is that that's not the case.''
 Some people may find that they can't refinance, perhaps because they've landed in financial trouble or because the value of their home has fallen. 
 Falling prices can put ARM borrowers in a vise: Not only do they face higher interest rates, but their home's value may not cover the amount of the original loan. To refinance, they typically have to make up the difference. If they can't, she may be stuck. ''Brokers will tell you that you can always refi out of a loan, but you can't always,'' said Rick Harper, vice president and director of housing for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco. ''There's usually somebody willing to make you a deal, but it might not be a better loan.''
 A better option might be to call the company that services your loan and see if it is willing to reduce your payments temporarily, extend the term of your loan or, if it comes to that, even help you sell your house, he said. 
 People often mistakenly assume that lenders are eager to claim the homes of borrowers who fall behind on their payments, said Mr. Schneider of Washington Mutual. In fact, lenders typically lose money on foreclosures because of administrative and legal costs and the loss that they often take on the sale of the house. 
 ''From our perspective, there's nothing good about us taking a home,'' he added. ''It's the worst possible outcome for everybody.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS Americans born in 2005 can expect to live 78 years, the National Center for Health Statistics reported.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Life expectancy has been rising steadily, up from 75.8 years in 1995 and 69.6 years in 1955. One reason: deaths from heart disease, cancer and stroke, the nation's top killers, continue to decline. Whites can expect to live five years longer than blacks; women, five years longer than men. ''We should continue to see improvements'' as leading causes of death decline, said one expert. 
 THE NEWS You may be living longer, but more of you are also working longer, the Census Bureau found in its annual American Community Survey.
 BEHIND THE NEWS By choice or out of necessity, the number of people 65 to 74 who were working or looking for work rose to one in four in 2006 from one in five in 2000. ''People are living longer and they need more resources,'' said Yung-Ping Chen, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. South Dakota had the highest percentage; West Virginia, the lowest.
 THE NEWS Three out of four workers drove to their jobs by themselves in 2006, according to another finding by the Census Bureau. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Only about 11 percent shared a ride and just 5 percent took public transportation. Commutes averaged 25 minutes, though New Yorkers spent an average of 31 minutes getting to work while folks in North Dakota made it in 15 minutes. Despite computers, fax machines, personal digital assistants and good old cellphones, just 4 percent worked at home.
 THE NEWS Millions of Americans strained to pay their rent or mortgage last year, despite signs of a slowdown in the housing market.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Half of the nation's renters and about a third of mortgage holders spent at least 30 percent of their gross income on housing, the Census Bureau found, an increase of about 1.5 million households compared with 2005. The data suggests that incomes did not keep up with rising housing prices as lenders let home buyers borrow more relative to their earnings. 
 THE NEWS Hablas espanol? One in five people over age 5 spoke a language other than English at home last year, with Spanish being the most common.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The number is up slightly from what the Census Bureau found in 2000. In some states, the numbers were dramatic. Forty-three percent of California residents spoke another language at home; in Los Angeles, the number was 53 percent. 
 The next five, after California: New Mexico, Texas, New York, Arizona and New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Bless This Mess

BYLINE: By AMANDA HESSER

 BODY:
At dinner recently at Mercat, a new Catalan restaurant in the East Village, my friends and I ordered the salt cod fritters. Like tripe and quenelles, salt cod fritters exist in a culinary sphere reserved for restaurant kitchens. Who at home is going to soak salt cod for a day, mash it up with some other ingredients and deep-fry it -- coating the kitchen with a mist of oil -- for what is essentially a bar snack? Jeffrey Steingarten or Deb at SmittenKitchen.com might bother, but that's their problem.
 The rest of us might opt for soaking salt cod or deep-frying, but not both together. I am here to argue for doing more of the latter. All over the world, people eat fritters. Shrimp fritters, zucchini fritters, banana fritters, corn fritters. When Americans travel, we eat fritters. But then, for reasons I cannot understand, we don't make them back home. 
 It couldn't be that we're still afraid of fried foods: it's well known that if food is fried at a high enough temperature and then properly drained, it can contain no more cooking fat than something that's sauteed (people forget that with sauteed food, you eat the fat). And it couldn't be that the mess argument has won. Kitchens are nothing more than workshops. Have you ever heard a woodworker say he doesn't like to sand because of the dust? (Frying makes a mess, it's true. But many fritters can be fried in advance and either eaten cool, as is the custom of tapas bars in Spain, or reheated in a 200-degree oven, so there's plenty of time to clean up and shower.)
 Perhaps it's because we're a grilling nation, proud of the game of fire and smoke. But I counter this argument with the fact that we're also a snacking nation. And fritters are all about snacking.
 The old idea behind fritters was to stretch an ingredient like zucchini, corn or clams. You either make a batter -- usually with a little egg and baking powder in it for leavening -- and mix in bits of the ingredient you're stretching, or you dip those ingredients into the batter just before frying. I grew up eating what my grandmother called ''critter fritters,'' made the former way with crab and seasoned with Worcestershire sauce, garlic and beer. Critter fritters made the most of leftover bits of crab, with the added benefit of being delicious.
 Today it should be the pleasure of fritters -- crisp, luscious poofs -- rather than their economy that keeps us making them. A few tips to get you on your way: chilling the batter before frying helps hold the batter together as it drops into the oil and makes the fritter cook more evenly. Lots of recipes have you pour three inches of cooking fat into a large deep fryer, which is nothing but a big waste. Use a narrow saucepan and less than two inches of cooking fat. Sure, a few will stick to the bottom, and sure, you'll have to do them in batches, but you'll get over it. And off you'll go, serving fritters.
 Critter Fritters
 1 cup flour
 1 teaspoon kosher salt
 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
 1 egg, lightly beaten
 2 tablespoons milk
 1/4 cup beer
 2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
 1 clove garlic, minced
 2 teaspoons finely chopped parsley
 8 ounces fresh lump crab meat
 Canola oil or shortening, for frying
 Lemon wedges, for serving.
 1. In a bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking powder. Make a well in the center and add the egg, milk, beer, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Gradually blend the liquid into the flour mixture. Mix the batter just until it is no longer lumpy. Fold in the garlic, parsley and crab meat. Chill for 30 minutes.
 2. In a heavy saucepan, heat 1 to 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat; it's hot enough when it quickly browns a small drop of batter. Drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the oil and fry, turning once, until puffed and golden on both sides, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Makes 20 fritters. Adapted from the author's grandmother, Helen Getz.
 Basque Chorizo and Cornmeal Fritters
 * cup cornmeal
 1/4 cup flour
 1 tablespoon chopped parsley
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 * cup sparkling water
 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
 Canola oil, for frying
 8 ounces chorizo, cut into 1/8 -inch slices or cubes.
 1. In a bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, parsley, salt, sparkling water and olive oil. Mix until smooth. Heat 1 inch of oil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat; it's ready when it quickly browns a small drop of batter.
 2. Dip each piece of chorizo in the batter and lower into the hot oil. Fry until golden on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. May be served warm or at room temperature. Serves 6 as an appetizer. Adapted from ''La Cocina de Mama'' by Penelope Casas.
 Shrimp Fritters Wrapped in Lettuce and Herbs 
 Chopped raw shrimp are sticky, so no batter is needed -- a little rice flour holds the fritter together.
 10 ounces small shrimp, peeled and chopped
 1/4 cup thinly sliced scallion
 2 teaspoons minced ginger
 1 dried red chili, ground with a mortar and pestle
 1 tablespoon fish sauce
 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 1/2 teaspoon sugar
 2 teaspoons rice flour
 Canola oil, for frying
 12 cilantro sprigs
 24 mint leaves
 12 bibb lettuce leaves 
 2 limes, quartered.
 1. In a bowl, combine the shrimp, scallion, ginger, chili, fish sauce, sesame oil, salt, sugar and rice flour.
 2. In a heavy saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, drop the shrimp in flattened golf-ball-size patties into the oil. Fry until golden on all sides, turning once, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels. To serve, place a fritter, a cilantro sprig and two mint leaves on a lettuce leaf, sprinkle with lime juice, roll up and eat immediately. Makes about 12 fritters.
 Plum Fritters
 1 cup flour
 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
 3 eggs, separated
 2 1/2 tablespoons plum brandy (or other eau de vie)
 1 teaspoon cinnamon
 Canola oil or shortening, for frying
 6 small ripe plums, pitted and halved.
 1. In a bowl, mix together the flour, salt and 1 tablespoon sugar. Make a well in the center and add 3 egg yolks and 1/2 cup ice water. Gradually blend the liquid into the flour mixture until almost smooth. Stir in the plum brandy. Chill for 30 minutes.
 2. Meanwhile, in a wide, shallow bowl, combine the cinnamon with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Whip the egg whites to soft peaks. 
 3. Fold the whipped egg whites into the batter. In a heavy saucepan, heat 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat; it's hot enough when it quickly browns a small drop of batter. Coat the plum halves in the batter, then fry in the oil until puffed and golden, turning once. Use a splatter guard to prevent the juices from splattering. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fritters to the bowl of cinnamon sugar. Roll them in the sugar, then set on a plate lined with paper towels. Eat warm or at room temperature. Makes 12 fritters.

Are Montclair's Children Being Left Behind?
 Educated citizens are the components of every successful nation.
 Most citizens recognize that the United States must improve the quality of its public education. Our national aptitude in mathematics, engineering and science has waned. The grammar and spelling skills of many young and middle-aged people must improve. Without adequate education, millions of American kids confront low-paying jobs and social miseries. 
 Recognizing our nation's diminishing quality of education, the federal government under President George W. Bush established the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Leading liberals and conservatives in Congress initially supported the act.
 The act's long-term goal is to have every public-school student pass standardized tests by 2014.
 Accountability is emphasized. In some New Jersey municipalities, there have been shocking lapses in student advancement. School systems in some New Jersey cities were so corrupt and ineffective that the state Department of Education seized control of their administrative offices.
 The intent of the act is to hold governmental employees and school districts responsible for delivering qualified, effective education for young citizens.
 A key shortcoming is insufficient funding for its mandates. While Congress has significantly increased federal funding for education (via federal indebtedness), the total still falls far short of the needed amount. The law places much of its financial onus on states and individual school districts.
 The Montclair School District is not deprived of funds. With a budget of $103 million, Montclair faculty members receive decent wages and guaranteed salary increases, regardless of the private sector's economic plight. The Montclair School District provides benefits, pensions, holidays and vacation amounts that are unrivaled by businesses.
 No Child Left Behind shackles Montclair and other school districts with additional costly mandates. Already burdened with a huge tax to support their public schools, taxpayers must give more of their earnings to pay for expenditures dictated by the act.
 Last week, five of the Montclair School District's 10 eligible schools did not meet No Child Left Behind mandates -- even though the vast majority of students in each school have achieved the criteria.
 Good teachers and administrators can only achieve so much. The studiousness of most students also requires the responsibility of their family members, religious and community leaders and the students themselves.
 There has been a concern, including here in Montclair, that some teachers ''teach to the test,'' rather than imparting in-depth knowledge on core subjects to their students.
 Plenty of other concerns exist about No Child Left Behind.
 There are congressional considerations about eliminating or drastically altering the act, which is slated to be reauthorized in 2008. Accountability, however, must be sustained.
 In the United States, a quality education is essential for national strength and individual success.
 The Montclair Times, Aug. 22

HEADLINE: A Quick Brunello On the Way to Rome

BYLINE: By LOUISE KRAMER

 BODY:
Getting stuck waiting for a plane is nobody's idea of fun. But Doug Tomlinson, a former management consultant with Deloitte in San Francisco, is doing his best to improve the experience with Vino Volo, a growing chain of airport wine bars.
 The fifth Vino Volo (''wine flight'' in Italian) will open at Kennedy Airport on Sept. 26. The sleek spots offer a respite for oenophiles, with wines by the glass or bottle, small plates of cheese and cured meats, leather chairs and outlets for laptops. 
 After talking himself out of dozens of business ideas over the years, Mr. Tomlinson said he had a light bulb moment in 2003 in a Midwest airport when he longed for a decent glass of wine to celebrate a deal with some colleagues, but had to settle for beer. ''I am a pretty risk-averse guy most of the time,'' he said. ''The unique thing about this is that I wasn't able to talk myself out of it.''
 He took a leave from Deloitte to create Vino Volo and never went back. He got advice and backing from some big names in food and wine, like W. Reed Foster, co-founder of Ravenswood Winery, Paul Clayton, chief executive of Jamba Juice, and John Scharffenberger, the chocolate maker.

 TIME TO PAY UP? The S.E.C. has announced that Orlando Joseph Jett, once a bond-trading star, lost his appeal of an agency order that he disgorge $8.2 million in bonuses rewarded in connection with a fraudulent trading scheme and that he pay a $200,000 civil penalty.
 A federal district judge in Manhattan recently upheld a March 2004 order by the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that Mr. Jett, a former Kidder, Peabody government bond trader, had booked fake profits of approximately $264 million and had to pay restitution. 
 Federal securities regulators found that while Mr. Jett worked as a trader, managing director and senior vice president of the now-defunct Kidder, he used a loophole in its automated trading records system to book enormous profits, when his trading activities actually lost $75 million. Kidder fired Mr. Jett in 1994 after the scandal came to light. 
 The commission initially sued Mr. Jett more than a decade ago. After losing several rounds in court, he refused to surrender the money. Then, he said he had been denied due process because he never received a copy of a 2004 S.E.C. order. He tried to have the commission's order reviewed by a federal appeals court. But the Sept. 7 ruling in Federal District Court held that Mr. Jett had not filed his appeal within acceptable time limits and that he had to pay.
 Mr. Jett, who works as a money manager at Jett Capital Management, based in Princeton, N.J., did not return a telephone call for comment. ELIZABETH OLSON
 WHAT'S THAT WORD? Robert L. Nardelli had a reputation for unusual pronunciations and word usage when he was chief executive of Home Depot. Now that he is at Chrysler, he is showing every sign of continuing the tradition.
 During a recent speech to the Automotive Press Association, Mr. Nardelli drew smiles when he called Detroit's famed Woodward Avenue ''Wood-ard.'' 
 He stumbled again when he tried to use industry jargon. Speaking of annual sales, he said, ''We're looking at an industry that started the year at about 17 million, right? 16.9, 16.8, 16.6 -- look at the last SAP and it's about 16.2.'' 
 He meant ''SAAR,'' for seasonally adjusted annual rate, the way auto makers project monthly sales over a year's time.
 That's O.K. We couldn't name half the stuff in Aisle 13. MICHELINE MAYNARD
 GREENSPAN'S DEFENSE When the economy starts to flounder, people start pointing fingers -- and right now they are pointing at Alan Greenspan, former Fed chairman. 
 Mr. Greenspan, far more accustomed to encomiums, isn't just rolling over. Taking on critics in an interview tonight on CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' he defends his decisions to handle an earlier economic downturn by lowering interest rates between 2001 and 2004. 
 In excerpts released by CBS, Mr. Greenspan calls his critics ''mistaken.'' The Fed's job was ''to unfreeze the American banking system if we wanted the economy to function,'' he said. ''This required that we keep rates modestly low.''
 Sustained low interest rates fed speculative borrowing, some economists say. That, they say, led to questionable mortgage lending that is reverberating in markets now.
 Mr. Greenspan, who stepped down from the Fed in January 2006, candidly admitted that he did not foresee the impact of subprime lending practices, telling Lesley Stahl on CBS that ''I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.''
 Mr. Greenspan will have plenty of opportunity to defend his record. His interview was only one of a series he is giving to publicize his memoir, ''The Age of Turbulence,'' which is to be released tomorrow.

HEADLINE: An Early Apartment House By the Master of Tuxedo Park

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
QAt 21 East 21st Street, the initials C. M. are over the entrance. I have always wondered whose initials they were. ... Mike Grant, Brooklyn
 A More likely the monogram should be read as M. C., the initials for both Marie and Miers Coryell, the couple who built this unusual apartment house in 1878. 
 It was designed by Bruce Price, who gained fame in the 1880s for the enclave at Tuxedo Park, N.Y. The Coryells gave him one of his first jobs, and he produced this little Queen Anne gem of brick and carved stone, with two picturesque dormers on the sixth floor. 
 It is rare to see an owner's monogram on a building, and rarer still to have the names of the builder -- David H. King Jr. -- plus that of the architect himself, on either side of the date stone, as they are here.
 Little is known about Marie Coryell, but in 1892, The New York Times called Miers Coryell one of the best known experts on marine engines in the country. How the Coryells came to hire Mr. Price, who was then new to New York and just beginning his career, is a mystery, and their decision to build an income-producing property in the form of an upper-middle-class apartment house is very unusual. Such buildings were still rare in New York; the Dakota, for instance, was not even begun until 1880.
 Mr. Price designed a picturesque if ungainly facade, rich in carved detail and peculiar ornamentation. His awkward floor plan shows how new a discipline apartment design was back then. 
 There was one apartment per floor. Mr. Price put the parlor and one bedroom in front, then strung out the dining room, the three main bedrooms and a servant's bedroom back toward the rear of the lot, each facing a mean little courtyard. At the end was the kitchen, and all were connected by a bowling alley of a corridor, perhaps 75 feet long. 
 This was a walk-up, with two circular staircases, a small one in the rear and a larger one in the front. The Coryells lived in the building, as did a doctor and a lawyer.
 Some idea of the building's economic circumstances may be gleaned from a help-wanted ad that someone there placed in The Times in 1881 for ''an excellent cook, who will also wash bed and table linen.''
 In 1890, an ad offered the first-floor apartment for $1,400 a year. The rent also included a storage area and extra servant's room on the sixth floor. 
 Mr. Price was a designer of sparkling ability, and as his career progressed, he was frequently called on for upper-class residences -- at Tuxedo Park, at Bar Harbor, Me., and in similar locales. By the turn of the last century he was getting bigger commissions, and when he died in 1903, at 57, his plans had been accepted for a palace in Tokyo for the crown prince of Japan. 
 But his daughter, Emily, eclipsed his reputation. Under her married name, Emily Post, she wrote ''Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home,'' published in 1922, and it became the last word in manners. 
 Whatever social standing 21 East 21st originally had was long gone by 1953, when its certificate of occupancy showed that it had been turned into a single-room-occupancy hotel. A gut renovation took place about 30 years ago, apparently in 1977.

HEADLINE: Why Haven't Investors Played It Safe With Blue Chips?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HAVE blue-chip stocks suffered another setback?
 Last year, professional money managers were finally warming up to large-capitalization stocks, after favoring their smaller and sexier small-cap cousins throughout much of this decade. This spring, large-cap stocks started to look even more attractive, thanks to the booming global economy and the falling dollar, which benefit the large caps because big companies tend to do a greater share of their business overseas.
 Then came what was supposed to be the clincher. In July, as market volatility spiked, the consensus view on Wall Street was that investors would finally flock back to large-cap stocks because of the stability and safety that big, industry-leading companies can provide. 
 Well, July came around, and while the smart money said investors would bite, many of them didn't. In fact, nearly $3.1 billion in net new money was pulled from large-cap stock funds in July, according to Citigroup Investment Research and Strategic Insight. In fact, more money was yanked from large-cap stock funds than was pulled from small-cap funds, which had net redemptions of $1.1 billion that month. 
 To be sure, this is only one month's worth of data. And Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief United States equity strategist, points out that large-cap stock funds sit on a bigger mountain of assets to begin with -- so larger outflows aren't necessarily troubling. 
 Still, why did investors flee from -- rather than run to -- the relative safety of blue-chip stocks? 
 One possible explanation is that the recent market sell-off was set off by growing troubles in the mortgage market. And credit troubles clearly affect the financial services sector, which happens to be the biggest sector in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of blue-chip stocks, representing 20 percent of the benchmark.
 ''To the extent that there are a lot of financials in the large-cap space, and that those financial companies have credit exposure, I think this would retard the development of the case for large-caps,'' said John S. Osterweis, president and chief investment officer for Osterweis Capital Management in San Francisco. 
 Of course, it's not clear cut. 
 For starters, while the financial sector makes up one-fifth of the S.& P. 500, small-cap stocks aren't devoid of exposure to banks and brokers. In fact, 15 percent of the Standard & Poor's 600 index of small stocks is made up of financial services firms.
 And among mutual funds, the gap is even narrower. While the average large-cap value stock fund invests 26.3 percent of its assets in financial companies, small-cap value funds have nearly as much exposure: 22.2 percent, according to Morningstar.
 Also, keep in mind that while many large investment banks like Bear Stearns have garnered big headlines recently because of their exposure to mortgage-backed securities, many of the stocks that were hit hardest recently were small-cap subprime lenders and savings institutions, said Wendell L. Perkins, chief investment officer for Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wis.
 This may explain why, even with their slightly greater weighting to financial stocks, large-cap stocks fell less than the small-caps when the market began to sink. ''In July, you were much better off in the large caps,'' said Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research for the fund tracker Morningstar. 
 The mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index, which tracks the 50 largest domestic stocks, lost only 2 percent of its value in July. By comparison, the Russell 1000 blue-chip index, which includes 950 less gigantic stocks, fell 3.1 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks tumbled 6.8 percent. And the Russell Microcap index, made up of the market's tiniest companies, did the worst as it shed 7 percent of its value.
 Mr. Perkins, who also co-manages the JohnsonFamily Small Cap Value and JohnsonFamily Large Cap Value funds, said blue-chip stocks should continue to hold up well as investors turn their attention away from the immediate financial troubles in the mortgage market to what those financial troubles could mean for the broader economy. Once that happens, it will put even more pressure on the equity markets, which in turn should drive more interest into the large-cap stocks, he said.
 Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash., agrees: ''There's a reasonably strong case for large caps for the remainder of the year and going into 2008.''
 Market strategists point to several factors that should work to the advantage of the blue chips. 
 For starters, many economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, either at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week or sometime later this year. If the Fed trims rates, Mr. Ankrim said that would put even more downward pressure on the dollar. And that, in turn, ''would almost certainly be good for firms with global reach,'' he said. This means the blue chips.
 Furthermore, Mr. Levkovich at Citigroup points out that historically, large-cap stocks tend to outperform during periods of slowing earnings growth and increasing market volatility. 
 EARNINGS for companies in the S.& P. 500 are expected to expand just 4.5 percent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial. That's down from 7.9 percent in the first quarter and 10.6 percent late last year. As for volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, is now consistently trading above a reading of 20 now, after being in the teens in recent years.
 While these signs are bullish for blue chips, investors must still be judicious when hunting in the large-cap space, said Steven Romick, manager of the FPA Crescent Fund, which invests in stocks of all sizes.
 Mr. Romick noted that while large-cap stocks are cheaper than their small-cap counterparts, ''they're not ridiculously cheaper.'' He added that the recent troubles in the financial services sector show that ''one still has to be quite selective'' even when dealing with the bluest blue-chip stocks.

HEADLINE: All Aboard

BYLINE: By Lawrence H. Silverman. 
Lawrence H. Silverman, a lawyer who was the chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council, was a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from 1996 to 2001.

 BODY:
Huntington
 EVEN with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's recent announcement of possible fare increases, there are hopeful signs for those of us who ride the Long Island Rail Road, which is operated by the authority. 
 For starters, Helena Williams became the new president of the railroad in June. The former deputy county executive in Nassau and president of Long Island Bus from 1993 to 1998, Ms. Williams knows Long Island and its transportation needs. And unlike most of her predecessors, Ms. Williams never worked for a railroad, much less the nation's largest, busiest and most complex commuter railroad -- she's an outsider with no ties to bind her to past practices. She is also a former labor counsel to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, experience that will be critical to her ability to work with the railroad's powerful unions. 
 At her first board meeting of the authority this summer, Ms. Williams made it clear that she would not waste time getting to the bottom of the problems that plague the railroad and announced that she was hiring a consultant, Donald Nelson, a former president of Metro-North Railroad. Mr. Nelson is credited with much of Metro-North's success and its high marks in customer satisfaction. Ms. Williams asked him to conduct a ''state of the system'' analysis of the railroad and come up with a ''blueprint of what are the next steps.'' His report is scheduled to be released next month. 
 It's a pretty good guess that the arrival of Ms. Williams and Mr. Nelson was not celebrated by many Long Island Rail Road employees -- certainly not by the managers who recently acknowledged that they knew for years that dangerous gaps between trains and platforms could be reduced but did nothing about them until a passenger was killed last year at Woodside Station in Queens. 
 Of course, all of this raises the question: Can Mr. Nelson do for Long Island what he did for Metro-North? Probably not. After all, Metro-North passengers enjoy direct service, whereas many of us have to switch at Jamaica Station, where trains must arrive, exchange passengers and depart within a two-minute window. As a result, small delays quickly multiply into big ones. Nor does Metro-North have to compete with other railroads for access to Grand Central Terminal; the Long Island Rail Road shares Pennsylvania Station with New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. 
 Another important difference between the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North is on the labor front. The relationship between labor and management on the L.I.R.R. is one of the least discussed and yet one of the most important factors affecting its efficiency and the quality of service. In order to achieve anything resembling meaningful and lasting change on the railroad, Ms. Williams and Mr. Nelson must earn the confidence and then the cooperation of managers and the work force. It will not be easy. 
 Many employees' families have worked on the railroad for generations. To them the Long Island Rail Road is not merely a job, it is their life, and their co-workers are their extended family. Promoting workers to management improves morale. Hiring outsiders generally has the opposite effect. 
 When Thomas Prendergast, a former senior vice president of New York City Transit, became president of the Long Island Rail Road in 1994, he tried to change what he repeatedly referred to as the ''culture'' on the railroad. He replaced some department heads with former colleagues from the subway. The results were not pretty: air-conditioning failures, undercarriage fires and breakdowns that reports later found were due to neglected or faulty maintenance. At least partly because of Mr. Prendergast's difficulties with labor and management, riders suffered some of the worst service ever.
 On the Long Island Rail Road, work rule changes intended to promote efficiency and improve service are difficult to achieve. With the right to strike, Long Island Rail Road workers have the power to cripple Long Island's economy, giving them unparalleled leverage in contract negotiations.
 Yet, early indications are that Ms. Williams and Mr. Nelson may be on the right track. Railroad employees have long complained that management does not listen to them. So after observing how railroad managers dealt with a thunderstorm in July that knocked out service on several lines, the next morning, Ms. Williams sat down with them. Together, they came up with ways to better communicate in emergencies and restore service more quickly. And at the next Metropolitan Transportation Authority meeting, Ms. Williams publicly recognized the ''specialized skills'' that enabled workers to get the trains running again.
 If this is the beginning of a sincere effort by Ms. Williams and Mr. Nelson to communicate with workers, their listening tour might be the thing that makes this administration different and provide the catalyst necessary for lasting change on the Long Island Rail Road. Riders can only hope.

HEADLINE: The Dialysis Business: Fair Treatment?

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
El Segundo, Calif.
 KENT J. THIRY, the chief executive of DaVita, a leading provider of dialysis services, regularly dons a Three Musketeers costume at company meetings, brandishes a sword and leads employees in chants of ''All for One'' and ''One for All.'' At a meeting last year in Dallas, he rode a longhorn bull around the hotel, surrounded by parade floats made by employees.
 Amid all this boosterism is a combative streak. In a skit presented at a DaVita employee meeting two years ago, a DaVita musketeer killed a federal bureaucrat -- dressed in black hat and bandit's mask -- who threatened to cut the reimbursement for dialysis. Another musketeer killed a federal prosecutor. 
 For his part, Mr. Thiry favors a warmer, homier approach at the company's headquarters here. He insists that DaVita is a ''village'' and that he, as the sign on his office door says, is ''KT, Mayor.'' Office aisles even sport street signs like ''Be Our Guest Ln.'' and ''Acquisition Ave.'' 
 With the help of such slogans, skits and shtick, Mr. Thiry has rescued DaVita from near collapse and turned it into an enterprise that, he asserts, is becoming ''the best dialysis company the world has ever seen.'' And that, he says, using another expression that his DaVita employees faithfully repeat, is ''no brag, just fact.'' 
 But the mayor and his profitable little community (2006 sales, $4.9 billion; earnings, $290 million) are threatened. Federal officials are cracking down on how DaVita makes much of its money: by administering the drug Epogen to treat anemia in dialysis patients. DaVita receives more from Medicare and private insurers for providing Epogen than it pays to buy the drug from its manufacturer, Amgen. 
 Concerns are mounting that such financial incentives are contributing to an overuse of Epogen that may lead to heart problems, blood clots or even premature deaths. ''The payment system leads to perverse incentives,'' said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, during a Congressional hearing in June at which DaVita was singled out for criticism. 
 The Food and Drug Administration, which has already forced Amgen to provide stricter warnings about Epogen and similar products, convened a panel of experts last week to consider further restrictions on the drug's use. While the panel advised against such a move, use of the drug is still expected to drop from last year's levels, industry analysts say.
 Medicare and Congress are moving to stop separate Medicare reimbursement for Epogen to end the incentives to overuse the drug. Law enforcement authorities, including those at the Justice Department and at the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, are conducting criminal and civil investigations into how DaVita and some other dialysis providers bill for Epogen. 
 All of this casts an unfavorable spotlight on the dialysis business, which might be the closest thing the United States has to nationalized health care. Medicare pays for almost all dialysis, even for patients younger than 65. 
 Dialysis is a dreary experience, one in which people with failed kidneys sit for hours hooked to machines that cleanse their blood, assisted by technicians who often have to work a second job to make ends meet. More than one in five of the nation's dialysis patients die each year -- a rate as much as double that in Europe and Japan -- for reasons that aren't clear.
 Some 350,000 or so Americans currently need dialysis; that population is growing about 3 percent a year, fueled by a rise in diabetes. DaVita treats about 106,000 patients in more than 1,300 clinics and appears to be the most aggressive Epogen user among major dialysis chains, according to the United States Renal Data System, a government-funded registry of dialysis data. Epogen accounts for 25 percent of DaVita's revenue and up to 40 percent of its earnings, according to the Stanford Group Company, a research firm. 
 As he sorties forth to defend DaVita, Mr. Thiry has become the most visible dialysis executive in Washington, taking issue with what he describes as unfair accusations that his company's profits are built on a product that causes harm to patients.
 ''The suspension of logic in this discussion has been remarkable,'' he said. He said he was confident that DaVita would emerge unscathed from the government investigations. 
 Mr. Thiry added that he would welcome a well-designed change in the reimbursement system to eliminate perceived incentives to overuse Epogen, which is commonly referred to as Epo. ''Do that tomorrow so we get rid of the taint,'' he said. ''We're still going to use the same amount of Epo.''
 THE controversy comes just as Mr. Thiry, 51, has started to attract favorable attention in business schools and the media for DaVita's management practices, like an extensive emphasis on employee training. 
 After graduating from Harvard Business School, Mr. Thiry was a consultant at Bain & Company and then ran Vivra, a dialysis chain in Northern California. After Vivra was acquired in the late 1990s, Mr. Thiry was recruited by Total Renal Care, a dialysis chain in Southern California that was in disarray. 
 Mr. Thiry had just seen the movie ''The Man in the Iron Mask,'' in which the Three Musketeers come out of retirement. Inspired, he called some of his former aides from Vivra and asked, ''Will you ride again?'' 
 He and his team took over in October 1999, though Mr. Thiry continued to live in Northern California, working mostly out of his home or a nearby company office. As they addressed bookkeeping problems and other woes, they also overhauled the corporate culture. 
 Many chief executives stress teamwork and values, but Mr. Thiry took those concepts to extremes. He changed the company's name from Total Renal Care to DaVita (which he describes as Italian for ''he/she gives life''). He also painted inspirational slogans in huge letters on the walls of his office -- including ''Begin with the end in mind,'' and ''Speak with your life, not just your words.''
 DaVita employees are known as teammates. Those who do well can win company-paid vacations. Dialysis clinics have ''walls of fame'' with a picture of each patient and staff member. 
 Mr. Thiry and his wife, Denise O'Leary, a former venture capitalist, bankroll the KT Family Fund, which provides $100,000 a year in scholarships for the children of employees, as well as the KT Community Fund, which helps pay for community service projects undertaken by employees. Another fund, backed by the company and employee contributions, helps staff members during setbacks like illnesses. 
 DaVita uses annual company meetings and many smaller regional gatherings so people can bond and learn the ''DaVita way.'' Mr. Thiry, often wearing his musketeer outfit, speaks at many of them, afterward posing for pictures with employees.
 Some skeptics say Mr. Thiry is merely a salesman who has created a cult of personality around him. 
 ''You see 2,500 in a huge conference room in Dallas, and KT running through the hall with his arms up slapping hands, with his Three Musketeers costume, and these women crooning,'' said a former employee who said Mr. Thiry's showmanship was self-aggrandizing. This person requested anonymity because a relative still works for DaVita. 
 But others say Mr. Thiry's motivations are genuine. ''Kent cries at movies. He's one of those guys,'' said Douglas Vlchek, who was called Yoda at DaVita, where he was chief wisdom officer, in charge of employee education. He left in 2005 and is now a deacon in the Catholic Church. ''I preach at Mass and I talk about this company sometimes,'' Mr. Vlchek said. ''It does what human beings are supposed to do.'' 
 Another defender is Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford business school who wrote a case study in 2006 of DaVita's revival. He said the corporate culture, while being too ''Kent-centric,'' reduced employee turnover and made the company ''extremely successful and effective.'' He also said that DaVita is a leader among companies in using data to make decisions. 
 Certainly, the financial results have been stellar. Revenue climbed from $1.4 billion in 1999, the year Mr. Thiry took over, to $4.9 billion last year. And the stock, which dipped below $2 in early 2000, is now about $62. 
 Mr. Thiry has profited from this growth, in large part from gains on stock options. He made $8.4 million in 2006 and more than $25 million in 2005. He owns DaVita shares worth about $90 million, according to the last proxy statement. 
 DaVita and its main competitor, Fresenius Medical Care, control about two-thirds of the dialysis business. The rest of the industry is composed of smaller chains and independent clinics, some of which are nonprofit operations. Since 2002, DaVita has grown faster in the markets it serves than Fresenius, said an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
 Mr. Thiry points to company data showing that DaVita provides better care than the national average, although the United States Renal Data System statistics do not show this clearly. He argues that DaVita's efforts to improve overall dialysis treatment, even when it makes no extra money, show that the company is not overusing Epogen just to cash in. 
 Dialysis clinics lose money on the fee paid by Medicare for a dialysis treatment because the payments haven't kept pace with inflation. Yet industry executives say the clinics can typically recoup those losses by getting reimbursed for Epogen and other drugs. 
 Government officials ''understood they were subsidizing the cost of dialysis by allowing us to make a profit on the drugs,'' said Dr. J. Michael Lazarus, chief medical officer of Fresenius. He added that he did not particularly like the arrangement. ''I don't want to be in the drug business,'' he said. ''I want to be in the dialysis business.''
 Amgen offers discounts and rebates to dialysis companies based, in part, on how much Epogen they use and how much that use increases year to year. DaVita says in regulatory filings that failure to qualify for such discounts could have a ''material adverse effect'' on the company's earnings.
 While Amgen and DaVita are financially tethered through Epogen, there have been tensions in the relationship. Protected by patents, Amgen is the only supplier of a drug that dialysis centers cannot do without, giving it strong leverage over the dialysis companies. 
 Mr. Thiry declined to comment about Amgen. But in previous comments to reporters and analysts, he has accused Amgen of ''abuse of monopoly power'' and has said that Washington would not care as much about Epogen if the price were lower. 
 In a letter to Amgen in February 2006, DaVita protested terms of a new contract, saying it would face huge financial penalties if it didn't increase usage of Epogen by 4 percent.
 In a statement, Amgen said the incentives in its contracts with DaVita were based on past patterns of growth and did not cause Epogen usage to increase unduly. Amgen said it ''partners with customers in service to patients,'' and that DaVita was a ''valued Amgen customer.'' It also said the cost per unit of Epogen to Medicare had dropped over the years. 
 Despite such pressures, Mr. Thiry says DaVita did not overuse Epogen. He said decisions on how much to use are made by patients' physicians. While a small number of physicians own a stake in their local DaVita clinic, the vast majority do not profit personally from prescribing Epogen, according to Mr. Thiry. 
 Still, corporate ownership does seem to influence Epogen use. According to a study published in April in The Journal of the American Medical Association, for-profit clinics use $1,700 more of Epogen on each patient every year than nonprofit centers do. 
 Moreover, DaVita does have a central protocol to advise doctors on dosage. 
 ''The truth is, there's a partnership between the facilities and the doctors,'' said Dr. Peter W. Crooks, head of nephrology for Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, which sends patients to Fresenius and DaVita clinics.
 When Epogen came on the market in 1989 it was a godsend for dialysis patients. The drug is a synthetic version of a hormone, made by the kidneys, that stimulates the body to produce oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Patients with failed kidneys make little or none of the hormone and can have fatigue-inducing anemia or require blood transfusions. 
 But some studies have shown that if the drug is used too aggressively and red blood cell levels are raised too high, it can cause cardiovascular problems or kill people. And Renal Data System figures show that more than 60 percent of DaVita patients have red blood cell levels that the F.D.A. considers risky. A Renal Data System study from 2006 found that DaVita was the company most likely to overshoot recommended red cell levels and was the slowest to reduce doses once this occurred. 
 Yet the evidence is complicated and incomplete, as testimony at last week's F.D.A. meeting showed. Low red blood cell levels are also unhealthy, and Medicare has a minimum recommended level for dialysis patients. Mr. Thiry said that DaVita tries to get as many patients as possible above that level, but that each patient responds differently and that some overshoot. 
 Still, other chains manage to keep more patients in the desired range, according to a Renal Data System study. DaVita said it didn't cut Epogen dosages sharply after an overshoot because that causes big fluctuations in red blood cell levels. At last week's meeting, some panel members said such fluctuations could, in themselves, be risky.
 The F.D.A. doesn't have to listen to its advisory panels and has yet to decide on a proper target range for levels of red blood cells -- but when it does, analysts say, it will almost certainly be lower than what DaVita was aiming for before the safety concerns intensified. Still, last week's proceedings reduced the chance that there would be severe new restrictions, and DaVita's stock surged to $63 on Thursday, the highest level since Mr. Thiry took over. 
 MR. THIRY said that last week's proceedings provided some vindication. ''As people step back and consider the actual evidence that exists, all the old fun and dramatic criticisms are evaporating,'' he said. 
 Other challenges loom, however. Congress and Medicare are moving to eliminate the separate payments for Epogen and other drugs in favor of one ''bundled'' payment that would cover all aspects of dialysis treatment. That would eliminate the financial incentive to overuse Epogen -- but could end up replacing it with an incentive to skimp on the drug to lower treatment costs and increase profits. After long opposing bundling, Mr. Thiry now says he would accept it providing the total payment per treatment does not drop. 
 To help press their case in the nation's capital, Mr. Thiry and DaVita's government relations office -- what it calls its G-Force -- have plunged into the various Washington battles in DaVita's usual rah-rah way. DaVita's political action committee contributed $530,000 to lawmakers last year and is aiming for $1 million this year, according to the company's in-house magazine. DaVita even organized its patients into an advocacy group, the DaVita Patient Citizens. DaVita employees and patients sent 27,000 letters and e-mail messages to lawmakers in 2006.
 Mr. Thiry's frequent trips to Washington have added to rumors that DaVita's ''mayor'' is planning to run for a real public office. Mr. Thiry says he would like to pursue a public service job when he leaves DaVita, but he wouldn't say when that might be. DaVita has begun to spread his cheerleading duties to other executives. 
 But for now, Mr. Thiry seems intent on saving DaVita, and his own reputation, from attacks in Washington and the media attention that has followed. ''We were on our way to becoming a role model for American health care,'' he said, ''until this spate of articles on anemia has tainted our community.''

HEADLINE: Will Rudy Let Her Rudy-Up?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 It's on.
 Or, rather, it's back on.
 Rudy versus Hillary, a New York steel-cage match pitting two eye-gouging, hair-pulling, kick-em-till-they're-dead brawlers.
 For months, Hillary's comely male rivals for the Democratic nomination have tiptoed around her, letting their wives take shots at the front-runner. 
 Barack Obama looks wary when he's on stage with Hillary, but Michelle stepped up: ''Some women feel it's a woman's turn, you know? They just feel like it's Hillary's turn. That, I reject, because democracy isn't supposed to be about whose turn it is.''
 That followed Elizabeth Edwards's takedown of Hillary: ''She's just not as vocal a women's advocate as I want to see. John is.''
 Obama and Edwards probably figured the criticism would sound less Lazio coming from their wives. But it just made them seem as though they were hiding behind their wives' skirts.
 Enter Rudy. He may wear skirts, but he's not afraid to take down a skirt.
 He put up an ad Friday on his campaign Web site slamming her as a hypocrite for running an antiwar campaign after supporting the president on the authorization for war.
 Obama has been trying to make this point for quite a while, but so gingerly that every time he sneaks up on it, Hillary surges ahead.
 Rudy doesn't do ginger.
 Hillary has been trying to Rudy-up, corralling ground zero and playing the fear card, saying that if there were a terrorist attack before the election, only she could stop Republicans from keeping the White House. But Rudy aims to de-Rudy her. His ad is an instant cult classic, with a solemn trumpet that is reminiscent of ''Taps'' and a narrator who sounds like the guy who does trailers for ''In a World Gone Wrong'' disaster flicks.
 Just when Hillary was basking in her reinvention of herself, Rudy sprang out of the Republican primary shadows and shoved her back.
 He ignores her attempts to be New Hillary, a senator who loves men in uniform, who is not afraid to use military power, and who is tough enough to deal with bin Laden. He recasts her as Old Hillary, a Code Pink pinko first lady and opportunist from a White House that had a reputation for having a flower-child distaste for the military, a left-wing shrew who made a secret socialist health care plan and let gays into the military and certainly can't be trusted to fight the jihadists.
 ''In 2002,'' the white words flash on a black screen, ''Hillary Clinton voted to authorize military action in Iraq because she believed it was the right thing to do.''
 Then it goes to a clip of Hillary speaking on the Senate floor during the war authorization debate that Obama has been too refined to highlight.
 ''If left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons,'' she said, an echo of Condi. ''He has also given aid and comfort and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members. So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation.''
 Then the narrator intones, ''But now that she's running for president, Hillary Clinton has changed her position, even joining with the radical group MoveOn .org in attacking American General Petraeus'' when she said it would require ''a willing suspension of disbelief'' to believe him.
 ''Just when our troops need all our support to finish the job, Hillary Clinton is turning her back on them,'' the narrator concludes.
 There are harsh images of Hillary, looking brittle in dark glasses, to go with the harsh words.
 Rudy has decided that the best way to win his primary is to show he can beat the woman on the way to winning hers.
 He can't campaign on family values or the sanctity of marriage. He can't whip up any fears on abortion or gays.
 He can't campaign on his plan to get out of Iraq because he doesn't have one. He can't campaign as the tough-guy heir to Bush because nobody likes Bush. He can't campaign on attacking Iran because he'll sound like crazy Dick Cheney.
 He can't campaign on the economy because he's W. redux, facing a possible recession because of the mortgage crisis. He can't campaign on Rudy's from-the-mountaintop ''12 Commitments'' because no one knows what they are, and they don't mention the word ''Iraq.''
 But he can be the only man in the field tough enough to slap around a woman.
 The irony is that if you could loosen up Hillary with a few Jack and gingers, she would probably be closer to her reinvention than to his caricature. She probably secretly supports the surge, knowing that after it sputters, she may reap the whirlwind. And then the Republicans, who have lied, stalled and mismanaged in every way imaginable, will paint her as Ms. Cut and Run, turning her back on the military again.

HEADLINE: Sparse Schedule for Thompson on Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

DATELINE: LAKELAND, Fla., Sept. 15 

 BODY:
At his second campaign stop of the day on Friday, just after 2 p.m., Fred D. Thompson was deep into a riff on the benefits of high-quality American health care. 
 ''It's allowing us to live healthier lives and to live longer,'' Mr. Thompson, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, said at a Jaycee park here. ''That's good news. But we have more retired folks. I hope to become one of them one of these days.''
 Nervous laughter from the audience. 
 ''Not too soon,'' he added hastily. 
 So much for dispelling the idea that he is too lazy to run for president. For months, Mr. Thompson has fought off suggestions that he is not motivated enough to weather the round-the-clock campaign trail required of serious presidential candidates. (Or, as a recent headline in Newsweek put it, ''Lazy Like a Fox.'')
 His critics, already pointing to what they call Mr. Thompson's skimpy Senate record, might find even more ammunition in his campaign schedule. In his second week as an officially declared candidate for the Republican nomination, Mr. Thompson has made a languid three-day swing through Florida ending Saturday with the candidate watching a football game in Gainesville. The pace has kept him on a jumbo air-conditioned bus far more often than he is actually campaigning. 
 Since Thursday morning, when the tour began, Mr. Thompson has made no more than three campaign stops a day, with long stretches in between. In recent spins through Iowa, he kept a similarly relaxed schedule. Mitt Romney, by comparison, often does six town-hall-style forums a day when in Iowa. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Thompson said the driving distances in Florida were a factor, and that he would add more impromptu stops later in the campaign.
 Next week, his schedule has no public events at all, limiting his appearances to fund-raisers in Florida, Tennessee and Texas.
 In Florida, Mr. Thompson has been warmly received in the heavily Republican enclaves he has visited, including at a restaurant frequented by Cuban-Americans in Miami; at a retirement community in The Villages; and at Celebration, the planned community outside Orlando that was created by Disney. 
 His stump speech, while noticeably short on details, has stuck to familiar, sweeping conservative themes like lower taxes and what Mr. Thompson calls ''the sanctity of life.'' 
 John Hall, a retired firefighter from Miami Beach who went to Miami to watch Mr. Thompson speak, said he came away impressed.
 ''I like his straightforwardness,'' Mr. Hall said. ''He comes across as a guy who stands by his principles. That's why I like George W. Bush, and I see the same thing in him. You've got to be strong.''
 Between his campaign stops, Mr. Thompson has been spending most of his time riding on his bus with a coterie of advisers. 
 Several of Mr. Thompson's aides said he had been spending his time being briefed, often on the phone with advisers. And much of the discussion has focused on economics and security, said Rich Galen, a senior adviser to the campaign. ''He's been going through the briefing books,'' Mr. Galen said.
 But once off the bus, Mr. Thompson has shown occasional signs of discomfort. In a speech here on Friday, he sweated profusely under the afternoon sun, breathed heavily and, while struggling over a question, asked no one in particular if his microphone was on. (It was.)
 Some audience members, in a crowd that easily reached into the hundreds, winced as Mr. Thompson sweated through the question-and-answer session. 
 ''I'm surprised they didn't pull him out of there,'' said John Chambers of nearby Punta Gorda, after the speech ended. Suzanne Miranda, who watched the event from a lawn chair, said, ''I felt bad for him.'' 
 Mr. Thompson later emerged from the bus clad in a clean polo shirt and appearing cheerful for his first interaction with the traveling press corps in two days. When reporters pressed him for a reaction to the Newsweek headline, he laughed. Is the campaign trail grueling, he was asked?
 ''Does it look grueling to you?'' he shot back. ''It's uplifting!''
 Minutes later, he climbed back onto the bus.

HEADLINE: Unveiling Health Care 2.0, Again

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 Rarely does a politician, a party or a political system get a chance at a do-over.
 Yet when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton rolls out her comprehensive health plan in Iowa on Monday, it will be just that: Mrs. Clinton, or whoever the next president might be, has a second chance to fix a system that has, in many ways, deteriorated in the 14 years since the Clintons' last attempt at an overhaul. 
 But will it turn out any differently this time? Can another big national health plan survive the furious lobbying of the interest groups, the divisions between the parties, the ambivalence of the public?
 It is, clearly, a moment of political opportunity: Strong majorities of Americans, once again, tell pollsters they want guaranteed health care for all. Some of the most powerful interest groups -- representing business, labor, hospitals and insurers -- have tried to set aside their differences to call for action. 
 The number of uninsured is approaching 50 million, the average cost of family coverage has risen 78 percent in the last six years, and more and more employers say they cannot afford to provide health coverage and still compete in a global marketplace. 
 The major Democratic presidential candidates have offered plans aimed at expanding coverage and lowering costs -- Mrs. Clinton's is only the latest -- and the major Republican candidates acknowledge that there are serious problems in the system.
 But it is worth remembering: Health care reform seemed inevitable in the early 1990s, too. 
 It was almost inconceivable, in the spring of 1993, when nearly three-fourths of Americans said they supported the Clinton plan and political consensus seemed easily within reach, that everything would collapse in the end.
 The Democrats, and especially Mrs. Clinton, promise that this time will be different. Like Vietnam, the failure of the last health initiative has been endlessly analyzed by those who lived through it, and its proponents say they have learned some lessons. First and foremost: That the last plan was doomed when middle-class Americans came to see it as more risk than benefit -- a 1,342-page restructuring of the health care system, creating vast and confusing new bureaucracies, in an effort to extend benefits to everyone.
 Those fears were symbolized by Harry and Louise, two nervous 40-somethings created for a devastating advertising campaign by the insurance industry. Between 1993 and 1994, support for the Clinton plan dropped to 43 percent from 71 percent, according to Robert J. Blendon, a Harvard professor and expert on health. The plan literally lost the support of the middle -- the middle income, the middle aged, political independents.
 In short, altruism has its limits, as does the public's appetite for trade-offs in their own lives for the sake of the uninsured, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who worked for the insurance industry in 1993 and 1994. ''Never, in my years of work, have I found someone who said, 'I will reduce the quality of the health care I get so that all Americans can get something,' '' he said. ''Every time the debate reaches that point, it collapses.''
 This time, candidates are emphasizing the benefits for people who already have insurance -- lower costs for coverage, new programs to improve the quality of health care. ''Everyone has to feel, at the end of the day, that they will get something,'' said one Clinton adviser.
 At least by Democratic standards, there is a certain humility to the major universal coverage plans these days, some health policy analysts say. The plans would build on the existing system, as governors in both parties have tried to do in the states -- expand public programs for children; shore up the employer-based system; and offer new private and public options for people who cannot get their coverage through work.
 And Mrs. Clinton is offering herself as the paradigm of this sadder-but-wiser approach.
 For its part, the public may also be sadder but wiser, some analysts say. Most Americans are now in some form of managed care, still a novel concept in the early 1990s. More say they know someone who is going without health insurance, working in jobs that do not provide it. Most people with coverage still say they are personally satisfied with the care they receive but they are worried about the system as a whole. 
 Some of the romanticism about the virtues of the American health care system may be diminishing, and not just among the audiences who cheered Michael Moore's ''Sicko'' this summer. Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a longtime expert on health policy, noted that recent studies show the United States does not rank at the top on several measures of health care quality, like waiting times to see physicians. ''We always had this fallback -- that we might cost too much, have a lot of people uninsured, but you bet your bottom dollar that those who have health coverage get the best care in the world,'' Mr. Reischauer said. ''And the answer is, some here do.''
 Many politicians and activists survey this landscape and see extraordinary prospects for major health legislation, if a president were committed to it. In fact, frustration has been simmering on the left over what they see as Mrs. Clinton's excessive caution in tackling the issue again. 
 But there are also grounds for skepticism that the stars may have finally aligned, many experts say. Politics itself, at least in Washington, has grown more partisan and ideologically charged in the last 14 years, making it more difficult to pass something as complicated as national health legislation. The debate over renewing and expanding the children's health insurance program is a case in point, with President Bush and other Republicans assailing a bipartisan plan as a first step toward a government takeover of health care. 
 The debate over health care on the presidential campaign trail is increasingly ideological, as candidates woo their core constituents on the right and the left. Republicans assail the Democrats for advocating nothing short of socialism on health care. Democrats, for their part, are moving toward an increasingly populist attack on the big economic interests, like the insurance industry. Mrs. Clinton has been escalating those attacks in the run up to her speech.
 Mrs. Clinton herself can be an extremely polarizing figure on this issue; while memories have faded, Mr. Blendon said, ''there's no question that if she's the presidential nominee, they'll bring out the old films and the tapes and the details.''
 Paying for universal coverage is always an issue, especially in a budget strained by war, a growth in entitlement spending and a nagging deficit. Moreover, all the talk of common ground and a new consensus for change among the so-called stakeholders -- business, the health insurers, doctors, hospitals, unions -- can quickly fade.
 Universal coverage, after all, has been a dream of the Democratic Party's since the New Deal -- but always just over the horizon.

HEADLINE: Revisiting the Canon Wars

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO. 
Rachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, when Reagan and Gorbachev were negotiating the end of the cold war and college cost far less than it does today, a book arrived like a shot across the bow of academia: ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' by Allan Bloom, a larger-than-life political philosophy professor at the University of Chicago. Subtitled ''How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students,'' it spent more than a year on the best-seller list, and today there are more than 1.2 million copies in print. Saul Bellow, who had urged his brilliant and highly idiosyncratic friend to write the book in the first place, wrote the introduction. (Bellow later cast Bloom as the main character in ''Ravelstein.'') 
 Bloom's book was full of bold claims: that abandoning the Western canon had dumbed down universities, while the ''relativism'' that had replaced it had ''extinguished the real motive of education, the search for a good life''; that rock music ''ruins the imagination of young people''; that America had produced no significant contributions to intellectual life since the 1950s; and that many earlier contributions were just watered-down versions of Heidegger, Nietzsche, Weber, Freud and other Continental thinkers. For Bloom, things had gone wrong in the '60s, when universities took on ''the imperative to promote equality, stamp out racism, sexism and elitism (the peculiar crimes of our democratic society), as well as war,'' he wrote, because they thought such attempts at social change ''possessed a moral truth superior to any the university could provide.'' 
 ''The Closing of the American Mind'' hit the scene at a time when universities were embroiled in the so-called canon wars, in which traditionalists in favor of centering the curriculum on classic works of literature faced off against multiculturalists who wanted to include more works by women and members of minorities. In early 1988, students at Stanford held a rally with Jesse Jackson, where they shouted, ''Hey hey, ho ho, Western culture's got to go,'' to protest a required Western civilization course. (The faculty quickly voted to replace it with a requirement including more works by women and minorities.) Bloom's book shared space at the top of the best-seller list with E. D. Hirsch's ''Cultural Literacy'' (1987), which argued that progressive education had left Americans without a grasp of basic knowledge. It also inspired further conservative attacks against the university, including Roger Kimball's ''Tenured Radicals'' (1990) and Dinesh D'Souza's ''Illiberal Education'' (1991). 
 Although it had great popular appeal, ''The Closing of the American Mind'' did not go over well among academics. Bloom's detractors criticized everything from his interpretation of the Greeks to his views on youth culture and feminism, which he saw as corrosive influences. ''The amazing thing about Allan Bloom's book was not just its prodigious commercial success ... but the depth of the hostility and even hatred that it inspired among a large number of professors,'' John Searle, the Berkeley philosophy professor and former proponent of the '60s radical Free Speech Movement wrote in The New York Review of Books in 1990. Searle also noted a ''certain irony'' that the Western canon, from Socrates to Marx, which had once been seen as ''liberating,'' was now seen as ''oppressive.'' ''Precisely by inculcating a critical attitude,'' Searle wrote, ''the 'canon' served to demythologize the conventional pieties of the American bourgeoisie and provided the student with a perspective from which to critically analyze American culture and institutions. ... The texts once served an unmasking function; now we are told that it is the texts which must be unmasked.''
 Today it's generally agreed that the multiculturalists won the canon wars. Reading lists were broadened to include more works by women and minority writers, and most scholars consider that a positive development. Yet 20 years later, there's a more complicated sense of the costs and benefits of those transformations. Here, the lines aren't drawn between right and left in the traditional political sense, but between those who defend the idea of a distinct body of knowledge and texts that students should master and those who focus more on modes of inquiry and interpretation. However polarizing Bloom may have been, many of the issues he raised still resonate -- especially when it comes to the place of the humanities on campus and in the culture. 
 Debates over what an educated person should know go back to the 19th century in America, when teaching any literature beyond the Greek and Roman classics was still controversial. But today, there's widespread concern that the humanities are losing ground -- as well as intellectual cachet, students and financing -- to the hard sciences on the one hand and business on the other. A 2006 report [PDF] on higher education commissioned by Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, which raised hackles with its proposal to introduce No Child Left Behind-style standards testing in universities, hardly mentioned the humanities. At the same time, several state legislatures have debated an ''academic bill of rights'' that would provide a grievance procedure against ''political discrimination'' on campus -- a measure proposed by David Horowitz, a Marxist-turned-conservative critical of what he sees as academia's left-wing bias.
 All this reflects what the philosopher Martha Nussbaum today describes as a ''loss of respect for the humanities as essential ingredients of democracy.'' Nussbaum, who panned Bloom's book in The New York Review in 1987, teaches at the University of Chicago, which like Columbia has retained a Western-based core curriculum requirement for undergraduates. But on some campuses, ''the main area of conflict is trying to make sure that the humanities get adequate funding from the central administration,'' Nussbaum wrote in an e-mail message, adding, ''Our nation, like most nations of the world, is devaluing the humanities vis-a-vis science and technology, so constant vigilance is required lest these disciplines be cut.'' Louis Menand, a Harvard English professor and New Yorker staff writer who serves on Harvard's curriculum reform committee, concurs: ''The big question for humanists is, How do we explain why what we do is important for people who aren't humanists? That's been tough, really tough.''
 But when college costs run as high as $50,000 a year, it's harder to ignore questions like ''What will this major do for my career prospects?'' While humanities departments thrive at elite institutions (at Yale, for example, history has long been the most popular major, with English usually beating out economics for second place), the high cost of college today exacerbates a utilitarian strain that's always made it hard for the liberal arts to make a case for themselves in practical-minded America. According to the Department of Education, in the 2003-4 school year, only 1.6 percent of America's 19 million undergraduates majored in English and 1.3 percent in history, compared with 20 percent in business, 16 percent in health, 9 percent in education and 6 percent in computer science. 
 Not all academics object to raising market questions. For Alan Wolfe, a political science professor at Boston College and the director of its Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life, ''the introduction of economic criteria into the university is a good thing.'' During the canon wars of the late '80s, he said, scholars had an ''imperious'' idea that ''if we want to argue about the curriculum we're free to do that.'' But now, most realize ''we have obligations to the students and the parents and the taxpayers.'' 
 According to Stanley Fish, a law professor at Florida International University and an occasional New York Times columnist, the conservative critique of academia connects to an economic one. ''The message the neoconservatives were putting out, that universities are hotbeds of atheism, sexual promiscuity, corrosive relativism and a host of suspect philosophies being imported from France and Germany, actually took quite strongly with the intended audience,'' said Fish, who was embroiled in these debates as chairman of Duke's theory-oriented English department from the mid-'80s to the early '90s. ''It's easier for a state legislature to cut university funding when there is an unflattering view'' of academia, he said. 
 But Fish thinks humanities professors bear some blame for their diminished standing. He's at work on a new book, ''Save the World on Your Own Time,'' which argues that academics should teach, not proselytize. In his view, ''the invasion of political agendas'' into the classroom in the '60s and '70s was ''extremely dangerous,'' since it meant classrooms could become battlegrounds for political demagoguery.
 The invasion of politics has been particularly notable in the literature curriculum. On campus today, the emphasis is very much on studying literature through the lens of ''identity'' -- ethnic, gender, class. There has also been a decided shift toward works of the present and the recent past. In 1965, the authors most frequently assigned in English classes were Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, Dryden, Pope and T. S. Eliot, according to a survey by the National Association of Scholars, an organization committed to preserving ''the Western intellectual heritage.'' In 1998, they were Shakespeare, Chaucer, Jane Austen, Milton, Virginia Woolf and Toni Morrison. The most-assigned living authors were Morrison, Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, Salman Rushdie, Thomas Pynchon and Philip Roth. (Roth himself may not be so pleased with the company. His forthcoming ''Exit Ghost'' includes a character's rant about a library display: ''They had Gertrude Stein in the exhibit but not Ernest Hemingway. They had Edna St. Vincent Millay but not William Carlos Williams or Wallace Stevens or Robert Lowell,'' the character says. ''Just nonsense. It started in the colleges and now it's everywhere. Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison and Toni Morrison, but not Faulkner.'')
 But many scholars see these changes as part of a necessary evolution. To Michael Berube, an English professor at Pennsylvania State University and the author of ''What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts?'' (2006), the changes have been particularly beneficial in American literature, which has seen the most canon revision in part because it never had a very stable canon to begin with. ''The old guard had very little to offer in the way of serious intellectual argument against the reading and teaching of ... Olaudah Equiano or Djuna Barnes or Zora Neale Hurston, so the canon of the past two or three centuries got itself revised in fairly short order,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Only the Department of Surly Curmudgeons still disputes that we're dealing with a usefully expanded field.'' 
 Reading lists, though, are a zero-sum game: for every writer added, another is dropped. One can debate the changing fortunes of writers on the literary stock market, but it's clear that today the emphasis is on the recent past -- at the expense, some argue, of historical perspective. As Alan Wolfe puts it, ''Everyone's read 'Things Fall Apart' '' -- Chinua Achebe's novel about postcolonial Nigeria -- ''but few people have read the Yeats poem that the title comes from.'' 
 For John Guillory, an English professor at New York University and the author of ''Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation'' (1993), ''The major fact that the discipline is confronting today is global English, which is a cultural corollary of economic globalization.'' At the same time, postcolonial Anglophone culture is only half a century old. ''I'm often impressed by this scholarship, but I'm also concerned that this new field seems to be so disconnected from the history of literature and scholarship that goes before it,'' Guillory said. ''I see too many scholars in the field who know very little about anything before the 20th century, and that concerns me.''
 Elaine Showalter, a feminist literary scholar and a former president of the Modern Language Association, who retired from Princeton in 2003, today urges a reconsideration of some of the changes made in past decades. ''This period of discovery and recovery (for example, of women writers) has been stimulating, exciting and renewing,'' Showalter wrote in an e-mail message. ''But now it's time for a period of evaluation and consolidation.''
 To some, another question is how to get students to read critically in the first place. ''What does it profit progressives to get minority writers like Walker and Black Elk into the syllabus if many students need the Cliffs Notes to gain an articulate grasp of either?'' asked Gerald Graff, an English professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has written on the canon wars. 
 The historian Tony Judt, a self-described ''old leftist'' and the director of the Remarque Institute at N.Y.U., which examines Europe and European-American relations, said undergraduates often arrive unprepared from high school and seeking courses ''in what we might have thought of as the old-fashioned approach'' -- broad surveys. But many young professors aren't interested in teaching outside their narrow specialties, nor are they generally prepared to do so. And colleges are loath to reinstate the core curriculums they abandoned in the '60s. ''Because we lack cultural self-confidence, we've lacked the ability to say, 'This is a good book and should be taught, this isn't and shouldn't,' '' said Judt, who was dean of the humanities at N.Y.U. in the early '90s.
 Judt also denounces the balkanization created by interdisciplinary ethnic studies programs. Multiculturalism ''created lots and lots of microconstituencies, which universities didn't have the courage to oppose,'' he said. ''It's much more like a supermarket -- kids can take pretty much any courses they like: Jewish kids take Jewish studies, gay students gay studies, black students African-American studies. You no longer have a university, but a series of identity constituencies all studying themselves.'' 
 Some say this kind of identity-based thinking is at odds with the true purpose of education -- something canon traditionalists can misunderstand as badly as their multiculturalist opponents. ''What Americans yearn for in literature is self-recognition,'' said Mark Lilla, a professor of political philosophy and religion who just left the University of Chicago for Columbia. ''That's where the conservatives went wrong. The case for the canon itself isn't a case for book camp and becoming a citizen in the West.'' Wrestling with difficult, often inaccessible works is ''the most alienating experience possible,'' he continued. ''When you read Toni Morrison, there's no alienation. It affirms your Americanism.''
 Bloom believed education should be transformative -- that it should remove students from the confines of their own backgrounds to engage with books that open up new realms of meaning. ''He told students that they had come to the university to learn something, and this meant that they must rid themselves of the opinions of their parents,'' Bellow wrote of Ravelstein/Bloom in his novel. ''He was going to direct them to a higher life, full of variety and diversity, governed by rationality -- anything but the arid kind.'' In ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' Bloom himself wrote that a liberal education should provide a student with ''four years of freedom'' -- ''a space between the intellectual wasteland he has left behind and the inevitable dreary professional training that awaits him after the baccalaureate.'' Whether students today see college as a time of freedom or a compulsory phase of credentialing is an open question. From Bloom's perspective, ''the importance of these years for an American cannot be overestimated. They are civilization's only chance to get to him.''

HEADLINE: Clinton to Propose Universal Health Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will lay out a plan to secure health insurance for all Americans while severely limiting the ability of insurers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with chronic illnesses and other medical problems, her aides and advisers say.
 Mrs. Clinton's purpose, they said, is not only to cover the 47 million people who are uninsured but to improve the quality of health care and make insurance more affordable for those who already have it. 
 The goal of Mrs. Clinton's plan, to be outlined in a speech in Des Moines, is similar to that of the ill-fated plan that she and President Bill Clinton pushed in 1993 and 1994. 
 But advisers to Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat from New York, said Saturday that she would try to avoid the perception that she was advocating a bureaucratic, big-government solution. That perception, promoted by conservative Republicans and the insurance industry, sank the Clinton plan in 1994.
 In her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton routinely receives applause when she admits having made mistakes as first lady. ''I've tangled with this issue before, and I've got the scars to show for it,'' she said recently.
 Previewing her speech, Clinton aides said she would assert on Monday that there was a moral imperative to ensure that ''every single American has quality affordable health coverage,'' just as she contends there is an economic imperative to rein in costs.
 Phil Singer, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said Saturday that he could not provide details. But aides and advisers who spoke on condition on anonymity said that Mrs. Clinton would propose expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program as a step toward universal coverage. She has denounced President Bush's efforts to restrict eligibility and limit spending on the program.
 Clinton aides said her plan would preserve a large role for private insurance companies; would promote the use of health information technology and low-cost generic drugs; and would create a public-private institute to evaluate and compare drugs, devices and medical treatments. 
 Mrs. Clinton will not try to impose an overall limit on national health spending, the aides said. But she is prepared once again to do battle with insurance companies, which she has said ''spend tens of billions of dollars a year figuring out how not to cover people'' and ''how to cherry-pick the healthiest persons, and leave everyone else out in the cold.''
 Aides to Mrs. Clinton said her proposal would elaborate several ideas that she has floated this year. 
 They said, for example, that Mrs. Clinton would amplify a comment in March when she declared, ''We could require that every insurance company had to insure everybody, with no exclusion for pre-existing conditions.'' 
 On another occasion, she vowed, ''As president, I will end the practice of insurance company cherry-picking once and for all by allowing anyone who wants to join a plan to do so, and by prohibiting insurance companies from carving out benefits or charging higher rates to people with health problems.''
 Karen M. Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, the chief lobby for insurers, said they endorsed the goal of universal coverage. But Ms. Ignagni said that insurers denied only 3 percent of claims, and that many of those were for experimental procedures that employers did not cover.
 Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said, ''Some of Mrs. Clinton's proposals, while trying to make insurance more affordable for older, sicker people, could unintentionally drive up costs for young, healthy people and ultimately for everyone.''
 Mrs. Clinton's role as architect and champion of the plan to remake the nation's health care system in 1993 and 1994 is still hotly debated.
 In an essay posted Friday on the Web site of The American Prospect, Paul Starr, who was a senior adviser at the White House in 1993, said that Bill Clinton had ''settled on the basic model for reform'' before he took office. Mrs. Clinton's role was ''not to choose a policy, but to develop the one that the president had already adopted,'' said Mr. Starr, a Princeton professor and co-founder of The American Prospect, a liberal journal.
 But aides to Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, one of Mrs. Clinton's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, said she bore a large measure of responsibility for the fiasco. 
 She insisted on developing the 1993-94 plan under a veil of secrecy, refused to compromise on her vision of ''health care reform'' and threatened to demonize anyone who tried to block it, the Obama aides said.

HEADLINE: Bye, Bye B-School

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
MOST people who knew Gabriel Hammond at Johns Hopkins in the late 1990s could have predicted he would rise quickly on Wall Street. As a freshman, he traded stocks from his dorm room, making a $1,000 bet on Caterpillar. Soon after, he abandoned his childhood dream of becoming a lawyer and, upon graduation, joined Goldman Sachs as a stock analyst.
 Three years into his new job, Mr. Hammond noticed something. Very few of his young co-workers were taking a hiatus from Wall Street to go to business school, long considered an essential rung on the way to the top of the corporate ladder. 
 So he, too, decided to forgo an M.B.A.. Instead, he raised $5 million and started his own hedge fund, Alerian Capital Management, in 2004. The fund now manages $300 million out of offices in New York and Dallas, and Mr. Hammond, 28, enjoys seven-figure payouts. 
 Like other young people on the fast track, Mr. Hammond has run the numbers and figures that an M.B.A. is a waste of money and time -- time that could be spent making money. ''There's no way that I would consider it,'' he says. 
 As more Americans have become abundantly wealthy, young people are recalculating old assumptions about success. The flood of money into private equity and hedge funds over the last decade has made billionaires out of people like Kenneth Griffin, 38, chief executive of the Citadel Investment Group, and Eddie Lampert, 45, the hedge fund king who bought Sears and Kmart. These men are icons for the fast buck set -- particularly the mathematically gifted cohort of rising stars known as ''quants.'' Many college graduates who are bright enough to be top computer scientists or medical researchers are becoming traders instead, and they measure their status in dollars instead of titles.
 Many of the brightest don't covet a corner office at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley. Instead, they're happy to work at a little-known hedge fund run out of a two-room office in Greenwich, Conn., as long as they get a fat payday. The competition from alternative investment firms -- private equity and hedge funds in particular -- is driving up salaries of entry-level analysts at much larger banks. And top performers at the banks make so much money today that they don't want to take two years off for business school, even if it's a prestigious institution like the Wharton School or Harvard.
 The new ranks of traders and high-octane number crunchers on Wall Street are also a breed apart from celebrated long-term investors like Warren E. Buffett and investment banking gurus like Felix G. Rohatyn. What sets the new crowd apart is the need for speed and a thirst for instant riches. 
 ''With the growth of hedge funds, you're getting a lot of really smart people who are getting paid a lot very young,'' says Arjuna Rajasingham, 29, an analyst and a trader at a hedge fund in London. ''I know it's a bit of a short-term view, but it's hard to walk away from something that's going really well.''
 The shift has not gone unnoticed by administrators at some business schools. Richard Schmalensee, who was dean of the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management until June, chalked it up to the changing nature of money-making. In many banks and investment boutiques, traders with math and science backgrounds now contribute more to the bottom line than the white-shoed investment bankers who long presided over Wall Street. And traders tend to be less likely to go to business school.
 ''I don't think you will see M.B.A.'s less represented in executive suites, but you may see M.B.A.'s less represented in the lists of the world's richest people,'' Professor Schmalensee says.
 BUSINESS school has not fallen out of favor among the student population at large. The number of students who earned M.B.A.'s in 2005 was about 142,600, nearly twice the level in 1991. But as M.B.A.'s become more common, the degree seems to carry less prestige with people who land top-paying jobs in finance soon after college.
 And recent upheavals in the financial markets don't seem to be changing the thinking of these younger high-fliers and their employers. 
 Hedge fund managers are unlikely to punish their younger workers for any dip in returns this year, says Adam Zoia, managing partner at Glocap, a headhunter in New York. Management fees charged by funds -- typically 2 percent -- come in regardless of return levels and can more than cover large salaries for young employees at many funds.
 ''Most managers say, 'If I don't pony up a decent bonus, then I'm going to lose people,' '' Mr. Zoia says. ''It'd be short-sighted of them not to retain their good people.'' 
 At funds that manage $1 billion to $3 billion, people with just a few years of finance experience will make $337,000 this year, Mr. Zoia says, and those with five to nine years of experience will average $830,000, up 6 percent from last year. These estimates include analysts and researchers but not portfolio traders, who can make much more because they sometimes share in profits.
 Dozens of young people (mostly male) who want to be, or already are, successful traders said in interviews that they relished the challenge of their jobs, in addition to the lofty paychecks.
 But they also spoke as if a money-clock were ticking: many said they wanted to make as much money as fast as they could so that they could live in style later in life while doing less lucrative things like running a charity, working for the government, spending time with their families, or inventing new technologies. Some, of course, plan to stay in finance their entire careers, and they, too, are very focused on earning fat bonuses fast.
 ''The sales pitch of these private equity funds or these hedge funds is, 'Come here, and you'll make a million bucks in two years,' '' says Gregg R. Lemkau, 38, managing director and chief operating officer of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, who passed up business school to stay at Goldman in the early 1990s when that choice was more rare. 
 And because today there are more self-made millionaires -- and billionaires -- than ever before, 20-something traders seem bolder in their monetary ambitions. Business school often does not fit into these plans.
 ''If you want to make the most money in the shortest period of time, you can't be away from work for two years,'' says Vitaly Dukhon, 30, who recently left the Fortress Investment Group in New York to join another hedge fund. 
 While in college at Harvard, Mr. Dukhon thought he would go to business school in his mid-20s, but in his first job on the Treasury desk at Deutsche Bank, he realized that the smartest people just a few years his senior were staying put. ''I saw that people that had been working for 20 years did have M.B.A.'s, but people five to six years older than me were not going,'' he says. ''Going to business school is a way for people to try to open the door, to try to get into a company or hedge fund. But if you're already there, it doesn't make sense to go.''
 Mr. Hammond of Alerian noticed the same trend while he was an analyst at Goldman Sachs. His co-workers who went to business school either wanted to change careers, or they were not doing well in their current jobs, he says.
 Part of the shift comes as investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have changed their tune on business school. Instead of pushing all their young employees into M.B.A. programs, banks are telling the best ones to stay put. 
 ''We are the perfect training ground for people who want to have careers in finance,'' says Caitlin McLaughlin, director of campus recruiting for Citi, the former Citigroup. Just 15 years ago, Ms. McLaughlin estimates, 85 to 90 percent of Citi's analyst classes ended up attending business school. Now, she thinks that figure is closer to 50 percent.
 Samir Ahmad, 25, has worked at Citi since college. This summer, he was promoted to associate, an M.B.A.-level position, in the fixed-income, currencies and commodities division. Despite advice from his older brother that he should attend business school, Mr. Ahmad says he cannot see what he would gain to justify the time. ''If I were to spend two years at business school, I'd get an M.B.A. degree, but I think learning a different product or a different group here at Citi would be more valuable,'' he says.
 To be sure, business school can still be a valuable investment, especially for those who want to change careers. Most schools teach a well-rounded curriculum that exposes students to the full picture of the way the business world works. They are great places to make friends and connections that can help throughout a career. And the top business schools serve as a useful filtering system, placing a seal of approval on graduates that can help them find jobs. 
 ''Most banking -- and that includes private equity -- is about deals and about relationships,'' says Timothy Butler, director of M.B.A. career development programs at Harvard Business School. ''That will always be M.B.A. territory.''
 YET even some students at top schools like Harvard say the decision to go is tougher now than it likely was two decades ago. ''We all struggled with it,'' says Katie Shaw, 28, who is in her second year of business school there. ''It's not only, 'Where do I go to business school?' It's also, 'Do I go?' ''
 Ms. Shaw worked in private equity before business school and plans to return to a position in finance. In private equity, she says, an M.B.A. is valued because buying and selling companies involves relationships and company analysis skills. Still, most private equity firms used to require their young hires to leave to go to business school, and some are now letting talented ones keep working instead.
 Headhunters for hedge funds and private equity firms say hedge funds, in particular, do not value an M.B.A. ''I have some clients that will legitimately say, 'An M.B.A. means absolutely nothing to us,' '' says Tim Zack, principal of In-Site Search, a headhunting firm in Westport, Conn., that is a division of Chaves and Associates.
 Mr. Hammond of the Alerian hedge fund recently hired someone from Carnegie Mellon's business school because of that person's engineering talent, not the skills he learned in business school. While Mr. Hammond says he understands why his new employee went to business school to move into finance, he would look less favorably on someone in an M.B.A. program who had left finance to go to business school.
 If he were looking at someone who went to Harvard Business School after the two-year analyst program at Goldman, ''I'd be suspicious,'' he says. ''I'd be saying, 'What was it you were doing wrong that you couldn't get a promotion at Goldman or did not pursue an opportunity with a private equity or hedge fund?' ''
 When young people on Wall Street consider the benefits of business school, Mr. Hammond says, the upside no longer outweighs lost salaries and bonuses they would have earned. He calculates the cost of going to a two-year business school to be at least half a million dollars for the average bank employee -- $250,000 or more each year in lost salary, plus $50,000 a year in tuition and living expenses. For hedge fund employees, Mr. Hammond says, the number would be considerably higher. 
 The result, headhunters say, is that many of the best people in finance are no longer entering the M.B.A. pipeline. ''If someone is doing well at a hedge fund, they absolutely do not encourage their employees to go off to business school,'' says Mr. Zoia of Glocap. 
 Some young people are pursuing alternatives that can be completed without leaving their jobs. Some take the certified financial adviser tests or study part-time at night at schools like N.Y.U. that offer master's degrees in subjects like financial engineering. 
 ''There's a real shift in assumptions as to what is going to make you a better applicant or a prospect for a job,'' says Art Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company, noting that he had seen an increased interest in young people pursuing a degree as a certified financial adviser at night rather than leaving their jobs for an M.B.A. 
 At the banks, there has been a push in recent years to keep top performers around after their time as analysts, the most junior position, ends. ''Strong performers we want to keep at the firm for as long as possible,'' says Julie Kalish, 28, head of United States recruiting for Credit Suisse. ''The amount of analysts that we try to keep for the associate promotion process has grown over recent years.''
 Admissions officers at top business schools say finance firms always try to hold onto their best employees when the economy is good. They say interest from applicants working in finance is not declining and their graduates still land a large number of top finance jobs. What administrators at business schools do not know -- largely because their admissions and career placement offices are separate -- is whether their students with a finance background are staying in that industry. 
 Recruiters at banks say a large number of the students that they are hiring from business schools are from an international background or are changing careers. These students are valuable, they say, but they come in with a different background from someone who has been in finance since age 22.
 Jeffrey Talpins, chief investment officer at Element Capital Management, a small fixed-income hedge fund in New York, says he likes to hire people fresh out of school so he can teach them himself. Mr. Talpins attended Yale as an undergraduate but did not go to business school. If a young employee asked his advice on business school, he says, he would tell them not to go if they wanted to stay in finance. ''I'd say, 'You already have a great platform for a job in finance,' '' he says. ''If you're a superstar, and you're very good, you'll grow very rapidly in this field.''
 Eventually, these young people may want to raise money and start their own fund, suggests Thomas Caleel, director of admissions at Wharton, and that's where an M.B.A. and the connections that come with it could help. ''If you are trying to raise money for a hedge fund, you will need that network,'' he says.
 Mr. Talpins of Element said he had no trouble raising money for his hedge fund without an M.B.A. After all, he had a track record from Citi and Goldman Sachs to show to potential investors. In his corner of the world, where math equations are likely to be scrawled on white boards around the office and young people hold the purse strings to millions of dollars in investor money, it seems there is no point in going to business school just to punch a ticket.
 In 2005, Trader Monthly named Mr. Talpins one of the top 30 traders under 30. ''Youth is not wasted on this crop, any of whom could be a billionaire by 40,'' the magazine said. ''Or, then again, they could be belly up and bust.''
 Mr. Hammond of Alerian, who was featured on the magazine's list last year, said he has seen people go to hedge funds and get fired in six months ''because they couldn't hack it.''
 But he says the risk is worth it.
 ''If you look at the really successful hedge fund managers -- the Eddie Lamperts,'' he says, ''they're all in their 40s now. They were probably making only low single-digit millions in their 20s.
 ''That's why you do this,'' he continues. ''That's why it's so attractive, because the payoff of being the winner, the next Eddie Lampert,is so high.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about young workers in the financial industry deciding to forgo M.B.A. programs referred incorrectly to a designation that some of these workers are pursuing. It is C.F.A., for chartered financial analyst, not certified financial adviser. And while that designation requires study toward a series of examinations, it is not a degree program.

Zev Chafets is a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of 'A Match Made in Heaven: American Jews, Christian Zionists and One Man's Exploration of the Weird and Wonderful Judeo-Evangelical Alliance.''

 BODY:
When Lev Leviev's first son, Shalom, was born in 1978, Leviev decided to circumcise the baby himself. He was only 22 years old. He had never studied the art of circumcision and never performed one. But he had seen it done. His father, Avner, had been an underground mohel in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbek Republic, at a time when performing any Jewish ritual act could get you in trouble with the Soviet authorities. The family had been in Israel for eight years. There were plenty of trained ritual mohelim in Tel Aviv. But Leviev regarded the act of circumcising his own son as both a religious duty and the fulfillment of a family tradition.
 Avner Leviev advised his son to prepare by cutting chicken legs, but young Lev felt no need to practice. ''I knew what I was doing,'' he told me when I spoke to him recently at his office in Yahud, a suburb of Tel Aviv. ''I was a diamond cutter, after all. It's not all that different.'' He extended his hands, palms down, for my inspection and smiled. ''I've got steady hands.'' 
 In the years since he introduced his son into Israel's blood covenant with the almighty, Lev Leviev has performed more than a thousand ritual circumcisions -- many on the sons of employees in his ever-expanding business empire. In those years, Leviev has gone from impoverished immigrant to the man who broke the De Beers international diamond cartel. His companies build vast shopping malls, housing projects, highways and railways throughout Israel, the former Soviet Union and Western Europe. He owns everything from diamond mines in Angola to a string of 7-Elevens in Texas. Recently he has been buying up iconic American properties, including the former New York Times Building in Manhattan for a reported $525 million. 
 Lev Leviev is probably Israel's richest man. Forbes ranks him 210th among the world's wealthiest people, with an estimated personal net worth of $4.1 billion. (People close to Leviev put that figure closer to $8 billion.) However much Leviev has, he is hungry for more. His business role model is Bill Gates, whom he says he hopes to eventually join in what he calls, in Russian-accented Hebrew, ''the world's starting 10.''
 Leviev admires not only Gates's wealth but also his activist style of philanthropy. ''A lot of very rich men wait too long to give their money away,'' he told me. ''Warren Buffett, for example. He's in his 70s now, and he should have started earlier. But Bill Gates is a young man, and he's already giving to help the world. That's the right way to do it.''
 Leviev, who is 51, is a legendary philanthropist, too -- he refuses to say how much he gives away each year, but he did not dispute an estimate of $50 million. He does not share Gates's universalist outlook, however. Leviev is a tribal leader, a benefactor of Jewish causes, particularly in the former Soviet Union, where he underwrites Jewish day schools, synagogues, orphanages, social centers and soup kitchens for more than 500 communities. To make this vast philanthropic enterprise run, Leviev subsidizes an army of some 10,000 Jewish functionaries from Ukraine to Azerbaijan, including 300 rabbis. 
 Most of the 300 rabbis are Chabadniks, adherents of the Brooklyn-based Hasidic group Chabad -- fundamentalist, missionizing, worldly and centered on the personality and teachings of the late Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher rebbe. Chabad is anti-abortion, regards homosexuality as a sexual perversion and generally finds itself aligned with other fundamentalist religious groups on American domestic issues. In Israel, it has supported right-wing Greater Israel candidates. Most controversially, during Rebbe Schneerson's lifetime, Chabad entertained the notion that he might be the messiah; a vocal group in the community still does. (This led the ultrapious Rabbi Eliezer Shach to acidly define Chabad as the sect closest to Judaism.) 
 Lev Leviev's loyalty to Chabad is unquestioning. ''The rebbe is my role model, and my values are his values,'' he says. 
 Lev Leviev arrived in Israel as a teenager in 1971, at a time when Moshe Dayan, hero of the Six Day War, was the legendary embodiment of the Israeli WASP (Well-born/Ashkenazi/Secular/Paratrooper). Immigrants were classified by their potential to attain this ideal. The Leviev family -- unconnected, uneducated, not even real Russians but Bukharan Jews, primitives from the steppes of Central Asia -- were classified as ''bad material'' and dispatched by government authorities to the dusty ''development town'' of Kiryat Malachi. 
 Avner Leviev enrolled his son in a Chabad yeshiva. It was a match that didn't take. ''I'm not a born yeshiva scholar,'' Leviev admits. In Tashkent he had finished 10th grade. He left the yeshiva after a few months, ending his formal education. If Leviev regrets this, he doesn't show it. ''I just wanted to make money,'' he told me. 
 Through a family friend, Leviev found work as an apprentice diamond cutter. It was industry practice not to teach anyone all 11 steps of the diamond-cutting trade, but Leviev paid his fellow workers to show him every facet of the process. By the time he finished an undistinguished stint in the rabbinical corps of the army, he was ready to go into business for himself.
 ''I never doubted that I would get rich,'' Leviev told me. ''I knew from the time I was 6 that I was destined to be a millionaire. I'd go with my father to shops, and while he was talking business, my eyes automatically counted the merchandise.''
 Leviev chose a tough industry. ''The diamond business is usually a family business,'' says a Tel Aviv diamond merchant. ''People accumulate wealth slowly, over generations. When Leviev started out, all he had was an amazing amount of ambition and the ability to understand the stone. Understanding the stone -- that was the key.''
 The headquarters of Leviev's U.S. diamond company, LLD USA, is located at the mouth of the Manhattan diamond district, on the corner of 47th Street and Fifth Avenue. To get up to his office, you need to be both photographed and fingerprinted by a very high tech security system. 
 People who handle gems are cautious and security-conscious, and Leviev is no exception. Perhaps for that reason, many of his closest associates are relatives or longtime friends, most of them also Bukharan Jews. Paul Raps, the general manager of LLD USA, has known Leviev since they were both young diamond merchants in Ramat Gan. ''One day we were sitting there, just chatting, and suddenly Leviev said to me: 'You know what we need? We need to get our hands on the gelem.' Uncut diamonds. I thought he was kidding. Nobody could find uncut diamonds back then.''
 Before Leviev's epiphany, the world's diamond market was strictly regulated by De Beers, a company founded in the 19th century to mine its first shaft of diamond-bearing kimberlite. In 1930, De Beers established a cartel that over the next few decades came to dominate diamond mining in the Soviet Union, Africa and the rest of the world. It regulated the market through a system of ''sightholders,'' handpicked producers of rough diamonds and dealers of finished diamonds, who were allowed to buy quantities of unfinished diamonds at fixed prices, via De Beers.
 When Leviev started out, there were about 100 sightholders around the world. They came to London several times a year and, at syndicate headquarters, were offered diamonds on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Those who left it too often were decertified, and new sightholders were selected.
 Small diamond cutters and merchants like Leviev couldn't afford to buy from sightholders. They were allowed to buy rough diamonds from ''secondary dealers'' who managed to get their hands on small, smuggled quantities. It was a limiting arrangement, and Leviev didn't like limitations. He applied to become a De Beers sightholder.
 ''There was resistance to him at first,'' recalls the Tel Aviv diamond merchant, who knew Leviev at the time. ''A lot of people thought he was uncouth, not really civilized. This wasn't anti-Semitism. Most of the people who rejected him were European Jews themselves. Leviev was an outsider, a Bukharan. But he was so industrious, so ambitious, such a good businessman, that eventually they had no choice. They had to accept him.''
 Soon Leviev became a rising star in the De Beers syndicate. He brought his extended family into his business, leveraged their resources and prospered. But he chafed under the control of the syndicate.
 In the late '80s, Leviev saw an opportunity. De Beers had encountered antitrust problems in the United States. In South Africa, the apartheid government that had worked with De Beers was losing political power. At the same time, the Soviet Union, whose leaders had long had a mutually profitable partnership with De Beers, was nearing collapse.
 Leviev has a complicated relationship with his former homeland. In our first meeting, when I asked him about his boyhood memories, he surprised me by saying: ''Fear. I grew up in fear.''
 Tashkent is a Muslim city, and although there wasn't much overt anti-Jewish violence, there was a climate of mistrust. ''Many times I was beaten up in school,'' he recalls. But his biggest fear was of the Communist government.
 ''As a boy, they used to make us stand at attention and salute the statue of Lenin,'' he told me. ''I'd curse him and the other Communists under my breath. They sent my grandfather to Siberia. They wouldn't let us keep the Sabbath -- we had to go to school on Saturdays. Just being Jewish was dangerous.'' 
 Still, he saw business potential in Russia. He spoke the language, knew the local customs. His father, sensing danger, begged Leviev not to go. So Leviev traveled to Brooklyn, to the headquarters of the Lubavitcher rebbe, for a second opinion. 
 It is a meeting that has become folklore, both in Chabad and in the diamond industry. Leviev tells the story with obvious relish: ''I spoke to the rebbe in Hebrew. I asked him, Should I go or not? He answered me in a kind of antique Russian. He said: 'Go. Go to Russia and do business, but don't forget to help the Jews. Remember your family tradition.' ''
 This was more than good advice. The rebbe's blessing gave Leviev the keys to the Chabad network in the former Soviet Union at a very dangerous time.
 Officially, Leviev was invited by the Soviet minister of energy in 1989, which was exploring ways of ending the De Beers grip on the country's diamonds. ''When I got there, Gorbachev was still in power, but you could sense that things were coming apart,'' Leviev says. ''Everything was unsettled, and I felt the fear again.'' 
 There were other risks, too. To do business with the Russians, Leviev had to give up his position as a De Beers sightholder. This shook the international diamond business. ''It was unbelievable,'' says the Tel Aviv merchant. ''He was breaking the rules, going after the source. When he succeeded in Russia, and then in Angola, others saw it and were suddenly emboldened. That's how Leviev cracked the De Beers cartel. With the instincts of a tiger and the balls of a panther.''
 There's no need to cry for De Beers, which still controls a major share of the world's uncut diamonds. But the syndicate no longer sets the worldwide market value of diamonds or decides who can manufacture and sell them. 
 Neither can Leviev. But he has become the world's largest cutter and polisher of diamonds and one of its major sources of rough diamonds -- the gelem he dreamed of. 
 A key to his success is his vertical integration. He mines the diamonds in Angola, Namibia and Russia, cuts and polishes them, ships them and sells them, wholesale and retail. He has a string of high-end shops in Russia and a luxury boutique, Leviev, on Bond Street in London. Next month, Leviev is opening a store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, which, as the president of Leviev Jewelry, Thierry Chaunu, told a reporter, will cater to ''the young hedge-fund professional who just got his bonus.''
 One of Leviev's first moves in Russia was to set up a high-tech cutting and polishing plant. It provided jobs and, more important, showed the Russians how they could gain control of their own industry. In turn, the Russian government helped him gain a foothold in Africa. In 1997, Leviev bought into the Catoca diamond mine, Angola's largest, in a joint venture with the Russian state diamond company, Alrosa; a Brazilian partner; and the Angola state diamond company. Leviev soon established warm ties with the Angolan president, Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, who speaks fluent Russian from his days as an engineering student in the U.S.S.R.
 When Leviev arrived in Angola, Dos Santos was fighting a civil war against Unita rebels, who were financed by the sale of smuggled ''blood diamonds.'' Leviev had a suggestion: Why not create a company that would centralize control of all diamonds? The company that grew out of that idea was the Angola Selling Corporation, or Ascorp, jointly owned by the Angolan government, a Belgian partner and Leviev. While Leviev's plan took aim at the trade in conflict diamonds, critics say that Ascorp took advantage of mounting international pressure to establish and profit from a monopoly.
 Unita surrendered in 2002, after the death of its leader, Jonas Savimbi. By then, the Angolan government had effectively pushed De Beers out of the country, and Ascorp had generated great sums for the Dos Santos government (and, it is rumored, the Dos Santos family), created thousands of jobs for Angolans in newly established factories and mines and made Lev Leviev a vast fortune. None of this would have been possible without the Russian connection.
 On a shelf in Leviev's Ramat Gan office sits a framed photo of Vladimir Putin. Leviev describes him as a ''true friend.'' The offices of many Israeli business magnates feature photographic trophies, grab-and-grin shots with (in ascending order of importance) the prime minister of Israel, the president of the United States, Bill Clinton and A-list Hollywood stars. Leviev has a different collection. Aside from the Lubavitcher rebbe and Vladimir Putin, there are photos taken with the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Kazakhstan, for which he serves as honorary consul in Israel. (''Yes, I saw 'Borat' '' Leviev told me wearily. ''Yes, I thought it was funny. But silly.'') Leviev's picture gallery reflects his status as the president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in the former Soviet Union, an organization he has led since 1998. Nobody knows exactly how many Jews live in the former Soviet Union, but estimates range from 400,000 to upward of one million. Leviev leads them with his checkbook. 
 ''When it comes to contributing to the Jewish people, Lev Leviev is in a class by himself,'' says Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident and former Israeli deputy prime minster. ''I know a lot of rich people who give money. But Leviev is on a completely different level. He's building entire communities.''
 More than this, he is a power broker and intercessor on behalf of beleaguered Jews throughout the former U.S.S.R. Take, for instance, the case of the Jewish private schools in Baku, Azerbaijan. Three years ago the government, concerned about the influence of neighboring Iran and the spread of local madrassas, decided to close all the private schools in the country. This, of course, included the Jewish school in Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. The community elders petitioned the government, but to no avail.
 ''They even tried to get American Jewish organizations to intervene,'' Leviev recalled. ''But the Jewish organizations couldn't do a thing.'' He smiled thinly. He has a generally low opinion of American Jewish activists, especially his fellow billionaires.
 And so Leviev decided to ride to the rescue. He flew to Baku on his private plane, parked at the airport and went straight to the synagogue.
 ''The Jews were all gathered there,'' he recounted in what is obviously a favorite story. ''I told them to wait while I talked to the president.'' At the time, that was Heydar Aliyev. ''There were journalists in his outer office. Everyone was excited to see me there, because they thought I had come to invest money in the country. Heydar thought so, too. He said: 'Just tell me what you're interested in -- oil? Gas? Tourism? What can I do for you?'
 ''I asked him, 'How can I invest in a country that doesn't like Jews?' Heydar got very upset when I said that. He began telling me how many Jewish friends he had and how much the Jews had contributed to his culture and the country and so on.
 '' 'But you're closing down the Jewish school,' I told him. 'I've come to ask you to allow it to remain open. Right now the Jews of Baku are gathered in the synagogue, awaiting your answer.' ''
 Leviev paused at this point in the story. Dramatic tales of peril and salvation are part of the Chabad oral tradition.
 ''Heydar consulted his advisers,'' Leviev said. ''Then he returned to me and said: 'The school can remain open. All right?'
 ''I told him: 'Well, there's another problem. The Jewish institutions here are in bad shape. Can you arrange for me to acquire a plot of land to rebuild?'
 '' 'Yes,' said Heydar. 'Is that all?' 
 '' 'Not quite. I'd appreciate it if you would personally open the school next year. That way there will be no misunderstandings about what the government's position is.' 
 ''Heydar said: 'I'll do that. Are you satisfied now?'
 ''I told him: 'Just one last thing, sir. Those journalists in your outer office? Would you mind announcing our agreement to them?' ''
 After Aliyev's press conference, Leviev remembers returning triumphantly to the synagogue to deliver the good news. Shortly thereafter, Aliyev died and was succeeded by his son, with whom Leviev is on friendly terms.
 ''And did you invest after that?'' I asked.
 Leviev smiled. ''No,'' he said. ''Azerbaijan has so many natural resources they don't need my investment. But I told them that they would get a blessing from God.''
 Leviev insists that he maintains a strict division between his community leadership and his business dealings. Perhaps this is so, but the republics of the former Soviet Union are not famous for their transparency. At any rate, business depends to a large extent on personal and political access. ''A big part of our analytical value depends on the perception that we can get anything approved in Russia,'' says Jacques Zimmerman, the vice president for communications of Africa Israel, Leviev's international holding and investment company.
 This perception has been strengthened by public displays of affection between Putin and Leviev. In 2000, the Russian president was the guest of honor at the opening of the Jewish Community Center in the Marina Roscha district of Moscow, which Leviev played a major role in building. It was a gesture widely interpreted as a sign of good will not only toward Russia's Jews but toward Leviev himself.
 Putin also took Leviev's side in a dispute over the post of chief rabbi of Russia, backing Leviev's candidate, Berel Lazar, over Adolf Shayevich, who held the position. The Kremlin's endorsement of Lazar was a final confirmation that Leviev had achieved a typically audacious and improbable victory -- putting the fundamentalist Chabad in effective control of the assimilated, mostly irreligious Jewish communities of the former Soviet Union. 
 Lazar's selection has been quite controversial not only in Russia but also among Jewish groups in Israel and in the U.S. But Chabad is nothing if not practical, and they have taken a gradualist approach to winning over Russia's secular Jews. Schools enroll nonreligious students and offer them a full government curriculum, along with some beginner's Torah studies. Community centers hold coeducational social events. There are even mixed dances. 
 Such modernity comports with Leviev's personal style, which is, in its outward aspect, Chabad-lite. He once made headlines by closing his upscale mall in Ramat Aviv -- a bastion of WASP Israel -- on the Sabbath, and officially his businesses are closed on Saturday. But he maintains a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for his Israeli executives, some of whom hold unofficial meetings and phone sessions on the Sabbath. Abroad, some of the businesses Leviev owns an interest in work seven days a week, and his American 7-Elevens sell nonkosher food. Leviev himself strictly observes the Sabbath, but he has been known to interrupt his weekday prayers for important phone calls.
 Unlike many Chabad men, Leviev is clean-shaven, wears stylish business suits open at the collar and sometimes lounges in jeans, and his small black skullcap is barely visible. He is also something of a feminist. The women in his office, including his private secretaries, are allowed to wear slacks, a violation of strict Orthodox custom. Leviev's two eldest daughters have been brought into the business as senior executives. Zvia, a mother of four who runs international marketing and mall businesses for her father, is frequently mentioned in the Israeli press as a potential successor. Leviev is proud to have raised his nine children in B'nai B'rack, Tel Aviv's ultra-Orthodox suburb, but he is planning to move to an estate in Saviyon, the equivalent of going from Borough Park to Scarsdale.
 Leviev's pragmatism ends, however, at the vexing and fundamental question of who is a Jew. American Reform Judaism recognizes patrilineal descent. The State of Israel grants citizenship under the Law of Return to people with a single Jewish grandparent. But Leviev accepts only the Talmudic rule that a Jew is anyone born to a Jewish mother, or someone who has undergone an Orthodox conversion and agreed to keep all 613 Jewish laws.
 There are a great many people who regard themselves as Jews but do not meet these criteria. In Israel alone, there are an estimated 300,000 among Soviet immigrants, and perhaps more than that in the former Soviet Union. ''What do you do about all these people?'' I asked Leviev. ''Just write them off?''
 Leviev's answer: ''It's not a matter of what I do or what I want. I have no choice. The law is the law.''
 A few years ago, concerned Bukharan Jewish immigrants in New York reported to Leviev that their children were being corrupted by the public schools of Queens. ''The kids were going out with Pakistanis, Puerto Ricans, all sorts of people,'' I was told by one of Leviev's intimates. Leviev would have been equally horrified to learn that the Bukharan Jews of Queens were hooking up with descendants of the Mayflower.
 In response, Leviev donated the money for a private school in Elmhurst. He picks up the tuition tab for the entire student body -- about 800 kids at an estimated $18,000 a pop. Leviev regards this as a pilot project. His goal, I was told by his assistant, Shlomi Peles, is to make a free Orthodox Jewish education available to every Jewish child in United States.
 The educational project is just one part of Leviev's recent discovery of America. After 9/11, he and a partner bought the JP Morgan building near ground zero at a bargain price (a reported $100 million), converting it into luxury condominiums and clearing a very handsome profit. It made him a believer in New York.
 ''Every building is half a billion dollars,'' he told me. ''All you need is a global perspective. I knew New York would come back.''
 Jacques Zimmerman, who handles communications for Africa Israel, told me: ''Lev's natural tendency, his home court, is Israel and Russia. But he is constantly looking to expand.'' 
 The engine for this growth is Africa Israel. The company is publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and handles Leviev's businesses, not including privately held diamond interests. Leviev personally owns about 75 percent of Africa Israel, which was valued, in mid-July, at approximately $5 billion.
 According to Zimmerman, Africa Israel has made a ''strategic decision'' to think big. ''The work involved in large and small projects is about the same, so why not do big projects?'' In Moscow, Africa Israel is currently building a million-square-foot mall as well as another 750,000-square-foot mall that is entirely underground. It is the lead partner in a consortium that is building the subway in Tel Aviv. Africa Israel is active in China, India, the Philippines and Latin America as well.
 ''We're worldwide, but our emphasis is moving more and more to the United States,'' Zimmerman says. ''In the last six months, we've bought into more than a billion dollars' worth of projects in Manhattan, and that's going to grow.''
 Africa Israel's American holdings include not only the former New York Times Building but also a half-share of the Apthorp apartment building on the Upper West Side and the Clock Tower on Madison Avenue, 1,700 Fina gas stations around the country and development projects in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Phoenix. Recently the company announced it will be opening a giant Hard Rock amusement park in Myrtle Beach, S.C. 
 ''All you need to do business in America is a good name, and banks will lend you all the money you need,'' Leviev told me with enthusiasm.
 Israel is a society in which successful people are rarely praised. But I encountered very little criticism of Leviev there, even from members of the Jewish WASP business establishment. ''He's still an outsider,'' one high-powered Tel Aviv lawyer told me. ''We don't know anything about his personal life. But from what anyone can tell, he's clean. You read about him in the business pages of the newspaper, not the gossip columns.''
 One of Leviev's greatest admirers is Eitan Raff, chairman of Israel's Bank Leumi, from which Leviev bought Africa Israel in 1996. The sale was controversial at the time. ''He was a Russian,'' Raff says. ''We didn't know him or anything about him. We thought he might be some kind of oligarch. I hired two or three investigators to check him out. He came up clean.''
 There were a number of foreign suitors for Africa Israel, but after fighting broke out in Jerusalem between Israeli and Palestinian gunmen, they became skittish and withdrew, leaving Leviev as the sole bidder. The asking price was $400 million, and Bank Leumi had to sell; it had been ordered by a court to divest itself of nonfinancial holdings, including Africa Israel, by a certain date. Leviev had the bank over a barrel. ''What would you say to $330?'' Leviev asked Raff. 
 ''No, it's worth four, that's the fair price,'' Raff said.
 Leviev stuck out his hand, diamond-business style. ''Four,'' he said.
 ''He acted with great probity,'' Raff says. ''He didn't try to take advantage or squeeze. His word is his bond,'' he says. ''Look, I'm a kibbutznik. Leviev and I aren't from the same world at all. But I consider him a friend, and I think he's an example of what the head of a public company should be.'' Leviev's biggest public-relations problem is his association with Arkady Gaydamak, a mysterious Russian-Israeli billionaire of unsavory reputation, now under indictment in France for a variety of offenses, including gunrunning and money laundering. Gaydamak, who cuts a flamboyant figure and recently established his own political party in Israel, is reputed to have made his fortune selling arms in Angola in partnership with various European, Israeli and African military and government figures. 
 Leviev says he was first introduced to Gaydamak by the former Mossad chief Danny Yatom. They certainly knew each other. According to the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan journalism group based in Washington, Leviev and Gaydamak jointly acquired a metallurgy plant in Kazakhstan in 1999. A year later, Gaydamak bought a 15 percent share of Africa Israel, which he later sold. Leviev swears they are no longer partners, but the relationship has stained his reputation.
 Unlike Gaydamak, Leviev has thus far steered clear of Israeli politics. That doesn't mean he lacks influence, however. He meets from time to time with the nation's leaders, mostly to discuss the economy. He owns Israel's Russian-language television station, which reaches about 15 percent of the population. Despite his allegiance to Chabad, Leviev is considered a moderate. ''He's not one of the crazies,'' a former adviser to Ariel Sharon told me. ''Certainly not a Greater Israel man.''
 Leviev's global view is Moscow-centric and more than a little Machiavellian. He says he believes, for example, that America's difficulties in places like Iran, Syria and Venezuela come primarily from George W. Bush's failure to come to Russia's economic aid. ''If Bush had invested $100 million to help the Russian economy early in his first term, he'd have Putin's friendship,'' he says. ''Instead, Bush put the money into a war with Iraq, and he's been paying for it all over the world ever since.''
 The first time I spoke to Leviev, he denied that he had any personal political aspirations. Three days later, he wasn't so sure. ''Would I like to be prime minister?'' he mused. ''I might. When I turn 60.''
 That's nine years off. At Leviev's pace, nine years is a lot of time -- time enough to make his way into the Forbes ''starting 10,'' time to complete the Chabadization of Soviet Jewry and time, perhaps, to make a run at becoming Israel's first Russian-Bukharan-mohel-mogul prime minister.

HEADLINE: FHASecure: How Much Help?

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
WHEN President Bush announced plans late last month to help borrowers who were struggling to keep up with their adjustable-rate mortgages, local housing advocates and lenders waited eagerly for details of exactly how the initiative would work. 
 Now that the Federal Housing Administration has disclosed those details, the jury is still out. ''I think there's a subset of borrowers this will help,'' said Brian J. Chapelle, a partner in Potomac Partners in Washington, a consulting firm to the mortgage industry. ''Whether it's the 240,000 people the Bush administration said it would help, we'll have to see.''
 At the heart of the initiative is a new program, FHASecure, aimed at the millions of people who took out adjustable-rate mortgages in recent years. Many of these loans started out with low initial interest rates that increased sharply after two or three years.
 Often, mortgage companies lent money to those borrowers based on their ability to pay only the lower rate, and now millions of them are struggling to keep up with higher monthly payments.
 Among other things, the FHASecure program expands the agency's insurance program for lenders. In the past, the agency insured refinance loans for borrowers whose existing mortgages were not federally insured, provided the borrowers were not delinquent on their payments and the loans were below the F.H.A. limit of $362,000.
 Now, under the FHASecure program, the agency will insure refinanced mortgages on ARMs below the $362,000 limit even if borrowers are delinquent. The availability of federal insurance is expected to give lenders incentive to help borrowers refinance on more favorable terms.
 The catch: Borrowers must show they were keeping up with their mortgage payments and other household debts for the six months before the interest rates rose.
 That is raising questions among some housing and mortgage specialists in the New York area about how widely the new program will be used.
 Kisha J. Wright, the default counselor for the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit affordable-housing group in Hauppauge, N.Y., said many people with subprime ARMs fall behind on their payments even before the interest rates reset, because many such loans did not include escrow provisions for taxes, and inexperienced borrowers frequently overestimated their ability to cover that expense.
 Other provisions in the FHASecure program may disqualify other subprime ARM borrowers. For instance, many subprime lenders did not require borrowers to document their earnings, and those lenders also allowed borrowers to carry household debts totaling 50 percent or more of their gross income.
 Like all F.H.A.-insured loans, those offered in the FHASecure program require extensive documentation of borrowers' incomes and limit their monthly debts to 43 percent of gross income.
 Kim Neilson, the senior vice president at the McCue Mortgage Company in New Britain, Conn., which makes F.H.A. loans, said that the borrowers who will most benefit from FHASecure are those who would have qualified for conventional F.H.A. loans in the first place but were directed by unscrupulous loan officers into more expensive loans. 
 ''The good news is, there are many of them out there,'' Ms. Neilson said. ''And for those people, this will really help.''

HEADLINE: New York Subpoenas 5 Energy Companies

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has opened an investigation of five large energy companies, questioning whether their plans to build coal-fired power plants pose undisclosed financial risks that their investors should know about. 
 Mr. Cuomo, using the same state securities law wielded by his predecessor, Gov. Eliot Spitzer, to investigate corruption on Wall Street, sent subpoenas late Friday to the top executives of the five companies, seeking internal documents. 
 The companies, which have projects in various states, are AES Corporation, Dominion, Dynegy, Peabody Energy and Xcel Energy. 
 It is rare, if not unique, for a securities law to be used for an environmental purpose, in this case the fight against new coal-fired power plants. The plants' main emission, carbon dioxide, has been linked by scientists to global warming. 
 In letters accompanying the subpoenas, the attorney general's office asked whether investors received adequate information about the potential financial liabilities of carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate climate change. 
 ''Any one of the several new or likely regulatory initiatives for CO2 emissions from power plants -- including state carbon controls, E.P.A.'s regulations under the Clean Air Act, or the enactment of federal global warming legislation -- would add a significant cost to carbon-intensive coal generation,'' the letters said.
 They added, ''Selective disclosure of favorable information or omission of unfavorable information concerning climate change is misleading.''
 Mr. Cuomo's move represents a new tactic in an expanding campaign against some of the more than 100 coal-fired power plants currently under consideration. 
 The nationwide anti-coal effort is being directed by a coalition of environmental groups, shareholder activists and state officials in the Northeast and on the West Coast, including in New York and California. 
 In an interview, Mr. Cuomo said, ''The concept here is using the securities laws to investigate whether the economic risks of these plants are being disclosed -- the economic risks which are dovetailing with the environmental concerns.''
 Katherine Kennedy, a special deputy attorney general in the environmental protection bureau who worked for the Natural Resources Defense Council for 19 years, added that power plants produced about 30 percent of carbon emissions in the United States, so ''it seemed like a logical place to begin.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo said, ''It's a priority for us.''
 Two of the five companies disputed Mr. Cuomo's assertions. Representatives of the other companies postponed comment until they could examine the letters and subpoenas.
 The power plant investigation was the second last week in which Mr. Cuomo issued subpoenas under the Martin Act, a 1921 state securities law that predates the creation of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York law grants the attorney general broad powers to compel testimony and subpoena records. 
 Until Mr. Spitzer used the law as a weapon against corruption on Wall Street, it was obscure. In June, The Wall Street Journal's editorial page called for its repeal, arguing that ''it is a law that allows a prosecutor to punish, or even ruin, any financial company regardless of evidence or motive.''
 In the case of the five energy companies, Mr. Cuomo said, ''This is a very straightforward, consistent use of the act because it's about disclosure to investors.''
 For five years, environmentally oriented shareholder groups have been filing resolutions seeking similar disclosures -- including one with Peabody Energy -- said Dan Bakal, the director of electric power programs for Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of investors and environmental groups focused on the environmental impacts of corporate actions. 
 ''This ratchets up the pressure on companies to provide more information as the risks become more and more material,'' Mr. Bakal said. Peabody Energy, he added, had increased its disclosure somewhat following shareholders' requests. 
 Vic Svec, a spokesman for Peabody, said in an e-mail message yesterday that the company included climate change disclosures ''in multiple places'' in its public financial filings. 
 Mr. Svec also said the letter was inaccurate ''in claiming that we operate power plants.'' He said Peabody is a minority partner in a planned Illinois plant.
 Mr. Svec called the New York action ''outrageous,'' adding, ''The legal system was designed to protect -- not harass -- those such as Peabody who are providing clean energy solutions for America.''
 Representatives of Dynegy, Dominion and AES said the documents were under review.
 Xcel Energy is building a coal-fired plant in Colorado that was cited in the letter from the attorney general. 
 A company spokeswoman, Mary Sandok, said in an e-mailed statement: ''The plant under construction in Colorado is being built under an agreement we reached with national, state and local environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and Environmental Defense. Our financial disclosures are adequate.'' 
 Data from the federal Energy Information Administration shows that about half the country's electrical generation comes from coal. For the next two or three years, new capacity will be coming largely from natural gas. 
 But coal, which is now the cheapest fuel -- absent expensive technology, still in its experimental stage, to control carbon dioxide emissions -- is projected to be the dominant fuel for new electricity from 2009 onward.
 The fight against new coal-fired plants has been waged by environmental groups in tandem with their fight at the state, regional and national levels to cap emissions of greenhouse gases in all sectors of the economy.
 A group of 10 Northeastern states, including New York, is adopting a program that would cap emissions and allow trading of pollution allotments among projects in those states. 
 California already has developed rules, which are being copied by New York, Vermont and 10 other states, to reduce heat-trapping gases from passenger vehicles. Those rules were endorsed in a ruling by a federal district judge in Vermont last week -- in a case in which Mr. Cuomo's staff participated.
 But this is Mr. Cuomo's most significant foray into the arena of climate change since taking over in January from Mr. Spitzer, who was one of the most high-profile occupants of the attorney general's office. 
 Before he started, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged Mr. Spitzer's formidable shadow; a Cuomo campaign ad last year said his predecessor had left ''big shoes to fill'' and featured people holding up the foot-measuring scales used by shoe salesmen. This year, Mr. Cuomo, who is a former federal housing secretary and son of a former governor, has himself made waves nationwide. 
 He shined a harsh light on close ties between some universities and student lenders, and he is now expanding Mr. Spitzer's aggressive use of the Martin Act in new areas. 
 Mr. Cuomo's office said last week that the attorney general had also invoked the Martin Act and issued subpoenas in his investigation of the oversight of the state's $154 billion pension fund during the four-year tenure of Alan G. Hevesi as state comptroller.

HEADLINE: Riding the High-Speed Rail

 BODY:
Transportation has been a hot subject recently in Albany. ''Troopergate,'' the brouhaha over whether Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration misused the State Police to smear a political opponent, has a big transport angle. The governor's staff members were trying to get state troopers to release the travel logs of State Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader. Those logs made it clear that Mr. Bruno was often using state helicopters and cars to travel to Republican fund-raisers.
 At the same time, the state's lobbying commission accused a businessman of improperly allowing Mr. Bruno to use his private plane and helicopter. The same businessman lathered Mr. Bruno with campaign contributions, and was associated with a firm that got $500,000 in state grants, courtesy of Mr. Bruno. 
 Sometime during all the back and forth in this transportation-focused summer, Mr. Bruno acknowledged that he had resorted to taking the train. One trip he took between Albany and New York City was longer and slower than scheduled, no surprise for anybody who travels that route routinely. But the delay and the political background noise apparently prompted Mr. Bruno to enthusiastically reaffirm his call for more high speed-rail in the state.
 The senator's people are quick to insist that there is absolutely no connection between his personal travel needs and his legislative agenda. That is fine. However he arrived at his position, he is promoting good public policy -- a high-speed, reliable rail system that can only help the state economy and its traveling public. 
 Like almost every other heavily populated place in the country, New York has a traffic problem that is getting worse by the rush hour. The cost of gas is painful, and the pollution from cars and trucks is unhealthful and bad for the planet. Rail lines are the most promising solution to the nation's transportation problem. Freight trains could take trucks off the highways, and passenger trains could reduce the number of cars. 
 The federal government spends most of its transportation money on automobile travel. Airplane traffic has been getting a healthy share of federal money since Sept. 11. But rail? It gets budget dust at best. A measly 4 percent of Washington's transportation budget goes to the railroads. 
 New York is a state that could benefit mightily from more focus on rails. One problem in Albany may be that, given their chilly relations these days, Governor Spitzer and Senator Bruno are not working cooperatively enough on a goal they share. They recently sent out separate press releases to announce the same $22 million in transportation initiatives. 
 Mr. Bruno's announcement focused on small projects for Albany, the town of Hudson and the rocky slope around the George Washington Bridge. The governor's announcement emphasized the creation of a new transportation working group, and an important effort to untangle the way different freight and rail carriers use the busy tracks between New York City and Albany.
 These are all good ideas, but there is an even better way for the Legislature to help New York's railroads become more dependable and faster. More lawmakers should abandon their cars and S.U.V.'s and take the train. Only about a dozen legislators regularly travel by rail to the state capital. Just as Mr. Bruno's experience helped fuel his support of high-speed railroads, a few more Amtrak tickets might finally get the rest of the Legislature on the right track.

HEADLINE: Somebody Else's Mess

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
George W. Bush delivered his farewell address on Thursday evening -- handing the baton, and probably the next election, to the Democrats.
 Why do I say that? Because in his speech to the nation the president basically said that on the most important, indeed only, legacy issue left in his presidency, Iraq, there would be no change in policy -- that a substantial number of U.S. troops would remain in Iraq ''beyond my presidency.'' Therefore, it will be up to his successor to end the war he started. 
 ''In one fell swoop George Bush abdicated to Petraeus, Maliki and the Democrats,'' said David Rothkopf, visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment, referring to Gen. David Petraeus and the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. ''Bush left it to Petraeus to handle the war, Maliki to handle our timetable and therefore our checkbook, and the Democrats to ultimately figure out how to end this.'' 
 The sad thing for the American people is that we have no commander in chief anymore, framing our real situation and options. The president's description on Thursday of the stakes in Iraq was delusional. An Iraqi ally fighting for ''freedom'' against ''extremists''? There are extremists in the Iraqi government, army and police. There is a civil war on top of tribal, neighborhood and jihadist wars, fueled not by a single Iraqi quest for freedom, but by differing quests for ''justice,'' revenge and, yes, democracy. The only possible self-sustaining outcome in the near term is some form of radical federalism.
 We also do not have a commander in chief weighing the costs of staying in Iraq indefinitely against America's other interests at home and abroad. When General Petraeus honestly averred that he could not say whether pursuing the surge in Iraq would make America safer, he underscored how much the war there has become disconnected from every conceivable worthy goal -- democratization of Iraq or spreading progressive governance in the Arab-Muslim world -- and is now just about itself and abstractions of ''winning'' or ''not failing.''
 That is why I thought the most relevant comments from the Petraeus hearings last week were those offered by the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Ike Skelton, when he said at the outset:
 ''We must begin by considering the overall security of this nation. It's our responsibility here in Congress under the Constitution to ensure that the United States military can deter and if needed prevail anywhere our interests are threatened. Iraq is an important piece of the overall equation, but it is only a piece. There are very real trade-offs when you send 160,000 of our men and women in uniform to Iraq. Those troops in Iraq are not available for other missions.''
 While Mr. Bush's tacit resignation last week greatly increases the odds of a Democratic victory in 2008, there are several wild cards that could change things: a miraculous turnaround in Iraq (unlikely, but you can always hope), a terrorist attack in America, a coup in Pakistan that puts loose nukes in the hands of Islamist radicals, or a recession induced by the meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market, which forces a stark choice between bailing out Baghdad or Chicago. 
 The first three, for sure, could propel the right Republican candidate right back into the thick of things -- especially if the Democrats have not positioned themselves with a credible approach to Iraq and the wider national security issues facing the country.
 There is an opportunity now for Democrats, and Americans will be listening -- but they need to articulate a concrete endgame policy, and it would have to include at least three components:
 First, a detailed blueprint with a fixed withdrawal date tied to a negotiation with Iraqi factions on a federal solution tied to a military redeployment plan to contain the inevitable spillover from Iraq.
 Second, a commitment by the next president to impose a stiff tariff on all imported crude oil, to make sure we become less dependent on what is sure to be a more unstable Middle East as we leave Iraq. And third, a plan to deal with the broader terrorist challenge. Set a date. Set a price. That will get people's attention.
 Democratic candidates have been talking about health care and other important issues, but the overriding foreign policy message that still comes across from them to many Americans, argues Mr. Rothkopf, is that Democrats are simply ''anti-Bush, antiwar and antitrade.'' Be careful: despite the mess Mr. Bush has made in the world, or maybe because of it, Americans will not hand the keys to a Democrat who does not convey a ''gut'' credibility on national security.

HEADLINE: The Search for Sand Is No Day at the Beach

BYLINE: BY CHARLES PASSY

 BODY:
IT is arguably America's best-known stretch of beaches, a playground populated by tightly toned models and sunburned tourists alike. But South Florida's shoreline is becoming known for something far more ominous: the sand shortage that is threatening to reshape all of the nation's coasts. 
 Blame it on global warming or just the vagaries of nature. Whatever the cause, the reality is forcing coastal communities to re-evaluate how they're going to keep their beaches wide and welcoming. In the process, they're looking at a combination of creative and practical solutions, from recycling glass bottles into sand to buying their beaches (or, at least, their sand) from the Bahamas or other sources.
What's at stake? Nothing less than the economic survival of the shores, say tourism and government officials. 
 ''When people are expecting to have a beach experience and our beaches are eroded, it's unsettling to them and it's bad business for us,'' said Nikki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau.
 South Florida is at the center of this sandstorm since it's faced with the ultimate dilemma: not only is it one of the country's most popular beach areas -- Ms. Grossman notes that more than 10 million visitors make their way annually to her locale -- it's also one of the most imperiled. There is, to put it simply, no longer a decent supply of offshore sand for the beach renourishment programs that have become as much a fact of life in this sun-worshiper's paradise as highway maintenance. 
 ''We're basically out of sand at this point,'' said Brian Flynn, a special projects administrator at the Miami-Dade County Department of Environmental Resources Management. He was referring to the close-to-the-coastline areas that have been dredged in years past and that represent the simplest, most affordable option when it comes to sand replacement. Much of what's left at this point is in protected areas with reefs. 
 But if South Florida is an extreme example, it's not an isolated one. There's barely a beach community in the United States that hasn't grappled with erosion at some point. This past summer alone has seen the issue arise everywhere from Galveston, Tex. (a proposed resort is prompting concerns about the effect it will have on beaches), to Long Island (among the most recent causes of beach erosion was an April northeaster). And even communities that have replenished their beaches have learned a lesson or two: at Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, a renourishment program had beachgoers complaining that there was too much gravel mixed with the sand. As a local newspaper summed up the situation in a headline: ''Sand Turns Rocky Horror.''
 Erosion is, of course, nothing new. By their very nature, beaches are temporal things, coastal experts explain. Sand will shift in different directions -- along the East Coast, it typically moves southward -- building up beaches in one spot, shrinking them in another. Storms can accelerate the process. As one prominent Florida newspaper columnist, Mike Thomas of The Orlando Sentinel, said: ''The state is a submarine that submerges and surfaces with sea-level changes.''
 But in Florida and elsewhere, the real problem comes with development. When coastal communities emerge and expand, residents and visitors expect the beaches to remain intact. ''Then you're forced to defend them,'' said Stephen Higgins, the beach erosion administrator for Broward County, which encompasses Fort Lauderdale and beach towns to the north and south of it.
 It's not just development on the shore. Boating plays a role as well, since it requires the dredging of channels, which interrupt the flow of sand. That's why South Florida's most critical areas of erosion are south of Port Everglades, one of the country's busiest cruise terminals: the sand shifting from the north can't make it past the deeply cut waterway. 
 Global warming also rears its ugly head. As environmentalists often note, a hotter planet means rising sea levels. And rising sea levels mean less sand.
 Put it all together and experts say coastal communities can no longer afford to take their beaches for granted. ''We now have to manage our beaches like we manage our cities,'' said Kate Gooderham, executive director of the American Shore & Beach Preservation Association, based in Fort Myers, Fla.
 For communities, that means making beach renourishment a scheduled maintenance item in cycles of every few years. But in South Florida, regular replenishment can't happen without available sand. That's where those creative solutions come into play. One is to engineer ways to recapture sand that gets lost in those deep inlets. Another is to find sand from sources even farther offshore -- namely, elsewhere in Florida or the Bahamas, though federal law currently prohibits importing foreign sand. (To go any greater distance, or to purchase sand from inland sources such as quarries, makes less sense since the cost of shipping and getting the sand on the beach becomes prohibitive.)
 Some solutions involve controversy. Something like class warfare ensued when the Army Corps of Engineers, which handles most beach renourishment projects throughout the country, looked at the possibility of taking offshore sand from St. Lucie County, a mainly middle-class area about 100 miles south of the Kennedy Space Center, and bringing it to Miami Beach. The president of the Florida Senate, Ken Pruitt, a Republican from Port St. Lucie, labeled it ''almost a criminal act.'' The Army plan was eventually dropped.
 Finally, there's an even more bizarre option, at least to those who think of sand as something natural. That is, make it from scratch. 
 Broward County, which completed a $44.5 million renourishment project in 2006, is considering using recycled glass bottles (since, after all, glass is made from sand). More than $500,000 is being committed to testing the idea, exploring everything from the response of beachgoers to the ability of sea turtles to nest in it. But even if the glass idea works, the issue comes down to a matter of money, according to Mr. Higgins, the erosion administrator. Turning glass back into sand requires millions of dollars in equipment and processing. If the cost proves too ''outrageous,'' Mr. Higgins said, then ''we will have to import our sand.''
 But Broward is unusual in that its local government is often willing to front those millions, then hope for some reimbursement from the federal government. (Typically, Washington picks up 65 percent of the cost of beach projects.) With other coastal communities, it's a matter of securing the federal funds first, a process that can drag out for years. 
 And those funds are becoming harder to get, say government officials and beach advocates. Washington currently commits about $120 million to beach renourishment, according to the shore and beach association, which argues that the number should be as much as twice that. The shortfall can be attributed in part to the fact that beaches are often seen as state and local resources. What federal money is committed to beach restoration is done so with an eye more on storm-damage mitigation -- the larger the beach, the more of a buffer it provides -- than on the economic engine of tourism.
 It's a philosophy that has cut across party lines, going back to the Clinton administration and continuing through the current Bush one, said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat. He is a member of the Congressional Coastal Caucus, and his district includes those Asbury Park beaches made famous by Bruce Springsteen. ''In the same way we look at our national parks as a national treasure,'' he said, ''we should look at our beaches as a national treasure.''
 It's an argument that Ms. Grossman, the South Florida tourism booster, will certainly buy. ''We say you have to think outside the sandbox,'' she said.

HEADLINE: No Blowing Smoke: Poppies Fade in Southeast Asia

BYLINE: BY THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
THE enduring image of Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle is of brightly colored poppy fields, opium-smoking hill tribes and heroin labs hidden in the jungle. 
 But the reality is that after years of producing the lion's share of the world's opium, the Golden Triangle is now only a bit player in the global heroin trade.
''The mystique may remain, and the geography will be celebrated in the future by novelists,'' said Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. ''But from our vantage point, we see a region that is rapidly moving toward an opium-free status.''
 The decline of the Golden Triangle is a major, if little noticed, milestone in the war on drugs. The question now is whether that success can be sustained. 
 Three decades ago, the northernmost reaches of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar produced more than 70 percent of all the opium sold worldwide, most of which was refined into heroin. Today the area produces about 5 percent of the world total, says Mr. Costa's agency.
 What happened? 
 Economic pressure from China, crackdowns on opium farmers , and a switch by criminal syndicates to methamphetamine production, appear to have had the biggest impact. At the same time, some insurgent groups that once were financed with drug money now say they are urging farmers to eradicate their poppy fields.
 As a result, the Golden Triangle has been eclipsed by the Golden Crescent -- the poppy-growing area in and around Afghanistan that is now the source of an estimated 92 percent of the world's opium, according to the United Nations. 
 Much of the growth in opium production there is in areas controlled by the Taliban, which United States officials say uses revenue from opium and heroin to finance itself. This shift to Afghanistan has had major consequences for the global heroin market: a near doubling of opium production worldwide in less than two decades. Poppies grown in the fertile valleys of southern Afghanistan yield on average four times more opium than those grown in upland Southeast Asia. 
 A striking aspect of the decline of the Golden Triangle is the role China has played in pressing opium-growing regions to eradicate poppy crops. A major market for Golden Triangle heroin, China has seen a spike in addicts and H.I.V. infections from contaminated needles.
 The area of Myanmar along the Chinese border, which once produced about 30 percent of the country's opium, was declared opium-free last year by the United Nations. Local authorities, who are from the Wa tribe and are autonomous from Myanmar's central government, have banned poppy cultivation and welcomed Chinese investment in rubber, sugar cane and tea plantations, casinos and other businesses.
 ''China has had an underestimated role,'' said Martin Jelsma, a Dutch researcher who has written extensively on the illicit drug trade in Asia.
 ''Their main leverage is economic: These border areas of Burma are by now economically much more connected to China than the rest of Burma,'' he said, using the former name for Myanmar. ''For local authorities it's quite clear that, for any investments they want to attract, cooperation with China is a necessity.''
 Myanmar remains the world's second-leading source of opium but is a distant second; its production declined by 80 percent over the last decade.
 Insurgents have long used opium to help finance civil wars in the Golden Triangle. But some are now working to destroy the crop. At least one faction of the Shan State Army, a group that long had ties to the heroin business, says it is leading eradication efforts.
 Kon Jern, a military commander for the group, which is based along Myanmar's border with northern Thailand, says he is cracking down because government militias and corrupt officials profit from opium. ''They sell the drugs, they buy weapons, and they use those weapons to attack us,'' he said.
 The United Nations credits Myanmar's central government with leading the eradication effort in Shan areas. In Laos, where the political situation is more stable, the government began a crackdown in the 1990s to increase its international credibility and because officials realized their own children were at risk, said Leik Boonwaat, the representative in Laos for the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime. Laos finally outlawed opium in 1996. 
 The government, Mr. Boonwaat said, also saw that opium did little to help poor farmers who grew poppies. ''It's mostly the organized crime syndicates that made most of the profits,'' he said.
 The amount of land cultivated in Laos for opium has fallen 94 percent since 1998. The country now produces so little opium that it may now be a net importer of the drug, the United Nations says.
 Yet experts warn that the reductions may not hold unless farmers develop other ways to make a living. 
 Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, an opium specialist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, says it took Thailand 30 years to wean opium farmers from poppy production, a transition led by the Thai royal family, which encouraged opium-growing hill tribes to use their cooler climate to produce coffee, macadamia nuts and green vegetables.
 But, he said, ''In Laos and Burma, we've had a very quick decrease.'' He asked, ''Is it going to last?''
 Four years ago farmers in Banna Sala, an isolated Laotian hamlet of several hundred ethnic Hmong, grew opium poppies with impunity. No longer. And some farmers are angry.
 ''They stopped me from growing opium, so I don't have money to send my children to school,'' said one villager, Jeryeh Singya, 34, who has seven children. She once bartered the opium she grew for soap, salt and clothing. ''If they let me grow it I would,'' she said.
 Mr. Kon, the rebel commander in Myanmar, says farmers are finding it difficult to switch crops. ''If they change and grow other kinds of plants nobody comes to buy their products -- the transportation is not good,'' he said.
 Experts say that to stay free of opium, isolated villages that depended on it will need assistance and investment for better roads, schools and clinics.
 But Myanmar, which is run by a military junta, poses a dilemma for Western countries. The United States has an embargo on trade with Myanmar. The European Union has suspended trade privileges and defense cooperation, limiting its aid to humanitarian assistance.
 ''This policy of boycott and isolation has, of course, meant that only very little development aid and humanitarian assistance is flowing into the country,'' said Mr. Jelsma, the Dutch expert on drugs. ''That makes the chances of the sustainability of this decline very questionable.''

 Behind the News By choice or out of necessity, the number of people 65 to 74 who were working or looking for work rose to one in four in 2006 from one in five in 2000. ''People are living longer and they need more resources,'' said Yung-Ping Chen, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. South Dakota had the highest percentage; West Virginia, the lowest.

HEADLINE: Being Rachel Zoe

BYLINE: By LYNN HIRSCHBERG. 
Lynn Hirschberg is editor at large for the magazine. Her last article was about the music producer Rick Rubin.

 BODY:
It was pouring rain in Paris in early July, and Rachel Zoe was late for the 11:30 a.m. Chanel haute couture presentation. ''Oh, I shouldn't say who my favorite is,'' Zoe told me the day before the show. ''So many of the designers are my friends. They all want to get their clothes on my clients.'' Still, for Zoe, a Hollywood stylist who has dressed stars like Lindsay Lohan, Cameron Diaz and Keira Knightley, Chanel's red-carpet ball gowns would have been a top priority of the couture calendar. And yet there she was, stuck in traffic in her chauffeured Mercedes sedan, an hour away from the Chanel show, which was to be held at a former palace in St.-Cloud, a suburb of Paris. 
 As always, Zoe (pronounced ZOH) was dressed for the designer she was viewing. She was wearing a bright pink nubby wool Chanel jacket, black pants and her usual five-inch platform open-toed shoes. All the Zoe trademarks were in place: she was very tan; her long blond hair was carefully styled to look carefree; there were ropes of gold chains around her neck and stacks of diamond bangles on her wrists; and enormous (Chanel) sunglasses nearly obscured her face. Even wearing high heels, she is short and stick-thin, but Zoe, who is 36, does not seem fragile. The masses of jewelry, the outsize sunglasses, the whole noisy, '70s-inspired look add up to a hectic, ostentatious, theatrical sort of glamour.
 It's the look she has duplicated on her clients, making the so-called Zoe-bots paparazzi favorites, as well as walking advertisements for a host of top designers. A cross-pollinator of the worlds of Hollywood celebrities, high fashion and tabloid magazines, Zoe has become a powerful image broker, a conduit to the ever-more lucrative intersection of commerce, style and fame. Early in her career, in 1996, she worked as a stylist at YM magazine, dressing such teenage pop stars as Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, girls who were young enough to be molded and popular enough to be influential. Around the same time, magazines like Us Weekly began inventing their own cadre of celebrities, like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. They had no discernible accomplishments or talent, but they did seem to go out a lot, and they thrived under the flash of the paparazzi. Magazines like Us constructed provocative narratives around them -- their romantic woes, their drug problems -- and Zoe, who began working with Richie in 2003 when she was viewed only as Hilton's plump sidekick, saw an opportunity. ''Nicole is now what people refer to as the big thing that happened,'' Zoe told me in Paris. ''Everything went from nowhere to everywhere. Nicole was about creating a look. Because of her fashion sense, which was really my fashion sense, she became famous. It was a huge moment: Nicole became a style icon without being a star.''
 And then Nicole became a star, too. Because of circumstances that remain murky, Nicole and Rachel no longer speak. But the relationship made their careers. Zoe began working with Lindsay Lohan, Kate Beckinsale and other tabloid-ready stars eager for a new fashion identity. Now she has 20 clients, each of whom reportedly pays her more than $6,000 a day to dress them for events, big and small. Some pay only for premieres and award shows; some also retain Zoe to provide clothes for their daily lives. The financial scope of her business also includes incentives in the form of money and/or clothes, accessories or jewels, offered by designers eager to dress a particular Zoe client for a particular event. ''Around three years ago, everything began to change,'' Zoe said as she ran through puddles toward the entrance of the Chanel show. ''The nature of what, or who, is a celebrity has expanded. We aren't saving lives here, but we are creating images, and images create opportunities in a lot of areas.''
 Normally Chanel refuses entry to latecomers, but Zoe was allowed into the show. Three publicists cooed over Zoe's appearance as she quickly kissed them hello on both cheeks and rushed past to her seat in the front row. The models were already walking down the muddy runway when Zoe took out her digital camera and began snapping shots of the dresses. There were many potential choices for her clients. A ruffled black chiffon flapper style gown might be perfect for Jennifer Garner; a more restrained, narrow sequined sheath might suit Keira Knightley.
 Although Lohan is a fan of Chanel, Zoe was not looking for clothes for her (Lohan was in rehab). Unlike Richie, who became famous for being famous, Lohan is actually a very good actress. But since her association with Zoe in 2004, her life in the tabloids and her style obsessions have eclipsed her talent. ''For an entire year, Lindsay wanted to wear three different looks a night,'' Zoe told me earlier. ''We were changing in cars, in bathrooms. I would have to bring two assistants with me so we could exchange the clothes, shoes, bags and jewelry, because what am I going to do with the clothes when she takes them off? You can't just leave diamonds in the car! But do you know how many designers she hooked up? When Lindsay would wear Chanel, it would sell out in four hours.''
 Lohan may have moved merchandise, but she seems to have simultaneously stopped attracting audiences to her films. Exposure in magazines like Us Weekly and In Touch, which Zoe seems almost to guarantee, promises a huge but very particular kind of fame. While, say, Jennifer Aniston has sold endless magazines, all those eager readers have been less quick to buy tickets to her movies. Only ''The Break-Up,'' which neatly mirrored the tabloid narrative of her life, was popular. And yet, if mass stardom of the self is your goal, there is no quicker path than the tabloids. 
 Zoe's job -- her innovation in the business -- was to maximize the fashion component of the Hollywood-equals-celebrity equation. And for Zoe, fashion means the red carpet. Movies don't necessarily depict a glamorous existence, but the red carpet has the gloss of perfection. When images of the girl and her gown are beamed around the globe, the dress, the bag, the shoes instantly become coveted symbols of a dream world. ''The power of it all blows my mind every day,'' Zoe said as the Chanel show ended. ''Anna Wintour is one of my heroes, but they say that I'm more influential. As great as it is, Vogue won't change a designer's business. But if an unknown brand is worn by a certain person in a tabloid, it will be the biggest designer within a week. When I worked with Nicole, there were things that she wore that designers had to remake for another season because there was such demand.''
 Zoe was interrupted by two carefully groomed publicists in head-to-toe Chanel. They were concerned that Zoe had not seen every look in the show. Zoe promised to come to the showroom. She checked her BlackBerry and called her driver to find out his location. ''I'm exhausted,'' she said, to no one in particular. ''My problem is, I kind of want to do everything. I was up until 4 a.m. checking on things in L.A. I have the fashion world, the Hollywood world, the creative world, and then I have the Rachel Zoe world. I have to deal with all of it.''
 On a gray day in Paris, Zoe was having lunch at the Bristol, where she was staying with her husband, Rodger Berman, who was once an investment banker and now produces award shows for television. ''I love Paris,'' Zoe said as she studied the menu. ''If I spoke the language, I'd live here.'' She looked up at the waitress, who had appeared at the table. ''Can you do crudite?'' Zoe said. The waitress looked confused. ''You did it yesterday. With cucumber. If not, I guess a salad, no dressing.'' The waitress still looked confused. ''You see,'' Zoe said to me, ''there's just too much of a communication barrier.'' Zoe took a sip of her English Breakfast tea. ''I wish caffeine had vitamins in it,'' she said.
 At times, Zoe, who was wearing a neon yellow patent leather Courreges jacket from the '60s, can seem like a dizzy character in a backstage musical. She seems to alternate between playing the madcap heiress (complete with costume) and the wisecracking best friend. But in both guises, her intense determination and ambition become almost immediately apparent. Zoe is, in many ways, her own best client. 
 ''In the last few years, stylists have become a dominant part of the business,'' says Meredith O'Sullivan, a publicist who represents the actresses Jessica Biel and Rosario Dawson, among others. ''And Rachel is a large part of the reason. Having a stylist is now a necessary element in any publicity or marketing campaign. As soon as I sign a girl, I insist that she get a stylist.''
 The economics of the stylist have significantly affected the movie business. A stylist's fee, which can range from $4,000 to $6,000 a day plus the cost of assistants, is usually paid by the studio that is distributing the star's film. Zoe, like most stylists, has an agent who negotiates with the publicity department of the movie company or, in the case of TV, the network. ''It's such a racket,'' said one head of publicity at a major studio, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of angering any actresses who work with Zoe or other top stylists. ''During awards season, when you are nominated or presenting an award, then it makes sense to have a stylist. But now, B- and C-list stars are demanding stylists for everything. The level of insanity is very high. But the bottom line is, if you don't give them what they want, the actresses say they won't do any press, that they won't appear at the premiere. Sometimes I feel like saying, How difficult is it to just go out and buy a dress?''
 Horror stories are rampant: last year, for instance, Nicole Kidman demanded upward of $100,000 for her stylist, makeup artist and hair person to be flown by private plane to the Rome Film Festival for the premiere of ''Fur,'' a low-budget, independent film about the photographer Diane Arbus. The studio, Picturehouse, decided not to pay for Kidman's team for the New York premiere of the film. She, in turn, decided not to turn up. ''It was cheaper for us if she didn't support the film,'' said an executive familiar with the marketing for ''Fur.'' ''We should all come back in our next life as stylists.''
 While stylists, including Zoe, never say they aim for the tabloids, all are concerned with coverage in those pages, because that is where the clothes are seen by the largest number of interested readers. Nicole Kidman may be leagues away from Nicole Richie, in both talent and prestige, but she is keenly aware of the fashion pop of the tabloids. And her exposure (created with the help of her stylist, L'Wren Scott) is carefully choreographed. Kidman's last few films have disappeared quickly, but her Chanel ad was a hit. What Kidman wears still sells. 
 The fashion choices made by a stylist like Zoe are usually safe and often geared to their commercial possibilities. Today actresses tend to look appropriate and boring. Gone are the days when Cher would don a beaded headdress for the Academy Awards or Jane Fonda would accept her Oscar in an off-the-rack pantsuit. True, the eclecticism of awards-show dressing started to die well before Zoe. In 1989, Wanda McDaniel, who is married to the Oscar-winning producer Al Ruddy, went to work for Giorgio Armani and began dressing stars like Jodie Foster (Armani still dresses her) and Julia Roberts, as well as most of the leading actors in Hollywood from George Clooney to Warren Beatty to Clint Eastwood. Armani never charged for the service -- the company even provided its own stylist to check on the fit of the garment and to assist with any accessories. Some stars continue to work with fashion designers in this way. Reese Witherspoon has an arrangement with the company Nina Ricci for red-carpet events, and Renee Zellweger usually wears the designer Carolina Herrera. But neither is structuring her career around tabloid exposure. 
 ''That's really what I object to about what Rachel Zoe does,'' said the major studio publicity head. ''If an Academy Award-nominated actress has 50 appearances to make and she hates to shop, we're happy to hire her a stylist. But to pay exorbitant amounts when the designers and the stars just want publicity in the tabloids, that is not going to help a movie at the box office.''
 Zoe did not invent the job of stylist to the stars, but she did expand what the job could entail. In the past, stylists concerned themselves with the Academy Awards and a few other black-tie gala extravaganzas. ''Everything changed with the popularity of red-carpet preshows and the popularity of fashion and celebrity in the tabloids,'' O'Sullivan told me. What Zoe recognized is that the tabloids -- virtually the only magazines to increase their circulation substantially in recent years -- pretty much split their coverage between the bad behavior of their chosen stars and what they wore, whether it was to jail, to a premiere or to pick up their kids at school. ''Because of the tabloids running photos of people in their downtime, that became a thing,'' Zoe said as she waited for the food to arrive. ''So, we started doing fun outfits to go get your coffee in the morning or if you were going to the Ivy for dinner. You know what I'm saying? The obsession with the tabloids fuels the business. Was I responsible? Yes. I think people should look cute all the time.''
 Life for Zoe and her clients became a constant red carpet. She put them in a combination of designer pieces and vintage finds from the '60s and '70s, which is also the way she dresses. After her days at YM, Zoe continued giving Jessica Simpson, then 16, advice on what to wear. ''The girls started asking for my help when they had an event,'' Zoe explained. ''They'd say, 'Oh, my God, Rachel, only you could wear such a huge pair of sunglasses.' Or, 'Only you could wear a ring the size of your hand.' And, I'd say: 'That's nonsense. You can wear it, too: it's about having confidence in taking a risk.' And without risk, there's no reward.''
 The reward, of course, was fame. Not just for clients like Nicole Richie and, later, for more established stars like Cameron Diaz, but for Zoe too. Top designers suddenly sought her out, and she was asked to create a line of evening bags for Judith Leiber, to consult on the Gap's shoe Web site and to be in an ad for a Samsung cellphone. Her autobiography/fashion guide, ''Style A to Zoe,'' will be published in October. The book is a narcissistic swirl of drawings of Zoe, photos of Zoe with her celebrity clients and glowing testimonials from fashion eminences like Valentino, mixed with tips -- how to strike a pose and what to pack for a trip to Europe. ''Hopefully, the book will teach people,'' Zoe said at the Bristol as her food finally arrived. ''You're only here once. Why shouldn't you do it with style?'' Zoe looked down at her plate. Steamed vegetables were fanned around a small dollop of sauce. ''What is this?'' she asked. Zoe picked up her untouched plate and beckoned the waitress. ''I need to send this back,'' she said. ''Bring it to me without the sauce, please.''
 As the waitress left, Zoe continued. ''It has to be the big picture for me,'' she said. ''A lot of people saw this job as you put them in a dress and that's all. I didn't see it that way. I want them to look great all the time. And I don't nickel-and-dime people. A lot of stylists say they are hired for this, this and this so that's the only thing I'm going to dress them for. I'm like, are you nuts? If my client calls me and says I'm going to a friend's premiere, I'll say, come over and let's do something cute. And I won't bill them for that.''
 It all adds up anyway: more outfits means more photos, which means more designer credits and greater awareness and money. Through her involvement with Zoe, Lohan was offered not only the covers of top fashion magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Elle but also upscale advertising campaigns for Miu Miu, Prada's younger sister. ''No one wants to stay in the tabloids,'' Zoe said as a new plate of vegetables was placed before her. ''But it's actually not a terrible place to start.''
 In late July, Zoe was in Manhattan to work on her newest venture, the relaunch of Halston, perhaps the most iconic American fashion house of the '70s. Her involvement came about in a typical Zoe connect-the-dots way. Zoe met Harvey Weinstein, the Academy Award-winning movie mogul, at a fund-raising event in 2005. Weinstein had a new interest in fashion. His girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, had become a co-designer of Marchesa, a label that specializes in evening dresses. Eager to help Chapman, Weinstein strongly suggested that the stars of his movies wear Marchesa gowns for big events. ''I also put the gowns on my girls,'' Zoe said now, as she sat in the back seat of a black sedan on her way to a vintage store downtown called Resurrection. ''And we became friends.''
 Zoe is also friends with Tamara Mellon, the president of Jimmy Choo (Zoe not only put Jimmy Choo stilettos on her girls; she also styled Jimmy Choo ads). It was Mellon who learned that Halston was available and brought the idea to Weinstein and Zoe, when they were all vacationing in St. Bart two years ago. At $22 million, Halston was not expensive -- the brand has been relaunched twice already, and both efforts were financial failures. Weinstein secured the company through a private equity firm. Zoe was intrigued. ''I said: Are you kidding? In a minute I'll do this,'' Zoe exclaimed. She was wearing loose jeans, a sleeveless white shirt unbuttoned to her sternum and an even larger amount of gold jewelry than usual. ''I keep changing my sunnies,'' she said as she fished in her Birkin bag for another pair of sunglasses. ''When the light changes, you have to change your sunnies.''
 Earlier that month, the Halston team named Marco Zanini, a former Versace assistant, as creative director. ''He's kind of brilliant,'' Zoe said. ''All the talent without the ego. But this is a slow process: I'm used to moving fast. Our C.E.O. is a Virgo like myself. We are always saying, keep it moving, keep it moving.''
 Growing up in Short Hills, N.J., Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig (her middle name was then pronounced ZOH-ee) was fascinated by Halston. The daughter of wealthy art collectors, she was surrounded by Frank Stellas and Keith Harings, but her earliest memory is of her mother's closet. ''I was 13 going on 30,'' she recalled. ''And to me, Halston was a true superstar. I wanted to be in his world. I wanted to dance at Studio 54 and fly to exotic destinations. And his clothes represented that dream.''
 Zoe's phone rang. Her ring tone is the opening notes of ''Riders on the Storm,'' by the Doors. ''I'm not sick of it yet,'' she said as she put the BlackBerry to her ear. ''What's up, babe?'' It was Taylor Jacobson, one of her two assistants, calling from L.A. ''It's bananies here, just bananies. Liv's fitting went great. But she needs some bags. Get some Atwood, Choo and Vivier. And I saw Annie last night. She'll wear the white long for the Hamptons premiere on Monday. You have to get the jewels to her from Cartier. Cavalli is so happy about the premiere. What else? What else? I have lost my short-term memory -- I'm just getting blonder by the day.''
 To translate: Liv Tyler and Anne Hathaway have several events, and clothes are needed. Zoe and her team almost never buy anything new -- they borrow or they are given garments from nearly every designer. Some designers say no. A year ago, Zoe contacted Olivier Theyskens, then the designer of Rochas, about dressing Keira Knightley. He refused. ''I was shocked,'' she said after ending her phone call. ''I honestly could not believe that he wouldn't want to dress her. He's a brilliant designer, but he doesn't understand how the business works.''
 Despite her roots in the tabloids with teen stars, Zoe is determined to elevate her business from mass to class. Her idol is Carine Roitfeld, now the editor of French Vogue, who started out as a stylist and inspired designers like Tom Ford at Gucci. ''I had someone say to me the other day, You are my muse,'' Zoe said as we passed a Starbucks. ''And I said, Don't put that pressure on me.'' She stared out the window. ''We have to stop at Starbucks. Even when I'm in Paris, I only drink Starbucks coffee. Otherwise, I feel like I'm cheating on this country.''
 After ordering an iced tea and placing the cup inside another cup (''I hate condensation,'' she explained), Zoe returned to the car. With all her new projects, the book, the Halston deal, the Leiber handbags that are priced from $2,500 to $16,000, it is surprising that Zoe is still fussing over Anne Hathaway's dress for a local premiere. ''I keep saying I'm going to cut back on styling,'' Zoe said, ''but it's hard to give up. To be totally honest, I struggle with these two people: the Rachel that is the 100 percent service let-me-chase-you-down-the-red-carpet person. And then there's the other Rachel. I've worked at this for 14 years, since I graduated from college, and right now, there are many opportunities to be Rachel the individual.''
 She has already started shedding skins. Even though she had great success with Lindsay Lohan, Zoe has now distanced herself from the troubled actress. ''I haven't really been with Lindsay in the last year,'' she said. ''When I was with Lindsay, we'd stay up all night and try on clothes. Clothes made her happy. But I've only seen her two times in the last six months.'' Zoe paused. ''I always wonder, How would I have been if I was 18 and around millions of dollars in fame and fortune? How would it be to be wanted by everyone?''
 Todd Shemarya hates to use the word ''brand.'' ''It sounds so using,'' he said when I met him for drinks at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles in August. As Zoe's brand agent since last year, Shemarya, who was boyishly dressed in jeans and a baseball hat, is largely responsible for her expansion past the world of styling. ''What I do,'' Shemarya explained, ''is to take an entity, whether it be a celebrity or a stylist, and enlarge their profile. I take whatever anyone's best assets are and then I apply those in a business situation.''
 Shemarya, who also represents stars like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston, got his start in the fashion world. He owned a modeling agency and began booking his models for commercials and other endorsement-related work. ''I don't give myself the credit for starting the endorsement thing,'' Shemarya explained, ''but it didn't get big until I started doing it. Elizabeth Taylor had White Diamonds perfume, but it wasn't that big of a deal yet. Now my clients endorse jewelry, pens, water, jeans and much more. But we are very careful. We don't endorse anything that will not enlarge an entity's profile.''
 In many ways, Zoe and Shemarya share a worldview: everyone has to get dressed in the morning, so why not have some role, financial or otherwise, in those choices? Both utilize the allure of celebrities, and both have altered the existing business model. Zoe has made every insecure actress (and they are all insecure) feel that her fame/success/career depend on what clothes her stylist tells her to wear, and Shemarya has turned top actors into ''brands'' without, he says, compromising their artistic credibility.
 He now plans to reinvent Zoe. ''The way I see it,'' Shemarya said, ''fashion is now bigger than the movie business. It's a world that has no end. And yet, nobody can guess who their customer is. Every fashion house is looking for a formula. Rachel has a formula. She's paid attention to the marketplace. She figured out who wanted to buy what. And now she's beyond being a stylist: Rachel Zoe is a brand that creates brands.''
 Although Zoe has no design training, Shemarya plans for her to have her own line of sunglasses, jeans and shoes. ''Very few designers ever went to design school,'' Shemarya said. ''And a lot of actors never went to acting school, and they were very successful. You either have a talent or you don't. And Rachel may never have been a designer, but she's been a creative director every single day. She creates outfits for people. She invents stars.''
 Shemarya says he feels it's crucial that Zoe move away from the tabloids. ''Her associations with the Lindsays, the Nicoles cheapens the brand,'' he explained. ''I didn't want Rachel to be seen out as much. And I'm not sure I would have chosen Halston for her. They've tried to revive that brand before, and it hasn't worked. Sometimes the universe gives us a signal.''
 Shemarya sipped his iced tea. ''Let's face it,'' he continued, ''you can take any entity and make them famous. But how long will that fame hold? I don't think people are stupid. They are interested in the tabloids because they want an escape from reality. And Rachel figured that out. But when Nicole became famous, it was a different time. I'm not sure people are so easily persuaded today.''
 His current goal is to reinvent Zoe as a television star. While audiences would probably like to see her behind the scenes with her famous clients, Shemarya imagines her as a 2007 updated version of Elsa Klensch, an early fashion reporter who had a weekly show on CNN. Klensch concentrated completely on designers and their creations. Her show was never provocative or celebrity-oriented -- Klensch would have had no interest in Zoe's actresses.
 ''I know what people want,'' Zoe told me. ''They want to watch me with my assistants backstage with a star.'' She isn't unaware of what brought her to the public's (and Todd Shemarya's) attention: without the girls she dresses, who is Rachel Zoe? ''That's the challenge,'' Zoe continued. ''I understand what people want to see, but I'm interested in something else. I want my show to be about the history of fashion, about these brilliant designers and their homes and their lives.'' Shemarya agreed. ''We want to do something educational,'' he told me, ''that you can still make money off of.''
 They're negotiating a deal with Bravo, home of ''Project Runway'' (which is co-produced by Harvey Weinstein) and many makeover shows. ''I would never do anything like a reality show with any of my clients,'' Shemarya insisted. ''Too much information cheapens the brand. And you can go from high to low, but it's very difficult to go from low to high. That's one of the challenges with Rachel.''
 At her white modernist house in the Hollywood Hills above Sunset Boulevard, Zoe and her assistant, Lia Davis, were sitting at the space-age table in her kitchen looking at dresses on the Internet. ''I die for this,'' Zoe said as she looked for a strapless gown that might work for Jennifer Garner, ''but nobody can wear this -- it's just too tight.'' Davis, who was wearing a loose black smock dress with silver gladiator sandals, wrote a note on the pad in front of her. ''Will people do feathers?'' Zoe asked. ''Yes!'' Davis enthused. ''Chanel wanted to dress Garner,'' Zoe continued. ''You should find out about that.''
 As Davis made another note, Zoe retrieved a diet Snapple from her refrigerator. It was nearly 2 in the afternoon, but Zoe was wearing a long white cashmere bathrobe and high-heeled espadrilles with full photo-ready hair and makeup. She looked particularly bony, her narrow frame accentuated by the tight belt of her robe. Her extreme thinness has spurred gossip: in recent months Zoe has repeatedly denied rumors that she is dependent on drugs and has, in the past, supplied clients.
 ''It's absolutely not true,'' Zoe told me in Paris. ''I never even get drunk. I don't like to let my guard down. I never lose control of where my head is. If I have an entire glass of wine in a night, that's a lot.'' Others agree. ''Rachel is a nurturer,'' says Cameron Silver, who owns an upscale vintage store called Decades, one of Zoe's favorite destinations. ''If she has a vice, it is shopping. She told me once that she has buyer's guilt every day of her life.''
 In fact, except for the living room, with its sculptural Philippe Starck couch and the huge bed in the master bedroom, this house is dominated by clothes. There's an enormous walk-in closet, with clothes organized by color. Her dresses are grouped according to category (designer, style, period and then hue). There are eight built-in drawers for jewelry, ranging from classic Hermes cuffs in the top drawer to more delicate '20s pieces in the drawer below. A second bedroom has been turned into a closet, where Zoe has stashed some of her furs. ''This room is just for coats and scarves,'' she said as she walked down the hall toward her office, where 50 handbags were placed on the floor in neat rows of five. Downstairs, what was once the garage is now the showroom. ''This is where all the clients come,'' Zoe explained.
 In the showroom, Zoe opened a closet, exposing at least 70 pairs of jeans, organized by size and cut. Six metal racks were packed with gowns, and there were rows of shoes, waiting to be tried on. On the desk were Polaroids of Zoe's clients, Debra Messing and Maria Sharapova, in various ensembles. A photograph of Lindsay Lohan was torn out of a tabloid. There was a red circle drawn around the ring she was wearing, and someone -- probably one of Zoe's assistants -- had written ''H. Stern,'' the name of the manufacturer. Zoe turned the clipping over. ''You're not supposed to see that,'' she said. 
 Zoe picked up a Polaroid of Jennifer Garner. ''I do have rules,'' Zoe said. ''I don't like the girls to wear black for awards shows. It doesn't photograph well. And I don't normally do gray, even though Lia loves gray. I stay away from brown and certain shades of green. Basically, I don't like any of the colors that don't look good on me.'' Zoe laughed. ''I never truly decide about a dress for a big awards show until five minutes before they have to leave. It's always Cinderella off to the ball.''
 Davis appeared in the showroom and asked Zoe to come back upstairs so they could finish making their choices. ''If you snooze, you lose,'' Zoe said as she followed Davis back into the kitchen. ''The dress Cameron wore to the Costume Institute I grabbed as soon as I saw it on the runway. And then everyone wanted it.''
 Zoe sat down and stared at a baby-doll dress with a white collar designed by Giambattista Valli. ''I feel like I've seen this dress before,'' she said. ''I love it, but I feel like I've actually put this exact dress on someone.'' Zoe paused. ''Maybe I've been doing this too long,'' she said. ''Maybe it's time for a change.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 46 of The Times Magazine today about Rachel Zoe, a stylist who works with many film and TV stars, misstated the location of the premiere of the Nicole Kidman film ''Fur,'' for which Ms. Kidman requested a travel budget of more than $100,000 for her stylist and other assistants. It was the Rome Film Festival, not the Venice Film Festival.

HEADLINE: Riding the High-Speed Rail

 BODY:
Transportation has been a hot subject recently in Albany. ''Troopergate,'' the brouhaha over whether Gov. Eliot Spitzer's administration misused the State Police to smear a political opponent, has a big transport angle. The governor's staff members were trying to get state troopers to release the travel logs of State Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader. Those logs made it clear that Mr. Bruno was often using state helicopters and cars to travel to Republican fund-raisers.
 At the same time, the state's lobbying commission accused a businessman of improperly allowing Mr. Bruno to use his private plane and helicopter. The same businessman lathered Mr. Bruno with campaign contributions, and was associated with a firm that got $500,000 in state grants, courtesy of Mr. Bruno. 
 Sometime during all the back and forth in this transportation-focused summer, Mr. Bruno acknowledged that he had resorted to taking the train. One trip he took between Albany and New York City was longer and slower than scheduled, no surprise for anybody who travels that route routinely. But the delay and the political background noise apparently prompted Mr. Bruno to enthusiastically reaffirm his call for more high speed-rail in the state.
 The senator's people are quick to insist that there is absolutely no connection between his personal travel needs and his legislative agenda. That is fine. However he arrived at his position, he is promoting good public policy -- a high-speed, reliable rail system that can only help the state economy and its traveling public. 
 Like almost every other heavily populated place in the country, New York has a traffic problem that is getting worse by the rush hour. The cost of gas is painful, and the pollution from cars and trucks is unhealthful and bad for the planet. Rail lines are the most promising solution to the nation's transportation problem. Freight trains could take trucks off the highways, and passenger trains could reduce the number of cars. 
 The federal government spends most of its transportation money on automobile travel. Airplane traffic has been getting a healthy share of federal money since Sept. 11. But rail? It gets budget dust at best. A measly 4 percent of Washington's transportation budget goes to the railroads. 
 New York is a state that could benefit mightily from more focus on rails. One problem in Albany may be that, given their chilly relations these days, Governor Spitzer and Senator Bruno are not working cooperatively enough on a goal they share. They recently sent out separate press releases to announce the same $22 million in transportation initiatives. 
 Mr. Bruno's announcement focused on small projects for Albany, the town of Hudson and the rocky slope around the George Washington Bridge. The governor's announcement emphasized the creation of a new transportation working group, and an important effort to untangle the way different freight and rail carriers use the busy tracks between New York City and Albany.
 These are all good ideas, but there is an even better way for the Legislature to help New York's railroads become more dependable and faster. More lawmakers should abandon their cars and S.U.V.'s and take the train. Only about a dozen legislators regularly travel by rail to the state capital. Just as Mr. Bruno's experience helped fuel his support of high-speed railroads, a few more Amtrak tickets might finally get the rest of the Legislature on the right track.

HEADLINE: The Wisdom of Sales Trend Predictions

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
INTERNET pundits make a spectacle of their annual predictions for online holiday sales. Now an Internet group is turning to a new approach to arrive at its forecast: just ask everybody.
 The Sloan Center for Internet Retailing, part of the University of California, Riverside, will announce a new Web site tomorrow relying on so-called prediction markets to foretell online sales and other Internet-related trends, like the shopping sites most likely to survive, or the popularity of ''World of Warcraft.'' In doing so, the Sloan Center is adopting a method of online research that off-line companies have used widely in recent months, but one that is not in broad use to study Internet sales.
 ''It's increasingly hard to get people to participate in research studies, but they're very eager to participate in prediction markets,'' said Thomas P. Novak, a director of the Sloan Center. ''Consumers are actually coming to you, which seems to me what the Web is all about.'' 
 The concept behind the Sloan Center's initiative, and the trend in general, is known as competitive forecasting, where Web sites pit users against each other to determine who is the most prescient about a certain topic. Analysts said this method, publicized widely in ''The Wisdom of Crowds,'' the book by the New Yorker columnist James Surowiecki, yields more accurate results because participants care much more about their answers than in a typical phone survey.
 Results of the best-known examples of prediction markets seem to bear this out. Cantor Fitzgerald's Hollywood Stock Exchange (www.hsx.com) last year predicted 32 of the 36 major-category Oscar nominees and over the last three years has correctly predicted 92 percent of the major-category Oscar winners. And the Iowa Electronic Markets (www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem) often predicts election results more accurately than pre-election polls.
 Unlike those Web sites, which operate as futures markets, with participants backing their predictions with dollars or online scrip, the Sloan Center's eLab is free and gives participants a way to earn something potentially more valuable: a reputation. Users assume an online identity, then answer a slate of questions. The site ranks users on the quality of their answers, and offers a gift certificate of $25 monthly to the top-ranked participant. Every three months, the top-ranked user wins a $500 gift certificate.
 Prediction markets offer unreliable results if too few people care enough about a topic to answer questions carefully, but Mr. Novak believes $25 and the promise of e-commerce industry fame will attract at least ''hundreds of people'' -- enough, he said, to establish statistically significant results. In addition, he said he and Donna Hoffman, another Sloan Center director, had designed the site so people could choose the most interesting questions to pose on the site.
 The eLab Exchange hopes to follow the lead of grass roots successes like YouTube and MySpace in not spending money on traditional advertising. It will count on discussion boards and blogs devoted to niche Internet topics in hopes they will attract a respectable user base. Mr. Novak said that even though the results of questions posed on the Exchange would be valuable for e-commerce companies, the Sloan Center would not seek to market its data. ''We're academics,'' he said. ''We're in this for the fun.''
 The same cannot be said for the many other companies lining up to use prediction markets to glean -- and then sell -- business research. Robin Hanson, an economics professor at George Mason University and a consultant to companies building prediction markets, said: ''A lot of new business plans are based on this idea. There's a big trend in this area, with people thinking this is cool.''
 But Mr. Hanson said he was skeptical about many of the dozens of businesses he had seen forming around the concept, because outside of topics like politics, movies or sports, few subjects would entice people to render carefully considered opinions. ''It's kind of like a job,'' he said.
 At the moment, the trend is mostly benefiting companies that sell software to create online predication markets, like Consensus Point in Nashville and NewsFutures in Baltimore. These companies say demand has jumped over the last year, both from organizations like the Sloan Center, who want to create public sites, and from corporations like Best Buy, Hewlett-Packard and others that are using private Web sites to devise business strategy with the help of their employees.
 ''You're now seeing very serious businesses using this for important projects,'' said Emile Servan-Schreiber, chief executive of NewsFutures. Eli Lilly, for instance, has used online prediction markets to predict drug sales, while Arcelor Mittal, the world's biggest steel maker, has used this technique to forecast a wide range of business trends.
 Mr. Servan-Schreiber said his company helped businesses build the Web sites, devise incentives for users and craft the questions properly, at a cost that was in the ''tens of thousands of dollars per year.''
 Zubin Dowlaty, vice president of emerging technologies for InterContinental Hotels Group, recently began using online prediction markets to ask employees which new technologies the company should invest in. In the future, he said, the questions will encompass the full range of the company's services, and would perhaps be open to the hotel's customers. 
 ''Compared to polling people, this significantly improves the process of harvesting and prioritizing ideas,'' Mr. Dowlaty said. ''And the cost is extremely low, relative to surveys or engaging a consulting firm.''
 While Mr. Dowlaty and other executives glean what they can from their internal prediction markets, they can always peek at the Sloan Center's eLab eXchange for intelligence from the masses. 
 ''If the market is thick enough there, it'd be a very valid research approach,'' he said. ''It could always spark ideas I could use on mine.''

HEADLINE: Airline Alliances Aim For New Efficiencies And Traveler Loyalty

BYLINE: By DAVID KAUFMAN

 BODY:
FOR two weeks every other month, Andy Jent heads from Dallas to Asia for a regional meeting with clients of CXO, his crisis-management firm. But rather than use a conventional travel agent or reserve flights online, Mr. Jent books his trip through the international reservations department at oneworld, a global alliance of 10 airlines anchored around American Airlines. 
 ''I tell them where I want to go,'' said Mr. Jent, who has flown more than 100,000 miles this year. ''They find me the best flights and I just organize my schedule to fit the itinerary they create. Half the time I lose track of which airline I am on.''
 Although never intended to act as travel agents for frequent fliers like Mr. Jent, airline alliances have come a long way since their arrival 10 years ago. Heralded as tools to increase consumer choices and enhance convenience while decreasing costs and delays, the alliances -- oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam -- have changed international business travel. With their integrated schedules and frequent-flier programs, along with universal upgrade privileges and premium-class lounge access, the alliances can deliver a level of consistency and confidence that transcends individual carriers. 
 ''Alliances offer more city pairs, service frequencies and the ability to seamlessly shift from domestic to international flights,'' said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm. ''All without having to change brands, terminals or airports.''
 Airline alliances evolved mostly as a result of globalization. ''With new manufacturing facilities in China and major markets opening in Europe, travelers suddenly found themselves with far different needs than in the past,'' said Christian Klick, vice president of Star Alliance, the oldest and largest such group. ''Alliances created a new global reach to satisfy these burgeoning traveler demands.''
 Established in 1997, Star Alliance has 17 carriers, including United Airlines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and South African Airways; they offer a combined 16,000 flights a day. With a management team in Frankfurt and a fully integrated online reservations system, Star Alliance continues to develop products and services that suggest how all the alliances might evolve as they enter their second decade.
 At the Los Angeles International Airport, for instance, a new 15,000-square-foot Star Alliance premium-class lounge opened in July, replacing 12 member-carrier lounges. The lounge -- with showers, a business center, free Wi-Fi and all-day dining -- is the third of its kind for Star, after Zurich and Nagoya, Japan. Additional lounges will open in London and Paris next year.
 ''These carriers could not have afforded to separately build such an elaborate space,'' Mr. Klick said. 
 The other alliances are also consolidating their services at major hubs worldwide. Known as ''co-locating,'' the moves are intended ''to bring the alliance to the customer rather than the customer to the alliance,'' said Michael Blunt, vice president for corporate communications at oneworld. 
 For instance, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, American and other oneworld carriers are now housed in single terminals in Tokyo and Madrid. SkyTeam has bundled its 10 members, which include Delta, Air France, KLM, Aeroflot and Northwest, at Incheon International Airport in Seoul and at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, while Star Alliance airlines have been moved to single terminals in Munich and Tokyo. 
 A Star Alliance facility with 120 self-service check-in kiosks is now set up at the new south wing in Terminal 1 at Narita International Airport in Tokyo. Since all Star carriers are within walking distance of one another, transfer times at Narita have been cut from 110 minutes to 45 minutes for international flights, according to Mr. Klick. Oneworld is reporting similar time reductions at its terminal at Narita as well. 
 When there are delays or itinerary changes, the ability to confer with a single alliance official helps solve problems even when travelers are arriving or departing on different carriers. 
 ''There is this sense that you are being taken care of, which is why I only fly within my alliance,'' said David Nathanson, a oneworld member and a principal of Nathanson Partners, a Dallas health care consulting firm.
 The ease of securing upgrades on member airlines and having access to premium lounges have kept Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economics professor, loyal to Star Alliance. ''These are very powerful benefits for me,'' said Mr. Gordon, who flies only United domestically and only Lufthansa within Europe. ''So it would be foolish not to concentrate as many miles as possible on my alliance members.''
 Looking forward, alliances are keen to exploit the changing demands -- and destinations -- of their members and member airlines. With only 33 percent of American business travelers committed to a single carrier, according to Forrester Research, a huge pool of passengers still travels without an alliance affiliation. To attract these travelers, all three alliances have entire divisions or programs aimed at winning over corporate and group-travel planners by offering volume discounts. 
 ''These are distribution and bookings experts on which airlines fly to which places throughout the entire alliance,'' said Don Casey, a managing director of international planning at American Airlines. This is a lucrative niche: Star Alliance's corporate business has 80 such clients and doubled its revenue in this area in the last five years to 2.2 billion euros (about $3 billion). 
 All the alliances are adding carriers whose networks extend deep into new global markets, like Asia and the Middle East. The biggest prize is China, where every alliance is establishing a strong presence. Star Alliance has recently signed on Shanghai Airlines and Beijing-based Air China; China Southern Airlines is set to join SkyTeam; and Hong Kong-based Dragonair is becoming a member of oneworld. In the Middle East, Turkish Airlines will soon join Star Alliance, and Royal Jordanian has signed up with oneworld.
 No major Indian or Persian Gulf-based airline has yet joined an alliance, although Air India has been talking with Star Alliance the last few months. Jet Airways in India and Emirates Airlines in Dubai are important alliance targets. 
 Still, not every carrier fits with an alliance. ''The goal is to fill white spaces on our network map without replicating existing services,'' said Mr. Blunt of oneworld, which recently signed on Japan Airlines, one of the world's biggest. 
 The alliances are also trying to tackle service issues. Oneworld, for instance, remains hampered by United States Department of Transportation antitrust regulations that prevent American Airlines' frequent-flier program members from earning miles when they use British Airways for trans-Atlantic flights. Another issue involves United Airlines, which no longer offers automatic upgrades for all Star Alliance fliers. 
 Still, for frequent international fliers like Nadav Salamon, a partner with Plesner Architects in Tel Aviv, the desire to relieve travel tension forges his devotion to his favorite carriers in Star Alliance. ''I want my miles to earn upgrades or free travel,'' said Mr. Salamon. ''So if I am paying for my ticket, I am flying Star Alliance.''

HEADLINE: Catskills Watershed (2 Letters)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''A Watershed Agreement'' (editorial, Sept. 10), you rightly hail the new Catskills agreement that both protects sensitive lands near the Belleayre Ski Center and allows a scaled-down resort project to advance there. Among those critical to this success were New York City and the Bloomberg administration. 
 The city performed technical analyses of the original project's potential impacts, provided expertise on watershed management techniques and agreed to allow the new development to connect to an existing city-owned waste-water treatment plant -- eliminating a new source of watershed pollution and making the new, smaller resort more economically attractive.
 Eric A. Goldstein New York, Sept. 11, 2007 The writer is a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 To the Editor:
 Although there are some positive aspects to the reconfigured Belleayre Resort proposal, most notably the potential to preserve the Big Indian Plateau, development has been increased on the western side of Belleayre Ski Center (Highmount) on steep slopes up to 3,000 feet. 
 In fact, most of the components of the Big Indian Plateau site have simply been moved to this new location. This is still way oversized for the area and will have a devastating effect on our communities and the character of Catskill Park, not to mention the New York City watershed. 
 Traffic, water consumption, flooding, erosion, negative socioeconomic impacts and more remain unresolved. It is the local people, not the national environmental groups, who will bear the burden of doubling the population of our town, and we will get to pay for it in higher taxes to boot.

HEADLINE: Eat In and Never Change a Light Bulb

BYLINE: By ELAINE GLUSAC

 BODY:
WILLIAM KUTNEY tends to think of his temporary accommodations in New Jersey as a home away from home. He has a full kitchen, flat-panel television and, of course, Wi-Fi. He attends happy hours there, and the staff handles his dry cleaning. But he doesn't have to change a light bulb or commit to a lease, which gives his current suite an edge over his previous six-month stint living in a furnished apartment in Indiana for work.
 ''Here, if the contract ends, I can be out of the hotel tomorrow,'' said Mr. Kutney, 27, a financial industry consultant from Dallas who has been staying at the Hyatt Summerfield Suites in Morristown since December. ''The staff helps make it nice, and you don't have to do your own sheets.'' 
 Meant to serve the 20 percent of travelers -- many of them on business -- who check in for five or more nights, extended-stay hotels were a 1980s innovation, offering larger closets, living areas, full kitchens, laundry rooms and discounts for guests who were willing to stay in what were often out-of-the-way suburban locations. They were aimed at budget customers, who dealt with fluorescent-lighted work space, cheap kitchen counters and part-time reception staff. But as the number of such hotels has risen, so has the quality. There are now more services, better designs and, in some cases, locations in actual cities.
 Hyatt's new 19-unit Summerfield Suites, which it bought last year and plans to expand by adding 11 locations this year, offers free grocery shopping service, swimming pools and outdoor grills. In 2008, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide plans to introduce Element Hotel, an extended-stay chain with a loft-style design and ''green'' elements, like low-flow toilets. AKA hotels, based in Philadelphia, recently opened two properties in Manhattan, two in suburban Washington, D.C. and one this month in Philadelphia, each with designer kitchens, 400-thread-count sheets and flat-screen TVs. 
 Established contenders like Residence Inn by Marriott are honing their appeal with more contemporary decor and features like outdoor fire pits. Homewood Suites by Hilton, which ranked highest for satisfaction in the extended-stay category in a 2007 J. D. Power & Associates survey, will replace all its beds and allow guests to choose their suite through an online program by the year's end. Staybridge Suites, managed by InterContinental Hotels Group, has begun adding screening rooms for sports and movie watchers.
 ''We've reached a level of maturity in extended stay where a greater range of services and amenities is important,'' said Bjorn Hanson, a lodging consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The market for high-end extended-stay rooms -- where rates average $117 a night, more than double the low-end average of $54.82 -- grew 7.3 percent in the first six months of 2007, according to Smith Travel Research, a database information group. Overall occupancy in all extended-stay rooms, 73.6 percent, is 10 percentage points above the national average; the rate among the top tier is even higher, at 75.2 percent.
 ''You see a lot of people traveling on the road doing training seminars and consulting, which benefits the extended-stay category,'' said Jan Freitag, vice president of Smith Travel Research.
 The downside is often giving up city locations for suburban or business park locations. Guests can't get room service, except for those staying at AKA hotels, which usually have restaurants in adjacent areas. Most extended-stay hotels restrict food service to free self-serve breakfasts. Their business centers rarely offer full services, though most offer free Wi-Fi.
 And, of course, guests share living space with strangers. ''It will always feel like a hotel if you don't have a home,'' said Connie Miller, 52, who had been living for four months at the Hyatt Summerfield Suites near Denver while her husband, a mining consultant, relocates for work. ''Privacy is an issue.''
 Such complaints are difficult to satisfy, but new high-end extended-stay hotels hope to raise aesthetics, as well as rates. Element hotels, for example, will offer uncluttered lobbies with 16-foot windows, as well as generous showers and sectional couches in the guest rooms. Microbrew beers will be served around fire pits at happy hours. Starwood plans to open 500 Element hotels in 10 years, with the first in Lexington, Mass., to open in July 2008, at rates 10 to 15 percent above what competitors charge. 
 Amenities at AKA hotels include luxury kitchen appliances, mosaic-tiled showers and choices of pillows. 
 ''Nobody was going after the person who was going to be here for a long stay who would normally stay at the Four Seasons on a short stay,'' said Larry Korman, a co-president of the Korman Communities, which buys condominiums that are under construction and converts them to luxury extended-stay hotels. Rates vary by location and length of stay, but dip to $255 per night for 30 days at the new AKA Central Park.
 Even existing hotels are polishing their acts. ''Expectations are different and it's more competitive,'' said Robert Radomski, vice president of brand management for Staybridge, which will add more than 21 locations this year, its busiest yet. In 2006, the hotel began upgrading its suites with walk-in showers and granite vanities, and built home theaters in public areas, with leather seats for up to 15 people to sit before a 60-inch monitor.
 To make its properties friendlier, Residence Inn by Marriott has added basketball and volleyball courts as well as pools and fire pits. ''The residential atmosphere is very important to us,'' said Rich Rollison, an American Army liaison officer for South Korea. He books up to 500 guests a year at the Residence Inn Arlington-Pentagon City for officials and officers coming to the capital for meetings. ''When you have a 10-day stay, you get tired of going out to eat. Suites are critical to what we do.''

HEADLINE: Tight Budgets, Tactical Thinking

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
THIS year, Sarah Garcia, the chief executive of Signature Wines and Beverages, took on a difficult challenge: finding a hotel room in New York for less than $100 a night. 
 She was successful. The room she dug up, in a boutique hotel in Midtown, ''was very nice,'' said Ms. Garcia, whose company, based in Hayward, Calif., customizes labels for bottled water and wines. ''The only issue was that it was below zero in February and the heater conked out.''
 But Ms. Garcia was trying to save money. She is also prone to accepting free lodging and meals from friends instead of staying in a hotel or eating out. It is no secret that travel costs are soaring and business travelers have been squeezed hard as companies, from corporations with travel departments to small businesses with employees making their own plans, tighten purse strings. 
 ''We have seen a 20 to 30 percent rise in our travel costs,'' saidE. Smith Yewell, the chief executive of Welocalize, a firm in Frederick, Md., that offers software-translation services. When trips are necessary, he economizes by swapping many short trips for longer ones. He has even encouraged employees to stay Saturday nights if it saves on airfare. 
 Mitch Cwanger, who heads up the airline practice for American Express Business Travel Advisory Services, said that some of his corporate clients were shifting employees from premium-class cabins even on long flights to Europe. ''It is the middle management maybe moving from business class to premium economy,'' he said. In some cases, he added, they might fly business class to Europe to arrive refreshed, but move to economy on the return trip. 
 Rising costs topped the concerns of corporate travel managers, says an annual client survey by BCD Travel, an agency that works with corporations. 
 Respondents to the survey pointed to the increasing use of low-fare carriers like Southwest, AirTran and Ryanair, which is based in Europe, as one way to manage costs. When Mike Jones, who founded Hartmann & Forbes, a maker of window coverings, travels to Asia, he flies China Air to, say, Shanghai, then opts for carriers like Dragonair for regional travel. 
 ''I can take commuter flights to Taiwan or over to Hong Kong or to Korea for almost nothing,'' he said, adding that walk-up fares are as low as $50. The downside? Not being able to read the name of the airline on the plane because of the foreign language. ''You say a prayer and get on board,'' he said. 
 For those making their own flight arrangements, there is a new online service called Yapta (yapta.com). The service allows travelers to track routes and keep tabs on the latest fares after a ticket has been bought, in case the fare drops. If it falls enough to surpass the airline ticket change fee (typically $100), the customer can apply for a refund from the airline for the difference.
 Avoiding expensive hotel stays is another challenge. Expedia Corporate Travel says that average room rates are up 10 percent in Chicago and 15 percent in New York this year alone. James J. Hummer, the chief executive of Whole Health Management in Cleveland, has cut out hotel stays to do day trips. ''Sometimes it's Chicago and back,'' he said. ''We have even done day trips down to Florida to meet with a prospective client.'' 
 Priscilla Campbell, who heads up the hotel practice for American Express, said that more businesses were widening the scope of hotel classes they use. ''If they have been staying at upper-tier hotels, they may consider more midtier properties,'' said Ms. Campbell, adding that midpriced chains were becoming more amenable to business travelers' needs. 
 The Global Hyatt Corporation, for instance, bought AmeriSuites and has been transforming the properties into the new Hyatt Place chain, a midpriced brand where the rooms have ergonomic desk chairs and free Wi-Fi. A total of 59 Hyatt Place hotels are open, and up to 120 will be ready by the end of year. They start at $120 a night; a search for a room for mid-September at the Dallas Hyatt Place turned up a fare for $159 a night.
 For rental cars, rates are up about 3 percent this year. The trick to reducing costs, travel managers say, is to set up a corporate account with a rental-car company, covering refueling and insurance, instead of arranging rentals as you go. Budget Rent a Car has a program that tracks a company's monthly spending on rentals and provides a rebate equivalent to $2 a day for each vehicle at the end of the month. Although local and excise taxes are nonnegotiable, travel managers say that companies can save money by not renting at airports, which often tack on fees for local projects like new stadiums. 
 Of course, corporate travel policies are only as productive as the employees who follow them. This spring, American Express introduced a pre-trip audit tool. The company negotiates a rate with a hotel group, and if a hotel outside the group is booked, the employee -- and perhaps even the person's manager -- will get an e-mail message suggesting that the choice be changed. 
 The key is to be adaptable. Adam Lowry, a co-founder of Method, a San Francisco manufacturer of biodegradable cleaning products, sends fewer employees on trips, relies more on videoconferencing and tries to visit several cities on one trip rather than take many round-trip flights to factories and customers, say, in the Midwest. 
 In this era, when prices are high and navigating the airport can be a headache, such strategic thinking, Mr. Lowry said, is ''a money saver and a sanity saver.''

HEADLINE: Juggling the Choices of Phoning From Abroad

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
FOR Chad Felton, a marketing manager from Rochester, the biggest hassle planning business trips to Europe was finding an efficient way to call and e-mail both his colleagues back home and his clients on the road.
 Several times, he rented an American cellphone that worked overseas so his colleagues could call him at their local rates. But when he dialed them, or called customers just around the corner when he was in London, he paid more than $1 a minute because of roaming charges. Worse, he could not send or receive e-mails with his rented phone.
 This year, Mr. Felton found a solution in the new BlackBerry 8830 from Verizon Wireless, one of many all-in-one devices for global business travelers. He travels with the same handset that he uses at home, so he does not have to send colleagues a temporary number and can read his e-mail without a hiccup.
 ''You can make voice calls overseas and get your e-mail delivered to you seamlessly,'' said Mr. Felton, who works for Document Security Systems and used the device on a recent trip to Ireland, Britain, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands. ''It was a no-brainer.'' 
 Mr. Felton still paid several hundred dollars in roaming and data charges to use his phone on the trip, but the bill was less than half the $1,000 or so that he used to spend using a rental phone. And by having access to his e-mail on the BlackBerry, he did not have to rent hotel broadband lines, saving him money as well.
 Mr. Felton paid $195 for the handset after signing a two-year contract and receiving a corporate discount. Like other carriers, Verizon Wireless charges about $20 more to add unlimited international data use to existing domestic data plans, which typically begin at around $35 a month.
 BlackBerry users who travel overseas can also occasionally pay as they go based on how many kilobytes of data they send and receive.
 Still, the hundreds of dollars Mr. Felton spent on his trip is a reminder that using your cellphone internationally remains expensive. The main reason is that carriers make a lot of money charging other companies to connect their calls.
 In recent years, carriers in the United States, Europe and Asia have reduced their fees because of volume discounts and regulatory pressure. But in emerging economies, using your international phone can cost as much as $4 a minute. Data charges can add hundreds of dollars more to your bill.
 ''These tariffs are very, very profitable, and the carriers are trying to keep them,'' said David Chamberlain, a wireless analyst at In-Stat, a technology research group.
 Businesspeople who visit the same country often have a cheaper alternative: buying a prepaid phone in that country and refilling it with extra minutes as needed, or signing a service contract with a local carrier.
 Ian Landy, the chief executive of excitations.com, a Web-based retailer, did the latter because he takes frequent weeklong trips to Britain and Europe. He bought a phone from Virgin Mobile for about $:200 ($400).
 But he tired of carrying two handsets -- his American phone to receive calls from home and a British phone to make local calls. He avoided getting a prepaid phone because the number would change when the minutes expired. 
 So he bought a Razr handset for about $200 from Cingular (now AT&T), whose phones work overseas. He still ran up bills of close to $1,000, but he could make and receive calls just as he did in the United States. 
 ''I pay for the phone personally, and the high fees bother me,'' Mr. Landy said. ''But with a prepaid phone, you're changing the number each time and you have to decide how much you spend each time.''
 In August, Mr. Landy tried his new iPhone in Britain and Italy. The phone was handy because it stored so much information, but browsing Web sites was arduously slow. As a consequence, using the phone was not cheap. He said he had already received a bill for $1,200, which included only a few of the days he had spent in Europe. 
 In September, Mr. Landy said that AT&T had contacted him to say that his ''international roaming data usage was excessive,'' and that the company retroactively put him on an unlimited plan that took his bill down to $250.
 As a third option, Mr. Landy could have bought a small memory chip called a SIM, or subscriber identity module, which has phone numbers from other countries attached to them. 
 With a British SIM card, he could have dialed at British rates in Britain. But he would have had to swap out his American SIM card, disabling his American phone number. (Alas, the iPhone does not allow users to change SIM cards.)
 Some companies sell global SIM cards that offer free roaming in dozens of countries. Letsroam, for instance, sells a card that allows users to call from Britain to a landline in the United States for 40 cents a minute, about a third less than most other American carriers. 
 The card, which costs $74, can be used in almost 50 countries. Customers pay as they go and buy extra minutes online.
 However, Verizon Wireless and Sprint phones use C.D.M.A. technology, or code-division multiple access, and do not accept SIM cards. But T-Mobile and AT&T phones accept them. Customers must ask the company to ''unlock'' their handset to accept different SIM cards. 
 AT&T and T-Mobile have added another useful feature to some of their phones -- the ability to connect to Wi-Fi hot spots to let users search the Internet and make Internet phone calls for less than they would if they paid roaming charges for calls over cellular networks.
 While T-Mobile phones work in about 190 countries, two notable exceptions are Japan and South Korea, where carriers operate unique cellular networks. In March, NTT DoCoMo, the leading Japanese wireless carrier, started selling the BlackBerry 8707g, a smartphone that operates in United States, Japan and most other countries. The phone costs $570, and users must sign up for a voice and data plan from AT&T or T-Mobile.
 The high cost is one reason Mark Mason, managing director of TransPacific Capital Group in New York, uses his T-Mobile BlackBerry when he visits Europe and many countries in Asia, but rents a phone when he visits Japan and South Korea every few months.
 ''It's wildly inefficient,'' he said. ''Ultimately, what you want is one single phone for the entire trip. It's one more big hassle factor that makes it hard to get business done.''

HEADLINE: Pain and Suffering at Life's End

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''Drugs Banned, World's Poor Suffer in Pain'' (front page, Sept. 10) rightly points out the need for pain-relief drugs for end-of-life care in poor countries, particularly in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 
 But end-of-life care is more than drugs. Almost three decades ago the first hospice-care program in sub-Saharan Africa began to deliver home-based care, including pain medication, but also integrated psychological and spiritual counseling and support systems for patients and their families. 
 Since that time, the Foundation for Hospices in Sub-Saharan Africa has partnered with African counterparts to create programs in more than a dozen African countries. 
 More programs are desperately needed, particularly in countries like Sierra Leone, to provide the quality end-of-life care that every person, regardless of country of origin or economic status, deserves. 
 Barbara Alison Rose Chevy Chase, Md., Sept. 10, 2007 The writer is executive director of Aid for Africa.
 To the Editor:
 As a member of the Peruvian American Medical Society, or PAMS, I have worked for several years supporting and developing a free mental health clinic for the poor of Ayacucho, Peru. 
 In my many discussions with the locals, it became apparent that among the indignities the poor suffer, there is the agonizing pain of terminal illness.
 I decided that I would buy morphine in Lima, and with the support of PAMS, use our nurses and pay local physicians to administer it to the dying.
 Everywhere I turned -- physicians, officials and even American-based nongovernmental organizations -- the answer was the same, ''You can't do it.'' The government would look suspiciously at the program and no one would volunteer.
 Along with mental health in the developing world, this is a tremendous tragedy that is largely ignored by the international health community. It is especially tragic as treatment is inexpensive and can be delivered locally.
 Mark D. Rego, M.D. Milford, Conn., Sept. 10, 2007 The writer is a lecturer in psychiatry at Yale University. 
 To the Editor:
 It is a tragic and terrible injustice that millions of people in poor countries die in pain because of inadequate treatment despite the availability of low-cost, effective treatments. 
 Yet the public health crisis of the undertreatment of pain inexcusably continues, even if not to the same extent, in wealthier nations, too. 
 A recent survey of 4,000 cancer patients in Europe revealed that two of three are in pain and that one-third of these patients sometimes had so much pain that they wanted to die. 
 Studies in the United States found that up to 41 percent of all cancer patients are in pain and that some 50 percent of seriously ill and dying patients did not have their pain managed.
 A survey of New York State doctors reported in 2005 that occasionally or frequently one-third of them prescribed lower doses of an opioid drug for outpatients with chronic pain because of concern about investigation by a regulatory agency. Astonishingly, three-fourths of the doctors occasionally or frequently prescribed a non-opioid drug even when an opioid drug, such as morphine, may be indicated. 
 The severe undertreatment of pain is an urgent worldwide crisis. Corrective action can wait no longer.
 David C. Leven Pelham, N.Y., Sept. 10, 2007 The writer is executive director of Compassion & Choices of New York, a nonprofit organization working to improve care and expand choice at the end of life. 
 To the Editor:
 While it's shocking that people suffer unbearable pain due to cancer and other diseases, it is by no means surprising. 
 Physicians in the United States are phobic about prescribing adequate doses of narcotics to patients for fear of government sanction or patient addiction. 
 Patients with pain do not become addicted. This was established about 40 years ago, and can be found in medical tests.
 As an anesthesiologist and pain management specialist, I can tell you that no patient anywhere need suffer the kind of pain you describe. The drugs are cheap. 
 What is needed is both government and physician education and understanding. No one need seek euthanasia. We have the tools -- they just need to be used.
 Garry S. Sklar, M.D. Woodmere, N.Y., Sept. 10, 2007

HEADLINE: The Nordic Option

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Stockholm 
 Think Sweden and what comes to mind is probably not a youthful finance minister, with his long dark hair in a ponytail and a gold ring through his left ear, explaining that his ambition is to make it ''more profitable to work'' than to sit around on welfare.
 But Anders Borg, 39, poster boy of the ''New Moderates'' who have put the long-governing Social Democrats out of office, does just that, and when the question of his coiffure comes up, the retort is swift: ''This is northern Europe, a modern society. Your public deficit or surplus is more important than your hairstyle.'' 
 Right. Sweden, of course, has a surplus that the deficit-ridden United States can only envy, as well as a knack for staying out of wars that borders on the obscene. It's that reasonable, semi-socialist, Volvo-driving, super-taxed Nordic place that gave the world Ikea's cheap furniture and Bergman's dissection of marriage.
 Or is it? The ponytailed finance minister -- a world first? -- is just one sign that something funky is up in the Swedish woods. A government that includes the country's first black, avowedly gay and bisexual ministers (that's three distinct people) has set about a radical reform of the generous welfare state that defined the Swedish condition.
 In doing so, it has adopted a few core principles. It should be more profitable to work than not to work. Welfare should mean caring for people who cannot care for themselves. Unemployment insurance should be adjustment insurance rather than an open-ended sinecure. Employers should be encouraged to hire through lower taxes.
 Hardly rocket science, you might say, but all of this has proved radical enough to make ''systemskifte,'' or ''system shift,'' the buzzword in Sweden. The term might be applied to much of northern Europe, where in recent years the welfare state has been upended even as its essence has been preserved.
 Europe, at peace and undivided, has not been foremost on the American mind of late. Old images of ''Eurosclerosis'' -- the vacationing worker (or non-worker) stripped of initiative by an overbearing nanny state -- have tended to endure. But in countries including Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and to some degree Germany, welfare has ceded to what Borg calls ''work-fair.''
 The transformation has brought streamlined state sectors; more flexible labor markets; a focus on social fairness through improved education and health care rather than through attempts at income redistribution via high taxes; a restored work ethic (''Make Work Pay'' is a Swedish government slogan); and a rediscovery of entrepreneurship and choice.
 ''Our principle is you should show solidarity with people who have problems for a space in their lives, but they should not be supported permanently by the welfare state,'' Tobias Billstrom, the migration minister, says.
 Billstrom is all of 33 and sports multicolored buttons on his shirt. He's a backer of the reforms because Sweden doesn't want the immigrants pouring into the country to think collecting subsidies and working on the black market are the Swedish way.
 Sweden has learned that a rigid labor market is a devastating form of exclusion (France, take note). Its aging population, like others in Europe, needs immigrants to find jobs and so pay the taxes that will fund pensions into the future.
 By slashing unemployment benefits, making it easier and cheaper to hire, offering tax credits to employers taking on people who have been jobless for a long time, and providing tax incentives to lure domestic jobs out the black market, Sweden has cut unemployment to 4.4 percent, or about half the French rate.
 Growth in 2007 of 3.2 percent will be among the highest in Europe and handily top the U.S rate. Surpluses keep accumulating. All nine million Swedes have health insurance, while 47 million Americans, or the equivalent of five Swedens, do not. And the school system delivers high standards.
 Of course, Sweden doesn't have the world to run, and a top personal income tax rate of 56 percent would make Americans pale. Still, Sweden's new Nordic model merits attention.
 ''My idea,'' Borg says, ''is to combine the entrepreneurial spirit of America with the welfare of Sweden. That's my ideal world: the creative impulse and restructured welfare. The lowest quarter of our population is well educated. The United States could learn from that.''
 It could indeed. Northern Europe has looked to America for some of its reforms. America, Iraq-obsessed, has not looked to a changing Europe. A stagnating middle class, losing jobs and health insurance, holds the key to victory for Democratic candidates next year if they can suggest strong programs for better education and universal health care.
 A stop in funky Stockholm is in order for Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack Obama.

HEADLINE: G.M. Talks With Union Said to Be Breaking Down

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley and Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
Talks between the United Automobile Workers and General Motors appeared on the verge of collapse Sunday night, even though the two sides had overcome a major sticking point in the negotiations, the creation of the health care trust that would assume responsibility for workers' benefits.
 The potential breakdown in the talks came nearly two days after contracts covering 73,000 hourly workers expired. 
 The two sides were mainly deadlocked over guarantees sought by the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, for workers who will remain at G.M. once it completes an extensive restructuring next year, people with knowledge of the negotiations said. 
 They insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the private negotiations.
 ''The talks are going bad,'' said one person who had been briefed on the talks.
 Of course, the tenor of negotiations can change rapidly. But if the union decided not to continue discussions with G.M., it would recess the talks there and most likely approach the Ford Motor Company in hopes of reaching an agreement, this person said. 
 Despite the deadlock, a walkout at G.M. did not seem likely. A number of local unions posted notices on their Web sites, asking workers to report for duty Monday as planned.
 The apparent impasse contrasted sharply with the situation earlier on Sunday, when the leaders of some local unions around the country told their members that the two sides were close to reaching a tentative agreement. These officials had said a deal could be announced by the end of the day, and several said Sunday night that they still hoped that would be the case.
 A spokeswoman for General Motors, Katie McBride, declined to comment. A spokesman for the U.A.W. could not be reached.
 The U.A.W. named G.M. as its strike target on Thursday in the talks on a new contract to replace the one that expired at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday. 
 Contracts at Ford and Chrysler were extended, while the union agreed to keep the G.M. contract in place on hour to hour. That would allow it to call a strike at any time.
 If the union tries its chances at Ford, it would be a repeat of negotiations in 1982. At the time, the union was angered by contract terms proposed by G.M., which like Ford was suffering from an economic downturn. 
 The union's then-president, Douglas A. Fraser, recessed the negotiations at G.M. and reached a historic agreement at Ford that traded concessions for involvement in company decisions. It later reached a similar deal at G.M.
 Negotiations with Ford would be a homecoming for Mr. Gettelfinger, who began his career in 1964 at Ford's plant in Louisville, Ky. He headed the union's Ford division before becoming U.A.W president in 2002, and has good relations with its labor officials. 
 Ford is in worse financial shape than G.M., however. It lost $12.6 billion in 2006, and continues to lose money in North America, where it does not expect to be profitable until 2009. And its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, is said to want to reach an agreement that would give Ford more flexibility than the current U.A.W. contract, which is the size of the Manhattan phone book.
 The G.M. talks appeared in danger of breaking down over several matters. One is said to involve Mr. Gettelfiger's demand that G.M. stop sending work outside the United States. Mr. Gettelfinger also was pushing for G.M. to put more cash in the health care trust, called a voluntary employee benefit association, or VEBA. 
 The trust, to be run by the union, would assume a liability that G.M. estimates at $55 billion. G.M., Ford and Chrysler have pushed hard in contract negotiations for the union to take charge of its medical benefits, saying they are a major factor limiting their ability to compete with Japanese auto companies.
 All told, the three companies have health care liabilities totaling nearly $100 billion.

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has promoted himself as a model of fiscal restraint, issuing dire warnings about the slowing economy, recently asking agencies to limit hiring, and even listing ''fiscal responsibility'' as an interest on his MySpace page.
 At the same time, a review of the city's budget since 1980 shows that Mr. Bloomberg has been presiding over one of the greatest expansions of city government since the John V. Lindsay administration, fueled by an extraordinary surge in real estate revenues, both from higher property taxes and transfer taxes from sales.
 Since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, the city budget, adjusted for inflation, has swelled faster than it has under any other mayor during the last 27 years, increasing by 23 percent, to $60 billion. 
 By contrast, spending rose 8 percent during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's eight years, and 4 percent under Mayor David N. Dinkins, who served one four-year term. Mr. Bloomberg's spending also outpaced that of Mayor Edward I. Koch, who increased the budget by 19 percent over his last two terms. 
 No one is predicting a collapse of the city's fiscal stability as a result of the increased spending, and Mr. Bloomberg, who is scheduled to speak about economic policy to Britain's Conservative Party at the end of the month, generally receives high marks for his stewardship of the budget.
 But some worry that New York, along with other cities where the real estate market has been hot, is ill-prepared to grapple with a downturn, having grown accustomed to booming revenues from flush times.
 According to the mayor's Office of Management and Budget, approximately 75 percent of the growth under Mr. Bloomberg has been driven by expenses that are difficult to control, like employee health care costs and benefits, pension payments and Medicaid. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has also significantly increased more discretionary accounts, reflecting his emphasis on quality-of-life issues and his desire to make New York attractive to people and businesses. Spending on parks, often one of the first areas to lose money in lean times, jumped 27 percent over his tenure, to $298 million, for example. The budget at Information Technology has almost tripled to $157 million, largely due to establishing the city's popular 311 service hot line and to upgrading other technology systems.
 Spending on schools jumped 14 percent, to $16 billion, driven by a 40 percent increase in teacher salaries favored by Mr. Bloomberg, among other expenses.
 And although the number of city workers has declined by about 1 percent since Mr. Bloomberg took office, he has been increasing the staff of late, adding nearly 10,000 workers since 2004, bringing the total up to 367,643.
 City officials argue that their approach has been restrained, and that the mayor's investment in services has helped the city thrive, bringing about a still-declining crime rate, cleaner streets and safer traffic conditions.
 ''Any way you look at it, city government has functioned well over the last almost six years,'' said Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor who oversees the budget. ''And the resources the mayor has allocated have been well spent.''
 The New York Times examined overall city spending as reported by the Independent Budget Office, including state and federal aid, dating back to 1980, the earliest year for which reliable records are available. The spending increases described in this article have been adjusted for inflation.
 Of the $60 billion spent in the last fiscal year, $16 billion came from state and federal sources, a smaller percentage than in 2002. 
 When Mr. Bloomberg took office, he inherited a budget punch-drunk from the aftereffects of 9/11 on an already slowing economy, facing a $5 billion deficit in what was then, in 2002 dollars, a $41 billion budget, including $14 billion from Albany and Washington. The mayor spent his first months in office looking for ways to reduce spending through cutting staff and modestly trimming services, but he increased revenue through borrowing and eventually raising taxes, fines and fees.
 ''He very deliberately, early on, made the choice that rather than really jamming down services, he was going to hold the service level and raise taxes,'' said Mark Page, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Bloomberg has also personally contributed tens of millions of dollars to the city, forgoing his salary, paying his own travel expenses, donating to social service and cultural groups whose city grants he trimmed, and supporting projects and experimental programs.
 Since then, Mr. Page added, the growth in population and the economy has led to ''a major increase in revenue that has enabled us to cut taxes and spend more. Smaller class sizes, dividing up large schools, maintaining parks, cleaning streets, what-have-you are all things that people like and they all cost money.'' 
 James Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning research group, said this dynamic was at work in 2003, when the mayor pushed through an 18.5 percent property tax increase. The mayor and City Council agreed to reduce property taxes by 7 percent for this fiscal year. 
 ''He was very clear at the time, saying we can't just slash public services, because we did that in the fiscal crisis and we've been paying for the damage for a long time,'' Mr. Parrott said.
 Although the rise in revenues is overwhelmingly due to growth in the economy, roughly 15 percent of the increase resulted from Mr. Bloomberg's imposition of new taxes and fees, primarily the property tax increase, according to an analysis by the Independent Budget Office, a publicly financed research and policy agency that does not report directly to the mayor. 
 ''He does look to the revenue side to meet needs,'' said Charles Brecher, research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research group and a co-author of ''Power Failure,'' which studied New York politics and policy from 1960 to the early 1990s. 
 ''It's not that he's necessarily taken on new roles for government, but he's put money into education, he's paying people more, and there has been selected expansion in some services.''
 Many fiscal experts applaud the mayor's use of recent windfalls to pay down spiraling long-term expenses, such as future interest on debt and pensions. 
 Still, some analysts see a danger in ever-rising spending based on volatile sources that are eventually bound to decline, like the financial or real estate markets.
 ''You've continued expanding a government that's tuned to run on high-test -- it basically wants to grow at a certain level,'' said E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization. ''It creates unsustainable appetites among all the major consumers of city tax money, and you're still not fixing infrastructure.''
 The spending also underscores Mr. Bloomberg's belief in the power of government to solve problems, a notion that runs counter to the small-government rhetoric of the Republican Party he abandoned in June. 
 Ester R. Fuchs, a political science professor at Columbia University who was a special adviser to the mayor in his first term, said that Mr. Bloomberg's spending pattern represents a new strategy for keeping cities healthy and competitive. 
 ''He was never antigovernment,'' Ms. Fuchs said. ''He actually viewed government as having a role, and by making government both more responsible and efficient, he made people more comfortable with the idea that government could spend the moneyeffectively.''

HEADLINE: Sad Alan's Lament

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
When President Bush first took office, it seemed unlikely that he would succeed in getting his proposed tax cuts enacted. The questionable nature of his installation in the White House seemed to leave him in a weak political position, while the Senate was evenly balanced between the parties. It was hard to see how a huge, controversial tax cut, which delivered most of its benefits to a wealthy elite, could get through Congress.
 Then Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before the Senate Budget Committee. 
 Until then Mr. Greenspan had presented himself as the voice of fiscal responsibility, warning the Clinton administration not to endanger its hard-won budget surpluses. But now Republicans held the White House, and the Greenspan who appeared before the Budget Committee was a very different man. 
 Suddenly, his greatest concern -- the ''emerging key fiscal policy need,'' he told Congress -- was to avert the threat that the federal government might actually pay off all its debt. To avoid this awful outcome, he advocated tax cuts. And the floodgates were opened.
 As it turns out, Mr. Greenspan's fears that the federal government would quickly pay off its debt were, shall we say, exaggerated. And Mr. Greenspan has just published a book in which he castigates the Bush administration for its fiscal irresponsibility.
 Well, I'm sorry, but that criticism comes six years late and a trillion dollars short.
 Mr. Greenspan now says that he didn't mean to give the Bush tax cuts a green light, and that he was surprised at the political reaction to his remarks. There were, indeed, rumors at the time -- which Mr. Greenspan now says were true -- that the Fed chairman was upset about the response to his initial statement. 
 But the fact is that if Mr. Greenspan wasn't intending to lend crucial support to the Bush tax cuts, he had ample opportunity to set the record straight when it could have made a difference.
 His first big chance to clarify himself came a few weeks after that initial testimony, when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. 
 Here's what I wrote following that appearance: ''Mr. Greenspan's performance yesterday, in his first official testimony since he let the genie out of the bottle, was a profile in cowardice. Again and again he was offered the opportunity to say something that would help rein in runaway tax-cutting; each time he evaded the question, often replying by reading from his own previous testimony. He declared once again that he was speaking only for himself, thus granting himself leeway to pronounce on subjects far afield of his role as Federal Reserve chairman. But when pressed on the crucial question of whether the huge tax cuts that now seem inevitable are too large, he said it was inappropriate for him to comment on particular proposals.
 ''In short, Mr. Greenspan defined the rules of the game in a way that allows him to intervene as he likes in the political debate, but to retreat behind the veil of his office whenever anyone tries to hold him accountable for the results of those interventions.''
 I received an irate phone call from Mr. Greenspan after that article, in which he demanded to know what he had said that was wrong. In his book, he claims that Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, was stumped by that question. That's hard to believe, because I certainly wasn't: Mr. Greenspan's argument for tax cuts was contorted and in places self-contradictory, not to mention based on budget projections that everyone knew, even then, were wildly overoptimistic.
 If anyone had doubts about Mr. Greenspan's determination not to inconvenience the Bush administration, those doubts were resolved two years later, when the administration proposed another round of tax cuts, even though the budget was now deep in deficit. And guess what? The former high priest of fiscal responsibility did not object. 
 And in 2004 he expressed support for making the Bush tax cuts permanent -- remember, these are the tax cuts he now says he didn't endorse -- and argued that the budget should be balanced with cuts in entitlement spending, including Social Security benefits, instead. Of course, back in 2001 he specifically assured Congress that cutting taxes would not threaten Social Security.
 In retrospect, Mr. Greenspan's moral collapse in 2001 was a portent. It foreshadowed the way many people in the foreign policy community would put their critical faculties on hold and support the invasion of Iraq, despite ample evidence that it was a really bad idea. 
 And like enthusiastic war supporters who have started describing themselves as war critics now that the Iraq venture has gone wrong, Mr. Greenspan has started portraying himself as a critic of administration fiscal irresponsibility now that President Bush has become deeply unpopular and Democrats control Congress.

HEADLINE: A 'Disappointed' Greenspan Lashes Out at Bush's Economic Policies

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS. 
David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 

 BODY:
After nearly two decades as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan wants to solidify his standing in history. 
 In an interview timed with the release of his memoir Monday, Mr. Greenspan sought to distance himself from the economic policies of President Bush and refute critics who say his policies at the Fed contributed to the housing bubble and bust that is now roiling the economy.
 Mr. Greenspan unleashed bottled-up frustration about President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Republican leaders in Congress who, he contends, put politics ahead of Republican goals like fiscal discipline and lower government spending. 
 ''I'm just very disappointed,'' he said glumly, as he sat in his living room. ''Smaller government, lower spending, lower taxes, less regulation -- they had the resources to do it, they had the knowledge to do it, they had the political majorities to do it. And they didn't.''
 In the end, he said, ''political control trumped policy, and they achieved neither political control nor policy.''
 Mr. Greenspan, a lifelong Republican who presided over the longest sustained economic expansion in American history, sounded frustrated that neither a Republican White House nor Republican leaders in Congress were heeding his quiet pleas for greater fiscal discipline.
 Mr. Greenspan said he met frequently at the White House with President Bush and Vice President Cheney, but his enthusiasm for the new administration cooled as he discovered that Mr. Bush ignored much of his advice.
 In his first term, Mr. Bush would rarely let a week go by without visiting a small business or a camera-friendly factory to extol entrepreneurship or the importance of tax cuts. But back at the White House, Mr. Greenspan got virtually no response to his advice that the president veto spending bills. Mr. Greenspan said he was told his recommendations would be ''taken under advisement.''
 His observations are in line with those of others who engaged Mr. Bush frequently, including the former Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, who was fired in December 2002. After the Sept. 11 attacks, they said, Mr. Bush would become animated and even passionate about counterterrorism or the war in Iraq. But they said that broader economic discussions bored him, unless he could take them to the factory floor.
 Mr. Greenspan has always been acutely aware of the explosive impact that his public comments could have in both political and economic circles. He never criticized specific Republican or Democratic politicians while he was at the Federal Reserve, even when he was under attack from one side or the other.
 But in the interview, Mr. Greenspan seemed dismayed that leaders in his own party paid little heed to his pleas for spending restraint and for ''pay-as-you-go'' rules that would require Congress to offset the cost of new tax cuts with savings elsewhere. He repeated the conclusion about the Republicans' loss of Congressional control in the 2006 elections: ''They deserved to lose.''
 Mr. Greenspan also spelled out his own views about the war in Iraq: he supported the invasion, he says, not because Saddam Hussein might have had weapons of mass destruction, but because Saddam had shown a clear desire to capture the Middle East's oil fields.
 ''I supported taking out Saddam, because he was moving inexorably toward taking the world's oil resources,'' he said. ''Iraq was a far greater threat than Iran to the world scene.''
 But Mr. Greenspan also seemed intent on protecting his reputation in history about a debacle that is a focus of his successors at the Federal Reserve: the housing bubble that peaked while he was chairman of the Fed and the bust that now threatens to tip the overall economy into a recession.
 Though he says little about the issue in his book, ''The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World,'' (Penguin Press, $35) Mr. Greenspan sought to staunchly refute charges that he contributed to the housing bubble by cutting interest rates from 2001 until 2004 and by making little effort to regulate the explosion of risky new mortgages.
 On Tuesday, after a month of almost unremitting turmoil in financial markets, Ben S. Bernanke, Mr. Greenspan's successor as Fed chairman, will preside over a crucial Fed policy meeting to decide whether and how much to lower interest rates in order to prevent a broader economic downturn.
 Mr. Greenspan, 81, acknowledged that the housing frenzy had been pumped up in part because of very low interest rates and in part because of the growing willingness of mortgage lenders to underwrite dubious and often fraudulent loans that were much bigger than many borrowers could realistically afford.
 But he said it was a mistake to blame the Fed, which needed to reduce interest rates in order to fend off the recession of 2001 and what many economists thought was a real risk of the kind of ''deflation,'' an across-the-board drop in consumer prices, that had plagued Japan. 
 John B. Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former under secretary of the Treasury under President Bush, recently argued that the Fed's rate cuts after 2001 appeared to have exaggerated both the housing boom and bust. 
 ''There has been a bit of historical revisionism going on,'' Mr. Greenspan grumbled. The real force behind soaring real estate prices, he said, was a global one: a drop in worldwide inflation and interest rates, in part because of the end of the Cold War and the rise of China as a manufacturing colossus. 
 ''The housing boom is not an American phenomenon -- it's a worldwide phenomenon,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''The evidence is quite overwhelming that what we are going through is a consequence of the fall of the Soviet Union and the shift of a billion workers from central planning in to the labor market.''
 The United States was only one of 40 countries that experience a housing boom after 2000, he said, and all of the booms were driven in part by low interest rates.
 ''If you line up all the major developed countries and all the developing countries, leaving out the Zimbabwes, inflation rates were all in single digits. This is utterly unprecedented, there is no history like this. And the consequence was a fairly dramatic decline in real interest rates, which created dramatic housing price increases around the world.''

HEADLINE: Debt Market Looks to Fed To Ease Fear

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Lou Gervolino, a business executive from the San Francisco area, watched mortgage rates climb last month when he looked to refinance a jumbo home loan. 
 In London, Cheyne Capital's portfolio managers were forced to unwind a big investment fund. And consumers in the United States faced the prospect of higher prices as corporate borrowing costs for everything from cars to computers continued to rise.
 The common thread in all three was asset-backed commercial paper -- the market for short-term loans backed by mortgages, credit card debt and business loans that had all but come to a standstill, helping to create a credit squeeze on Wall Street.
 Today, as the Federal Reserve's policy making board meets, the commercial paper market, which has started to loosen, will be a factor that Fed governors will consider as they decide on a rate cut. 
 Investors assume that the central bank will reduce the overnight federal funds rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point, to 5 percent. 
 But many market analysts say that will not be enough to restore confidence. Some traders have been agitating for a rate cut of half a percentage point, saying that it would help ease credit and give stocks a lift. But it could raise fears of inflation and suggest that the Fed was more worried about the economy than previously thought.
 ''It would be catastrophic if they fail to cut rates -- not because they should appease the markets every time but because of the degree of instability in the last couple of weeks,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, an independent research firm. ''It is a question of what the markets need as much as what they want.''
 The stock markets declined slightly yesterday ahead of the Fed meeting, and Wall Street's reaction today could hinge as much on the wording of the accompanying statement as on the size of any rate cut.
 A wave of problems is already hitting the economy, including a worsening housing market and higher gasoline prices, which threaten to crimp consumer spending. And the economy could be in for more jolts. 
 This week, four major brokerage firms -- Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley -- will report third-quarter earnings, the first since the credit market turmoil began. And the chief financial officer of Bank of America, Joe L. Price,' said yesterday that the turbulence would have a ''meaningful impact'' on third-quarter earnings, following on the heels of a profit warning from Merrill Lynch last week. 
 Problems stemming from the inability to issue asset-backed commercial paper -- from higher funding costs to the prospect of a major logjam that could derail the banking system -- have only added to the list of woes. 
 ''The Fed can reduce the cost of funding, and that helps,'' said Christian Stracke, an analyst at CreditSights, an independent fixed-income research firm. ''But it really needs to find a way to restore the quantity of funding -- and there is no easy solution.''
 Until recently, the asset-backed commercial paper market had been considered a safe haven for investors. It had also been a cheap and steady source of short-term financing for mortgage companies, credit card and auto lenders and other blue-chip companies. 
 But panic over the quality of assets backing the commercial paper caused the market to freeze. Issuers have found fewer buyers, reducing the market by $200 billion, to about $1 trillion, in the last few weeks. Yields have surged. And tenures on the short-term notes, essentially i.o.u.'s to be repaid in three to nine months, have been shortened to a week or even a day. 
 To be sure, there have been signs of stabilization. Asset backed-commercial paper levels declined $21.6 billion, to $945.1 billion, last week, compared with a $31.3 billion drop the week before. Spreads have narrowed, but no one is willing to declare victory.
 ''It's better, but it's still not great,'' said Alex Roever, a JPMorgan analyst who follows the commercial paper market. ''We are still a long way from being anywhere near normal, and our gains are kind of tenuous, too.'' 
 Since mid-July, investors in the asset-backed commercial paper have been on edge. The first signs emerged when IKB, a German bank, was unable to step in to provide emergency funds to one of its off-balance sheet vehicles that was unable to refinance its commercial paper. 
 To avert a crisis, IKB's largest shareholder, a German government-sponsored bank, agreed to provide the money. 
 As investors became skittish, banks began hoarding cash, causing the rate at which they borrow from each other to rise. The European Central Bank poured billions into the market to add liquidity.
 Then the bankruptcy filing of American Home Mortgage in early August sent a shockwave through the commercial paper market. The lender's notes carried a special feature: an option to delay paying back the money it borrowed in the unlikely event it could not refinance. 
 But the unlikely occurred. Investors who thought they had bought 30-day notes were holding 180-day notes. Deferments by other commercial paper issuers only compounded their fears, causing them to shun this type of commercial paper. 
 Also in August, commercial paper programs known as conduits came under scrutiny. Banks typically use these off-balance sheet vehicles on behalf of clients to issue short-term notes. 
 But the transparency of the contents of the conduits was poor, and as investors lost confidence in the credit ratings, they began to worry that they could be on the hook for bad mortgages that were bundled into investment grade pools.
 Some eschewed asset-backed commercial paper altogether. Others demanded higher yields, and the spreads on asset-backed commercial paper began to widen, on average, by as much as 10 to 50 basis points over the London interbank -- a huge surge in corporate borrowing costs. 
 ''It pushes up the cost of credit, and that cost ultimately gets pushed up from the market to the borrowers and from the borrowers to their customers,'' Mr. Roever, the JPMorgan analyst, said. 
 ''To the degree those individuals don't bear the cost, it puts a drag on growth,'' he said. 
 Meanwhile, several structured investment vehicles, which issue short-term notes to invest in longer-term securities with higher yields, were struggling to refinance. Most operated under rules that required them to liquidate their holdings if the prices of the assets plunged. 
 That is what happened to Cheyne Finance in late August, a S.I.V. that began selling its assets after the prices of mortgage and home equity loans underlying its commercial paper program collapsed. At least five other S.I.V.'s face the prospect of similar troubles -- and unless bank sponsors step in, many analysts fear more could be at risk.
 All of this has put tremendous pressure on commercial banks, which are on the hook for billions of dollars in backup financing on top of bringing billions of dollars worth of buyout loans. 
 ''The largest risk seems that, if this liquidity crisis continues and the banks keep funding large chunks of assets,'' a recent Citigroup report said, ''the credit crunch will spread to corporates and the wider consumer sector.''

HEADLINE: Cigarettes Are Costly, but Often Less So in Chinatown

BYLINE: By ANGELICA MEDAGLIA

 BODY:
All over Chinatown, cigarette butts dot the sidewalks: blue, white and brown ends labeled with names like Seven Wolves in Chinese, Shuanxshi and Yes in English. But the most common name is Marlboro.
 The stubs are tangible evidence of the ready supply of illegal cigarettes in Chinatown, available at sidewalk stalls and variety stores, where they typically sell for $4 a pack -- as much as $3.50 less than those sold legally. They include Chinese brands and knockoffs of popular American brands smuggled into the United States, all untaxed.
 Under the Manhattan Bridge, a popular shopping place for many immigrants from Fujian Province, there are illegal cigarettes for sale amid the shopping stalls, the private bus operators, the makeshift employment agencies and the booths where international calling cards are sold. Cautious vendors sell cigarettes mostly to customers they already know: people who speak Fujianese, people who work in restaurants, people waiting for buses to take them to jobs in Washington or Richmond, Va. 
 Neither the merchants who sell them nor the people who buy them are willing to speak publicly about the black market. But several smokers who said they had smoked counterfeit Marlboros or Chinese brands said that they bought them because they were cheap; some said they thought they were buying legitimate brands at bargain prices. 
 The smuggling and sale of illicit Chinese cigarettes has long been a challenge for law enforcement agencies in New York. And it appears to be growing, but reliable statistics on the volume of the trade are not available. 
 ''It is a problem,'' said Joseph Green, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives. ''Eight years ago, say, there were only 100 investigations, and now we have several hundred'' in New York State.
 In a raid at a warehouse in Corona, Queens, in August, federal and local authorities found 600,000 cartons of cigarettes, many marked ''made in China''; 125,000 counterfeit tax stamps from Kentucky, Virginia and New York; and $350,000 in cash. 
 In April, the police seized 243,000 cartons of counterfeit Marlboros and Newports from China as they were being unloaded from a van into a self-storage facility in College Point, Queens.
 Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest tobacco company -- whose Marlboro brand is one of the most popular among bootleggers -- helps law enforcement officers distinguish between genuine brands and counterfeit ones by checking obvious and more subtle features in the packaging. 
 Counterfeiting is so prevalent that the British American Tobacco company, the world's second largest publicly traded tobacco group, estimates the total loss of sales incurred by tobacco companies at roughly $4 billion per year. 
 And some tobacco companies have started researching electronic chips and other technology that would help customs authorities at airports sort the legitimate brands from the fake. 
 So far this year, the police, in precincts throughout the city, have received about 240 complaints about contraband cigarettes from cigarette retailers and customers. Other numbers tell a similar story about the prevalence of illicit cigarettes. A survey conducted in 2006 by the state's Department of Health found that nearly half of the smokers interviewed in New York City said that they had bought illegal cigarettes within the year. 
 The black market in cigarettes in New York is run largely by Chinese and Russian groups, according to Mr. Green, of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives. 
 Yet, though Chinatown offers a large market for contraband cigarettes, smoking rates among Asians are lower than for any other racial or ethnic group in New York, according to the city's health department. Beyond the legal issues, there are health concerns. Contraband cigarettes have been shown in studies to contain higher levels of toxic metals, like lead, than legitimate brands do. 
 In Chinatown, Louisa Lam works with people trying to kick their smoking habits at Gouverneur Healthcare Services and hears reasons that keep the market thriving. 
 There was a high school student who said he bought counterfeit Marlboros because he did not want to ask his mother, a home health aide, for the money for real ones. 
 And there are some older people, suffering from smoking-related illnesses, who buy Chinese brands in the belief that they have less nicotine than the American ones. 
 ''Most of them will tell you it is not as strong,'' Ms. Lam said of the flavor of the Chinese brands. ''But nobody really knows what's in the cigarettes.'' 
 About a year and a half ago, Hunter College began a smoking-cessation program intended especially for Chinese restaurant workers, but the program has had few takers. Recruiters visited about 500 restaurants in Chinatown, Queens and Brooklyn, but only about 65 smokers signed up for nine sessions of telephone counseling and a $90 reward.
 One restaurant worker, Toiyan Auyeung, who lives in Pittsburgh and was in New York recently awaiting a bus to Maryland for a restaurant job, said, through an interpreter, that he did not want to buy illegal cigarettes and that he relied on a friend to buy him real Marlboros in Chinatown. ''I can't figure out,'' he said, ''which ones are real and which are fake.''

HEADLINE: Eritreans Deny American Accusations of Terrorist Ties

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Sept. 17 

 BODY:
Eritrean officials, responding to American accusations that they have abetted terrorists in the volatile Horn of Africa, defended their actions on Monday and said that while they would like to have better relations with the United States, they had no intention of bowing to American pressure.
 Over the weekend, the Eritrean government held a conference for Somali opposition leaders that included some prominent Islamists whom Jendayi E. Frazer, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, has called terrorists. 
 American officials have threatened to list Eritrea as a state sponsor of terrorism, accusing it of funneling weapons to Somali insurgents. But on Monday, Eritrean officials denied that they were trying to destabilize Somalia, and said their conference was a legitimate way to rebuild the shattered country. 
 More than that, said Ali Abdu, Eritrea's information minister, if Ms. Frazer was trying to make ''Eritrea kneel down in front of her,'' she had better learn what he called a basic Eritrean fact.
 ''Eritreans kneel on only two occasions,'' he said. ''When they pray and when they shoot.''
 In the past few weeks, Eritrea has become a worsening headache for American policy makers. Its capital, Asmara, has become a magnet for rebel leaders from across East Africa. Its troops are building up on the disputed border of Ethiopia, which has already been a flash point for war. What little taste Eritrean officials had for diplomatic niceties seems to have disappeared. 
 Eritrea has been fiercely independent from the moment the country broke off from Ethiopia in 1993. Back then, it was a darling of the West, considered the little-country-that-could and held up as a model of a crime-free, egalitarian African nation.
 But in the late 1990s, things changed. Eritrea and Ethiopia went to war over Badame, a seemingly insignificant border town, and 100,000 people were killed. 
 American diplomats helped broker a truce but then backed off after Ethiopia decided to ignore a United Nations-supported commission that said Badame belonged to Eritrea.
 ''We expected the Americans to be fair,'' said Yemane Gebre Meskel, the chief of staff for Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea's president. ''They weren't.''
 The Bush administration sees Ethiopia, with its 77 million people and one of Africa's largest armies, as the best bulwark in the Horn of Africa against Islamist extremism, so the United States has consistently taken Ethiopia's side against Eritrea, population five million, said Representative Donald M. Payne, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa.
 ''And that's not productive,'' he said. ''Right now we're boxing Eritrea into a corner.''
 But Bush administration officials say Eritrea is fueling the growing violence in Somalia, and point to a United Nations report in July that said Eritrea had covertly shipped planeloads of weapons to Islamist fighters there. Eritrean officials say the report was fabricated. 
 Last winter, American and Ethiopian military forces teamed up to oust an Islamist movement that briefly controlled Somalia's seaside capital, Mogadishu, and install Somalia's weak transitional government in the city. It has not worked. An Iraq-style insurgency is burning its way across the country, with roadside bombs, political assassinations and suicide attacks, which were unheard of in Somalia until the Ethiopians arrived. Some diplomats have another name for Mogadishu: Baghdad by the Sea.
 Ms. Frazer has also accused the Eritreans of arming separatist rebels in Ethiopia's eastern Ogaden region, a charge that the rebels and Eritreans deny. If the United States did designate Eritrea a state sponsor of terrorism, a possibility that Ms. Frazer raised last month, it would result in severe economic sanctions and put Eritrea in the same club as Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan and Cuba.
 ''I think it's 50-50 right now whether this happens,'' said a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 Some experts on the region contend that Eritrea has proven a reliable partner in combating Muslim extremism in recent years. It fought Sudan in the 1990s, when Osama bin Laden lived in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, and it championed Sudanese rebels in the south and in Darfur.
 ''If there is one country where the fighting of extremists and terrorists was a priority when it mattered, it was Eritrea,'' said Ted Dagne, an Africa specialist for the Congressional Research Service.
 The Eritreans say the same thing. 
 ''We have cooperated before with the Americans, and we can cooperate at any time,'' Mr. Yemane said. ''We are hoping to put this cycle of misunderstandings behind us.''
 Those misunderstandings include diplomatic harassment on both sides, with the Eritreans demanding to inspect confidential diplomatic pouches of the American Embassy in Asmara and the Americans closing down an Eritrean consulate in Oakland, Calif.
 European diplomats have taken a less confrontational approach, praising Eritrea for its role as regional peacemaker. In the past year, Eritrea helped broker a peace plan for eastern Sudan and held several meetings on Darfur, bringing scores of rebels to Asmara, a time capsule for perfectly preserved 1930s Art Deco architecture built by the Italian colonists. 
 At the same time, some Western human rights groups have accused Eritrea of cracking down ruthlessly on dissent. On Monday, the French organization Reporters Without Borders issued a statement accusing Eritrea of holding 12 journalists in secret prisons.
 Mr. Abdu, the information minister, denied that Eritrea punished people without due cause, but said the government had taken steps to protect itself from its many enemies.
 ''You must remember we are in a state of war,'' he said, referring to the unresolved border standoff with Ethiopia, which in recent months has drawn thousands of troops from each side.
 A European Union official who works closely with Eritrea said the country was ''obsessed with survival.''
 ''And because of that,'' he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ''the Eritreans are very hard to push.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Surged 36% In August, Report Says

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The number of homes entering foreclosure, being auctioned and repossessed by banks jumped by 36 percent in August from the month before, with cities in California, Florida and Nevada showing the biggest increases, according to a report to be released today. 
 The report from RealtyTrac, a company that tracks public foreclosure filings nationally, attributes a big part of the rise to mortgage companies being forced to take ownership of homes because borrowers have fallen behind on payments and their properties were not sold at auction.
 The sharp increases provide more evidence that the troubles in the housing and mortgage markets may prove long-lived, given that home prices are falling in many parts of the country, there is a large inventory of unsold homes and the job market is starting to weaken. 
 Housing specialists are also concerned about a big wave of adjustable-rate mortgages that will be reset to higher, variable interest rates in the coming months.
 Nationally, there were 243,947 foreclosure filings in the month, accounting for one in every 510 households, according to the report. That is up 36 percent from July and 115 percent from August 2006. Filings were up 48 percent from July in California, 77 percent in Florida and 21 percent in Nevada, which has the highest foreclosure rates in the country at one in 165 households.
 Foreclosure filings rose across most of the country, and the biggest increases were in Midwestern states that have struggled with job losses in manufacturing industries and in states where the real estate boom was most frenzied.
 RealtyTrac's data is based on courthouse filings from 2,500 of the nation's more than 3,000 counties. Some mortgage industry officials caution that data based on those filings may be incomplete or may lead to double counting of some homes.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Turmoil Hits E*Trade Hard, Prompting Earnings Warning

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The online brokerage firm E*Trade Financial warned yesterday that it had been badly bruised by the mortgage market crisis and sharply lowered its full-year forecast, sending shares plummeting 8.5 percent in extended trading. 
 E*Trade said its 2007 earnings would be 31 percent below its previously issued forecast as a result of increased provisions for loan losses and potential declines in the value of some securities. It also said it intended to exit the wholesale mortgage business.
 Another financial services company, the mortgage and vehicle fleet company PHH Corporation, which agreed in March to be acquired by General Electric and the Blackstone Group, said that its takeover could collapse because Blackstone faced a shortfall of up to $750 million in debt financing.
 Also, EverBank Financial said yesterday that it had canceled an agreement to buy roughly $2.5 billion of the assets of NetBank, a struggling Internet bank.
 E*Trade's mortgage portfolio of about $30 billion mostly consists of third-party loans bought from lenders or brokers. E*Trade originated only about $1 billion of the loans.
 E*Trade's president and chief operating officer, R. Jarrett Lilien, said the total loan-loss provision for the second half of 2007 was $245 million, given the mortgage crisis. The loan-loss provision for the first half of the year was about $55 million. 
 E*Trade lowered its full-year earnings outlook from a range of $1.53 to $1.67 a share to $1.05 to $1.15 a share.
 PHH said Blackstone told G.E. in a letter that it received revised interpretations on debt availability for the deal from JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers that could result in a shortfall of up to $750 million. The deal struck in March to acquire PHH was done at $31.50 a share in cash, or about $1.8 billion.
 Blackstone will continue to seek debt financing but is not optimistic, PHH said. Blackstone has also said there can be no assurances that conditions to close the deal will be satisfied, PHH added.
 Under the terms of the March transaction, G.E. was to retain PHH's vehicle fleet company, PHH Arval, and then sell PHH Mortgage to Blackstone immediately after closing. PHH shares fell 16.8 percent, to $24.24, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 EverBank, which is privately held, agreed in May to buy some of NetBank's consumer and brokerage deposits, as well as its business finance unit and other assets.
 The deal was expected to close in early summer, but EverBank said ''it became clear'' that NetBank could not meet conditions required to close and to win regulatory approval. 
 On July 1, EverBank, based in Jacksonville, Fla., did complete the purchase of NetBank's mortgage servicing portfolio.
 NetBank, based in Alpharetta, Ga., has struggled with mounting operating losses amid a tough interest-rate environment and lower mortgage originations.
 It was not immediately clear what options NetBank still had for its remaining operations. The company did not immediately return a call seeking comment. NetBank shares rose 1 cent, to 8 cents, on the Pink Sheets.
