HEADLINE: Qatar's Sovereign Wealth Fund Takes Profit on a Stake in Barclays Bank of Britain

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Qatar announced Tuesday that it would sell a part of its stake in the British bank Barclays after the value of its investment almost doubled.
 Qatar's sovereign wealth fund said it would sell 379 million shares in the bank, exercising warrants that it had agreed to buy a year ago when the bank was suffering at the height of the financial crisis. 
 The fund will retain a 7 percent stake in Barclays and will remain the bank's largest shareholder. 
 Shares of Barclays rose fivefold in the last eight months after the bank avoided the government's cash injection, acquired the assets in the United States of Lehman Brothers and benefited from strong earnings at its securities unit.
 Qatar would make a profit of about $:634 million ($1.03 billion) on the investment based on Monday's share price as it paid 198 pence a share to exercise the warrants. 
 Barclays is set to get $:750 million as a result of the sale to strengthen its capital base, Qatar said.
 Shares in Barclays fell about 5 percent on Tuesday. 
 ''The decision to exercise the warrants and dispose of the resultant shares forms part of Qatar Holding's portfolio management program and does not impact on our current intention to remain a long-term strategic shareholder in Barclays,'' Ahmad al-Sayed, the investment group's chief executive, said. 
 The sale renewed speculation among investors that Qatar's sovereign wealth fund could be raising cash for another acquisition. 
 Shares of the British supermarket chain J Sainsbury rose as much as 20 percent last Thursday because some investors had expected Qatar to make a takeover bid or try to increase its current shareholding of about 15 percent. 
 Shares in Sainsbury, which rebuffed a takeover proposal by Qatar in 2007, rose 4 percent Tuesday in London.
 John S. Varley, Barclays' chief executive, said the effect of the sale ''will be further to broaden the base of our share register.'' 
 ''Qatar Holdings is our largest shareholder and a key partner,'' he said. Qatar initially bought a 6.2 percent stake in Barclays in July of last year and increased the holding to about 7 percent, excluding warrants and share options, in October because the bank needed to raise capital to avoid taking government aid. 
 At that time, Barclays sold shares and warrants to Abu Dhabi's royal family and Challenger Universal, a Qatari investment vehicle.

HEADLINE: Inquiry to Focus on Royalty Rates for Oil Shale Program

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The Interior Department said Tuesday that it would investigate a decision made by the Bush administration to grant low royalty rates for oil shale development in the Rocky Mountains.
 Ken Salazar, the secretary of the interior, expressed ''serious concerns'' about changes made without public notice to six leases on Jan. 15. He asked the department's inspector general, Mary Kendall, to look into the matter. 
 The announcement came as Mr. Salazar said he would resume a research program for oil shale development on federal lands in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah. Mr. Salazar had frozen oil shale developments within weeks of his appointment last February, saying more research was needed into the technology.
 The investigation will focus on a decision taken by the Interior Department in the final days of the Bush administration to lock in a royalty rate of only 5 percent on 30,000 acres of existing oil shale leases for oil companies, Mr. Salazar said. By comparison, royalty rates, which are payments to the government for the right to operate, in the Gulf of Mexico are 16.7 percent. 
 ''Taxpayers deserve answers to serious questions about why these lease addenda were granted at the eleventh hour, under what circumstances, and at what potential expense to the federal treasury,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''We must reform our nation's oil shale program.'' 
 Oil shale is a sedimentary rock that can release oil when heated. But while the potential reserves are considerable, the current technology remains too expensive to produce at current oil prices. Environmental groups also consider oil shale among one the dirtiest fossil fuels to produce because of the energy that is required to heat the rocks and unlock the trapped liquids. Such groups hailed the latest inquiry.
 ''We are encouraged that Secretary Salazar is looking to make decisions based on an open and accountable system that will protect our land, not the corporate favoritism of the previous administration,'' said Bobby McEnaney, at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
 Oil shale deposits in the Green River formation in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah hold an estimated 800 billion barrels of potential resources, or more than three times the total known oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. More than 70 percent of American oil shale lie on federal land.
 Under the new program, oil companies will be allowed to bid for 160-acre leases to demonstrate whether they can produce oil shale in an economic manner, and will then be able to add an additional 480 acres to their leases, substantially less than in the Bush-era program. Their bids will be reviewed by a team of federal and state officials. 
 ''We have a duty to ensure that potential oil shale development is done responsibly,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''We want to avoid the booms and busts of the past.''

HEADLINE: Volcker's Voice, Often Heeded, Fails to Sell a Bank Strategy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Listen to a top economist in the Obama administration describe Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who endorsed Mr. Obama early in his election campaign and who stood by his side during the financial crisis. 
 ''The guy's a giant, he's a genius, he is a great human being,'' said Austan D. Goolsbee, counselor to Mr. Obama since their Chicago days. ''Whenever he has advice, the administration is very interested.''
 Well, not lately. The aging Mr. Volcker (he is 82) has some advice, deeply felt. He has been offering it in speeches and Congressional testimony, and repeating it to those around the president, most of them young enough to be his children. 
 He wants the nation's banks to be prohibited from owning and trading risky securities, the very practice that got the biggest ones into deep trouble in 2008. And the administration is saying no, it will not separate commercial banking from investment operations. 
 ''I am not pounding the desk all the time, but I am making my point,'' Mr. Volcker said in one of his infrequent on-the-record interviews. ''I have talked to some senators who asked me to talk to them, and if people want to talk to me, I talk to them. But I am not going around knocking on doors.''
 Still, he does head the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which makes him the administration's most prominent outside economic adviser. As Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, he helped the country weather more than one crisis. And in the campaign last year, he appeared occasionally with Mr. Obama, including a town hall meeting in Florida last fall. His towering presence (he is 6-foot-8) offered reassurance that the candidate's economic policies, in the midst of a crisis, were trustworthy. 
 More subtly, Mr. Obama has in Mr. Volcker an adviser perceived as standing apart from Wall Street, and critical of its ways, some administration officials say, while Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, chief of the National Economic Council, are seen, rightly or wrongly, as more sympathetic to the concerns of investment bankers.
 For all these reasons, Mr. Volcker's approach to financial regulation cannot be just brushed off -- and Mr. Goolsbee, speaking for the administration, is careful not to do so. ''We have discussed these issues with Paul Volcker extensively,'' he said. 
 Mr. Volcker's proposal would roll back the nation's commercial banks to an earlier era, when they were restricted to commercial banking and prohibited from engaging in risky Wall Street activities. 
 The Obama team, in contrast, would let the giants survive, but would regulate them extensively, so they could not get themselves and the nation into trouble again. While the administration's proposal languishes, giants like Goldman Sachs have re-engaged in old trading practices, once again earning big profits and planning big bonuses.
 Mr. Volcker argues that regulation by itself will not work. Sooner or later, the giants, in pursuit of profits, will get into trouble. The administration should accept this and shield commercial banking from Wall Street's wild ways. 
 ''The banks are there to serve the public,'' Mr. Volcker said, ''and that is what they should concentrate on. These other activities create conflicts of interest. They create risks, and if you try to control the risks with supervision, that just creates friction and difficulties'' and ultimately fails.
 The only viable solution, in the Volcker view, is to break up the giants. JPMorgan Chase would have to give up the trading operations acquired from Bear Stearns. Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would go back to being separate companies. Goldman Sachs could no longer be a bank holding company. It's a tall order, and to achieve it Congress would have to enact a modern-day version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which mandated separation. 
 Glass-Steagall was watered down over the years and finally revoked in 1999. In the Volcker resurrection, commercial banks would take deposits, manage the nation's payments system, make standard loans and even trade securities for their customers -- just not for themselves. The government, in return, would rescue banks that fail.
 On the other side of the wall, investment houses would be free to buy and sell securities for their own accounts, borrowing to leverage these trades and thus multiplying the profits, and the risks. 
 Being separated from banks, the investment houses would no longer have access to federally insured deposits to finance this trading. If one failed, the government would supervise an orderly liquidation. None would be too big to fail -- a designation that could arise for a handful of institutions under the administration's proposal. 
 ''People say I'm old-fashioned and banks can no longer be separated from nonbank activity,'' Mr. Volcker said, acknowledging criticism that he is nostalgic for an earlier era. ''That argument,'' he added ruefully, ''brought us to where we are today.''
 He may not be alone in his proposal, but he is nearly so. Most economists and policy makers argue that a global economy requires that America have big financial institutions to compete against others in Europe and Asia. An administration spokesman says the Obama proposal for reform would result in financial institutions that could fail without damaging the system. 
 Still, a handful side with Mr. Volcker, among them Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics at Columbia and a former official in the Clinton administration. ''We would have a cleaner, safer banking system,'' Mr. Stiglitz said, adding that while he endorses Mr. Volcker's proposal, the former Fed chairman is nevertheless embarked on a quixotic journey. 
 Alan Greenspan, the only other former Fed chairman still living, favored the repeal of Glass-Steagall a decade ago and, unlike Mr. Volcker, would not bring it back now. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but in response to e-mailed questions he cited two recent public statements in which he suggested that the nation's largest financial institutions become smaller, so that none would be too big to fail, requiring a federal rescue. 
 Taking issue implicitly with the Volcker proposal to split commercial and investment banking, he has said: ''No form of economic organization can fully contain bouts of destructive speculative euphoria.''
 For his part, Mr. Volcker is careful to explain that he supports 80 percent of the administration's detailed plan for financial regulation, including much higher capital requirements and ''guidelines'' on pay. Wall Street compensation, he said in a recent television interview, ''has gotten grotesquely large.''
 Before the credit crisis, the big institutions earned most of their profits from proprietary trading, and those profits led to giant bonuses. Mr. Volcker argues that splitting commercial and investment banking would put a damper on both pay and risky trading practices. 
 His disagreement with the Obama people on whether to restore some version of Glass-Steagall appears to have contributed to published reports that his influence in the administration is fading and that he is rarely if ever in the small Washington office assigned to him.
 He operates from his own offices in New York, communicating with administration officials and other members of the advisory board mainly by telephone. (He does not use e-mail, although his support staff does.) He travels infrequently to Washington, he says, and when he does, the visits are too short to bother with the office. The advisory board has been asked to study, amid other issues, the tax law on corporate profits earned overseas, hardly a headline concern.
 So Mr. Volcker scoffs at the reports that he is losing clout. ''I did not have influence to start with,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes a Health Care Hiatus

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As Congressional leaders and White House officials huddle behind closed doors to settle their differences on health care legislation, one of the most powerful voices in the debate -- President Obama's -- has grown noticeably quieter. 
 After spending much of the summer and most of September banging his presidential drum in favor of a health care overhaul, Mr. Obama, entering what one senior White House official called ''a quiet period,'' is intentionally lowering his public profile on the issue, for the moment. 
 The idea, aides said, is for the president to take a breather while Democrats resolve their internal conflicts, so he can come back strong with a fresh sales pitch when the legislation moves closer to floor votes.
 ''I think his time is better spent on this particular issue in conversation with members and in talking to his own advisers and instructing them on how to proceed,'' David Axelrod, senior adviser to the president, said in an interview Tuesday. ''That's the phase that we're in.''
 But after his stream of all but nonstop public appearances on his top domestic priority, Mr. Obama's health care hiatus raises some questions: Was his continued presence counterproductive? Might his high profile prove to have been too polarizing as Democratic leaders negotiate through a thicket of political considerations in search of a deal that can get through the House and the Senate? Did the president stop talking because the public had stopped listening?
 ''He's been in very great danger of people hitting the mute button when he comes on television to talk about health care,'' said David Gergen, who has advised both Republican and Democratic presidents on communications strategy. ''So I think it's wise to take a pause here and come back in full voice to make his case, because people are going to be more ready to listen again.''
 On Capitol Hill, some Democrats seemed to agree Tuesday.
 ''I don't know how much it helps, but it certainly doesn't hurt the process to have him quiet,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat who has been a less than enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Obama's health care agenda.
 Mr. Obama has not, of course, stopped talking about health care altogether. He used his weekly address on Saturday to take a swing at the insurance companies, which he accused of ''rolling out the big guns and breaking open their massive war chest to marshal their forces for one last fight to save the status quo.''
 And in New York on Tuesday night, he told volunteers for Organizing for America, his campaign arm, that Democrats, who ''can be their own worst enemy,'' should ''keep our eye on the prize'' and come together around a health care bill. 
 But that is preaching to the converted, a task much different from trying to rally a confused country around a complex policy issue that could reshape one-sixth of the American economy. 
 And it is a far cry from the public relations offensive the president waged in summer and early fall, including a series of question-and-answer sessions in public forums, a prime-time address to a joint session of Congress, campaign-style rallies and a number of television interviews.
 That effort helped revive health care legislation at a time when many analysts thought it was in danger of falling apart. White House officials say Mr. Obama's speech in particular allowed him to reframe the discussion on his own terms.
 ''I think it changed the environment,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''After a sort of helter-skelter August, it lifted the debate.'' 
 But the gains did not last, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. It found that support for the health care proposals being discussed on Capitol Hill reached 42 percent after Mr. Obama's speech on Sept. 9 but dropped back to 34 percent in a survey taken from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4. And a Washington Post/ABC News poll published Tuesday found that 48 percent approved of Mr. Obama's handling of health care while 48 percent disapproved, little changed since summer.
 Even so, Mr. Obama remains in a far better position than Congressional leaders to sell Americans on a health care bill, said Andrew Kohut, the Pew center's director. 
 ''Health care, when it is seen as something Congress is proposing without Obama, is less popular,'' Mr. Kohut said. ''There is still a bully pulpit, and when Obama used it in September, my interpretation of the numbers moving up is that it had to do with him.''
 Mr. Gergen, the communications strategist, predicts a return to ''full campaign mode'' by the president. The question is how. One of the few tricks of the trade he has not yet employed is an address from the Oval Office, perhaps the biggest arrow in the presidential communications quiver. Aides say they discussed the idea in September but decided in favor of the address to Congress, because it afforded a longer format in which Mr. Obama could delve deeply into the issue.
 Mr. Axelrod would not say whether an Oval Office address was under consideration now, but he made clear that Mr. Obama would hardly be silent for long.
 ''Having come all this way,'' he said, ''you can be assured that we are going to do whatever we can to focus attention on the magnitude of the opportunity here.''

 QUESTIONS
 This week on the blog, Joshua B. Freeman, a professor and the author of ''Working-Class New York: Life and Labor Since World War II,'' is answering questions. Here is an excerpt: 
 Q. I grew up with a ''working class.'' My father was a house painter. Most people around me in the Bronx worked in the garment center. They had a boss, a union and went on strikes. Now everyone is called middle class. What happened to the old working class? Dr. Wu
 A. New York City still has more than a million workers who have a boss and a union (though they are much less likely to go on strike than in the past). Of course, the makeup of the working class has changed with the economy. We have fewer garment workers but more computer programmers, fewer longshoremen but more air freight handlers, fewer metal workers but more health technicians.
 Since World War II, the language of class has also changed, as categorization by type of job has been largely replaced by categorization by income, wealth, consumption patterns, values, aspirations and self-descriptions. People who use the latter criteria tend to lump most people into the middle class, a term whose capaciousness limits its utility.
 Q. Much has been made about the labor movement's radical history (when the labor movement has been at its best) but little about the political conservatism that runs through many unions. Can you comment specifically about the carpenters' union in New York City? Would you term it as a ''conservative union,'' and what role if any does the union's conservatism play in the recent history of corruption (recent indictments of top carpenters' officials)? 
 Bennett Baumer
 A. You have a good point; historians tend to dwell on radical unions while not paying as much attention to the conservative strains in the labor movement. The building trades unions have tended to be on the conservative side of the New York labor movement, but that does not make them conservative by Barry Goldwater-Newt Gingrich-Glenn Beck standards. 
 Perhaps there is a link between ideology and propensity to corruption, but I am not sure: One of the biggest New York union corruption scandals in recent memory involved District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, generally considered one of the more liberal unions in the city.

 But it turns out that expulsion is quite a rare event in Albany. In fact, as far as anyone can remember, the last time it happened was 90 years ago, during the anti-Communist Red Scare. After almost 24 hours of debate, five assemblyman were expelled for disloyalty to the nation and the state, and their affiliation with the Socialist Party of America.
 Months later, all five men were re-elected in special elections called to fill their seats.

Because of an editing error, a report in the City Room column in some editions on Thursday about the formation of a State Senate committee to determine whether Senator Hiram Monserrate should be punished or expelled following his assault conviction misstated the date that the formation of the committee was announced. It was Tuesday, not Thursday.

HEADLINE: Election Highlights Changes In Atlanta

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Since 1973, this Southern capital has elected a succession of black mayors, sometimes to the consternation of residents in the largely white, prosperous neighborhood of Buckhead in the north. 
 But the current race to succeed Mayor Shirley Franklin in the Nov. 3 election has upended expectations here in what Chris Rock, in his new documentary, ''Good Hair,'' calls ''the city where all major black decisions are made.'' The front-runner, Mary Norwood, is one of Buckhead's own, a white Junior Leaguer running as a populist outsider.
 The three top candidates in the six-way race have each maintained that Atlanta has moved beyond using race as a qualification for public office. But the ascendancy of Ms. Norwood may also reflect the decline of the city's black majority and the recession's sour effect on the mood of the voters. 
 The city has changed significantly since Mayor Franklin squeaked to victory without a runoff in 2001. It has grown by more than 100,000 people since 2000, according to census estimates, and the influx of many whites and Hispanics has narrowed the black majority to 56 percent from 61 percent.
 Atlanta is still a draw for black professionals, and the percentage of blacks in the metropolitan area has grown slightly, but in the city itself the pool of likely black voters is estimated at just barely a majority. Many of the city's public housing projects, where black votes once could be marshaled in a bloc, have been demolished.
 Ms. Norwood, who has held an at-large City Council position for eight years, and tirelessly attended neighborhood meetings across the city, has galvanized white voters and managed to attract significant support among blacks. Though she has often voted in Republican primaries in this heavily Democratic city, some polls show her with more black support than either of her two top opponents, who are both black: Lisa Borders, the president of the City Council, and Kasim Reed, a lawyer and former state lawmaker who resigned his office to run for mayor. 
 The election will probably result in a runoff between Ms. Norwood and Mr. Reed or Ms. Borders, although Ms. Norwood is so far ahead in polls that there is talk she could win outright.
 ''It would be a major game change in this town if a Buckhead Betty became mayor,'' said Tom Houck, a former newspaper columnist here, who is white, using a mocking term for the well-heeled women of the north side. ''Atlanta is a symbol for black Americans, more than Los Angeles, more than Chicago, more than Baltimore.''
 Mr. Houck spoke recently to a primarily black audience at a forum about race in the campaign, where some of those present were intent on electing a black mayor and others asked what good, exactly, black leadership had done the city.
 Ms. Norwood has addressed the race question only obliquely, though her campaign photographs and videos emphasize her interactions with black voters. 
 ''Dr. King said we should be evaluated on who we are, not what we look like,'' she said in an interview on Tuesday. ''I'm focused on public safety, city service delivery, quality of life issues and growing the city. That's what the citizens of Atlanta are interested in.'' 
 Ms. Norwood has set the tone by relentlessly attacking the Franklin administration's record on crime and city finances, forcing the other candidates to distance themselves from the mayor. 
 ''When you attack City Hall, you're also implicitly attacking, to a degree, black politics,'' said Michael Leo Owens, a political science professor at Emory University. ''And this is a message that in some ways plays well with the white electorate.''
 At a time of high anxiety over taxes and crime, it also resonates with voters of all races. The candidates have spent the bulk of their time in debates and forums arguing over who has the experience necessary to fix the city's money problems and who has the best public-safety plan. 
 Some voters, particularly younger ones, seem to agree that race should not be a factor in their choice at the polls.
 ''This is a majority white country and Barack Obama's president,'' Tyronia Morrison, a 30-year-old lawyer who is black, said after a candidate forum in southwest Atlanta. ''We need to rise above that and get back to the issues.''
 Asked if she thought black voters cared about the race of the mayor, Ms. Borders said: ''Folks that do not have what they need, who've been marginalized in some way, they want someone that they think, 'Hey, I can relate to them.' If you feel like you've been treated fairly, then your sensitivity is not that high.''
 Ms. Borders and Mr. Reed condemned a memo from an ad hoc group, the Black Leadership Forum, that surfaced in August suggesting that blacks unite behind Ms. Borders, whom the memo described as the most electable black candidate.
 The controversy over the memo obscured the fact that, as Steve Suitts, an Emory lecturer, wrote in an op-ed article Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ''White voters, not black voters, end up voting most often for a candidate of their own race in the South.''
 This mayoral election is the first for an open seat since the death of Maynard Jackson, the city's first black mayor and a political kingmaker, in 2003.
 ''Maynard basically was able, because of the esteem in which he was held, to pick his successors,'' said Bob Holmes, the author of a new biography of Mr. Jackson. ''If he endorsed them, then the black community united behind them. And he's no longer here.''
 Presumably, the mantle of the Jackson machine would have fallen to Mr. Reed, who ran Ms. Franklin's campaigns and who has been endorsed by Andrew Young, who succeeded Mr. Jackson as mayor. Mr. Reed has raised the most money, according to the latest filings, but has lagged behind in the polls. 
 Both Mr. Reed and Ms. Borders have battled voter fatigue after the presidential election and struggled to differentiate themselves with recession-size campaign treasuries. ''None of them is considered a charismatic leader,'' Mr. Holmes said of the three candidates. 
 That bodes well for Ms. Norwood, who has positioned herself as the candidate of change. 
 ''In this instance,'' Mr. Owens said, ''difference equals white.''

HEADLINE: Pulling Heartstrings, Racy Puppets Return

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
They may have no legs of their own, but darned if those fuzzy creatures aren't still standing, long after more full-bodied competition has bitten the dust. I mean the singing, occasionally foulmouthed hand puppets of ''Avenue Q,'' the ''Sesame Street''-style musical for adults who can't quite believe they've grown up, which reopened Off Broadway on Wednesday night at New World Stages, after a six-year, Tony Award-winning run on Broadway.
 For showbiz old-timers who have been through many different dressing rooms since they first hit it big, they look and sound remarkably healthy, including the ones with green noses and the big, furry monster who spends all his time looking at porn on the Internet. And they -- and their songs (by Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx) and script (by Jeff Whitty) -- remain surprisingly fresh (in all senses of the word), even for someone who, like me, has now spent many hours in their company. 
 That includes seeing them in their first Off Broadway incarnation (at the Vineyard Theater, in March 2003), then on Broadway (at the Golden Theater, where they opened that summer) and at some point in the West End of London, where their distinctly American-television-informed humor mystified most critics but still drew a young and appreciative audience.
 I missed them in Las Vegas, where they were booked (instead of going on the road, like most Tony-winning Broadway shows) amid some controversy. But that was not the happiest chapter in the lives of the puppets, and I am just as glad not to have been there. (They only lasted five months in Las Vegas and were summarily replaced by the next Tony winner for best musical, ''Spamalot.'') I was sad that I was unable to make it to their farewell Broadway performance last month. But then it was announced that -- what do you know? -- they weren't dying, after all, only (like much of America) downsizing.
 A spirit of cutting back but staying feisty feels appropriate to this bubbly portrait of young people scrabbling to stay solvent on the outer fringes of an outer borough of New York City. It's an attitude that also reflects the continuing relevance of ''Avenue Q'' to an audience on the sunny side of 30. This month the cover of Business Week heralded a new Lost Generation, in reference to the rising unemployment figures among the young. And if there's one thing that the characters of ''Avenue Q'' would agree that they have in common, it's that they're lost.
 When the puppet named Princeton makes his entrance (on the hand of his alter ego, the actor Seth Rettberg), asking in song what you do with a B.A. in English, he is no quaint anachronism from another, less prosperous time. I know people pushing 30 who are still asking the same question.
 Nor does the sensibility of Mr. Lopez's and Mr. Marx's adhesive songs, conceived as sweetly satiric homages to the instructional ditties of ''Sesame Street,'' feel particularly dated. There are still plenty of young people around who were weaned on the ''Sesame Street'' worldview and who still have its gentle melodies lodged in their heads.
 I suppose you could lament that this reflects a lack of cultural progress in our society. Or you could rejoice that ''Avenue Q,'' directed by Jason Moore and choreographed by Ken Roberson, gives gainful employment to talented performers who will probably find little chance elsewhere to demonstrate their multiple skills in singing, acting and working well with puppets (designed by Rick Lyon). The appealing ensemble includes Anika Larsen (who is terrific in the roles of the wistful Kate Monster and the predatory Lucy the Slut), Nicholas Kohn, Cullen R. Titmas, Sala Iwamatsu, Maggie Lakis and Danielle K. Thomas (as Gary Coleman, the child actor turned apartment-building superintendent). 
 Watching them bring new shadings to the art of blurring the boundaries between cloth and flesh is a pleasure, as their characters wrestle with issues of sex, love, commitment and time passing. Though I don't belong to the same generation as these frustrated figures, I felt a reassuring sense of homecoming when I once again saw Anna Louizos's cartoon urban streetscape. 
 Part of that is a critic's gratitude for a proven show with an original sensibility in a theater season short on musical imagination. But pretty much anyone who remembers arriving in New York, fresh from school, without a trust fund or a sugar daddy (or momma), will find grounds for identifying with those rudderless figures onstage. The show's concluding number, ''Only for Now,'' hymns the curse and comfort of the idea that nothing is forever.
 In the original lyrics, the litany of things that are promised to be only temporary, in addition to ''your hair'' and sex, included George W. Bush. That has been altered to Fox News. In the meantime I am perfectly happy that the ''for now'' of ''Avenue Q'' remains indefinite.

HEADLINE: Michigan Again Reports Highest Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Michigan again had the highest unemployment rate of all states in September at 15.3 percent, followed by Nevada and Rhode Island, which set records, the Labor Department said Wednesday. 
 Nevada, at 13.3 percent, and Rhode Island, at 13 percent, were followed by California, at 12.2 percent. Florida also hit its highest rate since records began 33 years ago, 11 percent.
 Fifteen states and Puerto Rico now have unemployment rates above 10 percent -- meaning more than one person in 10 looking for a job is not working there.
 Still, the Labor Department said, unemployment rates were little changed on the month in most states, and dropped in 19 states.
 The federal car-buying incentive program known as cash for clunkers helped slow the exodus of work in Michigan, which is the heart of American automobile manufacturing, the state's employment department said.
 Manufacturing jobs have increased in the state for three consecutive months, according to the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, while the monthly increases in the state's unemployment rate have shrunk.
 Still, the work force picture was not as rosy in terms of jobs numbers in a majority of states.
 Nonfarm payroll employment decreased in 43 states and the District of Columbia in September. Only seven states gained jobs, and the largest increase -- 4,400 in Indiana -- was small when compared with the biggest drop of 81,700 in New York.
 Texas shed 44,700 positions, California 39,300, Wisconsin 21,700 and Michigan 21,500. The nation's capital, Washington, experienced the largest percentage drop, 1.4 percent.
 Since September 2008, all states and the District of Columbia have lost jobs, with California shedding the most, 732,700.
 In Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota and California, the unemployment rate dropped from August, but so did the number of jobs.
 While Wisconsin found encouragement in its jobless rate falling to 7.7 percent in the state's fourth monthly decrease, Ohio read a different story in the discrepancy.
 ''Ohio's unemployment rate declined in September as more Ohioans dropped out of the labor force,'' said Douglas Lumpkin, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services director, about the decline to 10.1 percent, from 10.8 percent in August.
 Laid-off workers can become so discouraged about the prospects of new jobs that they give up looking and are not counted as part of the labor force. At the same time, with the downturn in housing and automobile manufacturing, analysts have begun to worry about structural unemployment creeping into the economy.
 The unemployment rate increased the most in any state in Illinois, to 10.5 percent, the highest since October 1983.
 Illinois lost 14,200 jobs, the 20th month that payrolls in the state had shrunk, resulting in the smallest number of jobs in the state in 14 years.

HEADLINE: It Works for Dating, Why Not for Jobs?

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
After four fruitless months of searching for a job, Danielle E. Lazzaro knew there were not many promising openings.
 So Ms. Lazzaro, 24, had high hopes for a new matchmaking service the State Department of Labor is trying out. Slim as the pickings might be, she said, she hoped that by providing her resume to a state career center, she would discover an assortment of jobs she had not considered before -- jobs that might suit her experience and training in marketing and communications.
 And given that the Labor Department invited Ms. Lazzaro to speak to the news media about the service, alongside M. Patricia Smith, the state's labor commissioner, she had reason to anticipate an aha! moment when she received an e-mail message that listed all of her matches. 
 Make that both of her matches. There were only two, and in Ms. Lazzaro's view, there may as well have been none. After scouring the Labor Department's entire database of available jobs, the program spat out one that Ms. Lazzaro did not think she was even moderately qualified for.
 The other opening? A clerical position in Buffalo, hundreds of miles away from her home in East Rockaway on Long Island. ''I thought that I was going to get a lot more results, more than two obviously,'' she said. ''I was a little disappointed. I was really hoping it would point me in another direction.''
 The response from the state's computer program, which has been dubbed Smart 2010 (short for Skills Matching and Referral Technology), was another blow to Ms. Lazzaro's plans -- professional and personal. A graduate of Adelphi University, she joined the ballooning ranks of unemployed New Yorkers in June when she was dismissed from a marketing position at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale. Her longtime companion, a substitute math teacher, proposed to her this summer but they have postponed wedding plans while she looks for a job, she said.
 ''I wanted to be that independent, working woman,'' Ms. Lazzaro said. ''Now I kind of lost all my independence.'' 
 Employers across the state have been shedding jobs for most of the past year as the recession has rolled on. With more than 850,000 residents out of work, state officials have been trying new tricks to help connect people with employers that are hiring.
 The state has a database of about 70,000 available jobs, about 30,000 of which were posted in the last week, said Leo Rosales, a spokesman for the Department of Labor in Albany. The department is spending about $140,000 in federal funds to experiment with the matchmaking software, which goes beyond searching for keywords in a resume and tries to find contextual clues about the applicant's skills and interests. 
 The program, which was developed by Burning Glass, a Boston-based company, suggests a more traditional matchmaking service: a Labor Department press release describes a ''holistic approach'' to find a match based on ''the entire person -- their strengths, skills and talents.''
 New York is the second state to offer the service, after Minnesota, which has had a contract with Burning Glass for two years, said Kirsten Morell, a spokesman for Minnesota's Department of Employment and Economic Development. Ms. Morell said she did not know how many Minnesotans had been matched with jobs, but she said state officials there had been ''very pleased'' with the results.
 Lisa S. Berger, a Manhattan resident who has been unemployed for more than a year, was less thrilled with the first set of matches she received after running her resume through the program last week. Of the 15 job openings listed, she said, about half were duplicates, and most of the rest were closer to the kind of corporate work she had done before switching to the nonprofit realm a few years ago.
 Ms. Berger, 54, wants a position soliciting contributions from wealthy donors for a university or other nonprofit institution. But the matching software seemed to have seized on the jobs she had held before she made her career switch. Only one or two of the matches was of interest to her. 
 ''It did point out to me that my resume was still way too geared toward what I used to do rather than what I want to do,'' Ms. Berger said. She added that she had already begun revising her resume ''to show that all that experience -- I sold, managed accounts, identified prospects, wrote proposals -- those are all transferable skills.''
 The most pleasant surprise was the helpfulness of the Labor Department counselor who assisted her, Ms. Berger said. ''If used in conjunction with a very good counselor where they can look at the results and say, 'Maybe your resume needs some little changes,' I think that would be of help,'' she said.
 Mr. Rosales said that is precisely what job seekers should do -- along with considering widening their sights and even lowering their expectations.
 ''The results that come back to the Lisas and Danielles of the world may not be a dream job for them, but it may be a job that they can take to keep their head above water,'' Mr. Rosales said. ''What we're hearing from people is they want that job they lost and that can pay them what they were making before.''
 But with tens of thousands of New Yorkers having exhausted their unemployment benefits, and job seekers outnumbering openings six to one, some may have to lower their sights, he said.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Weighs Lower Fares During City's Off-Peak Hours

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The new chairman of New York's transit system is looking to introduce a pricing policy that would offer passengers discounts to ride late at night and on weekends, an abrupt break from a century-old fare model that could be the city's biggest transportation revolution since the demise of the token.
 A new computerized, scannable fare card would allow New York City Transit to charge passengers different prices depending on the time of day, a practice already in place in London, where Jay H. Walder, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, first worked with the concept. 
 ''We might imagine that we offer discounts at later times, or we offer weekend discounts,'' Mr. Walder said in an interview on Wednesday. ''Time-of-day pricing might be very attractive.''
 The goal would be to encourage use of buses and subways during traditionally quieter hours. And it would bring New York's subway system in line with local commuter rails, which charge a range of fares. 
 ''We have an infrastructure that is set for the capacity of the peak,'' Mr. Walder said. ''What we really want to do is use that infrastructure all the time.''
 The chairman ruled out charging higher prices for longer trips, a system used in cities like Washington and London, saying such a move in New York ''would be a mistake.'' But he said a frank discussion of changes to the pricing structure ''will be an important part of what we're doing.'' A transit spokesman said later that Mr. Walder was not considering higher peak fares.
 In a wide-ranging interview with reporters at The New York Times, Mr. Walder -- who wore a pair of subway token cufflinks -- shared his plans to overhaul the technology of the nation's biggest transit system. He plans to introduce so-called smart cards equipped with computer chips, digital arrival-time clocks at subway stations and GPS devices that would let passengers know exactly when the next bus was arriving.
 He would not detail his relationship with officials at City Hall and legislators in Albany, whose support will be critical as he pursues an ambitious agenda on state and city territory. And he begged off questions about timelines and other specifics, citing his 15 days on the job.
 But Mr. Walder was emphatic when discussing the prospect of a revised fare structure, noting with a hint of excitement that ''you can see creative and innovative things that would happen with this.'' He said an off-peak pricing plan could ''generate the revenue we need and get more people to be using the transit system at different times of day.'' 
 A change to the fare system would require approval from the transportation authority's board, most of whose members are appointed by the mayor and the governor. 
 Andrew Albert, a nonvoting board member and chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council, said he was hesitant about the idea. ''You really already have some crushed loads at off-peak periods,'' he said, citing crowded platforms on some weekends. ''London is not necessarily the same as New York.''
 The price of a single bus or subway ride -- $2.25, after a 12.5 percent increase this summer -- is largely symbolic: about half of riders travel with unlimited-ride MetroCards, and the price for each ride varies depending on which type of card is used. 
 For years, however, the subway token represented a key economic indicator for New York, akin to a slice of pizza. A nickel fare reigned from the system's first days, in 1904, through World War II, an egalitarian entry fee that also starved the system of funds. Fares began rising in 1948.
 The unlimited-ride MetroCard was introduced in 1998, after years of effort at the authority that included contributions from Mr. Walder, then the chief financial officer. Ridership on weekdays has since swelled by 40 percent, and weekend ridership has risen almost 70 percent. In 2008, the average weekday ridership was 7.6 million, according to New York City Transit. 
 About $220 million is included in the authority's new capital plan to install a smart card payment system similar to London's Oyster card, a no-swipe fare card that is waved over a sensor to speed up payment. Mr. Walder wants the cards to be linked to credit card accounts and usable in multiple forms of transit. Unlike in other cities, however, passengers in New York would not have to wave their cards again to exit the system.
 This has long been a topic of interest for Mr. Walder, who promoted the benefits of a variable pricing system, citing the London operation as an example in a 2007 speech at City College.
 ''This should be an absolutely revenue-neutral policy,'' Mr. Walder, then a London-based consultant for McKinsey & Company, told a group of transit experts. ''You are not doing this to raise money. You are doing this to improve the efficiency of the transport system we have, to allow people to make their choices about what they want to do. And it is very, very doable with the technology we have today.''
 ''I think every one of these conclusions is applicable to New York,'' Mr. Walder said at the end of his presentation. 
 On Wednesday, he said he could not rule out an overall fare increase as the authority grappled with a possible budget shortfall of $113 million, announced by Gov. David A. Paterson last week as part of an across-the-board cut to state spending.
 ''There are no easy answers for these questions,'' Mr. Walder said. ''I can't say anything is off the table, but I'm not starting from that place. I'm not getting there in doing it, but I'm certainly not taking anything off the table.''
 Mr. Walder also said that he was not bothered by the stringent attacks on the authority by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's re-election campaign.
 ''Frankly, I think that expressing those frustrations is fair,'' Mr. Walder said.

HEADLINE: Ford Looks To the Future

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
AT the ripe old age of 52, William Clay Ford Jr. is perhaps the most seasoned auto executive in Detroit. This month, Mr. Ford celebrates 30 years on the job at the Ford Motor Company, which was founded more than a century ago by his great-grandfather, Henry Ford. He is now the executive chairman of the board, but Mr. Ford has held many positions during his career, including a five-year stint as its chief executive. 
 Along the way, Mr. Ford has seen Detroit's fortunes rise and fall in the highly competitive global auto industry. He has also proved prophetic about the need to make cars cleaner and greener, and for automakers to get leaner to thrive in the 21st century. While its hometown rivals General Motors and Chrysler were forced to seek government aid and file for bankruptcy this year, Ford Motor survived without assistance from the American taxpayer. 
 In an interview in his office at company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., Mr. Ford shared his views on where the automotive industry was headed, and why he believes Ford Motor will play a leading role in developing the cars we drive in the future. 
 Q:In 10 years, what will the typical car be like?
 A: Let's start with the driver. The driver will have more information at his or her fingertips. They will have real-time traffic data to help them navigate. They'll have real-time parking information. They will have active accident-avoidance technology. And pretty much everything that one does manually today will have the option of voice control as well -- setting the temperature, radio, telephone. The cars themselves will be lighter weight and smaller. Engine displacements will be smaller but with greater horsepower. And what propels the vehicle will be a mix of technologies. It will be electric, plug-in hybrids, and conventional gasoline engines.
 Q:Will consumers have to compromise on anything to drive an electric car?
 A: I think we have learned over the years that there can't be trade-offs. Customers don't want to give anything up. So our job as manufacturers is to deliver these new technologies in a way that doesn't require any trade-offs. As we sit here today, range is an issue on pure electric vehicles. Ten years from now I suspect that will be a lot less of an issue. The way we overcome that in the short term is to have plug-in electric hybrids, which gives you the benefits of electric and the range of a gasoline engine.
 Q:A lot of these changes are being driven by government regulations. Can regulations alone influence consumer behavior?
 A: No, and I think we learned that with CAFE (corporate average fuel economy standards). The rules were being set by administrators, and the customer, because gas was so cheap, was saying, give me the biggest V-8 engine that you've got. Therefore we had to force smaller cars at great discounts on the market so we could sell bigger vehicles. That was contrary to what market demand was telling us that people wanted. Now, I think you have regulations and consumer interests converging, and it's driven primarily by the price of fuel. The difference today is that technology is coming on stream fast enough that the customer can have both good fuel economy and good performance.
 Q:Vehicle sales have dropped drastically in the past two years. Is this lower level of consumption the new reality?
 A: Let's take the U.S. There are several million new driver's licenses being issued every year. You have a large number of new drivers coming into the market every year, whether it's young people coming of age or immigrants. So the driving population continues to grow. In addition, public transport across the country is very uneven, and the average commute for Americans is still long. I think all of that will continue to necessitate individual ownership of vehicles. 
 If you look out into the future, there are going to be 50 cities in the world with 10 million people -- 30 of which are not going to be in Europe or the United States. They are going to require mobility solutions that probably don't include individual car ownership on a large-scale basis, simply because the cost of owning a car in the city is going to be too expensive.
 Q:What are some of the possible solutions?
 A: Let's say you are a customer in Rio. You live in downtown and you want to get to the soccer stadium that's 45 minutes outside of the city. You can use your cellphone to ask, what is the best way to route me to this stadium? It can give you the cheapest way, or the most direct way. It could be a combination of bus, subway, taxi, car-share, bicycle or walking. That customer can have a blend of transportation to get them to that destination.
 Q:What about in China and India, where millions of people have never had cars and desperately want to own them?
 A: There is a great demand everywhere in the world for individual mobility. People like the fact they are not on somebody else's schedule. They can come and go as they please. But juxtaposed against that is the reality of urban living, where it can be very costly and difficult to keep a car. Again, it will depend on where people live and their needs, whether it's China, India or the United States. 
 Q:Those countries are also growing their own auto industries and getting good at it. How does Ford make sure you are part of that growth?
 A: One thing we can and will do is be the leader in technology globally. That really is our advantage. I don't care where you are in the world, people are aware of what technology is available to others. If you're in Nairobi you're certainly aware of the iPhone. A generation ago, we all could get away as manufacturers with introducing an older vehicle into these markets. We can't do that anymore, because the developing nations want the latest and greatest.
 Q:Do consumers care where their cars are built?
 A: Some certainly do. There is great national pride, not just in the U.S. but around the world. There is a certain percentage of the population that doesn't much care. But all things being equal, I think people would still prefer to do business with their hometown companies. That's true in America, that's true in China, that's true in Germany.
 Q:Is the financial support given by taxpayers to G.M. and Chrysler a positive development for the American economy?
 A: The biggest concern that we had all through this was the collapse of the supply base. I believe that if G.M. and Chrysler had gone into free-fall bankruptcies, it could have devastated the entire industrial base of this country. 
 Q:Does the average American value the domestic auto industry?
 A: They should. One cannot find a healthy economy anywhere in the world that does not have a strong industrial base, period. We seem to be the only country in the world that doesn't strongly value that. Everywhere else Ford does business in the world the government and people understand it, and do everything they can to enhance it. The notion that we can just simply become an information-age data provider as a nation is ludicrous. The unemployment consequences would be enormous. Manufacturing still has the greatest multiplier effect, in terms of job creation, of any sector of the economy. 
 Q:Are all these car companies, big and small, still going to exist 10 years from now?
 A: It's an interesting question. In the early 1980s I was part of our corporate strategy group here. We did a study that said in 10 years, there would be probably six car companies globally. Well look how that turned out. There are more car companies today than there were back then. Every futurist that ever looked at our industry going back 30 years said there was going to be great consolidation. But in fact you see the opposite happening. Logically, should there be consolidation? Yes. And logically, we should not have had the overcapacity we've had for many years. But nonetheless, those trends continue. It's hard for me to predict there will be a great consolidation. The lesson for Ford is that we can't control any of that. We had to get our own house in order.
 Q:A decade ago, you were talking about the need for the industry to become more environmentally conscious. A lot of people criticized you then. Do you feel vindicated?
 A: I'm not sure vindication is the right word. But I'm really happy about what is happening now. I did see this day coming. Maybe I saw it too soon. I certainly knew 30 years ago when I joined the company that the consumption of natural resources and the pollution that our industry was causing were unsustainable. Technology has evolved to a point where we can now move forward at a quick pace. Holding us back through the years was a combination of technology that wasn't ready, and very cheap fuel that prevented the customer from wanting new, fuel-efficient technology. But we are at a confluence now. We have ever-increasing fuel prices, and technology that is a game-changer and can be introduced affordably.

HEADLINE: Euro Breaks $1.50, Oil Prices Rise, and Shares Turn Broadly Lower

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As the dollar fell to $1.50 against the euro on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than a year, concerns swirled for businesses and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic.
 For the United States, a weakening currency makes foreign-made goods more expensive, and it raises troubling questions about whether the primacy of the dollar is being eclipsed by gold, oil and other currencies. For the 16 countries in the euro zone, a stronger euro puts exporters and manufacturers in countries like Spain, Germany and Greece at a disadvantage and could slow the flow of American tourists to European shores. 
 Stocks, meanwhile, sold off broadly on Wall Street after a noted banking analyst downgraded Wells Fargo to sell. On the flip side, the losses helped to cut some of the dollar's earlier losses. 
 Over the last seven months, the dollar's value has declined more than 15 percent as federal deficits in the United States rose to record levels, stirring fears that the government's aggressive efforts to combat the recession would weaken the American currency and swamp global markets with Treasury bonds.
 Now, inflation-wary investors have gone hunting for stronger returns by funneling their money into countries where interest rates are higher than the record low rates in the United States, or where rates seem poised to rise sooner. Interest rates are hovering near zero in the United States, and central bankers say they are unlikely to budge anytime soon.
 Investors have also migrated from the perceived safety of the dollar into the stock markets, and they have snapped up gold, oil and other hard assets. 
 As the dollar weakened, oil prices rose sharply to breach $80 for the first time since October 2008, settling at $81.37, setting the stage for higher gasoline prices in the United States.
 The latest dip in the dollar came as shares on Wall Street fell for a second consecutive day, and the governor of the Bank of England cautioned that the days of abnormally low interest rates would not continue forever. 
 Investors are using the dollar's weakness to capitalize on the so-called carry trade, which allows them to borrow dollars and use them to buy currencies in countries with higher interest rates. As governments like Australia begin to raise rates in the wake of the financial crisis, some analysts say the disparity between the dollar and other currencies could continue to grow.
 ''The divide between the central banks has become much clearer,'' said Steven Englander of Barclays Capital. ''That's separating the men from the boys in terms of who is optimistic about growth and optimistic enough to actually act on it.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 92.12 points, or 0.9 percent, to 9,949.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 0.9 percent, or 9.66 points, lower, at 1,081.40, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.6 percent, or 12.74 points, at 2,150.73.
 Financial firms tugged the broader markets lower. Shares of Wells Fargo, which reported a third-quarter profit on Wednesday, closed down 5 percent. Analysts said that a new report detailing executive pay restrictions at seven companies that received government bailouts also seemed to drive investors out of bank stocks.
 If consumer spending stays weak and government stimulus spending eases over the next year, rising exports, fed by a cheap dollar, may be one of the only sources of economic expansion.
 ''The U.S. dollar has to decline,'' said Martin Murenbeeld, chief economist at Dundee Wealth. ''For any kind of growth to develop in the United States economy once the government has stopped pumping the system, you're going to have to have something happen on the foreign trade system.''
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 101 31/32. The yield rose to 3.39 percent, from 3.34 percent late Tuesday.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 42-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Morgan's Riskier Bets Bring Profit and Bonuses

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The last year has been a difficult one for Morgan Stanley as the Wall Street firm, wounded by losses, shied away from big risk-taking and seemed to fall ever further behind its perennial rival, Goldman Sachs.
 That has begun to change. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reported a profit for the first time in a year as it pursued a more aggressive trading strategy.
 Morgan also signaled that like many of its competitors, it planned to pay healthy bonuses this year to keep its employees happy and attract new talent, despite the public furor over compensation on Wall Street. 
 The bank put aside $5 billion in the latest quarter for bonuses, increasing its compensation pool for the first nine months to $10.9 billion. 
 The chief financial officer, Colm Kelleher, said that while Morgan was mindful of the help it had received from taxpayers, politics should not limit the pay of employees. ''We do accept there is a new paradigm here,'' Mr. Kelleher said, but he added, ''we have to pay people competitively.'' He said Morgan was hiring 400 employees, mainly outside the United States, to rebuild its trading businesses.
 Bonuses at the nation's banks are at the forefront of the political debate as Washington's compensation master, Kenneth R. Feinberg, reviews the pay of top executives at the companies that received bailout money, and the Federal Reserve prepares to release its own guidance on compensation. Last week, Goldman Sachs said it had so far this year set aside $16 billion for compensation, putting it on track for bonuses that could rival the record payouts of the boom years before the crisis.
 Wall Street critics say excessive pay contributed to risk-taking at banks that led to the financial crisis. But Morgan said its compensation accrual rate in the latest quarter -- at 64 percent of revenues far above the industry norm of about 50 percent -- was exaggerated because of accounting charges that lowered revenues. 
 Without the charge, the rate was closer to 43 percent, Morgan said, adding that about 5,000 employees in the sales and trading division, where bonuses make up a large part of the compensation, could earn less this year. 
 Morgan said on Wednesday that it earned $757 million, or 38 cents a share, in the third quarter after three successive quarterly losses, a turnaround powered by increased underwriting fees and higher trading revenues.
 This compared with $7.7 billion in the quarter a year ago, when results were helped by a one-time gain. 
 The results beat analysts' expectations and ended a run of red ink that had tested the nerves of its shareholders and management.
 Last month, the firm announced that John J. Mack would step down as chief executive at the end of the year, to be succeeded by James P. Gorman, who had overseen its new Smith Barney retail brokerage joint venture. 
 Mr. Mack will be leaving just as some of the changes he put in place begin to bear fruit. The push to lure ordinary investors into the bank's expanded retail brokerage business, part of Morgan's reinvention into a steadier, more conservative bank, yielded $3 billion of revenue in its global wealth management unit for latest quarter and a pretax profit of $280 million. 
 Morgan was the last of the major Wall Street banks to report earnings, and its results underscored a new order taking shape. The stronger banks have posted profits while players that were once mighty have continued to strain under losses from souring loans. 
 At Citigroup, which is still a recipient of government support, spiraling consumer losses overwhelmed strong trading results. Goldman, however, reported a $3.19 billion profit in the third quarter, ahead of Morgan. On Wednesday, another big bank, Wells Fargo, reported a $3.2 billion third-quarter profit despite loan losses. 
 In a sign of Morgan's newfound stability, it increased its risk-taking, which is commonly evaluated by a measure known as value at risk. This rose to $118 million, from $113 million in the second quarter. That was still behind other, more aggressive rivals like Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, according to Cubillas Ding, an analyst at Celent in London. He said, for example, that Goldman's value at risk in the third quarter was $208 million.
 ''Although Morgan Stanley has increased their risk-taking over the last quarter, this has roughly remained at the same levels compared to a year ago,'' he said. ''It looks like Morgan Stanley are pursuing a more moderate strategy.''
 Morgan said on Wednesday that net revenue in the third quarter was $8.7 billion, compared with $18 billion a year ago. The bank said revenue was lower in part because of a continued improvement in debt-related credit spreads, which depressed revenues by around $900 million. The bank also continued to be burdened by its souring real estate investments.
 The improvement in profit was helped by higher investment-banking fees as well as trading. Its institutional securities arm had a pretax profit of $1.3 billion on revenue of $5 billion. The unit, which includes trading and investment banking, had reported three consecutive quarterly losses before the third quarter.
 Underwriting revenue of $760 million was up 74 percent from the quarter a year ago helped by improved market activity. Equity underwriting revenue more than doubled from a year ago, to $457 million. Revenue from fixed-income underwriting was $303 million, 25 percent higher than a year ago.

HEADLINE: Beige Book Sees Signs That Growth Is Stirring

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Regional economies in most parts of the country are on the mend, largely because home sales are rebounding and factories and manufacturers are stirring back to life, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. 
 The Fed's regular report on economic activity across the country -- known as the beige book -- noted the dissonance between tentative signs of a recovery and lingering weakness as the United States struggles to break out of the deepest recession since the 1930s. 
 Conditions in the beige book, which tallies activity in a dozen regional Fed districts, have brightened gradually in the last six months, and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the recession is probably over. Still, the pace of improvement has been slow. 
 ''Reports of gains in economic activity generally outnumber declines, but virtually every reference to improvement was qualified as either small or scattered,'' the Fed said in the report.
 Few businesses were hiring, credit conditions were deteriorating in some markets, and commercial real estate deteriorated across every corner of the country as businesses closed down or shrank, leaving behind warrens of empty offices and half-filled shopping centers.
 While the economy's woes began in the housing market, some analysts believe that commercial real estate may be the next leg to collapse. Many regional lenders are heavily exposed to commercial real estate ventures in troubled parts of the country, and they could cause another wave of losses. 
 Construction spending from the $787 billion stimulus by the government provided a ''source of strength'' in the Midwest and Southwest, the report said, but the increase in federal spending was undercut as state and local governments pulled back and tried to shore up their budgets.
 The report also demonstrated how heavily businesses were relying on government spending in the face of huge contractions in the private sector.
 ''There were several reports that the only 'sure' business will come from government stimulus projects, although funding for such projects has been slow to materialize,'' the Fed said.

HEADLINE: Two Accounts That Mets Had With Madoff Made Gains, Filing Shows

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Mets and their owners, the Wilpon family, may be in better financial shape than has been assumed. That is one conclusion being drawn from a filing released Friday by the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, which is sorting through accounts in Bernard Madoff's company.
 The report shows that Mets LP, one of the team's financial arms, withdrew $570.5 million from two accounts it held with Madoff's company, $47.8 million more than it put in. The accounts were part of a list of more than 30 in which more money was withdrawn than was deposited with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. 
 As a result, Mets LP and the others were deemed ''net winners'' ineligible for compensation and potentially liable to being sued by Irving H. Picard, the court-appointed liquidator who is trying to recover money lost in Madoff's $65 billion Ponzi scheme. A spokesman for Picard declined to comment.
 According to the report, the two Mets LP accounts held nearly $830,000 in ''fictitious equity'' on Nov. 30, 2008, just before Madoff admitted to the fraud. Mets LP claimed that it had lost money in those two accounts, but their claims were denied by the court in August. 
 The gains now reported by the liquidator appear to refute news media reports that said the Wilpons lost up to $700 million in Madoff's scheme.
 Fred Wilpon, the team's principal owner, has said several times that he lost far less than was reported and that the finances of the Mets have been unaffected by Madoff.
 ''I'm fine, my family's fine, my business family's fine,'' Wilpon said in August in a telephone interview. Wilpon would not say what he, his business, Sterling Equities, or his family had lost. But he said the estimates were wildly inaccurate and wildly high.
 David Newman, the Mets' senior vice president for marketing, said Wednesday, ''As has been stated previously, this has no effect on the operations of the New York Mets.''
 The new figures released in Bankruptcy Court do not mean that the Mets made money with Madoff, either. The Mets, Sterling Equities and the Wilpons had dozens of accounts with Madoff's financial firm. It is unclear how much money was in those accounts, and how they were used to help run the team, if at all. Some accounts may have had losses exceeding any gains in the two Mets LP accounts.
 But at least one account that the Mets had with Madoff included money that was used to pay for players' deferred salaries, according to a person with knowledge of the team's finances who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Mets paid the players their salaries and interest of a few percentage points as compensation for not taking all their money upfront, the person said. The Mets then invested the money with Madoff, hoping to earn a far higher return.
 The court report did not say over what time the $522.7 million in deposits and $570.5 million in withdrawals were made, or whether they were concentrated in a specific period. The accounts could have been opened over many years and the withdrawals and deposits made in small increments over time.
 ''You don't know what's in all the other accounts, even if they had a large chunk in these accounts,'' said Vince Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball'' and a consultant to major league teams. ''It's tough from this partial piece of the picture to put it all together.''
 Owners routinely tap a variety of funds, including their personal savings and their businesses, to pay for their teams. But because most teams are privately held, it is often difficult to know to what degree. Teams try to bring in more money than they spend, but because some large payments, like free-agent signings, are bunched at certain times, owners sometimes dip into accounts to bridge shortfalls.
 The Mets may have had to spend additional amounts of money in recent years to help finish building Citi Field, which opened in April, and to offset losses stemming from the slowdown in the economy. The Mets also raised eyebrows by spending less than many teams to sign draft picks and by moving prospects from the team's program in the Florida instructional league to the Dominican Republic.
 Although a complete picture of the Mets' finances is still murky, some of Fred Wilpon's charitable giving has been affected. The Judy and Fred Wilpon Family Foundation gave the Police Athletic League a $502,500 donation in 2006. Wilpon recommended that most of the money be invested with Madoff, according to Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney and the chairman of the P.A.L. board.
 Court-appointed liquidators recovered $392,000 of that money.
 ''Fred's a victim,'' Morgenthau said. ''He was totally taken in. He completely trusted Madoff.''

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
IF you wonder whether hybrid-electric vehicles will ever catch on, simply ask one of the millions of people who ride in them every day.
 Hybrid-electric buses, that is.
 Transit systems from New York to Taipei, and from Ames, Iowa, to Ann Arbor, Mich., are adding hybrid buses at a rapid clip. New York, by far, has the nation's biggest fleet of hybrid buses, which run on electricity and diesel fuel, with nearly 1,000 in all five boroughs, most in Manhattan.
 Although the initial cost is well above that of a conventional diesel-powered bus, hybrid buses emit less pollution and get far better fuel economy. They are quieter than old-style buses, and their ride is generally more comfortable (not accounting for the condition of city streets). Like the hybrid taxis that have become a common sight in New York, hybrid buses arrived during the last decade. 
 Transit officials faced pressure in the mid-1990s to clean up their bus fleet, which was a major contributor to air pollution on city streets. ''We were looking at what to do to reduce bus emissions as quickly as possible that didn't have a major cost,'' said Joseph J. Smith, senior vice president for the department of buses for the MTA New York Transit Authority.
 Its first option was not hybrids, however, but buses that ran on compressed natural gas, or C.N.G.
 While those buses are starting to become more popular across the country, the costs back then to switch from an all-diesel to a C.N.G. fleet would have been prohibitive, Mr. Smith said. ''It was unbelievable the kind of money you would have had to invest in those garages,'' he said.
 In 1998, the transit authority began using its first 10 hybrid-electric buses, costing $1 million each; they became guinea pigs for what turned out to be a successful experiment. By 2001, the city had ordered another 125 and subsequently bought hundreds more. 
 Today, New York has the largest fleet of hybrid buses of any city in the country -- 850, out of a fleet of 4,500. And the price has dropped by half, although hybrid buses are still twice as expensive as conventional diesel buses.
 Environmentalists argue that the switch has been worth it, in terms of public health. ''People say that it's expensive to switch from diesel to hybrids or natural gas. The question is, how much are your kids' lungs worth?'' said Daniel Becker, director of the safe climate campaign of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. The improvement in pollutants has been impressive. From 1995 to 2006, diesel particulate emissions -- also known as soot -- dropped 97 percent, while emissions of nitrogen oxides dropped 58 percent per bus.
 The buses' performance has been impressive, especially by bus standards. Each is expected to save the city 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel, compared with what would be consumed by a conventional bus, or a 45 percent improvement in fuel economy.
 The typical hybrid bus gets 4 miles per gallon, which pales when compared with the 50 m.p.g. of the Toyota Prius, but a city bus weighs 20 tons, compared with a 3,000-pound car. The average all-diesel bus gets about 2.75 m.p.g., Mr. Smith said.
 Much of the fuel economy savings can be traced to new lithium-ion batteries, like those on a camera or cellphone, which have been installed in the buses. 
 Their early batteries, which were lead acid, cost $20,000 and needed to be replaced every two to four years. The lithium batteries are expected to last six years, and the weight difference alone equals a 13 percent improvement in fuel economy. But those batteries are expensive, at $60,000 each.
 The batteries mean that overall maintenance for New York's hybrid buses is more costly than for conventional diesel buses. However, the hybrid buses are easier to fix -- and most important, don't break down as often, which the department measures as ''mean distance to failure.''
 The newest buses to make their appearance in the city are a pair of turbine-driven hybrids, the first of eight that will join the fleet. (Baltimore is also testing turbine-driven buses.)
 ''It will revolutionize the way we do business in the garages,'' Mr. Smith said. ''There is no oil, there's no transmission, there's no starter, there's no generator, no antifreeze for a radiator. When you have an inspection every 3,000 miles, you do not have to drain the oil or drain the transmission.'' 
 Moreover, the bus will not need a filter to catch particulates, small bits of filth from diesel fuel. The filter normally requires changing every year. 
 Along with changing life at depots, the buses have changed life for drivers and for repair crews. After all, New York has operated diesel-powered buses since 1938, said Henry Sullivan, the department's chief maintenance officer.
 Each driver receives roughly an hour of training to become familiar with the functions of the bus and then is coached in the correct way to drive it. 
 Mechanics, meanwhile, undergo significant training, Mr. Smith said, because the batteries can pose a hazard. ''You're not dealing with 12 volts or 24 volts, you're dealing with 600 volts,'' he said. ''You make a mistake -- that could kill you.''
 Beyond hybrids, officials are looking to the next phase of alternative-fuel buses, which will be equipped with hydrogen-fuel cells. The first one will be tested by the city next spring, but Mr. Smith said he did not expect them to be commercially available for at least 15 years.
 Still, if New York's experience with hybrid buses is any indication, other communities could follow the city on its path to cleaner transportation.
 ''You pay through the nose in the beginning, but we opened the door for these smaller cities to have hybrids'', Mr. Smith said. ''We see it as building bridges from one technology to another technology.''
 Meanwhile, the public interest in hybrids of all types, cars and buses, also helps, Mr. Becker said. ''It's sort of a rolling ad that you can live a comfortable lifestyle without destroying the planet at the same time.''

HEADLINE: Is Happiness Still That New Car Smell?

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 FOR generations, American car buying has been guided by one grand philosophy: which one do I want?
 But now, another question has begun to percolate: do I need a car at all?
 The recession and a growing awareness of the environment are causing many people to reassess their automobile ownership. After more than a century in which an automobile represented the American dream, car enthusiasm may no longer be a part of Americans' DNA. 
 At one extreme lies a fledgling car-free movement emerging in big cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco that echoes a much broader campaign in Europe and Asia. 
 Whether because of cost, convenience or environmental awareness, a small but growing number of people are making individual decisions to get rid of their automobiles and rely on public transportation, car-sharing programs and rental cars. 
 ''There's a cultural change taking place,'' said John Casesa, a veteran auto industry analyst and partner in the Casesa Shapiro Group. ''It's partly because of the severe economic contraction. But younger consumers are viewing an automobile with a jaundiced eye. They don't view the car the way their parents did, and they don't have the money that their parents did.''
 Jessica Gitner, a California native, inherited her parents' used 1987 Nissan Maxima station wagon when she turned 16 and drove it 44 miles a day round-trip to high school. But when she moved to Washington, D.C., Ms. Gitner, a music intern at National Public Radio, vowed to get along without a car. She now rides her bike as well as the Metro.
 ''I'm a recent college graduate, and like many who are in the same boat, I'm struggling to earn enough for rent and living expenses,'' said Ms. Gitner, 22. ''I don't have health insurance. I'd rather spend money on that than a car.''
 Yet Ms. Gitner says it is impractical to expect Americans without access to public transportation to get along without automobiles, and experts agree.
 Millions of people face long commutes, along with ferrying kids to school and activities, and countless errands that cannot be conducted via bus or streetcar. Beyond that, there will always be a group of customers who want the latest, hottest, sexiest car that automakers put on the market. 
 Lust for sports cars endures among auto enthusiasts, as the strong early response for the Chevrolet Camaro proved last summer, and automakers are hoping that the burst of sales that accompanied the government's cash-for-clunkers program may linger into the early part of the 2010 model year. But between the two extremes lies a growing middle ground of people who have reassessed their transportation needs because of both the financial crisis that rocked their budgets and their desire to help the planet. 
 ''People are questioning car purchases more than we've ever seen in recent history,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends and insights for TrueCar, a company that tracks car-buying habits.
 Young, cash-strapped consumers are delaying their first purchases longer, he said, robbing automakers of the chance to attract them early and keep their business as they move up in life.
 Across the country, empty nesters are moving back into cities and shedding their cars. Toyota has identified 60 locales where it has seen this occur, according to James E. Lentz, the president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., and it has begun thinking about whether it needs to open satellite offices to serve customers who've moved away from suburban dealerships.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Toprak said he was seeing data that suggested car owners who remained in the suburbs were downsizing from three cars or more to one or two. Further, there is a significant move toward smaller vehicles, whether buyers are purchasing S.U.V.'s or cars, he said.
 The shift shows up in the average price paid for a car. According to TrueCar's data, it hovered at around $28,000 for months, but plummeted this summer to about $25,000, the biggest drop the company had seen since it began tracking car prices in 2000.
 The decline was a direct result of cash for clunkers, which offered incentives of up to $4,500 for people who traded gas-guzzlers for more efficient models. Atop the list of the most popular replacements was the compact Toyota Corolla, which starts at just above $15,000.
 ''The fundamental difference in car buying now is that it's a lot more practical, rather than emotional,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''That will continue to be the case until we have a full recovery in the marketplace.''
 This new atmosphere poses a challenge for the automakers, which can no longer draw from their experience of the past to predict the future.
 ''They're having a very hard time grappling with these trends,'' Mr. Casesa said.
 What, exactly, should they be designing and selling? If gas prices spike again, are they ready with smaller automobiles that were in hot demand during 2008? Should they shy away from luxury cars and big sport utilities for fear that consumers will no longer be willing to spend the money?
 And what if the world reaches a point where people don't want cars, period, but still need something to transport them? How much time and money do they spend on developing alternative modes of transportation -- and given that smaller cars yield much less in profits than big ones, how much will they even have available to spend?
 ''The behavior that changed in the past year is going to take a while to change back,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''It's engrained in our memories now that we shouldn't splurge on car purchases because we don't know what's going to happen next year. It is not a massive exodus from car ownership, but it is a trend that will be with us in the future.'' 
 In an earlier time, automakers might have turned a blind eye to all these developments, writing the period off simply as the latest cyclical downturn.
 But with Chrysler and General Motors making trips through bankruptcy this past year, at a cost of $55 billion in taxpayer money, and with President Obama an avid proponent of higher fuel economy, carmakers cannot afford to follow their old instincts.
 Indeed, no one in Detroit, at least, thinks record sales will come back any time soon, if at all. In a chat last month on Twitter, G.M.'s executive vice president, Robert A. Lutz, said the automaker expected the market to peak at 13 million to 14 million sales a year, but not in the near future. TrueCar forecasts it could take three to five years to climb to those levels. 
 Few experts are willing to predict when the industry might return to record levels above 17 million, last seen in the middle of this decade.
 The tough economy and interest in the environment mean a whole new language for companies that previously boasted about engine displacements and torque. Now, their vocabularies have to include words like ''sustainability'' and ''battery range.'' 
 Most important, they can no longer assume that simply selling the sizzle of a new car will be enough to satisfy a newly aware group of consumers.
 So companies that previously pushed horsepower are devoting resources to developing ''personal mobility devices,'' a category meant to fill the space between car and carless.
 Initial efforts have led to some offerings that look like unicycles, such as the U3-X, an experimental electric-powered device that Honda introduced in September. Thanks to a special balance device, the U3-X remains permanently upright and sets off when the driver leans backward or forward.
 G.M. has a device called P.U.M.A., for personal urban mobility and accessibility, which it developed with Segway. Some have likened it to a covered scooter or even a baby carriage, but such devices show that even if car companies can't sell cars, they want to stay in the transportation business.
 For now, the devices most likely are headed for emerging markets like India and China, where car ownership can be impractical because of both cost and congestion, said Christopher E. Borroni-Bird, G.M.'s director of Advanced Technology Vehicle Concepts. Even if someone can afford a car, he said, dense traffic might defeat the purpose.
 ''Car-free might not be what these people are looking for, but they need some sort of transportation,'' he said.
 Yet to some consumers, cars simply are not as necessary -- or meaningful -- as they were in the past. Ian Deason, a Detroit-area native who is the director of partnerships and alliances at JetBlue Airways, got his driver's license the day he turned 16 and owned a succession of cars even after he moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
 In a previous assignment, Mr. Deason drove his Saab to work at Kennedy Airport each morning, a commute of about 35 minutes, half the time he would have spent on public transit. ''The extra hour to an hour and a half that I got every day was worth the money,'' which included $400 a month for parking, he said.
 But when Mr. Deason moved his office to JetBlue's headquarters in Queens, he gained a faster subway ride and decided to get rid of the car. ''I'd love to say it was environmental, but it was convenience,'' he said.
 Karla Vallance, an Internet consultant based in Jamaica Plain, Mass., had a 1988 BMW 325ic convertible that she bought used while working for CNN in Atlanta for 17 years until this summer, when she finally sold it.
 That step culminated a yearlong process in which Ms. Vallance prepared herself to give up her car, commuting about five miles into downtown Boston by public transportation, bicycle and occasionally on foot. Her final decision to sell came when she faced spending $1,000 in repairs on the car, for which she had recently purchased four new tires.
 ''It just seemed insane to keep it when I used it so little,'' she said. Even so, her separation anxiety was palpable. ''It's a huge psychological step. I so loved my car -- those old Beemers are fabulous.'' 
 Ms. Vallance is is vowing to live car-free as long as she can. ''It feels good,'' she said, ''and as long as I live in a city with such easy access to excellent public transportation, it's kind of a no-brainer.''
 Those twin factors of need and desire eventually may work to the automakers' favor, Mr. Toprak of TrueCar said, especially as the companies tout their vehicles' improved fuel economy and environmental friendliness.
 An emphasis on the environment has been an important focus for the Ford Motor Company, which did not join G.M. and Chrysler in accepting federal assistance, and whose executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., has espoused environmental causes for much of his adult life.
 Mr. Ford, who served as chief executive at Ford from 2001-6, backtracked on several promises made while he was in the job, to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles by 25 percent and to introduce more hybrid electric vehicles. But since naming Alan R. Mulally as his successor three years ago, Ford seems to have again embraced the need to go green.
 It is introducing smaller vehicles based on fuel-efficient models from Ford's lineup in Europe. Other companies also are emphasizing the environment with their new models, particularly Toyota and Honda, which each introduced redesigned versions of their hybrid-electric cars this year. Toyota also has brought out the luxury market's first car expressly designed as a hybrid, the Lexus HS.
 More alternative fuel vehicles are on the way, led by the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid that is expected to debut in late 2010. Each model moves the industry farther away from sole reliance on internal combustion engines. ''We've taken the lap,'' Mr. Borroni-Bird said.
 At least in the short term, automakers face an imperative to make sure that the fundamental basis of their business -- selling cars -- remains intact. If public opinion swings too far away from cars, some environmentalists warn that the car industry could find itself in the same circumstances as cigarette manufacturers, who have hung on to their most fervent users even as public policy, health concerns and public opinion have cast a shadow over their products. 
 No one in the industry wants to face the prospect that cars could someday find themselves in the same struggle for acceptance as cigarettes. And reality will be enough to keep the industry going, at least for now. Said Mr. Casesa: ''There's no doubt that Americans will still need cars in great numbers. This is a vast country, with lots of space, dominated by a suburban life style. But it doesn't mean they'll need a second car or a third car, or as big a car with as much stuff in it.''
 Here, some manufacturers may find solace in those who have abandoned their cars but still long for them and hope to return, when circumstances are right. Despite selling her BMW, Ms. Vallance said she could consider purchasing a car again if she moves to a less pedestrian-friendly locale. 
 Added Mr. Deason, ''Call me a Detroit kid at heart, but I miss driving.''

HEADLINE: Future Dangers for a Maritime City

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
From its description Rising Currents: Projects for New York's Waterfront, a six-month research program being inaugurated early next month at the Museum of Modern Art, sounds like the kind of dry, somnolent workshop someone would dream up for a convention of civil engineers. Conceived to address the potential effects of rising water levels and apocalyptic storms on the city, the program is modeled on the principles of ''soft infrastructure,'' which proposes flexible ecological systems as an alternative to ''hard'' solutions like concrete dams and storm barriers.
 But the program's real subject is frustration with the federal government's snail-like response to global warming, the brutal effects of the financial crisis, wasteful infrastructure projects and squandered intellectual resources. Its aim is to prod government to think more creatively about our nation's crumbling and outdated fabric. 
 The idea began taking shape several years ago, after the prominent New York engineer Guy Nordenson visited New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and was prompted to study the impact that global warming could have on a seemingly safe coastal city like New York. His findings were alarming: for example, according to a recent study by New York City's panel on climate change, even at current rates of global warming water levels will rise as much as two feet by 2080 as the atmosphere gets hotter. If the ice cap melts at a faster rate, Mr. Nordenson added, the figure could double. In that case a storm surge on top of that could put 20 percent of the city under water. 
 Mr. Nordenson's response was a 360-page blueprint, written with Adam Yarinsky and Catherine Seavitt, that draws as much on historical precedent as technological innovation. A dense network of piers, wetlands and oyster beds could project out into New York Harbor from the waterfronts on all sides, breaking up storm surges. An additional archipelago of small fingerlike islands could be built in the center of the harbor, and old subway cars could be dumped into the water to form reefs.
 If implemented, the plan could psychologically shift the city's epicenter from Manhattan toward the waters to its south, with the waterfronts of Staten Island, Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey reimagined as an interconnected ecosystem dotted with piers and public parks.
 When MoMA's curator of architecture and design, Barry Bergdoll, saw the plan a year ago, he was intrigued. But he had thoughts of his own on the matter. After the Obama administration unveiled its stimulus package this year, he worried that its emphasis on shovel-ready projects would reinforce the problems of the city's existing infrastructure rather than give rise to new, ecologically sound models. 
 The financial collapse also meant that work was drying up for a whole generation of midcareer architects. Why not use this dormant talent to push the project a step further?
 Mr. Bergdoll decided to select four teams that would participate in a program to design four projects in New York Harbor inspired by Mr. Nordenson's guidelines. The teams, which will be announced in the next few weeks, will be provided with studio space on three floors of the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, an affiliate of MoMA, in Long Island City, Queens. The designs could include anything from parks to public housing but must respond to specific site conditions. MoMA plans to exhibit the results next spring.
 This is only the second time that MoMA's architecture department has committed to mount an exhibition of projects before they had even been designed -- a risky proposition, since who knows if the program will produce memorable work? 
 Yet whatever the outcome, Mr. Nordenson and Mr. Bergdoll have already produced something of value. By drawing on the sudden wealth of underemployed brain power, the program takes advantage of one of the few benefits, if you want to call it that, of the financial collapse. And while acknowledging that the causes of global warming, crumbling infrastructure and a collapsing global economy are all connected, it brings these issues down to a manageable scale, one that the public can grasp.
 Washington should be studying this program carefully as it evolves, and emulate it.

HEADLINE: As the Dollar Sinks, Oil Skyrockets

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
Crude oil soared to close above $80 a barrel on Wednesday, breaking that psychological barrier for the first time this year, despite weak global economic conditions.
 Prices have been up in 9 of the last 10 trading days, owing at least in part to the slide of the dollar. Many oil analysts predicted that prices would continue to rise in coming weeks and could reach $100 a barrel by early next year.
 ''Oil is just flying,'' said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at PFGBest Research, a futures trading firm. ''It's off to the races.'' 
 Analysts said rising oil prices reflected confidence that the economy was beginning to rebound from a deep recession, as well as higher demand from refineries for superior grades of oil that were cheaper to refine.
 But they say the most important factor is the falling value of the dollar, which is encouraging traders, institutions and foreign countries to invest their cash in hard assets like oil and gold. Oil is priced in dollars on global markets, and a falling dollar almost always puts upward pressure on oil.
 The rise in the price of crude oil is being accompanied by an increase in gasoline prices, a potential threat to retailers that hope consumers will be able to spend their cash at the mall this holiday season and not at the gas station. The national average price of a gallon of regular gasoline rose by 2 cents on Wednesday from the day before, to $2.60, according to AAA, the automobile club. 
 That was nearly 12 cents above the price of only a week ago. But it is still about 30 cents below the pump price of a year ago, and well below the $4 mark crossed in the summer of 2008.
 The price rise is a reminder of a time just over a year ago when companies up and down the energy pipeline were rushing oil to market, struggling to keep up with demand. 
 That boom ended with the financial panic of late last year. Economic conditions are still weak, leading oil companies to cut their investments in new drilling and production projects and close refineries.
 Demand for oil products in the United States and other industrialized countries remains sluggish. Imports have been declining and are now at the lowest levels since mid-August, while inventories are rising. 
 Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was producing 800,000 barrels a day more than the world market could consume, despite attempts to curtail production. 
 ''You have to be looking through magenta-colored glasses at this point to see demand outstripping supply any time in the next six months,'' Mr. Kloza said. ''This is a minibubble that is dollar-related, and related to financial flows wanting to be long oil as a leverage against a weak dollar.''
 T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oil man, said that he thought the price reflected oil's role as a ''finite resource'' that could potentially rise to $100 again next year. ''Get used to it,'' he said, referring to high oil prices. ''You're going to have to live with it.''
 Traders drove the spot price of oil up $2.25, to $81.37 a barrel on Wednesday, and the price briefly hit $82 before easing.
 Wild price swings, reflecting an unstable market, have become almost normal in recent years. The price of a barrel of oil swelled from just below $100 in January 2008 to nearly $150 that July before collapsing to less than $35 last December. The price has more than doubled since then, and few analysts see the price moving below $75 any time soon. 
 Oil executives expressed optimism that higher prices would encourage more drilling in the United States, which had fallen sharply since last year along with oil prices. But they said they were worried that the continuing zigzags would make future investment decisions difficult. 
 ''We all recognize that last year's too high a price hurt the consumer and the industry itself because the prices were unsustainable,'' said Glenn M. Darden, president and chief executive of Quicksilver Resources, an oil and gas company in Fort Worth. He said he hoped for ''stabilized prices,'' adding, ''at least $80 oil is a lot different from $140 oil.''

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
The features that sold Jennifer Bearss on a Mercedes-Benz six months ago are not the ones Americans might associate with the brand. Ms. Bearss, a nursery-school teacher who lives in a rural area south of here, said her new car used significantly less gas than the minivans and small S.U.V.'s she previously owned, was comparatively affordable and had a roomy interior despite its compact proportions. Perhaps most Canadian of all, its hatchback easily accommodates her children's bulky hockey bags.
 The B200 Mercedes that Ms. Bearss drives is one of a handful of cars sold in Canada and not in the United States. And what Ms. Bearss finds desirable in the B200 are the factors that often influence car shopping in Canada, where Toyota Corollas, not Camrys, and Honda Fits rather than Ford Explorers rule the road. 
 ''Americans often assume that our tastes are similar,'' said Dimitry Anastakis, a history professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, who is writing a book about the Canadian auto industry. ''But when it comes to the second-most important purchase they make, Canadians are very different. There's a kind of realism about cars as a need rather than a desire.''
 Market numbers clearly lay out the difference. Last year, compact and subcompact cars accounted for 35.1 percent of new vehicle sales in Canada, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, based outside Toronto. The comparable figure for the United States: 19.4 percent. At the other end, 16.2 percent of American sales were large, intermediate or luxury S.U.V.'s, while those segments captured 9.2 percent of Canada's market. Only pickup trucks enjoy comparable popularity among buyers on both sides of the border.
 Some of the difference is economic. Canadians have less disposable income than Americans, and the wealthy make up a smaller portion of the population. Because of taxes, Canadians also pay more for gasoline. In late September, the national average price for regular gas in Canada was about $3.30 a gallon, compared with an average of $2.52 in the United States.
 But it is not just about money. There are social and historical differences between the Canadian and American markets. When the United States auto industry reached a peak of styling excess during the 1950s and 1960s, the roads were less flamboyant in Canada. Duties, some reaching 30 and 40 percent, made it impractical for manufacturers to import all but the most expensive cars from the United States. So American-owned auto companies in Canada built a more limited number of models, usually on a single, inefficient assembly line. 
 To introduce variety, automakers jumbled up parts among their brands, at a time when there were real distinctions, to create Canadian models that were often given names suggesting the monarchy or Canadian history.
 Now, because of free trade with the United States, Canada makes a lot of cars. Ontario surpassed Michigan as a car producer in 2004. The vast majority of the cars are immediately shipped to the United States.
 Yet one remnant of the old days lingers. A Honda assembly line in Alliston, Ontario, turns out the Acura CSX, a modestly restyled Civic with a more luxurious interior and deluxe features, and an accordingly higher price. The CSX, a result of a successful attempt to create a luxury model more in line with Canadian preferences, is sold only in Canada.
 Other brands import their low-budget offerings. In showrooms next to its current Golf and Jetta models, Volkswagen Canada sells earlier versions made in Brazil, called the Jetta City and Golf City, a marketing approach the company pioneered in South Africa. At 15,300 Canadian dollars (or $14,200), the Golf City is 5,875 Canadian dollars less than the 2010 base model Golf (although air-conditioning is an option on the City models, it is standard on the current versions). And long before Toyota sold the Yaris subcompact in the United States, it was available in Canada as the Echo, a brand name created for the market.
 Several auto industry executives from the Canadian subsidiaries of European and Asian car makers acknowledge that it can be difficult to convince their head offices that Canada is not simply a northerly part of the United States where some people speak French.
 Marcus W. Breitschwerdt, the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Canada, said that when he proposed selling B-class models like Ms. Bearss's hatchback, ''I really had to fight with the company. We had to go and go again to convince people in Stuttgart that this premium, luxury compact had a future in North America.''
 Mercedes also brought its tiny Smart car to Canada, initially with a diesel rather than a gasoline engine, several years before its introduction in the United States. Unlike its American counterpart, Mercedes Canada distributes and markets the car directly, and its dealers tuck the two-seaters into their showrooms near huge S.U.V.'s and luxury sedans.
 Mr. Breitschwerdt estimates that with accessories, the Smart typically sells for 21,000 Canadian dollars, considerably more than a basic Toyota Corolla (which offers a rear seat and considerably more cargo space). But it swiftly exceeded Mercedes's expectations in Canada. The company expected to sell 1,800 Smarts over three years. Instead, about 3,000 were sold in the first year alone. 
 Much to Mr. Breitschwerdt's surprise, more than half of Smart sales come from dealers in small places like Red Deer, Alberta, where driving is usually associated with pickup trucks. Ads for Smart in Canada have depicted the small cars, originally intended for congested European city centers, zipping around a transport truck on wintry highways.
 Canada, of course, is not entirely about small or practical vehicles. Anyone who was in downtown Montreal when that city hosted a Formula One auto race knows that there are Canadians who buy luxury and exotic cars. But Professor Anastakis, who once worked on automotive policy for the Province of Ontario, said that Canadian big spenders generally picked discreet luxury and performance over flash. ''There's a social stigma to a showy, ostentatious display of wealth through vehicles because it's, well, too American,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
He grew up playing in the narrow, crowded streets of Manhattan's Chinatown. He has lived and worked there for all his 61 years. But as Wee Wong walks the neighborhood these days, he cannot understand half the Chinese conversations he hears.
 Cantonese, a dialect from southern China that has dominated the Chinatowns of North America for decades, is being rapidly swept aside by Mandarin, the national language of China and the lingua franca of most of the latest Chinese immigrants.
The change can be heard in the neighborhood's lively restaurants and solemn church services, in parks, street markets and language schools. It has been accelerated by Chinese-American parents, including many who speak Cantonese at home, as they press their children to learn Mandarin for the advantages it could bring as China's influence grows in the world. 
 But the eclipse of Cantonese -- in New York, China and around the world -- has become a challenge for older people who speak only that dialect and face increasing isolation unless they learn Mandarin or English. Though Cantonese and Mandarin share nearly all the same written characters, the pronunciations are vastly different; when spoken, Mandarin may be incomprehensible to a Cantonese speaker, and vice versa. 
 Mr. Wong, a retired sign maker who speaks English, can still get by with his Cantonese, which remains the preferred language in his circle of friends and in Chinatown's historic core. A bit defiantly, he said that if he enters a shop and finds the staff does not speak his dialect, ''I go to another store.''
 Like many others, however, he is resigned to the likelihood that Cantonese -- and the people who speak it -- will soon become just another facet of a polyglot neighborhood. ''In 10 years,'' Mr. Wong said, ''it will be totally different.'' 
 With Mandarin's ascent has come a realignment of power in Chinese-American communities, where the recent immigrants are gaining economic and political clout, said Peter Kwong, a professor of Asian-American studies at Hunter College.
 ''The fact of the matter is that you have a whole generation switch, with very few people speaking only Cantonese,'' he said. The Cantonese-speaking populace, he added, ''is not the player anymore.'' 
 The switch mirrors a sea change under way in China, where Mandarin, as the official language, is becoming the default tongue everywhere.
 In North America, its rise also reflects a major shift in immigration. For much of the last century, most Chinese living in the United States and Canada traced their ancestry to a region in the Pearl River Delta that included the district of Taishan. They spoke the Taishanese dialect, which is derived from and somewhat similar to Cantonese. 
 Immigration reform in 1965 opened the door to a huge influx of Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong, and Cantonese became the dominant tongue. But since the 1990s, the vast majority of new Chinese immigrants have come from mainland China, especially Fujian Province, and tend to speak Mandarin along with their regional dialects.
 In New York, many Mandarin speakers have flocked to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Flushing, Queens, which now rivals Chinatown as a center of Chinese-American business and political might, as well as culture and cuisine. In Chinatown, most of the newer immigrants have settled outside the historic core west of the Bowery, clustering instead around East Broadway. 
 ''I can't even order food on East Broadway,'' said Jan Lee, 44, a furniture designer who has lived all his life in Chinatown and speaks Cantonese. ''They don't speak English; I don't speak Mandarin. I'm just as lost as everyone else.'' 
 Now Mandarin is pushing into Chinatown's heart. 
 For most of the 100 years that the New York Chinese School, on Mott Street, has offered language classes, nearly all have taught Cantonese. Last year, the numbers of Cantonese and Mandarin classes were roughly equal. And this year, Mandarin classes outnumber Cantonese three to one, even though most students are from homes where Cantonese is spoken, said the principal, Kin S. Wong. 
 Some Cantonese-speaking parents are deciding it is more important to point their children toward the future than the past -- their family's native dialect -- even if that leaves them unable to communicate well with relatives in China. 
 ''I figure if they have to acquire a language, I wanted them to have Mandarin because it makes it easier when they go into the workplace,'' said Jennifer Ng, whose 5-year-old daughter studies Mandarin at the language school of the Church of the Transfiguration, a Roman Catholic parish on Mott Street where nearly half the classes are devoted to Mandarin. Her 8-year-old son takes Cantonese, but only because there is no English-speaking Mandarin teacher for his age group.
 ''Can I tell you the truth?'' she said. ''They hate it! But it's important for the future.'' Until recently, Sunday Masses at Transfiguration were said in Cantonese. The church now offers two in Mandarin and only one in Cantonese. And as the arrivals from mainland China become old-timers, ''we are beginning to have Mandarin funerals,'' said the Rev. Raymond Nobiletti, the Cantonese-speaking pastor.
 At the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, which has been the unofficial government of Chinatown for generations and conducts its business in Cantonese, the president, Justin Yu, said he is the first whose mother tongue is Mandarin to lead the 126-year-old organization. Though he has been taking Cantonese lessons in order to keep up at association meetings, his pronunciation is sometimes a source of hilarity for his colleagues, he said. 
 ''No matter what,'' he added, laughing, ''you have to admire my courage.''
 But even his association is being surpassed in influence by Fujianese organizations, said Professor Kwong of Hunter College. 
 Longtime residents seem less threatened than wistful. Though he is known around Chinatown for what he calls his ''legendarily bad'' Cantonese, Paul Lee, 59, said it pained him that the dialect was disappearing from the place where his family has lived for more than a century.
 ''It may be a dying language,'' he acknowledged. ''I just hate to say that.'' 
 But he pointed out that the changes were a natural part of an evolving immigrant neighborhood: Just as Cantonese sidelined Taishanese, so, too, is Mandarin replacing Cantonese. 
 Mr. Wong, the principal of the New York Chinese School, said he had tried to adjust to the subtle shifts during his 40 years in Chinatown. When he arrived in 1969, he walked into a coffee shop and placed his order in Cantonese. Other patrons looked at him oddly. 
 ''They said, 'Where you from?' '' he recalled. '' 'Why you speak Cantonese?' '' They were from Taishan, he said, so he switched to Taishanese and everyone was happy.
 ''And now I speak Mandarin better than Cantonese,'' he added with a chuckle. ''So, Chinatown -- it's always changing.''

HEADLINE: Vaccine Against Virus in Girls May Be Given to Boys

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Gardasil, the vaccine used to immunize girls and young women against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer, may now be given to boys and young men to protect them from genital warts, a federal advisory group recommended Wednesday.
 But the panel of independent medical experts stopped short of urging its routine use in boys, as it has recommended for girls. And members questioned whether vaccinating boys was a cost-effective way to protect their future sexual partners against cervical and other types of cancer caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV. 
 Gardasil, made by Merck, works against four strains of the virus -- two strains that are responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancers and two strains responsible for about 90 percent of genital warts. But it is expensive, requiring a series of three injections that cost $130 each. 
 The vaccine was approved last week by the Food and Drug Administration for use in boys and men ages 9 to 26. Wednesday's action, by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is intended to guide national policy on use of the vaccine; its recommendations are typically adopted by professional medical associations and set the standards of practice for physicians.
 The new recommendation means, in effect, that doctors and clinics may now administer the vaccine at their discretion to boys and men ages 9 to 26, but they are not expected to offer it. Parents may consider the vaccine as an option for their sons, but some health insurers may choose not to cover the shots.
 Gardasil for girls and young women has caused heated debate among some public health and cancer experts. The debate over the use of the vaccine in boys is likely to be equally heated.
 At a time when the Pap smear test has greatly reduced the death toll from cervical cancer in the United States, some epidemiologists argue that offering the test to women who do not have routine access to gynecologists would have a greater effect than Gardasil.
 ''What we need is a public policy that gets the resources to where the women are who need it the most,'' said Dr. Peter B. Bach, an epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. ''But what you end up with is the wealthiest families getting the vaccine for their daughters.''
 The Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil in 2006 for use in girls and women ages 9 to 26 for the prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts. Last year in the United States, about 37 percent of girls ages 13 to 17 started the HPV vaccine series, a national immunization survey showed, and about half of them completed it.
 In an interview last month, Dr. Richard M. Haupt, Merck's director of research for Gardasil, said that vaccinating young men could reduce the amount of the virus circulating in the population and ultimately lower the incidence of HPV-related cancers in both sexes. 
 But genital warts are a significant problem in themselves, he said. Each year in the United States, he estimated, there are at least 250,000 new cases in males, each of which typically results in three visits to a doctor.
 A clinical trial of about 4,000 young men, sponsored by Merck, reported that the vaccine prevented 89 percent of genital warts. 
 But experts at the vaccine advisory committee meeting debated whether it was appropriate and cost-effective to vaccinate boys for a problem that can be embarrassing and uncomfortable but is not life-threatening. 
 Harrell W. Chesson, a health economist at the disease control centers, said that to reduce HPV, it would be more cost-effective to increase vaccination among girls than among boys.
 The committee said it would take up the issue of the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing HPV-related male cancers at its next session in February, when more data should be available. Merck plans to present studies sometime next year on the efficacy of the vaccine against anal pre-cancers in men who have sex with men, a company spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: Car-Sharing Services Cut Cost of Ownership

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
THE economy may be slowly improving and gas prices have fallen well below their $4 peak, but a growing number of consumers and companies are trying to save money by using car-sharing services that rent vehicles by the hour.
 Car sharing began in Europe decades ago and caught on in the United States starting about 10 years ago. But in the last year, services have grown steadily despite, or perhaps because of the recession. 
 ZipCar, the industry leader, has had its membership jump 30 percent and its revenue rise 25 percent in the last year. The company now has 325,000 members who pay an annual fee of $50 and rent cars for as little as $8 an hour, with gas and insurance included.
 ''In the downturn, smart consumption has been as important as ever,'' said Scott Griffith, chief executive of ZipCar, whose 6,500 cars are in 29 states but are concentrated in New York, Boston and other cities where there are plenty of young drivers who don't own cars but need them on an ad hoc basis.
 ZipCar competes against many small car-sharing services in cities like Chicago and San Francisco and, increasingly, with Connect from Hertz and WeCar from Enterprise, in this emerging market, which is expected to grow to two million members by 2013. 
 Car sharing's success has proved to be a small antidote for traditional rental car companies that have been hurt by slumping rentals and a decline in the number of formerly leased cars, the primary source of vehicles in their fleets.
 Car-sharing companies instead have stocked their fleets with Mazdas, Mini Coopers, hybrids and other cars popular with younger, urban drivers who stress gas mileage and styling.
 Indeed, many companies try to reach young adults by forming alliances with colleges, companies and local governments to help them reduce the size of their fleets and free up parking space.
 Universities are a particularly large opportunity, the companies say, because parents have been looking to save money by sending their children to school without cars. According to a study by the AAA, even a small sedan driven just 10,000 miles a year can cost more than $5,500 to own and maintain.
 ''One of the things we've learned in car sharing is that most people don't have a clue how much they're spending operating a car,'' said Dave Brook, an industry consultant who founded a car-sharing service in Portland, Ore., in 1998. ''It's a very good deal for the colleges because it provides an alternative, and it's a good deal for the company because it's guaranteed revenue.''
 The total number of shared cars on campuses is still a small portion of the overall industry, which is expected to grow several times over to about two million members by 2013, according to one estimate. But car-sharing companies say it is one of the fastest-growing parts of their business, and they say that if students start using their services now, they are more likely to use them when they graduate.
 Colleges, too, want to reduce parking bottlenecks and still give students, particularly freshmen who often cannot keep cars on campus, the chance to drive to a movie, concert or dinner. ZipCar, Connect and WeCar also accept drivers who are as young as 18, unlike most full-service rental car companies, which require that drivers be at least 25 for unrestricted rentals, although some will rent to customers over 21, with additional fees and restrictions. 
 ''Car sharing takes cars off the road, and that fits in with the green movement at these schools,'' said Griff Long, the senior director for global car sharing at Connect by Hertz, which has 10,000 members, most of them at the 15 programs it has at the University of Arizona, Ohio State University and other schools.
 ZipCar, which has cars on 140 campuses, often hires students to help maintain its cars. Connect and WeCar use workers from their networks of suburban rental offices to keep their cars running. They can also add or remove cars on campus as demand warrants. Most schools guarantee that the cars on their campuses will be used a certain number of hours each month, and they agree to cover the difference if those benchmarks are not met.
 The hourly charge to rent cars from campus outlets is often lower than rates charged to regular consumers.
 Erin Kane, a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, has used the WeCar service at her school for two years. Twice a week during her sophomore and junior years, she and her classmates studying Swahili would pick up a family of immigrants from Burundi and drive them to campus so they could take English classes.
 She also rents a Prius or a Ford Escape on campus to attend swing dancing class in downtown St. Louis, to pick up friends at the airport and take her dormitory mates grocery shopping.
 ''It's been very convenient,'' said Ms. Kane, who spends about $45 a month using WeCar, which she pays for with money from a job on campus. ''It makes me question how necessary it is to own a car.''
 In all, there are seven hybrid vehicles available for rent on the Washington University campus. In April, students drove the cars 2,637 hours, 62 percent more than in November 2008, according to Nick Stoff, the manager in charge of parking and transportation at the school.
 So far, 725 students and faculty and staff members have become WeCar customers, a figure Mr. Stoff expects to grow as word spreads that the cars are on campus and are affordable at $10 an hour.
 He says he hopes the program will persuade students to keep their cars at home. ''There are a lot of students who bring their car but don't use it, but want to have it there as a safety blanket,'' he said.
 Indeed, surveys show that 20 percent of drivers who use car-sharing services have given up their first or second vehicle; an additional 40 percent said they put off buying a vehicle.

HEADLINE: 'Shrek' to End Broadway Run on Jan. 3

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
''Shrek the Musical,'' the DreamWorks film studio's first attempt to compete with Disney on Broadway, will close Jan. 3 after 441 performances, its producers said on Wednesday. 
 Based on the popular movies and the William Steig book about a misunderstood ogre and the princess he rescues, ''Shrek'' received mixed reviews when it opened in December, but also set the record at the Broadway Theater for weekly gross ticket sales of $1,260,282 during Christmas week last year.
 Within a month, however, the show's grosses had fallen to about $500,000, far less than needed to cover weekly running costs, which have been pegged in the high six figures, though producers have never given a precise number. The proceeds improved somewhat in the spring and summer; last week, however, ''Shrek'' was back down to grossing $583,404.
 The producers, which include Neal Street Productions, are not expected to recoup their investment in the musical, according to people involved with the production who insisted on anonymity, saying the information was proprietary. Outsiders have estimated that the show cost $25 million to mount, which would make it one of the most expensive productions ever on Broadway (adjusting for inflation). But people involved in the show insisted that it had cost less than that.
 Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, said, ''While we were hopeful that the show would have had a longer run on Broadway, we believe it will continue to create financial value for the company and deliver profits beyond our initial investment.''
 The decision to shutter ''Shrek'' does not preclude future theatrical productions by DreamWorks, people involved in ''Shrek'' said. The studio does not currently have projects bound for Broadway. Disney continues to be represented by ''The Lion King'' and ''Mary Poppins.''

HEADLINE: Finding Ease, Efficiency and Fun on a Scooter

BYLINE: By DEXTER FORD

 BODY:
A FUNNY thing happened on the way to $4-a-gallon gas, financial collapse and gridlocked city traffic. Americans finally climbed off their Hogs and out of their Hummers and discovered scooters -- the zippy, fashion-forward transpo-pods that have long filled the streets and sidewalks of Beijing, Paris, Rome, Shanghai and other cities throughout the world.
 American city dwellers, from Miami to Seattle, are being lured into Vespa and other scooter dealerships by the prospect of 70-plus miles per gallon efficiency, traffic-dodging agility and leave-it-anywhere parkability. 
 ''People in the city are using scooters more and more,'' said Paolo Timoni, president and chief executive of Piaggio Group Americas, the American distributor of Vespa, Piaggio and Aprilia scooters. ''If you were walking across New York City four years ago, you'd be unlikely to see a scooter anywhere. Nowadays, you'll probably see a scooter on every other block. You see them on Park Avenue. You see them in Tribeca. 
 ''Five or six years ago, most people were buying Vespas as recreational vehicles: they liked the design, the great colors, the fact that a Vespa is an Italian product. But more and more, there is a larger share of people who are choosing Vespas as an alternative form of transportation -- either to reduce their cost of transportation, or because of traffic congestion. And some buy a Vespa as an environmental effort, to leave a smaller carbon footprint than a car.'' 
 So the depressed economy and rising gasoline prices have given more urban Americans a practical reason to consider this less-expensive way to move. But once they start riding them, many scooter newcomers discover what Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn learned filming ''Roman Holiday'': these things are a hoot.
 ''I bought a Yamaha 650 cc cruiser,'' said Vijay Yajnik, an ebullient 60-year-old software entrepreneur and scooter neophyte in Torrance, Calif. ''Too much bike, not enough fun. So I got rid of it and got the Vespa. 
 ''And I'm just having a blast,'' he said, buckling his helmet for a brisk Saturday afternoon ride with his new two-wheel posse, the South Bay Scooter Club. The club, like many others across the country, has members ranging from pierced-and-tattooed teenagers to trim sexagenarians, riding a wild mix of machines from loud, stripped-down Honda Ruckuses to sleek, chic $9,000 Piaggio MP3s. 
 Scooters deliver the same flying-over-the-ground, slicing-through-traffic freedom as motorcycles, but without the tough-guy, daredevil image associated with their bigger, faster cousins. And with their simpler, easier-to-learn controls, lighter weight and more modest speed, scooters can more easily slip under the peer-pressure radar of concerned parents, spouses and friends.
 What makes a scooter a scooter? Unlike a motorcycle, which has its (generally larger) motor mounted in front of the rider, a scooter's power plant is mounted in the rear, under the seat, and is generally concealed by styled bodywork. 
 Because all the mechanical stuff -- engine, transmission, fuel tank and so forth -- is hidden under the seat, there is plenty of room to rest one's feet in front; this feature makes it possible to ride a scooter while wearing a skirt. 
 Scooters generally have a lower front fairing, to help keep the rider shielded from flying mud, stones and dust. Smaller wheels add to a scooter's maneuverability while further reducing its over all size and weight. Vintage scooters -- early Vespas, Lambrettas and others -- had clutches and three- or four-speed manual gearboxes, but almost all modern scooters have electric starters and automatic, continuously variable transmissions. Simply hop on, start up and go. 
 Riders new to scooters are cautioned by safety experts to wear a helmet certified by the Department of Transportation -- preferably a full-face design -- and protective clothing and shoes, and to take riding in city traffic very seriously. 
 ''Just because it's called a scooter and is small and cute doesn't mean it's any safer than a big, high-performance motorcycle,'' said David R. Thom, a motorcycle accident researcher with Collision and Injury Dynamics, a safety consulting firm in El Segundo, Calif. 
 Studies have shown that about half of all serious or fatal motorcycle accidents occur at urban-style intersections, with impact speeds below 25 miles an hour. These crashes are primarily caused by auto drivers failing to see bikes and turning into their paths -- an accident that can happen just as easily on a Vespa 50 as on a Suzuki GSX-R1000.
 Safety advocates and scooter manufacturers recommend that before setting out, scooter riders, like motorcyclists, get proper licensing and adequate training, preferably through the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's RiderCourse classes. 
 A new Vespa looks a lot like Peck's 1952 machine, but under the skin there have been a wide range of improvements and innovations. Vintage Vespas and Lambrettas, which are still very popular among dedicated scooteristas, used oil-burning two-stroke engines, identified by their characteristic ringing exhaust sound and wake of blue smoke. Current Vespas and nearly all other modern scooters use much more environmentally friendly four-stroke engines, and advanced antipollution technology like electronic fuel injection is rapidly becoming routine.
 VESPA'S corporate parent, Piaggio, has also heavily invested in a scooter design with two front wheels, the MP3. These advanced machines lean and turn just like a normal scooter, but can be parked, even on tilted ground, by simply locking the tilting mechanism and brake -- no awkward kickstand needed. The dual front wheels and brakes provide added front traction and stopping ability, making the design more confidence-inspiring in rough weather and on slippery manhole covers and trolley tracks.
 Piaggio will even introduce a plug-in hybrid version of the MP3 to the United States next year, allowing riders to charge their batteries at night and ride to work in all-electric mode in the morning, using a small gas engine to extend range and power. Maximum mileage is projected at 140 m.p.g., about twice the efficiency of conventional scooters. 
 Scooters come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny 50 cc machines with top speeds of 30 to 40 miles per hour all the way to 500 cc, 600 cc and bigger maxi scooters, from Piaggio, Suzuki and Honda, which can carry two people and luggage on freeways, at speeds nearing 100 m.p.h. 
 Asian and European urbanites have long embraced the low initial cost, easy parking, traffic-thwarting maneuverability and practicality of scooters. And now, as fuel prices remain high and the economy continues to struggle, Americans are beginning to see the wisdom of the rest of the world's scooter-riding ways. 
 ''I got the idea of getting a scooter in Ho Chi Minh City,'' said Roisin Wisneski, 26, an energy analyst who recently moved from Washington to Brooklyn. 
 ''They are everywhere in Vietnam, and I rented one just to get around,'' Ms. Wisneski said. ''When I got back to D.C., with its wide avenues and limited public transit, it just made sense, and I bought my own.''

 Re ''From Defeat, Lessons in Victory,'' by Gordon M. Goldstein (Op-Ed, Oct. 18):
 Developing strategy through historical analogy is not very helpful.
 Opponents of United States operations in Afghanistan like to point to Vietnam. One could just as well point to the successful invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam or Caesar's occupation of Gaul as models for action in Afghanistan.
 The reality is that every situation is different. Afghanistan is not Vietnam, Cambodia or Gaul. The best course for President Obama is to get all the information he can from people who know something about Afghanistan, look at the overall strategic objectives and find the strategy that is most likely to achieve those objectives. 
 Michael Paluszek Plainsboro, N.J., Oct. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Vietnam War We Ignore'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 18): 
 Lewis Sorley's parallels are correct, but he did not take the subject to resolution. 
 America's desire to bend the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people failed. America will fail in Afghanistan, too, and for some of the same reasons encountered in Vietnam. 
 Americans must understand that cultural and religious differences affect all aspects of life, including politics. In some cultures, no amount of political or military strategy will bend the mind-set of the people. The change must come from within.

 The writer is a Vietnam veteran.
 To the Editor:
 I was an adviser with the United States Agency for International Development to the South Vietnamese National Police from 1968 to 1970. During my service in the five northern provinces of the country, I witnessed the success of the pacification war described by Lewis Sorley in his book. 
 After Congress withdrew both economic and military aid, the country fell, not to internal subversion, but to external invasion.
 In 1978, I was sent back to Southeast Asia to evaluate the continuing flow of refugees out of Vietnam. More than a million Vietnamese fled the Communist regime. Many, if not most, of the refugees I interviewed were fishermen and rice farmers whose way of life was never compatible with the collectivization forced upon them. 
 Estimates of the number who died trying to flee run as high as 500,000. In their decision-making, the president and Congress need to factor in the human costs of disengagement.
 Michael G. Harpold Ketchikan, Alaska, Oct. 18, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Lewis Sorley describes what he calls ''successful changes in strategy undertaken in the later years of the conflict.'' He suggests that these changes won hearts and minds for the central government.
 His Vietnam was unlike the one I served in as an infantryman in 1969. As we patrolled, we hit explosive devices that the villagers could have alerted us to, but did not. We cordoned villages to capture their men as they tried to visit home or return to their Vietcong jungle base camps. 
 Meanwhile, South Vietnamese forces seldom ventured out to patrol and disrupt the movements of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese Army in the surrounding countryside and jungle. That more dangerous task was left to us.
 To us, the South Vietnamese population seemed at best indifferent and at worst hostile to their central government. Its fall was no surprise to us.
 Robert Driskill Nashville, Oct. 20, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Gordon M. Goldstein advises President Obama to follow, in Afghanistan, the example of President John F. Kennedy's 1961-63 ''middle way'' in Vietnam. Right or wrong, it's not a promising example. 
 In Vietnam it led directly to the choice President Lyndon B. Johnson faced in 1965: escalate or lose. Kennedy left Johnson with a two-part policy: (1) Don't let the Communists take over South Vietnam, and (2) really by example only, don't commit American troops in large numbers.
 As McGeorge Bundy put it 30 years later, those two propositions couldn't have coexisted by 1965. Saigon was rapidly losing the war. (William Bundy's proposal of some 100,000 United States troops was intended only as a holding action to test how American troops would fare.) 
 In Vietnam the goal was clear but unattainable by any means not grossly disproportionate to the American stake. 
 False inferences from that failure will not help President Obama with the hard question he is wrestling with: what feasible goals and means in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in Somalia and worldwide will minimize the chance of a major terrorist attack on the United States, wherever it may originate, in a cost-effective way?
 Francis M. Bator Wellesley, Mass., Oct. 21, 2009
 The writer, former deputy national security adviser to President Johnson, is professor emeritus at the Harvard Kennedy School.
 To the Editor:
 Lewis Sorley reminds us of ''the many successful changes in strategy undertaken in the later years'' of the Vietnam War. 
 Perhaps we did learn how to win some local battles after 1967. But we still lost the war. 
 No matter how good our tactics in the field may be, if we support a corrupt and unpopular government in Afghanistan, there's no reason to think that the outcome will be any different than when we supported a corrupt, unpopular government in Saigon.
 Mike Sandman Brookline, Mass., Oct. 19, 2009

HEADLINE: Twin Biographies of a Singular Woman, Ayn Rand

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
AYN RAND AND THE WORLD SHE MADE
 By Anne C. Heller
 Illustrated. 567 pages. Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $35.
 GODDESS OF THE MARKET
 Ayn Rand and the American Right
 By Jennifer Burns
 Illustrated. 369 pages. Oxford University Press. $27.95.
 Ayn Rand poses theatrically in her signature cape and gold dollar-sign pin on the cover of a groundbreaking new biography. Rand also poses theatrically in this same Halloween-ready costume (Rand impersonators have been known to wear it) on the cover of another groundbreaking new biography. The two books are being published a week apart. And both have gray covers that make them look even more interchangeable. Yet Rand, whose Objectivist philosophy is enjoying one of its periodic resurgences, loathed the very idea of grayness. She preferred dichotomies that were strictly black and white. 
 So in a Rand universe -- like those of ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged,'' the doorstop treatise-style novels that have given her such staying power -- it would be unacceptable that one of these books would be only moderately better than the other. And the versions of her story should not overlap as vastly as they do. 
 But both authors, Anne C. Heller (''Ayn Rand and the World She Made'') and Jennifer Burns (''Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right'') make many of the same points and touch on many of the same biographical details. That repetition is especially surprising since Ms. Burns had access to the supposedly crucial Ayn Rand Papers at the Ayn Rand Institute in Irvine, Calif. Ms. Heller did not.
 Still, Ms. Heller's research is more intensive. It is so thorough, in fact, that it seems to inform Ms. Burns's parallel but more cursory account of Rand's personal life. (The Heller manuscript has been in circulation for long enough to be cited in one of Ms. Burns's footnotes and included in her bibliography.) Ms. Heller has delivered a thoughtful, flesh-and-blood portrait of an extremely complicated and self-contradictory woman, coupling this character study with literary analysis and plumbing the quirkier depths of Rand's prodigious imagination. Ms. Burns glosses through all this to arrive at her book's best section, a lengthy coda about Rand's intellectual and political legacies. Neither book is the work of a slavish Rand devotee.
 Ms. Heller's book is worth its $35 price, which is not the kind of detail that Rand herself would have been shy about trumpeting. When Russian Bolshevik soldiers commandeered and closed the St. Petersburg pharmacy run by Zinovy Rosenbaum, they made a lifelong capitalist of his 12-year-old daughter, Alissa, who would wind up fusing the subversive power of the Russian political novel with glittering Hollywood-fueled visions of the American dream. 
 While Ms. Heller sifts carefully through Rand's early literary influences (very notably a French boys' serial adventure story called ''The Mysterious Valley,'' whose dashing hero, according to Ms. Heller, greatly influenced Rand's tastes in both real and fictitious men), Ms. Burns gets her out of Russia more hurriedly. Both books take her to California, and to the fishy story of how this young Russian ingenue, on only her second day in Hollywood, was plucked out of obscurity by Cecil B. DeMille, who cast her as an extra in ''King of Kings.'' Ms. Heller's book does not let this fable go unquestioned. Ms. Burns doesn't do more than replay it; her primary interests lie elsewhere.
 So Ms. Heller provides the far more nuanced version of the strange dynamics between Rand and her husband, Frank O'Connor, whom she called ''Cubbyhole.'' (He gave her the unlikeliest imaginable nickname for such a steel-willed woman: ''Fluff.'') Ms. Heller also provides a more evocative, detailed account of the long, duplicitous affair that Rand conducted with Nathaniel Branden, who began as a fan 25 years her junior and spent years as her foremost acolyte and officially anointed intellectual heir. 
 Both books characterize Rand's long relationship with Branden as the most important connection in her life. And both use it to illustrate how drastically Rand's personal ties could rupture. The amphetamine-addicted, self-styled goddess in both books becomes so moody and volatile that her associates do not simply part ways with her. Some, like Branden and his wife, Barbara, wind up excommunicated. When Rand died, Heller reports, there were bodyguards at her funeral to keep the Brandens away if they tried to attend. Ms. Burns ignores that detail, preferring to cite the dollar-sign-shaped topiary that was part of the funeral decor.
 Crucially, both authors understand the reasons that Rand's popularity has endured, not only among college students dazzled (and thronged into packs) by her triumphant individualism but also by entrepreneurs. From the young Ted Turner, who rented billboards to promote the ''Who is John Galt?'' slogan from ''Atlas Shrugged,'' to the founders of Craigslist and Wikipedia, who have found self-contradictory new ways to mix populism with individual enterprise, it is clear that (in Ms. Burns's words) ''reports of Ayn Rand's death are greatly exaggerated.'' 
 Ms. Burns gives a lucid account of how Rand set herself at odds with religious conservatism, how Rand-inspired libertarianism has shape-shifted, and even how Rand disciples of the 1970s adopted a hippie aspect to rival that of Students for a Democratic Society, confounding everyone, Rand included. She referred to libertarian fans as ''scum,'' ''intellectual cranks'' and ''plagiarists.'' Rand also complained, ''If such hippies hope to make me their Marcuse, it will not work.'' 
 That era was one Rand moment. This seems to be another. Both of these books cast light on why Rand's popularity can be rekindled by economic turmoil, and on how much her real life and reputation diverged. Both capture the temperament of a woman once described as ''the Evel Knievel of leaping to conclusions.'' But of these two authors, it is Ms. Heller who comes closer to conveying what is missing from most images of Rand: ''a personal warmth and charm that Rand most assuredly possessed,'' on the evidence of her hypnotic effect on those in her orbit. Rand might have expressed disdain for that charisma, but it was enough to stop DeMille in his tracks. She would have been nowhere without it.

HEADLINE: 'Green' and 'Luxurious' In the Same Sentence

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WHEN hybrid cars make a green statement, they tend to proclaim penny-pinching mileage and shared sacrifice. But mass-market hybrids like the Toyota Prius have been about as luxurious as a recycling bin, as racy as hemp Birkenstocks. 
 Now, in the face of stricter mileage standards, a new generation of luxury hybrids and plug-ins is looking to convince affluent buyers that they can have their green cake and eat it, too. Even luxury automakers that once publicly scorned hybrids, especially diesel-centric European companies, are readying electric-bolstered cars for showrooms. 
 Mercedes, BMW, Infiniti, Audi, Porsche, Cadillac and Land Rover are among the brands whose inaugural hybrids are either hitting the market or in the works. Fisker Automotive, the brainchild of the auto designer Henrik Fisker that is based in Irvine, Calif., is aiming at June for deliveries of its $80,000 Karma plug-in hybrid sedan. Even the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid, set for sale in November 2010, is pegged by many analysts as a roughly $35,000 car, well above the price of typical family transportation. 
 Those cars will battle a growing lineup of Lexus models, including the new HS 250h sedan, that until recently had the luxury hybrid field to itself. ''There's no rule that an environmental car has to be small and dorky,'' said Mr. Fisker, the former Aston Martin design chief. 
 Previous luxury hybrids, he said, have often failed to deliver either the significant design or mileage gains that would justify premium prices. The Karma and Karma S convertible, by contrast, look voluptuous and exotic. The Fiskers can travel up to 50 miles on their lithium-ion batteries before a small gasoline engine kicks in to extend driving range to 300 miles. The company expects a federal economy rating of about 67 m.p.g., but better than 100 m.p.g. for drivers who charge the car nightly and have modest commutes. 
 ''It's more efficient than any Prius, but beautiful like a Ferrari,'' Mr. Fisker said, adding that today's customers want their high technology in a smartly designed package. 
 ''If the iPhone had been ugly, it wouldn't have captured the market,'' he said. 
 Mercedes has begun selling the S400 Hybrid. This huge, sumptuous sedan can deliver 29 highway miles per gallon in real-world driving, a significant 6-m.p.g. gain over the V-8-powered S-Class. In November, Mercedes will offer a hybrid version of its ML-Class crossover S.U.V. The first entry from BMW, the ActiveHybrid X6 crossover S.U.V., goes on sale in December. This spring, BMW will market a roughly $100,000 version of its flagship sedan, the ActiveHybrid 7-Series, promoting it as the world's fastest hybrid.
 The Mercedes S400 aims to dodge common hybrid pitfalls, like huge, weighty nickel-metal-hydride batteries that hog trunk space or add several thousand dollars to the vehicle's price. Combining a compact, power-dense lithium-ion battery -- the same chemistry used by the Volt, Fisker and Tesla Roadster electric car -- with a downsized V-6 engine, the Mercedes does save fuel. While it's expensive, starting around $89,000, the S400 costs about $4,000 less than the V-8 gasoline S550 version. 
 ''In the past you had to sacrifice something to get a hybrid,'' said Rob Moran, a Mercedes spokesman. ''Now cars can offer size, performance and luxury, and still the feel-good of owning a hybrid.''
 INDUSTRY analysts say regulatory pressures, perhaps more than consumer demand or automaker altruism, are driving the luxury hybrid market. Achieving fuel economy standards proposed by the Obama administration will be a particular challenge for exclusive luxury and sports-car makers like Mercedes and Porsche, which cannot offset thirstier models with sales of tiny economy cars. (Mercedes does sell small numbers of the Smart two-seater.) 
 In response, automakers are hedging their bets by developing a range of alternative fuel technologies. Automakers complain that volatile gas prices and a lack of a national energy policy are making it hard to gauge demand for high-mileage cars. 
 ''As long as gas is less than $3 a gallon, demand for hybrids will remain fairly low,'' said Mike Omotoso, global powertrain analyst at J. D. Power & Associates.
 Despite heavy publicity and anxiety over fuel prices and global warming, hybrids still hold less than 3 percent of the market. J. D. Power expects that to jump to 9.3 percent by 2015, driven by a huge influx of new models, including plug-ins. And Mr. Omotoso said luxury hybrids could provide ideal green cover for an otherwise conspicuous lifestyle. ''Because of the financial meltdown, and people pointing the finger at fat cats, a hybrid S-Class or 7-Series says, 'Sure, I'm rich, but socially responsible,' '' he said.
 Luxury hybrid makers also view their cars as test beds for technology that can trickle down to everyday machines. Earlier this year, Fisker received $529 million under a federal loan program for advanced technology cars, with Tesla receiving $465 million. Ford got $5.9 billion and Nissan $1.6 billion in low-interest loans, the latter to build a plant in Tennessee for the coming Nissan Leaf all-electric car.
 Some critics have questioned taxpayer-financed loans for boutique companies building small numbers of cars for elite buyers. Yet both Fisker and Tesla defend the loans as crucial to advancing lithium-ion technology and creating more-affordable models. While the Karma is being built in Finland, Fisker will use $360 million of the loan to develop and build a lower-priced plug-in at a retooled plant in the United States. (Under the loan terms, no money can be spent outside the country.) Fisker estimates that the new sedan, code-named Project Nina and scheduled for sale in 2012, will cost $40,000 after a $7,500 federal tax credit. 
 Tesla is using its loan to develop the Model S, an all-electric sedan due in 2011 and priced below $50,000 after its own tax credit. 
 Mr. Fisker has big dreams for his juiced-up cars, envisioning annual worldwide sales of 15,000 for the Karma and 75,000 or more for the Project Nina. Even those totals are a drop in the oilpan by Toyota or Chevy standards. But he says the companies that will reinvent the automobile must start small -- and with big prices. 
 ''The early adopter will take the risk and pay the price,'' he said. ''But one day we'll see plug-in hybrids for $20,000.''

HEADLINE: As Dollar Falls, Oil Tops $80 a Barrel

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Oil prices hit new highs for the year Wednesday just as the dollar fell to new lows against the euro, showing how much the weak American currency has come to dominate energy markets. 
 Benchmark crude for December delivery jumped close to 3 percent, or $2.38 to $81.50 a barrel in afternoon trading in New York.
Futures of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas all rose 2 percent to 3 percent.
 The run-up in prices came within minutes of a government report showing that crude supplies in the United States are growing and that refiners are producing very little gasoline because consumers are not using as much.
 ''The dollar obviously is the overriding factor,'' an analyst at PFGBest, Phil Flynn, said. ''It's not about demand I can tell you that.''
 Refiners are shutting down plants, a combination of little demand and rising crude prices that wipe out profit margins.
 That can have real consequences at the pump. The government reported Wednesday that gasoline supplies fell by more than 2 million barrels last week and gasoline futures rose 2 percent.
 There is usually a lag between the direction of crude bought and sold on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the price that people pay for gasoline to fill up their cars.
 Crude began to rise on Oct. 7, when a barrel cost less than $70, and moved higher for eight days straight nearly reaching $80. Average retail gasoline prices started ticking higher one week later and a gallon has increased every day since, up about 12 cents in one week to $2.596 on Wednesday, according to the auto club AAA, Wright Express and Oil Price Information Service.
 A gallon is still 29 cents less than last year at this time, when gas prices were in full retreat.
 There are concerns that spiking energy prices could stunt an economic recovery in Europe and the United States. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said Tuesday that crude prices at $80 a barrel right now was worrisome.

HEADLINE: To Honor a Battler, Literary Peace Breaks Out

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The Norman Mailer who was honored Tuesday night by the glittery literati at a gala benefit was generous, nurturing and diligent, a big cuddly teddy bear with rumpled white hair and a rocking chair that faced the bay. Only occasionally did the more familiar Mailer appear, the wild, fierce, and contentious celebrity who probably deserved more punches in the smacker than he delivered in his lifetime.
 ''Norman Mailer lived a long time, and the ferocious genius, sometimes erratic personality was not the same at 75 or 80,'' said David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, who along with Tina Brown, was a co-chairman of the party at Cipriani in Midtown Manhattan. 
 One of the worst things you could do to a writer like Mailer is ''to domesticate him into a tabby cat,'' Mr. Remnick said. Then he shrugged. ''It's an award dinner.''
 And indeed it was. The cause was the newly created Norman Mailer Writers Colony, the brainchild of Lawrence Schiller, Mailer's longtime friend and collaborator, who created this nonprofit organization and these awards both to honor Mailer and to support both new and established writers. With the help of Mailer's widow, Norris Church Mailer, the couple's house in Provincetown, Mass., has been turned into a residential educational center. Mr. Schiller said the event brought in about $200,000. (The publisher and investor Spas Roussev, who is on the colony's executive board, underwrote the dinner.)
 The brightest stars of PBS, the ''Charlie Rose'' show and PEN attended, including the Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, who was recognized with a lifetime achievement award; Salman Rushdie; Don DeLillo; Joan Didion; Doris Kearns Goodwin; Michael Cunningham; Colum McCann; Jhumpa Lahiri; and Calvin Trillin, who served as master of ceremonies. The filmmakers Oliver Stone, in a camel sport coat, khakis and sneakers, and John Waters, in a purple-and-black suit, lent the evening a sprinkle of Hollywood celebrity and fashion diversity. (Mr. Waters's Provincetown home was five blocks from Mailer's.)
 Gay Talese, trim in a tuxedo, delivered the most-distinguished writer award to David Halberstam, which was accepted by his widow, Jean. To Mr. Talese the event, which he helped organize, underscores how New York's literary world is a ''basket of crabs,'' with a small group all vying for a limited pool of money, attention and prestige. Mr. Talese was thinking of Mailer's love-hate relationship with the PEN American Center, of which Mailer was president between 1984 and 1986, when Mr. Talese was a vice president. 
 ''PEN was more or less a literary tea party with a small budget and limited influence in the book and academic industry,'' he explained. Mailer put it on the map, he said, by organizing an international writers' conference and tapping his wealthy friends for support. ''Mailer being Mailer, however, had ways of offending others who were part of PEN,'' Mr. Talese said. Some resented the commercialism, while many women were furious at him for his antifeminist stance. Mailer meanwhile was insulted because he felt PEN did not appreciate him. PEN didn't even bother to honor Mailer until last year, after his death, Mr. Talese said, nor was the group interested in cosponsoring some of the Mailer awards. ''Now we have Mailer Inc. and PEN Inc.,'' he said, and ''just so much money to go around to fund these organizations.''
 Before Cipriani's waiters began handing out Bellinis, Mr. Schiller mentioned that he was at a book party recently where he ran into an officer of PEN, who wanted to revisit the idea of a collaboration between the two organizations. As Mr. Schiller recalled, she said: ''There is only so much money to go around in the literary community. Is this the right thing to do?''
 Mr. Schiller replied, ''That ship has sailed.''
 Other writers who attended the fund-raising benefit and are active in PEN scoffed at suggestions of a conflict, though. ''PEN is in my heart,'' said Ms. Brown, who has also helped organized PEN's annual spring galas. While the recession has made it difficult to raise money, the two groups are doing different things, she added, with the Mailer group focused on education and PEN following human rights and freedom of speech.
 Mr. Schiller gave PEN a table. The center's current president, Kwame Anthony Appiah, along with other trustees attended. Francine Prose, a former PEN president, praised the new Mailer awards, saying ''anything that helps younger writers'' was welcome.
 Two of those young writers were in attendance. One of them, John Gilmore, a senior at Utah State University won the National College Award for nonfiction writing. When William Kennedy announced his name and home state, one could see the heads of audience members tip sideways as they whispered. Could he be related to Gary Gilmore, the convicted murderer who asked Utah officials to execute him, and whose life was chronicled by Mailer and Mr. Schiller in the Pulitzer Prize winning 1979 novel ''The Executioner's Song''?
 ''No,'' Mr. Gilmore said afterward with a laugh as he stood arm in arm with his wife, Maryssa DeLeon, who is also in college, studying mortuary science. He added that Mr. Schiller told him the awards committee had spent three weeks investigating if there were any connection before it contacted him about the prize.
 The other winner, Emily Swanagin from Birmingham, Ala., won the National High School Award. ''I'm so nervous,'' she said, standing on a platform in front of the more than 320 guests. ''I've never been this famous before.'' 
 A glimpse of Mailer's rougher side did come through in the end. Ms. Goodwin, who was asked to bring the evening's events to a close, told a story about Mailer's kvetching during a final stay as her guest in Boston shortly before he died in 2007. He had demanded a more accommodating toilet in the guest bathroom for his next visit, and she promised to oblige. ''Now every time I go into that bathroom and see that toilet, I think of Norman,'' she said.
 It may not have been the image of the heroic novelist that Mailer would most like to be remembered by, but at least he wasn't a teddy bear.

HEADLINE: Rising Taxes Squeeze Local Operations

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
When property taxes go up, homeowners can find other homeowners willing to fight for relief. Big businesses, too, can flex their muscles. But small businesses are often left behind, mainly because they are, well, small.
 ''The little guys get hurt more by rate hikes because they have less bargaining power with their local city governments or taxing jurisdictions,'' said Myron Orfield, a University of Minnesota Law School professor and property tax specialist. 
 Chris Hoene, director of research and policy for the National League of Cities, an association in Washington said that the property tax problem of some small-business owners was ''a story that isn't told often enough, even though it closely approximates the one that we tell about homeowners on fixed incomes who can't afford their property taxes.'' 
 With tax revenue down, said Robert J. Cline, director of state and local tax policy economics for the Ernst & Young accounting firm, all businesses face potential property tax rate increases. But property taxes represent a greater portion of the total tax bill for small businesses, Mr. Cline said. ''So if property tax rates rise significantly, small businesses may see that this recession has a more severe impact on them in terms of taxes compared to the 2001 recession, when property values held up like a champ,'' making rate increases unnecessary. 
 After the 2001 recession, there were ''residential property tax revolts'' in a number of states, including Florida and Indiana, said Gerald Prante, an economist for the Tax Foundation, a tax policy group in Washington. ''In many respects, homeowners got what they wanted, and as a result there was a shift in some municipalities to higher property taxes for businesses.'' 
 Grafton Willey IV, a tax accountant who heads the Rhode Island chapter of the National Small Business Association, an advocacy group based in Washington, said that while homeowners carried much of the property tax burden, ''they vote, and often push politicians to put more of it on businesses.'' 
 Susan M. Wachter, a real estate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that large retailers could push their rent costs down throughout America's malls. ''Large malls will follow through with requesting lowered property tax from municipalities,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''Small entrepreneurs and tenants do not have similar information resources to even know whether and how much property tax payments are being lowered for others.'' 
 Mr. Orfield said that municipalities with the least property wealth -- central cities and older ''inner-ring'' suburbs where foreclosures had weakened an already fragile tax base -- were the most compelled to raise rates. 
 ''In many big metro areas, where hundreds of surrounding cities have competed for property wealth by zoning for the biggest housing and most valuable commercial property, it's a disaster,'' he said. ''Twenty percent got all the good jobs and big homes, which allows them to have lower tax rates. The rest got nothing -- and a small-business person there, who probably has one location where he needs to do business, will be hurt when rates go up.'' 
 Paul Scully, an organizer for Building One America and the Gamaliel Foundation, community grass-roots groups based in Chicago, said that rising tax rates had been ''devastating for owners of one-off small businesses like hardware stores, barbershops and bookstores.'' 
 According to the Tax Foundation, using the latest available Census Bureau data, New Jersey collected the nation's highest per-capita combined local and state property tax, $2,485, in 2007. Connecticut, where -- as in New Jersey and most other states -- local schools depend heavily on local property tax dollars, placed second with $2,312; New York was sixth with $1,963. Alabama collected the least, $455. 
 Beyond greater state financing for schools, property tax relief generally takes two forms, said Mr. Hoene of the National League of Cities -- so-called circuit breakers, which limit increases for homeowners on fixed incomes, and one-size-fits-all caps on rate increases. 
 Caps -- including those under California's trend-setting Proposition 13, approved by voters in 1978 -- come off when a property is sold. Mr. Hoene said most of the benefits of caps eventually flow to ventures that change hands infrequently, like apartment buildings, and big businesses that can move property under their corporate umbrella. 
 Caps can also have unintended consequences, like California's recent increases in state income and sales taxes or reductions in local services that small businesses need. And entrepreneurs operating on narrow profit margins get no circuit breakers, Mr. Hoene said. ''We think about relief for homeowners on fixed incomes, but rarely consider those most at risk on the commercial side.'' 
 In Bloomfield, N.J., Kelly Conklin and his wife, Kathryn Schackner, own Foley-Waite Associates, a 31-year-old architectural woodworking company that produces interiors for high-end Manhattan residences. The company employs nine full-time workers with benefits and rents space in a former 19th-century knitting mill. 
 Under his lease, Mr. Conklin pays his landlords' property taxes, which he expects will soon rise $100 to $200 a month. That is not a lot of money, Mr. Conklin said, ''But this is not a business of having your throat cut by one expense -- it's a death of a thousand cuts.''
 He added: ''All our costs are up. We're now working our way through a backlog of orders, but given the financial meltdown in Manhattan and the attendant decline in real estate values, there's a cliff out there with our name on it.'' 
 Mr. Conklin has a unique perspective on property taxes. He sits on the planning board of Glen Ridge, the next town over, where he and his wife live. While unhappy about his tax increase, he is deeply worried that Bloomfield's interest in far greater revenue may lead to his losing his space. 
 ''A developer has bought the adjacent industrial parcel, and I know he has discussed a development scheme for multiunit housing with Bloomfield officials,'' Mr. Conklin said.
 ''If he pursues the idea, he may well succeed in getting the parcel rezoned -- multiunit housing yields significantly more property tax revenue than an old mill,'' Mr. Conklin said. ''And if that happens, I'm worried that he may then give our landlords an offer for the mill that is too attractive for them to refuse.'' 
 He added, ''It's hard to run a business with this much uncertainty, on top of everything else.''
 Polly Cleveland, a land economist who teaches environmental economics at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, said there were ''an awful lot of people in Mr. Conklin's position'' because local services were overly dependent on local property taxes. 
 ''There is nothing wrong with the property tax,'' said Ms. Cleveland, herself an entrepreneur who with her husband, Thomas Haines, last paid property taxes of about $190,000 on two small Manhattan apartment buildings they recently sold. ''It is actually the most progressive tax that we have when we administer it properly and finance services such as health and education at the state level.''

HEADLINE: $13 an Hour? 500 Sign Up, 1 Wins a Job

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: BURNS HARBOR, Ind. 

 BODY:
As soon as the job opening was posted on the afternoon of Friday, July 10, the deluge began.
 C.R. England, a nationwide trucking company, needed an administrative assistant for its bustling driver training school here. Responsibilities included data entry, assembling paperwork and making copies.
 It was a bona-fide opening at a decent wage, making it the rarest of commodities here in northwest Indiana, where steel industry layoffs have helped drive unemployment to about 10 percent.
 When Stacey Ross, C. R. England's head of corporate recruiting, arrived at her desk at the company's Salt Lake City headquarters the next Monday, she found about 300 applications in the company's e-mail inbox. And the fax machine had spit out an inch-and-a-half thick stack of resumes before running out of paper. By the time she pulled the posting off Careerbuilder.com later in the day, she guessed nearly 500 people had applied for the $13-an-hour job. ''It was just shocking,'' she said. ''I had never seen anything so big.'' 
 Ms. Ross had only a limited amount of time to sort through the resumes. While C. R. England has not been immune to the downturn, it has added significantly to its stable of drivers and continued to hire office staff members to support them. Ms. Ross was also trying to fill more than two dozen other positions.
 The 34-year-old recruiter decided the fairest approach was simply to start at the beginning, reviewing resumes in the order in which they came in. When she found a desirable candidate, she called to ask a few preliminary questions, before forwarding the name along to Chris Kelsey, the school's director. When he had a big enough pool to evaluate, she would stop. Anyone she did not get to was simply out of luck. 
 She dropped significantly overqualified candidates right away, reasoning that they would leave when the economy improved. Among them was a former I.B.M. business analyst with 18 years experience; a former director of human resources; and someone with a master's degree and 12 years at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. 
 Over the course of four days, Ms. Ross forwarded 61 resumes to Mr. Kelsey, while rejecting 210 others. The remainder never even got a look. Many were, in fact, never uploaded to the company's internal system because there were too many.
 Just before the advertisement was removed, a standard one-page resume arrived from Tiffany Block, 28, who lived in nearby Portage and had lost her job four months earlier as an accounts receivable manager at a building company when it closed its Indiana office. 
 Someone she knew had applied for the job and had said so on Facebook. Ms. Block went to the company's Web site and filed an application online, which many others had not. By doing do, her application went directly into the company's system. She was hardly optimistic, since she had not had an interview in months.
 Ms. Ross, however, passed it on the next day to Mr. Kelsey. 
 Attendance at Mr. Kelsey's school has surged during the recession. Mr. Kelsey, 33, had just promoted one of his three administrative assistants, who handle the paperwork needed for drivers to hit the road. He needed a replacement quickly. 
 The overwhelming response astonished him. He asked Cheree Seawood, one of his current assistants, to go through the resumes and help pick out several to interview. To make the task easier, he decided they should be even more rigorous in ruling out anyone who appeared even slightly overqualified. Mr. Kelsey, an ardent New England Patriots fan, compared his personnel strategy to the team's everyman approach.
 ''We like to get the fair and middling talent that will work for the wages and groom them from within,'' he said. 
 In other words, he said, he did not want the former bank branch manager Ms. Ross had sent, or the woman who had once owned a trucking company, or even the former legal secretary.
 He also realized that in this climate he could afford to be extra picky and require trucking industry experience.
 The company eventually settled on eight people to interview, inviting in the first two just five days after the job was posted.
 In the past, Mr. Kelsey had mostly ad-libbed interviews, but this time he asked his company's human resources department for help. They sent him a list of 13 questions, as well as an eight-page packet with 128 questions grouped under 50 ''competencies.'' He decided he would ask them all.
 At the end of each hourlong interview, he and Ms. Seawood each jotted down a rating for each applicant and then compared them. 
 Invariably, the candidates' job search travails came up. One woman who lost her job had started working as a waitress and confessed she had come directly from her job on the overnight shift. 
 But Mr. Kelsey resolved to keep his personal sympathies at bay. ''If you start judging applicants on want or need, eventually that want, or need, will go away when they get the job and their financial situation stabilizes,'' he said. ''Then you're left with whatever skills they have.''
 Before Ms. Seawood called Ms. Block to schedule an interview, she had been getting increasingly depressed. 
 ''I felt like, I'm 28 years old, and I don't have a job,'' she said. ''What am I doing with myself?''
 But Mr. Kelsey was immediately impressed when she came in on the second day of interviews. Dressed in a conservative business suit, Ms. Block patiently answered all of the 100-plus questions. Mr. Kelsey liked that she remained consistent in her answers and showed independence.
 Afterward, Mr. Kelsey gave Ms. Block a 9; Ms. Seawood rated her at a point lower.
 The next week, however, Ms. Seawood gravitated to a different candidate. The woman had just had nose surgery and came in wearing a protective mask. Besides her qualifications, the fact she had not tried to postpone impressed Ms. Seawood. 
 But when Mr. Kelsey invited the woman back, the interview was a disaster. She grew visibly irritated amid his battery of questions.
 Mr. Kelsey immediately called Ms. Block to ask if she could come in for a second interview. 
 Was an hour from now too soon? 
 Momentarily panicked, Ms. Block quickly assented. 
 Mr. Kelsey marched through many of his questions again. Then, trying to gauge her ability to be assertive among truck drivers, he added a new hypothetical: if she were in the stands at a baseball game and a foul ball came her way, would she stand up to try to catch it, or wait in her seat and hope it fell her way?
 The other finalist had said she would wait. But Ms. Block said immediately that she would jump up to grab it. 
 Mr. Kelsey decided he had found his hire.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo Says Profit Doubled in Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company said Wednesday that its third-quarter profit nearly doubled from a year ago, although it joined other big American banks in reporting higher loan losses. 
 Wells, the nation's fourth-largest bank, said it earned $3.2 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the period ended Sept. 30. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 37 cents per share.
 The San Francisco-based bank said losses from bad loans climbed to $5.1 billion. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have all reported higher credit losses as consumers struggle to pay off their bills.
 Wells Fargo, which acquired the Wachovia Corporation last fall, says it expects credit losses to peak in 2010.
 The bank's stock was up about 1 percent, to $30.75, in early trading on Wall Street.
 Among the other banks reporting a rise in earnings was US Bancorp, which said Wednesday that its third-quarter profit rose 4.7 percent as interest income and its fee revenue rose. But it said its bad loans rose too.
 Stress in residential home construction and related industries drove the number of bad loans up 9.3 percent just since the end of June.
 The Minneapolis-based bank earned $583 million, or 30 cents per share, on revenue of $4.25 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting a profit of 27 cents per share on revenue of $4.12 billion.
 There were several bright spots.The company saw mortgage banking revenue rise by $215 million as homeowners refinanced during a stretch when interest rates were low. Revenue from commercial products rose 18.9 percent.
 USBancorp's shares were up about 6.6 percent, to $25.37, in early trading.
 Not all banks were reporting profits. The banking company KeyCorp said Wednesday that its loss widened considerably in the third quarter as it set aside more money for possible loan losses as borrowers are having a tough time repaying debts amid the recession.
 The Cleveland-based company said its results also reflected write-downs on real estate-related investments, higher costs of other real estate it owns and write-offs of intangible assets.
 KeyCorp said its loss available to common shareholders was $438 million, or 52 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $48 million, or 10 cents per share, during the same quarter a year ago.
 Analysts in a Thomson Reuters survey had expected on average a loss of 41 cents per share. Such estimates generally exclude one-time charges or gains.
 Revenue slipped to $981 million from $1.07 billion a year ago.
 Its shares were up 3.3 percent, to $6.69, in early trading.

HEADLINE: Eyeing a Democratic Win, the President Joins Corzine in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J. 

 BODY:
Hoping to spare his party an embarrassing defeat in one of the year's most closely watched elections, President Obama campaigned on Wednesday evening alongside New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine, saying that a Democratic victory in the state would help the president carry out the political change he was elected to bring to Washington. 
 Mr. Corzine is the first incumbent governor to seek re-election since the economic crisis hit last fall and is locked in a tight race with the Republican nominee, Christopher J. Christie, who has blasted Mr. Corzine for New Jersey's rising taxes and unemployment. 
But Mr. Obama told a crowd of more than 3,000 at Fairleigh Dickinson University that it is unfair to blame Mr. Corzine for a global recession that has battered every state in the nation. And he praised Mr. Corzine for helping mitigate the pain the downturn has inflicted on middle-class families by preserving funding for education and health care and making New Jersey one of the first states to start its own economic stimulus plan. 
 ''For the last four years, you've had a leader who's put the interests of hard-working New Jersey families ahead of the special interests,'' he said, calling Mr. Corzine one of the ''best partners I have in the White House.''
 Mr. Obama also accused Republicans of ''selective memory'' by ignoring the fact that the economy collapsed during the final month of President George W. Bush's term, and warned that Mr. Christie would reimpose the same ''trickle down'' economic policies that led to the downturn.
 ''They made the mess, and now they're complaining about how fast we're cleaning it up,'' Mr. Obama said, bringing a roar of laughter and applause from the crowd.
 Mr. Corzine was clearly buoyed by the support from Mr. Obama, who won New Jersey handily last fall and remains highly popular. Speaking before the president, Mr. Corzine promised to be brief ''because I know who you're here to see,'' and used the joint appearance to align himself closely with Mr. Obama's policies. 
 Mr. Corzine said that, like Mr. Obama, he had fought for expanded health care programs, and increased funding for early education and alternative energy.
 ''I'm proud to be President Obama's partner in building a better America and certainly a better New Jersey,'' he said. 
 The appearance was part of a political blitz for Mr. Obama, who appeared in New York on Tuesday to raise more than $3 million for two Democrats and was scheduled to stump in Massachusetts and Virginia next week. 
 Mr. Christie was careful not to criticize Mr. Obama, but said that New Jersey voters were savvy enough to judge Mr. Corzine on his own record. 
 ''Air Force One is leaving tonight,'' he said in a television appearance on Wednesday. ''If they vote for Jon Corzine, President Obama isn't moving in to run the state.''
 Mr. Corzine's political fortunes have improved considerably since Mr. Obama's first campaign appearance on his behalf in June. For much of the spring and summer, Mr. Christie held a double-digit lead in the polls, and some Democrats openly wondered whether the governor should be replaced at the top of the state party's ticket. 
 But Mr. Corzine has used his financial advantage to close the gap in recent weeks, and one key factor in the Nov. 3 election will be his ability to motivate the 600,000 first-time voters who cast ballots for Mr. Obama last year. 
 With the Democrats' prospects having grown dimmer in Virginia -- the only other governor's race this fall -- a procession of Obama aides and administration officials have come to New Jersey to bolster Mr. Corzine in recent weeks -- including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. 
 Mr. Obama urged audience members to rekindle the verve they felt during his own campaign last year and rally behind Mr. Corzine, and he tried to make a virtue of the governor's image as an unpolished politician. Conceding that Mr. Corzine's ''frizzy'' hair and ''scraggly beard'' were the antithesis of the slick politician, Mr. Obama said that the governor been an honorable public servant with the courage to level with the public about the problems ahead.
 ''I'm going to ask you to cast aside the cynics and the skeptics and show that leaders who do what's right and what's hard are rewarded and not rejected,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Obama arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport without incident. But on Tuesday, Secret Service officials said that they arrested a private security guard and charged him with making threats to harm the president.

HEADLINE: Who's Looking at the Fed's Books?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. BARNETT. 
William A. Barnett is a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Kansas and the editor of the journal Macroeconomic Dynamics.

DATELINE: Lawrence, Kan. 

 BODY:
 ON Tuesday, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, introduced legislation to allow the Government Accountability Office to audit some of the Federal Reserve's lending programs. Different bills calling for more comprehensive Fed audits already have widespread support in the House and Senate. Expanding this oversight is long overdue. 
 After the financial turmoil of the last year, it should be clear that we depend on the Fed for high-quality financial data and that the Fed should be held to the highest standards of transparency. And yet we cannot be assured of either of these things unless the Fed is subjected to a thorough audit of its numbers. I worked on the staff of the Federal Reserve Board 30 years ago, and I know that without comprehensive audits to double-check Federal Reserve data, the risk exists of inadequate and sloppy accounting from the Fed. 
 Consider the data the Fed presented last year on nonborrowed reserves. Nonborrowed reserves are total bank reserves minus money borrowed by banks and held as reserves. Clearly, the money borrowed cannot exceed the total reserves, so nonborrowed reserves should not be negative. Yet for a few months last year, the Fed reported banks' nonborrowed reserves at billions of dollars below zero. In its calculations of nonborrowed reserves, the Fed included in borrowed reserves new forms of bank borrowing not being held as reserves. Such incompetent accounting would not survive an unconstrained, fully informed audit.
 The information the Fed releases on bank deposits is similarly biased and contaminates data on the money supply and thereby on the liquidity of the economy produced by Federal Reserve policy. In order to evade reserve requirements, which mandate that a certain fraction of deposits be held in reserve and not lent out, many banks sweep much of their checking account deposits into shadow money-market-deposit savings accounts before reporting those deposits to the Fed. Since such accounts have no reserve requirements, this allows the banks to decrease the amount of total reserves they're required to have. But the liquidity provided to the economy from checking accounts is the pre-sweeps amount, not the reported post-sweeps amount. 
 Why does the Fed not require banks to go public with their real checking account deposit data? If the Fed doesn't see it as a problem that banks evade reserve requirements on checking accounts, why doesn't it just remove those requirements? Such evasion would be less likely to continue in the face of a comprehensive audit by the Government Accountability Office. 
 But while the Fed needs to be audited substantially, creating an independent data institute to monitor the Fed's monetary and financial data would be better than expanding a Government Accountability Office audit. An independent institute would have the highest specialized expertise to produce economic data for the Fed. 
 Neither an independent monitoring institute, nor -- a reasonable second best -- an expanded Congressional audit would constrain the Fed's ability to act in the country's best interests. It would simply ensure that the country knew what the Fed was doing, and why.

HEADLINE: Islanders Foe Or Prudent Politician?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JEFF Z. KLEIN

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Depending on whom you speak to, Kate Murray is either a hard-headed obstructionist willing to drive the Islanders from Long Island, a principled public servant protecting taxpayers or a Republican veteran holding out for a political ransom.
 Murray has been tagged with these and other less flattering labels because as supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, she and the Town Board have the power to block, delay or approve the zoning for the Lighthouse Project, a $3.8 billion plan to refurbish Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders' shabby home, and build thousands of homes, offices and stores nearby. 
 The project was proposed in 2003, and Murray is one of its last, and seemingly most stubborn, hurdles. She says she is only doing her job.
 ''As much as I've tried, if you go any faster, you're going to end up in court,'' Murray said while sitting in her corner office, which is adorned with a small bust of Ronald Reagan and photos of George E. Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York. ''It could be painful if it's not done right.'' 
 The project is one of the biggest developments ever on Long Island, and supporters have called it critical to revitalizing the local economy as well as the Islanders, one of hockey's most beleaguered franchises. The negotiations have dragged on so long that Charles B. Wang, the team's owner and a lead investor in the development, has threatened to sell or move the team if it is not approved soon.
 Politicians who get in the way of big real estate projects rarely get love letters from the business community, particularly during a recession when work is scarce. But when the projects include new sports venues and rabid fans are added to the mix, the pressure on politicians is even more pronounced. 
 Murray is unrepentant. She says that the Town Board has moved with relative haste in the 20 months since it received the developers' application and that similar-size projects on Long Island have taken far longer. Though she is up for re-election, she denies that politics have played a role, yet notes that Nassau County -- which is led by an outspoken Democrat, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi -- took four years to push the project onto her desk.
 Murray wants to ensure that the estimated $71 million in new taxes that would be generated by the project are not given back in subsidies. She understands that the Islanders are important to Long Island, but wants to assuage local municipalities and environmental groups that are concerned about heavier traffic. New wells would also be needed to supply two million gallons of water a day to the 150-acre development.
 In their defense, Murray and her supporters point to Bruce C. Ratner, the owner of the Nets, who has spent six years and millions of dollars fending off lawsuits and other problems in his quest to build the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn that includes the Barclays Center basketball arena.
 None of Murray's professed prudence has persuaded the construction workers, businessmen and Islanders fans who have bombarded her telephone hot line and e-mail account with complaints and likened her to a ''sumo goalie'' blocking the net. In a poll released last week by Newsday, News 12 Long Island and the Siena Research Institute, 51 percent of Long Islanders said they supported the Lighthouse Project.
 Proponents argue that the delays paint Long Island as an inhospitable place to do business and host a pro sports team.
 ''In most municipalities, you'd think the town would be rolling out the red carpet to get a $3 billion investment that will not just keep the Islanders, but expand our tax base and make us a destination,'' said Suozzi, who is Murray's chief antagonist. ''God forbid someone comes up with a better alternative.''
 Wang and executives of the Lighthouse Project declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement last week, Wang denied a report that said he was pulling the plug on the Lighthouse Project and said that having supplied the Town of Hempstead with all required documents, it was time for the Town Board to make a decision.
 ''Long Island stands in this defining moment waiting for an answer. Yes or no,'' he said.
 A frustrated Wang, who has lost tens of millions of dollars since buying the Islanders in 2000, has looked for new homes for his team, if only to gain leverage in negotiations. In September, the Islanders played an exhibition game in Kansas City, Mo., where city officials have been trying to attract a team to play in the new Sprint Center, but it drew only about 8,000 fans.
 A strong Canadian dollar has brought interest from north of the border. Last week, Quebec City unveiled plans for a $400 million N.H.L.-standard arena to attract a club to replace the Quebec Nordiques, who moved to Denver in 1995. Winnipeg, which lost the Jets to Phoenix in 1996, is also in the hunt for a new team. And this month, the Canadian billionaire James L. Balsillie lost a court case in which he sought to buy the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes and move them to Hamilton, Ontario.
 Business leaders in Queens have acclaimed the 65 acres in Willets Point adjoining Citi Field as an ideal home for an arena and residential-commercial district. The city has already taken control of about 70 percent of the property in that area, which has ample parking and access to mass transit and highways.
 Leaders in Brooklyn have invited Wang to consider the Barclays Center, which would have to be redesigned to include a hockey rink when and if Ratner gets final approval to build it.
 ''Brooklyn is the only place they should consider -- and put everyplace else on ice,'' said Marty Markowitz, the borough president. ''We've got lots of hockey fans, and if they come here, I would personally take the first spin on the Zamboni.''
 But Wang has had trouble promoting these cities as alternatives because the Islanders cannot break their lease before 2015. More important, the National Hockey League -- which must approve any move -- appears to want the team to stay put.
 ''We continue to hope the Lighthouse Project will receive the appropriate, and long-overdue, approvals that will keep the Islanders where they belong,'' said Bill Daly, the league's deputy commissioner.
 Oddly, the N.H.L. may have strengthened Murray's hand. On Monday, she received a letter from Wang, who said he wanted to meet to discuss the compromises that the town is seeking.
 Murray said that in general the board was concerned about who would pay for road improvements; Wang has promised to spend $55 million, less than half of the expected cost.
 She also said the Lighthouse's two 36-story towers, half a million square feet of retail space and 2,300 homes have alarmed the neighboring villages of Uniondale, Roosevelt and Garden City, concerned that their schools and streets would be overwhelmed and their mom-and-pop shops driven out of business.
 ''We have to respect that this is a suburban community,'' said Murray, who grew up in Levittown, America's original suburb. ''There's a tension and a balance.''
 Until the project is approved, fans and its backers are directing their tension at Murray.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Thursday about the role of Kate Murray, the supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, N.Y., in a $3.8 billion plan to refurbish Nassau Coliseum and build thousands of houses, offices and stores nearby referred imprecisely to another suburban community, Levittown, N.Y., where Murray grew up. While Levittown is considered to be the country's first postwar suburb, featuring mass-produced housing, it is not necessarily ''America's original suburb.'' (Suburbs first emerged in the 1800s and several of them lay claim to the ''first'' distinction.)

HEADLINE: Paterson Administration Fears Cost of U.S. Health Care Overhaul

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Danny Hakim reported from Albany and David M. Herszenhorn from Washington.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The Paterson administration is raising alarms that health care legislation taking shape in Washington could drive up deficits and punish New York and other states that have expanded Medicaid coverage on their own.
 New York's warning is almost certain to be echoed by governors across the country as Democrats in Congress work to complete major health care legislation that will require states to pay part of the cost of a broad expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor. 
 The House version of the health care bill would eventually require all states to pay 10 percent of the cost of newly enrolled Medicaid beneficiaries. The Senate version would require some states to pay more and some less; by 2019, New York would likely pay about 18 percent of the costs for new enrollees. 
 But the legislation is still in flux, and some House Democrats want the federal government to pick up the entire cost of the Medicaid expansion, an approach that is strongly favored by Gov. David A. Paterson and many other governors struggling with steep budget deficits as a result of the weak economy.
 Either way, states like New York that have more generous Medicaid eligibility rules stand to receive relatively less in new federal aid than states with the tightest eligibility rules, many of them in the South.
 Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch, the Paterson administration's point man on the state budget, said, ''We're being penalized for our generosity.''
 ''What the White House wanted to do is expand the number of people covered by Medicaid, and therefore they wanted to give the most money to the states which had the tightest eligibility requirements,'' he said.
 Mr. Ravitch will go to Washington on Thursday in part to meet with the state's Congressional delegation to raise the Paterson administration's concerns and lobby for more stimulus aid.
 His trip underscores just how much the states have riding on the health care legislation that is developing in Congress, and it may signal the beginning of an intense lobbying effort by the states as they begin to grasp the implications of the health overhaul.
 Aides to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, cautioned states to reserve judgment.
 ''States stand to benefit significantly from reform, and they have a responsibility to play a role in the effort,'' said Erin Shields, a spokeswoman for Mr. Baucus. Mr. Baucus will ''encourage states to look not only at the federal Medicaid matching rate but also take a long-term view of reform that considers elements like increased flexibility for states and the bill's long-term costs,'' she said.
 For instance, the House version of the health care bill includes a provision that would severely restrict the ability of states to adjust their eligibility rules for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, a requirement that could prove costly. The Senate bill has no such requirement. 
 In recent weeks, the Paterson administration has projected that a Senate version of the legislation could cost the state $900 million, while the original House bill could save the state as much as $2 billion. Those appear to be best- and worst-case scenarios. The administration's analysis of the Senate bill assumes that three-quarters of the more than one million New Yorkers who are eligible for Medicaid and other public programs but who have not enrolled will do so because they may be penalized if they are uninsured. 
 That is a big if, however. The various bills have undergone significant revisions in recent weeks. In the Senate, proposed penalties have been scaled back and hardship waivers that would exempt the poor. The federal legislation is likely to modestly expand the number of New Yorkers who could sign up for Medicaid, by expanding the eligibility of childless adults, but that would have a limited financial impact. 
 Aides to Senator Charles E. Schumer, the powerful New York Democrat who serves on the Finance Committee, strongly disputed the Paterson administration's projections.
 ''Senator Schumer is going to fight as hard he can for New York in every aspect of the bill, but in this instance the state's conjured prediction is highly unrealistic,'' said Joshua Vlasto, a spokesman for Senator Schumer. 
 A far more pressing concern for New York is how great a share of Medicaid payments the federal government will pick up, and whether New York and other states that have long maintained more generous Medicaid eligibility will be treated equitably under the plan. 
 Mr. Ravitch is particularly concerned because of New York's precarious financial health. The state is facing unprecedented deficits in the fiscal years ending in March 2012 and 2013 and a cumulative gap of nearly $50 billion over the next three and a half years.

HEADLINE: Who Gets Paid What

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

DATELINE: It was, from the start, a delicate dance 

 BODY:
-- a minuet in the measure of money and politics. 
 For months, in the basement of the Treasury Department, Washington's pay masters pushed one way, and the seven beleaguered giants of the bailout era pushed the other. 
 In the end, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Obama administration's special master of compensation, reduced the pay of the companies' top earners. 
 But his ruling, which came to light Wednesday, will not bring an end to big paydays at the companies. Indeed, despite the remarkable government intrusion into these private enterprises, senior executives at some of the companies will enjoy multimillion-dollar pay packages this year, mostly in the form of stock. Other employees will earn even more. 
 Interviews with officials, consultants and corporate executives involved in pay review suggest that the companies themselves -- the American International Group, Bank of America, Citigroup, Chrysler, General Motors, and the two car companies' finance affiliates, GMAC and Chrysler Financial -- played a central role in the process and its outcome. 
 Both camps recognized from the beginning that bailout politics, as much as economics, would shape the final decision, according to people involved in the process. The popular resentment directed at companies that have received billions of taxpayer dollars -- and at Washington for providing the bailouts -- was never far from participants' minds, these people said. 
 In a meeting with A.I.G. executives, for instance, representatives of the insurance giant suggested that the head of one of its business units receive pay on par with an industry chief executive. 
 ''Tell me how I justify that?'' asked Mary Pat Fox, a consultant working on Mr. Feinberg's team. The room fell silent.
 Mr. Feinberg declined to discuss the review, which began this summer, with a series of meetings with the companies' executives. Each company provided its own list of the 25 most highly paid workers in 2008. 
 In the months that followed, the executives argued time and again that slashing pay would drive away talented employees, the very workers they needed to help turn their companies around. At times, the basement war room grew so crowded that meetings spilled into the office of Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who is now a prominent economic adviser to the Obama administration.
 A.I.G. refused to cancel some pay contracts that fell outside Mr. Feinberg's purview. At one point, A.I.G. executives expressed frustration with the contracts. A.I.G., they said, was having trouble identifying just who its most highly paid employees were. 
 Bank of America, for its part, sent its head of trading and investment banking, Thomas K. Montag, to argue on his team's behalf. 
 But some concessions were inevitable. Citigroup, for instance, sold its commodities trading unit, Phibro, to avoid a confrontation with Mr. Feinberg over a $100 million payday for Phibro's star moneymaker, Andrew J. Hall. 
 Others dug in. Chrysler Financial executives initially asked to be freed from the review since the company had repaid its bailout money. But Chrysler Financial's holding company owed the Treasury money, so the request was refused. 
 One surprise from A.I.G. came in a disclosure for an executive in the category of ''other compensation.'' The total in that category for 2008 was $1.5 million, reflecting flights on the company's corporate jet. 
 By late July, the pay team, in consultation with two prominent compensation experts, Lucian A. Bebchuk and Kevin J. Murphy, devised a 20-page document laying out Mr. Feinberg's demands for information. 
 The companies were ordered to turn over minutes from their board's compensation committee meetings over the past year, the stock awards for top executives during the last two years, and any performance measures that were used to determine compensation in the last two years.
 Mr. Feinberg's most controversial demand was that the companies disclose how much stock each of the top 25 executives held. Typically, only the top five make such disclosures in securities filings. 
 The pay team immediately received phone calls from the companies' compensation managers, who called the request overly broad. But by mid-August, the companies complied. 
 Michael Murray, who heads compensation at Citigroup, was the most upset. He told the pay team it was awkward for him to go to each of the executives and ask how much stock they held because many considered the question of whether they had sold shares over the years a personal matter.
 Bank of America was particularly concerned that it might lose employees if Mr. Feinberg restricted pay. The bank was in the midst of integrating its operations with those of Merrill Lynch, which it agreed at the height of the crisis last year to buy. 
 When Bank of America submitted the names of top executives to Mr. Feinberg, its representatives pointed out that 45 of the top 100 employees at the bank and Merrill had left.

HEADLINE: Strains for Democrats In Budget-Balancing Act

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When economists met privately with Democratic leaders of the House on Wednesday, the topic was how to pump billions more into the economy to stimulate job creation. They left with a homework assignment: How to cut trillions from future federal budget deficits.
 That seemingly contradictory mix captures the unusual political and policy tension in the White House and Congress these days as the politicians deal with an economy that has begun a slow but jobless recovery and a public that is increasingly fretful about the accumulating debt. 
 Not since the early 1990s have Washington's policy makers faced this balancing act between demands for immediate economic stimulus and pressure for longer-term plans to restore fiscal stability. But this time is a lot worse, both in the severity of the economic downturn and the size of the deficit. 
 ''It is a complicated balance because these imperatives point in different directions,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the senior economic adviser to President Obama, said in an interview. ''Imagine a business if it were trying to execute a plan of rapid expansion for two years, followed by retrenchment and cost-cutting for the next three. It would be a complicated business strategy to execute.''
 The complications are evident as Democrats shape the stimulus measures under discussion now, as well as in the administration's drafting of its budget for the fiscal year 2011, which is due by February and which will include ''proposals to put our country back on firm fiscal footing,'' Peter R. Orszag, the budget director, said last week. 
 Administration officials and Democrats in Congress are confronting questions from Republicans and some reporters about how they plan to ''pay for'' stimulus measures, like proposed tax credits for first-time home buyers and for employers who hire new workers and Mr. Obama's recent proposal for a second round of $250 Social Security checks to older Americans, veterans and the disabled. The first checks went out last spring as part of the $787 billion stimulus package enacted soon after Mr. Obama took office.
 But stimulus measures, like the one last winter, typically are not offset with savings elsewhere --budget cuts or tax increases -- because such steps would take money out of the economy when the purpose of stimulus is to funnel money into it. 
 ''Stimulus doesn't work unless it increases the deficit; that's the bottom line,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody's Economy.com, who has advised lawmakers of both parties and was at Wednesday's meeting in the office of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. 
 Afterward, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would not have another big stimulus bill but instead a series of smaller ones. That reflects their sensitivity to the fact that a single bill would carry a bigger price tag and to Republicans' criticisms that the first stimulus package has been a failure, a claim that most economists, including those at the Capitol meeting, reject. 
 ''We do not have a plan for an additional stimulus package, but we do have plans to stimulate the economy,'' Ms. Pelosi told reporters.
 Those plans are expected to total at least $100 billion. Much of that would go to extending into next year the original stimulus package's provisions for expanded unemployment compensation, health benefits and food stamps for people who have been out of work for long periods. Those safety-net provisions, which have some bipartisan support, are set to expire Dec. 31.
 Other spending and tax cut proposals are proving more controversial as heightened concerns about the deficit play out in the internal debates at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
 Within the administration, for example, economic advisers generally were unenthusiastic about spending nearly $14 billion early next year to send out $250 Social Security checks regardless of the beneficiaries' income. But political advisers favored it, people familiar with the discussions say. Americans over 65 are the age group least supportive of Mr. Obama, but the most likely to vote in midterm elections.
 At the Capitol, the House Democratic majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has been outspoken in his opposition on fiscal grounds, but other Democratic leaders favor the proposal.
 Congressional Democratic leaders are far more enthusiastic than the White House about the proposal to extend the stimulus law's $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. The provision is due to expire Nov. 30.
 In a meeting on Wednesday with about 30 House Democrats, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, cautioned that the home buyers credit was costly and of uncertain efficacy when officials should be seeking ''the maximum bang for the buck for every dollar we spend,'' according to an attendee.
 On Thursday, a House subcommittee will hold a hearing on alleged fraud involving the tax credit. According to the panel, investigators at the Internal Revenue Service have identified 167 criminal schemes involving the tax credit and opened 107,000 civil examinations. 
 But the credit is a priority of Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader -- who faces a tough re-election race in a state hit hard by the housing crisis -- as well as other lawmakers in both parties and the housing industry. 
 Among other ideas on the table are extending business tax breaks and using the financial bailout money to expand lending to small businesses now that the financial system is stabilized.
 Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System and one of those who met with House leaders, afterward paraphrased a quote he attributed to St. Augustine, ''Lord, make me chaste, but not just yet.'' 
 ''We do need to become more chaste about the budget deficit,'' Mr. Blinder said. But, he added, ''this is not the time to do it.''

HEADLINE: Obama Acts to Spur Loans by Small Banks

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
After enduring months of criticism that his administration had done too little to help small businesses weather the recession, President Obama said Wednesday that ''there's still too little credit flowing to our small businesses'' and unveiled initiatives he said would open the spigot. 
 The measures, announced by Mr. Obama at a small records storage company in Maryland, would allow smaller community banks to borrow at low rates from the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program. It would also raise the loan caps on several popular Small Business Administration programs.
 Under the administration plan, banks with less than $1 billion in assets could borrow from the program at a lower interest rate than financial institutions are required to pay. 
 In exchange, banks must demonstrate how they would increase lending to small businesses and follow up with quarterly reports. According to the White House, most business loans by the community banks that are eligible for the new rules are made to small businesses.
 In addition, community groups that lend to small businesses in low-income areas under a Treasury Department program will be able to borrow relief money at just 2 percent annually for eight years. In the past, banks have been leery of the such loans because the program allows the government to buy warrants for the banks' common stock and because it requires the institutions to limit executive compensation. But the small banks probably will not have to issue warrants in that program rules contain an exception for infusions of less than $100 million. The proposal as described Wednesday caps the infusions at $20 million.
 The small institutions would be subject to the same compensation rules as any other relief recipient, said Gene Sperling, senior counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in an interview. But, he added, ''for these smaller community banks, the executive bonus restrictions will usually affect only their single most highly compensated employee.''
 But some community bankers remain concerned. ''I think that could be a damper on community bank involvement in this program, said Cam Fine, president and chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association. ''Those family-owned banks are not going to want to subject themselves to compensation restrictions imposed by TARP, because it is their own personal money that is the capital of the bank.'' 
 Changing the S.B.A. loan limits will require approval from Congress. The administration's plans, which would raise the limit on the most popular loan to $5 million from $2 million, are identical to provisions of a bill introduced by Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. She is the ranking Republican on the Senate Small Business Committee and is seen as perhaps the only Republican who may vote for a Democratic-led health care bill. 
 In a statement, Ms. Snowe indicated she appreciated the gesture. ''These actions will help satisfy the capital needs of small businesses looking to start or expand their operations,'' she said. 
 Unlike the S.B.A. proposals, the bailout plan can take effect at the administration's direction. 
 ''Our goal is to conduct a wide spread consultation with the small business and small bank community for a few weeks, and get this operational as quickly as is practical,'' Mr. Sperling said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Order Pay Cuts At Firms With Bailout Aid

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Responding to the furor over executive pay at companies bailed out with taxpayer money, the Obama administration will order the firms that received the most aid to slash compensation to their highest-paid employees, an official involved in the decision said on Wednesday.
 The plan, for the 25 top earners at seven companies that received exceptional help, will on average cut total compensation this year by about 50 percent. The companies are Citigroup, Bank of America, American International Group, General Motors, Chrysler and the financing arms of the two automakers. 
 Some executives, like the top traders at A.I.G., will face tight limits on their pay. In addition, the top-paid employees at all the affected companies will face new limits on their perks. 
 The plan will also change the form of the pay to align the personal interests of the executives with the longer-term financial health of the companies. For instance, the cash portion of the executives' salaries will be slashed on average by 90 percent, and the rest will be replaced by stock that cannot be sold for years. 
 But while the plan would pare compensation substantially from what the highest-paid people at the companies might have received under normal circumstances, it would still permit multimillion-dollar pay packages. 
 In addition, it would have no direct impact on firms that did not receive government bailouts or that have already repaid loans they received from Washington. Therefore, it is unclear how much effect, if any, the plan will have on the broader issues relating to executive compensation, income inequality and the populist animosity toward Wall Street and corporate America. 
 The plan, which was written by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the official at the Treasury Department in charge of setting compensation for bailed-out companies, will be made public in a few days. The official who described the plan's basic components did not disclose the particular impact on specific employees of the firms. 
 Wall Street is facing criticism and anger over the large year-end bonuses at many firms. 
 Firms like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley received tens of billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees from the government but because they have returned the loans, they are no longer under any pay restrictions. With the financial markets and their profits recovering after the huge government assistance program last year, the three are expected to make huge payouts this year even as unemployment continues to rise. 
 The administration and regulators at the Federal Reserve have been preparing new guidelines to align executive pay scales at banks with appropriate risk-taking. But the White House, which has come under attack from conservatives for giving the government what they consider too large and intrusive a role in the economy, has also made clear that it has no intention of seeking to impose any broad-based caps on executive pay. 
 Instead the administration is seeking to influence pay decisions through several changes in the way corporations govern themselves. The White House has proposed, for instance, giving shareholders a nonbinding vote on the pay of top executives. 
 It has also proposed that compensation committees of boards, as well as compensation consultants, be more independent. 
 And it will propose that the companies under review divide the function of chairman and chief executive between two executives. Many of these proposals have been introduced in legislation by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
 The cuts described for the seven companies that received the most assistance may present an incomplete picture because the Treasury Department has already addressed a handful of very highly paid executives. Under pressure from Mr. Feinberg, Citigroup agreed to sell its Phibro trading unit, which is headed by Andrew Hall, the trader whose pay last year was almost $100 million.
 And as a result of Mr. Feinberg's discussions, Kenneth D. Lewis, the head of Bank of America, who said he would resign by the end of the year, agreed to forgo his salary and bonus for 2009. (He will still receive a pension of $53.2 million, although Mr. Feinberg can issue an advisory opinion challenging it.).
 The plan will hit executives at some companies harder than others. At the financial products division of A.I.G., the locus of problems that plagued the insurer and forced its rescue with more than $180 billion in taxpayer assistance, no top executive will receive more than $200,000 in total compensation, and officials in that unit will not receive any other compensation, like stocks or stock options. Some bonuses previously promised will be paid in the coming year, and it is not clear how much of those will be awarded. 
 But at other companies, the cuts may mean less. Many executives at Bank of America and Citigroup are expected to reap multimillion-dollar pay packages.
 For executives at all seven companies, new restraints will also be imposed on perks. Any executive seeking more than $25,000 in special perks -- like country club memberships, private planes, limousines or company-issued cars -- will have to apply to the government for permission. 
 The administration will also warn A.I.G. that it must fulfill a commitment it made to significantly cut the $198 million in bonuses still promised to employees in the financial products division. 
 A former employee of A.I.G.'s financial products unit, who left during the uproar over bonuses last March, said he did not see how the Treasury could make the new recommendations stick.
 Earlier this year, he recalled, A.I.G. obtained an outside legal opinion explaining why it had to fulfill its two-year contract to pay bonuses. If the company reversed itself now, said the former employee, who asked not to be named because he no longer wanted to be associated with the company, the employees ''could sue A.I.G., using A.I.G.'s own argument. They've painted themselves into a box.''
 A report last week by the inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program found that the insurance company had recovered only $19 million of the $45 million it had asked the recipients to repay from earlier bonuses.
 The pay restrictions illustrate the humbling downfall of the once-proud giants, now wards of the state whose leaders' compensation is being set by a Washington paymaster.
 They also show how Washington in the last year has become increasingly powerful in setting corporate policies as more companies turned to the government for money to survive.
 The compensation schedules set by Mr. Feinberg come as many other banks that received smaller but significant taxpayer assistance in the last year have been reporting huge year-end bonuses, setting off a new round of recrimination in Washington about the bailout of Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Deal Would Give U.S. Power To Block State Bank Rules

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Reaching a compromise on an issue that threatened to derail financial regulatory legislation, the House Financial Services Committee voted on Wednesday to give the federal government the power to block the states from regulating large national banks in some circumstances. 
 The Obama administration had opposed any efforts by the federal government to pre-empt state officials from imposing more rigorous banking standards. A group of Democrats with close ties to the banking industry had sought a complete federal pre-emption, which would have the effect of sharply limiting any state regulation of banks. 
 Under the compromise offered by two Democrats, Representative Melvin Watt of North Carolina and Dennis Moore of Kansas, and approved by voice vote, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, would be able to override the states, but only if it found that the state law ''significantly'' interfered with federal regulatory policies.
 The compromise cleared the way for the House Financial Services Committee to move ahead with plans to approve the creation of a new federal agency to protect consumers from abusive or deceptive credit cards, mortgages and other loans. That vote was expected to take place on Thursday. 
 On another issue that has been hotly debated for months, the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday approved a measure to regulate derivatives, the arcane financial instruments that have been linked to the current financial crisis. The Financial Services Committee approved a similar measure last week. (The agriculture panel has jurisdiction because many derivatives involve trading in farm commodities.) 
 It will be weeks before both houses of Congress act on a final bill to regulate the financial services industry, said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Financial Services Committee. 
 Adoption of the compromise proposal on bank regulation was a partial setback for the banking industry, which would like to avoid having to comply with state laws that are sometimes stricter than federal rules. 
 Still, President Obama and Mr. Frank would have gone further and subjected banks to state laws with no chance for appeal.
 While its authors said they were reasonably happy with their compromise, some Democrats on the committee have their doubts. Representative Melissa Bean, an Illinois Democrat, issued a statement saying she would have pushed for even greater federal authority in rule-making, but that flu in her family prevented her from attending Wednesday's session.
 ''Rolling back this 140-year-old precedent of federal rules to a system of 50 different state regimes increases costs for training and compliance, which gets passed to consumers, as in the insurance industry, where such costs are estimated at $13 billion annually,'' she said.
 Ms. Bean, described by the Almanac of American Politics as a ''centrist,'' issued a statement declaring her support for the creation of a strong consumer financial protection agency that would ''put cops on the beat where enforcement has lacked in the past.''
 Representative Collin Peterson, the Minnesota Democrat who heads the agriculture panel, said derivative regulation was a big step toward passage of broader financial regulation.

HEADLINE: A Silver Lining Clings to Tobacco

BYLINE: By ALIZA ROSENBAUM and IAN CAMPBELL

 BODY:
The Marlboro Man may not look so tough anymore, but investors shouldn't write him off. Altria, which makes Marlboros, announced on Wednesday that it had shipped sharply fewer cigarettes in the third quarter than a year earlier. The looming health care reform, meanwhile, could further burden smokers and manufacturers. 
 But the investor Warren Buffett has said that some apparently drooping businesses can deliver more puff than expected. He called such stocks cigar butts, and Altria could be one of them. 
 Most of Altria's profit comes from its cigarette subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, which in turn relies heavily on Marlboro. So it's somewhat alarming that Altria shipped 16 percent fewer cigarettes in the third quarter than a year earlier -- even though Marlboro's share of the United States market actually edged up to 41.9 percent in the quarter.
 With health care reform top of the agenda in Washington, the tobacco business is also still an obvious target. From 2000 to 2004, smoking was responsible for $193 billion in annual health-related economic losses, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the government tries to cut health care costs by discouraging smoking, there could be more taxes imposed like the April increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes. 
 Yet it wasn't all bad at Altria in the third quarter. Net revenue excluding excise taxes fell 11.3 percent in the cigarette segment -- less than the decline in volume, suggesting the company managed to raise average prices. Add in other businesses including UST, the chewing tobacco and snuff maker acquired by Altria this year, and the group managed to eke out a 1.7 percent overall increase in profit as net revenue excluding taxes slid just 0.5 percent in the quarter. Cost cutting helped, too. 
 Altria's stock currently trades at just under 10 times consensus estimates of 2010 earnings, slightly below Reynolds American's multiple, despite what some analysts view as a more powerful stable of products. Pricing power, especially at Marlboro, could surprise -- as could cost cutting and contributions by the smaller business units. It would be oddly fitting if the tobacco-dominated company did turn out to be one of Mr. Buffett's cigar butts.
 Overvalued Euro?
 How times have changed for the euro. It was once widely seen as an experiment bound to fail. Now, as the dollar wanes, the common European currency is the star, riding high at $1.50. But does the euro deserve it? The answer is probably not. 
 Back in October 2000, the single currency was at $0.84. Then, commentators wrote about how it was at a ''critical stage.'' The obituaries were ready to run. 
 But the euro didn't die. Over the next nine years, it strengthened by 79 percent. Buying the euro when all looked dark would have been a good idea. 
 Now, investors are writing obituaries for the dollar. It seems to have nothing going for it. The Federal Reserve's target overnight interest rate is virtually zero. The Obama administration's fiscal deficit is stratospheric. And even good news about United States economic growth provokes dollar selling. 
 But the euro really isn't worthy of its current star status. The strains in the region where it is used weren't serious in 2000, but they are now. Germany and Italy are on course for 5 percent declines in their economies -- twice the pullback seen in the supposedly hopeless United States. The German unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, is healthy compared with Belgium's or Ireland's, at over 12 percent. Spain's is a horrific 19 percent. 
 To aid recovery, the euro zone needs an active economic policy and a competitive currency. But estimates of the euro's purchasing power against other currencies suggest it is close to 30 percent overvalued. For countries like Spain, Greece, Italy and Ireland, where wages raced ahead in the good years, the effective level of overvaluation is even higher. 
 What can be done? Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, can try to talk the euro down. But more effective would be recognition that reports of the dollar's demise are exaggerated. That will come when the Fed hints that growth has returned and that interest rates will soon be rising.

HEADLINE: A New Challenge for 2 Ailing Banks

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
In the whirl of the financial crisis, Bank of America and Citigroup stood out for being among the most troubled banks in the industry. Now, they will stand apart.
 The Obama administration's plans to slash pay at heavily bailed-out firms force them to operate under different rules from the rest of Wall Street, a shift that could more boldly define the two-tiered system that has emerged between the strongest and weakest banks. 
 News of the government's plan to on average halve pay for the top 25 employees of firms that took two bailouts ricocheted down Wall Street on Wednesday. Although the order was anticipated, many bankers were surprised by the depth of the cuts and were already trying to identify loopholes. 
 Pay experts, meanwhile, fretted that the new policy would have unintended consequences, including causing the departure of talented executives who were trying to nurse the companies back to health and remove them from taxpayer lifelines. 
 ''It looks like meatball surgery with a sledgehammer,'' said Brian Foley, an independent compensation expert in White Plains. ''There are going to be some people who just pick up their sticks and go.'' 
 Bank of America and Citigroup had been bracing for a move like this. Now they are grappling with how to adapt. Representatives of both companies declined to comment ahead of the official release of the rules. 
 But on Wednesday, Citigroup officials planned to raise the issue at a corporate off-site meeting of its 100 highest-ranking executives in Princeton, N.J., according to people briefed on the meeting. Bank of America executives have been struggling for weeks with how to address the pay issue.
 Yet even before they were unveiled, the prospect of tougher pay rules has had an impact. Over the last year, dozens of bankers and traders have left both companies for foreign rivals, boutique finance companies and other American banks that did not face stringent compensation rules. And this month, Citigroup sold off its lucrative Phibro trading unit to untangle itself from the man to whom it owed a $100 million bonus, Andrew J. Hall. 
 The new rules also affect last year's top 25 highest earners at the American International Group, General Motors, Chrysler and the financing arms of the two automakers. Total compensation, including bonuses, for executives there will fall sharply. For many, pay will decline for a second consecutive year; their 2008 bonuses were cut in half after dismal results in 2008. 
 These employees will now receive as little as 10 percent of their compensation in cash, down from about 40 percent, with the rest of their pay in company stock.
 ''This is a blunt object that is killing the good and the bad,'' said James F. Reda, an independent compensation expert. 
 It was also unclear whether the new pay rules would cascade down to managers just below that group. In theory, the rules are written to prevent that from happening. But in practice, pay experts say, it creates an awkward relationship if a junior manager is paid a lot more than the boss. 
 But the new measure may have more bark than bite, especially if the rules call for the executives' total compensation to fall by an average of 50 percent: the actual pay cuts for the top 25 earners at Citigroup and Bank of America could be skewed because their chief executives have already agreed to enormous reductions. 
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, announced earlier this year that he planned to work for $1 a year until the bank posted several consecutive quarters of profits. Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's chief executive, agreed last week to give up his salary and bonus for all of 2009. 
 If their pay cuts are factored into the equation used by Kenneth R. Feinberg, who is overseeing pay for the administration, that might give the affected companies more leeway to pay multimillion-dollar bonuses to the other 24 executives included. 
 The new rules also raised questions at A.I.G., whose plan to pay out bonuses stoked a furor early this year. The company's top-paid employees in the financial products group could face strict $200,000 pay caps, which experts said would make it difficult to retain traders to better unwind its complex positions. 
 ''That's insulting,'' said a person close to A.I.G.'s board after hearing of the rules. ''Why wouldn't anybody quit?'' 
 For example, Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s new chief executive, was awarded a starting pay package worth about $7 million, with $3 million in cash. The remaining $4 million was in stock. But under the new rules, there will probably be two dozen or so executives under him who will be entitled to as little as 10 percent of their pay packages in cash. 
 ''Can you really expect these 25 men and women to tighten their belts that far if you could go to another company in the U.S., another company offshore or a private company?'' asked Mr. Foley. ''There comes a point were you just can't afford to stay.'' 
 Other companies might try to cut deals. Some compensation experts said they expected the affected companies might dangle the promise of a big payday in the future if a talented executive agreed to stay. In some cases, a company might offer a promotion or give managers more flexibility to do their current jobs.

HEADLINE: Rise in New Jobless Claims Was Higher Than Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for jobless benefits rose more than expected last week, after falling in five of the last six weeks, as employers remained reluctant to hire even with the economy showing signs of recovery. 
 The Labor Department saidThursday that new jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 531,000 last week, from an upwardly revised 520,000 the previous week. Economists had expected only a slight increase, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Economists closely watch initial claims, which are considered a gauge of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire new workers.
 The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out fluctuations, fell slightly to 532,250, the lowest since mid-January and about 125,000 below the peak for the recession, reached this spring. But claims remain well above the 325,000 that economists say is consistent with a healthy economy.
 The number of people continuing to claim benefits declined for a fifth week to 5.9 million, from just over six million. The figures on continuing claims lag behind initial claims by a week.
 Many recipients are moving onto extended benefit programs approved by Congress in response to the recession, which began in December 2007 and is the worst since the 1930s. 
 When those programs are included, the total number of recipients fell to 8.8 million in the week ending Oct. 3, the latest data available, down about 50,000 from the previous week. That decline is probably a result of recipients having run out of benefits, rather than finding jobs, economists say.
 In another report, a private forecast of economic activity rose for the sixth consecutive month in September, a sign the economy will keep growing next year.
 In the forecast, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1 percent last month after a 0.4 percent gain in August. Economists expected an increase of 0.8 percent last month, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
 The Conference Board said the indicators' growth rate of 5.7 percent over the six months through September was the strongest since 1983, but joblessness was weighing on the rebound.
 ''These numbers strongly suggest that a recovery is developing. However, the intensity of that recovery will depend on how much, and how soon, demand picks up,'' said a Conference Board economist, Ken Goldstein.
 Many analysts think the economy grew as much as 3 percent in the July-September quarter, but employers are reluctant to hire as they wait to see whether such growth can be maintained.
 The unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent in September. The recession has eliminated a net 7.2 million jobs.

HEADLINE: Shares Surge as Amazon Reports 62% Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Amazon.com shares surged Thursday after the company said its third-quarter profit soared 62 percent, showing that consumers are comfortable opening their wallets to the online retailer despite the still-shaky economy. 
 Throughout the recession, shoppers have flocked to Amazon for deals on all kinds of products, from books to baby strollers, even while offline competitors were struggling.
 The most recent report showed that the summer months were no exception -- and that Amazon expected to carry the momentum through the holidays. It said it expected revenue in the current quarter to grow more than 20 percent.
 The results and outlook sent Amazon shares up $13.68, 15 percent, to $107.07 in after-hours trading. Before the earnings report the stock had finished regular trading up 3 cents at $93.45.
 Amazon said Thursday that it earned $199 million, or 45 cents a share in the third quarter. This far exceeded the 30 cents a share that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting.
 Revenue climbed 28 percent to $5.45 billion, also surpassing analyst estimates for $5.03 billion.
 Revenue from items like books, CDs and DVDs rose 17 percent to $2.93 billion. Revenue from electronics and other general merchandise jumped 44 percent to $2.36 billion.
 Amazon said its revenue rose 23 percent in North America, and increased 33 percent internationally.
 For the current quarter, Amazon predicted revenue of $8.13 billion to $9.13 billion. Analysts were expecting $8.11 billion.
 The company declined to give details about sales of its electronic reader, the Kindle, beyond saying it is the company's best-selling product.
 Though e-books still make up a small portion of the overall book market, the market has grown rapidly. Now Amazon faces tougher competition from companies like Sony and Barnes & Noble -- which both soon will release devices that, like the Kindle, can wirelessly download books.
 Amazon said Thursday that it intended to release software next month to let people buy Kindle books and read them on a computer, regardless of whether they own a Kindle device. This is similar to an application already offered to owners of Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch, and may provide Amazon with a way to expand its e-book revenue.
 Also Thursday, Amazon lowered the price of its international version of the Kindle by $20, to $259, matching the cost of a version sold only in the United States that it is discontinuing. Now all Kindles will have wireless access that works around the world.

HEADLINE: South Africa's Invisible Agent of Change

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
South Africa will host the 2010 World Cup, a feat that 25 years ago would have seemed about as likely as a capitalist Russia or a black president of the United States. 
 ''Endgame,'' a British-made drama on Sunday on PBS, reaches back to a period in the 1980s when South Africa could not host an international sporting event without boycotts and bloodshed. Nelson Mandela was still in prison, and the conservative government of P. W. Botha crushed protests and riots in townships like Soweto under cover of emergency rule. Security forces tortured and killed militants; terrorist bombs exploded in shopping malls. The country was a pariah in the civilized world and on the brink of civil war. 
 ''Endgame,'' a ''Masterpiece Contemporary'' production, stays at the edges of the best-known events and instead focuses on secret talks between Afrikaners and the African National Congress that began in 1985 and didn't end until 1990, the year that Mr. Mandela was released from prison. 
 It's a bit disconcerting to plunge back into a chapter of history that, however momentous then, may seem remote and sui generis now that the United States is fighting two wars and a global recession (including, despite the soaring price of gold, in South Africa). 
 And there was no happily ever after once apartheid was abolished: the worst didn't happen, but the country now battles many of the kinds of problems -- poverty, disease, corruption -- that stymie other African nations. 
 This film doesn't try for a universal theme or overarching lessons but, somewhat in the manner of a Peter Morgan drama like ''Frost/Nixon,'' magnifies the personal conflicts and conciliations that make for good storytelling. 
 Those were tense, high-risk discussions, and they couldn't have taken place in a less likely setting -- a stately manor in the English countryside -- or been engineered by a less prepossessing eminence grise. 
 Michael Young (Jonny Lee Miller) is the back-channel hero of this film: a meek, earnest public affairs executive at Consolidated Gold Fields, a British mining company, who is given the task of evaluating company investments in South Africa and concludes that only dialogue can pull the country back from imminent disaster. 
 The film, which stars William Hurt and Chiwetel Ejiofor and was directed by Pete Travis (''Vantage Point''), is labeled a political thriller with some legitimacy, since it does have suspense, menace and even a scary car chase. 
 Facts are telescoped and trimmed without unduly distorting history, but what the narrative does best is frame a decisive moment and zoom in on the ordinary people who worked the sidelines of an extraordinary breakthrough. 
 Mr. Mandela, of course, looms largest even in the background. Clarke Peters, who played Lester on ''The Wire,'' is persuasively dignified and charming as Mandela, who in prison keeps up a civil, secret dialogue with the chief of security, Niel Barnard (Mark Strong), and also smuggles messages to Oliver Tambo (John Kani), then the head of the African National Congress. 
 Those were two covert channels of communication. The film mostly concentrates on another. Mr. Hurt is Will Esterhuyse, a philosophy professor who is recruited by Young to represent the Afrikaner viewpoint at the secret talks, mostly because more prominent public figures declined to take the risk. Mr. Hurt manages the South African accent credibly enough, but more important, he hits the half notes in a role that could too easily be conventionally righteous.
 Mr. Ejiofor plays his counterpart, Thabo Mbeki, who at the time was the information officer of the African National Congress and went on to become president of South Africa after Mr. Mandela, from 1999 to 2008. Mr. Mbeki's tenure may be most memorable for setting back AIDS prevention and slowing the distribution of antiviral drugs because he subscribed to a denialist theory that disputes a link between H.I.V. and AIDS. 
 Mr. Mbeki's finer hours took place long before his rise to power, when he served as a go-between in the standoff between the government and the anti-apartheid movement. 
 In the film Young reports -- behind closed doors -- to the chairman of Gold Fields, Rudolph Agnew, played with a Dickensian flourish by Derek Jacobi. Agnew approves of the mission as long as it leaves him plausible deniability to accusations of meddling in South Africa's internal affairs. Agnew keeps tabs on his aide while keeping him at arm's length, warning him that should word of his mission leak out, ''I shall have to deny all knowledge of it and disown you.'' Agnew pauses, then adds throatily, ''And I'll be nothing if not convincing.''
 Young brings two opposing delegations to Mells Park, a 16th-century country estate that was then owned by Gold Fields. And a little like the butler in the novel ''The Remains of the Day,'' Young earnestly preps the staff, assigns the chintz-covered guest rooms and keeps the postprandial Scotch flowing, a form of persuasion later described by Esterhuyse as ''Glenfiddich diplomacy.''
 The two sides have seemingly irreconcilable positions, and each man at the table has his own secrets and hidden agendas. It takes time, stealth and effort to overcome mistrust and build relationships, and throughout, Young's tact and self-effacement --the un-Holbrooke school of diplomacy -- help keep hostilities in check. 
 ''It takes a big man to stay invisible,'' Esterhuyse tells Young at the close of their final meeting. This film shines a light on the prim, humble businessman who risked everything to start a conversation -- and kept his own mouth shut.

HEADLINE: 1.6 Million In City Get Food Stamps

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The number of New York City residents receiving food stamps reached 1.6 million in August, reflecting a surge of nearly 30 percent in less than two years, the largest since the early 1970s. 
 The increase amounts to about $680 million annually in additional federal assistance to low-income city residents, the city's Independent Budget Office reported on Thursday.
 The magnitude of the surge has been ''unprecedented,'' the budget office found, noting that the state and city had taken steps in recent years to make it easier for eligible residents to apply for food stamps, but that the recession was probably an even greater reason for the increase. The previous peak of food stamp enrollment, 1.46 million, occurred in April 1995.
 But in 1995, nearly four-fifths of food stamp recipients also received public assistance; today only about one-quarter also receive welfare benefits.
 The separation of food stamps from cash welfare assistance ''suggests that while negative public attitudes and restrictive government policies toward welfare persist, food stamps have become an increasingly acceptable form of low-income assistance,'' the budget office found, citing a similar trend nationwide.

HEADLINE: Everyman's Financial Meltdown

BYLINE: By RON CHERNOW. 
Ron Chernow is the author of ''The House of Morgan'' and ''Alexander Hamilton.''

 BODY:
FOR connoisseurs of financial mayhem, the stock market crash of October 1929, which started 80 years ago this week, still holds pride of place. Like a tautly directed drama, it unfolded with graphic horror at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets, captured in grainy black-and-white newsreels. It capped a stylish era in which well-tailored men and chic flappers set a racy tone for stock investing. To the delight of historians, it possessed clear-cut villains, a riveting story line and plenty of palpable abuses for reformers to correct. 
 In retrospect, the evils of the 1920s seem almost quaint in their simplicity. Finance today is far more esoteric, marked by complex securities sure to baffle reformers as they seek solutions to the problems exposed by last year's crash. 
 Before the '20s, common stocks were deemed unsuitable for ordinary investors. That stigma began to fade during World War I, when Liberty Loan drives encouraged Americans to own government bonds, feeding a taste for securities that persisted into the '20s. To capitalize on this trend, commercial banks on Wall Street created securities affiliates and hired thousands of young stockbrokers who were untroubled by memories of past panics. Charles Mitchell, the head of National City Bank, prodded his recruits with pep talks and office contests to sell stocks with razzmatazz. The stock market quickly grew fashionable, with brokerage offices installed even on trans-Atlantic liners.
 It is tempting to deride the bull market of the '20s as a case study in mass delusion. There was a widespread belief that history had turned a corner, that a New Era of permanent prosperity had dawned. Long an importer of capital from Europe, the United States had emerged from World War I as the world's leading creditor, and governments from around the globe flocked to Wall Street for loans.
 The stock market of the 1920s was dazzled by the technological innovations of its day. As in every boom, irrational exuberance was merely rational exuberance run amok. Charles Lindbergh's solo flight to Paris fostered a perfect mania for aircraft stocks, while the invention of ''talkies'' spurred film company shares to new heights. The decade witnessed an explosion in sales of cars and radios, refrigerators and washing machines, all made affordable by installment plans. Art Deco skyscrapers soared in Manhattan. The infectious excitement obscured the economy's dangerous lopsidedness, with oil, agriculture and other ''sick sectors'' undercutting the general prosperity. Long before the crash, community banks were failing at the rate of one per day.
 Every stock market spree is sustained by soothing illusions. Investors in the '20s took comfort from the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Now buttressed by a central bank, Wall Street believed that the business cycle had been repealed, and the presumed safety net encouraged investors to buy the dips and ride out the most turbulent fluctuations. Three consecutive Republican presidents -- Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover -- cut taxes, weakened antitrust laws and promised not to meddle with Wall Street. 
 The stock exchange was a rigged market that made no claims to fairness. Speculators operated more than a hundred ''pools'' that openly manipulated individual stocks and sometimes bribed financial journalists. Their flamboyant managers -- William Crapo Durant, Michael Meehan, Joseph P. Kennedy and Jesse Livermore -- became folk heroes, their raffish exploits reported in gossip columns, giving Wall Street a louche glamour. Hot stock tips, circulated by waiters and bootblacks, made old-fashioned research superfluous. For many participants, a whiff of sin only enhanced the stock market's seduction. Small investors imagined that the large speculators who dominated the exchange could, if necessary, levitate the market and prevent unpleasant crack-ups.
 Even as the stock boom captured the national imagination, most Americans sat safely on the sidelines. In a population of 125 million, fewer than two million took a flier in stocks, but their impact was magnified by half a million margin accounts. Under the lax standards in effect, investors could plunk down a small fraction of a stock's value and borrow the rest. Banks showered this brokers' loan market with funds, and many corporations channeled spare cash there as well. Since much of this money was raised on the stock exchange in the first place, it created a self-perpetuating speculative machine. Margin loans equivalent to one-fifth the value of listed stocks poised the market on a tall but shaky scaffolding.
 Compounding the leverage problem was the vogue for mutual funds, known then as investment trusts. Their managers were supposed to shelter small investors from speculative swings, but these professionals proved as faddish as everyone else. Pumped up with borrowed money, they invested in other highly indebted trusts in a never-ending chain of speculation.
 Those who questioned the New Era gospel were ostracized as knaves or fools. The most persistent spoilsport was the economist Roger Babson, whose gloomy forecasts were mocked even as the economy stagnated in the sweltering summer of 1929. On Sept. 5, 1929, Babson reiterated his doomsday cry: ''Sooner or later a crash is coming, and it may be terrific.'' This time, instead of yawning, the market sold off sharply in what was dubbed the ''Babson Break'' -- the first sign of market fragility. President Hoover turned to Thomas W. Lamont, the senior partner of J. P. Morgan & Co., for reassurance. Five days before Black Thursday, Lamont obliged him with this stunning bromide: ''The future appears brilliant.'' 
 ON the morning of Thursday, Oct. 24, 1929, the stock market imploded from the sheer weight of its own excesses. Stocks suffered such precipitous drops that there were tearful scenes on the exchange floor and the visitors' gallery was cleared. Wall Street was thronged by distraught investors, who emitted a haunting moan as their life savings evaporated. 
 At noon, the crowd thrilled to the sight of Wall Street titans hurrying up the steps of the House of Morgan. Led by Lamont, the emergency meeting included Charles Mitchell and Albert Wiggin of Chase National Bank. Conspicuously missing were any government figures; it was a throwback to earlier panics, when financiers orchestrated their own rescues. The bankers pledged $240 million to stabilize the market. At 1:30, Dick Whitney, acting president of the stock exchange, strode ostentatiously to the United States Steel trading post and barked out a bid for 10,000 shares at a price several points higher than the previous trade. To cheers, he re-enacted this inspirational scene with other stocks. Such was the residual mystique of Wall Street bankers that the market rallied vigorously and closed only marginally lower. The next day, The Wall Street Journal ran a hopeful headline: ''Bankers Halt Stock Debacle.''
 This first act of the 1929 crash suggested that the smart money was powerful enough to tame an unruly market. Heavy selling on Monday, however, convinced investors that Thursday's turbulence hadn't been a fluke, but the first tremor of an earthquake. At Tuesday's opening, tremendous waves of selling set off pandemonium on the trading floor. The overloaded ticker tape lagged two and a half hours behind trading as 16.5 million shares changed hands. When the final numbers were in, stocks had lost a quarter of their value in two days. The shock and pain were manifest in photos of ruined men standing on Wall Street. This time, the notion that somebody would save them -- the bankers, the Fed, the big-time speculators -- had proven a cruel mirage.
 On farms and in small towns, the crash was greeted with puritanical glee: the city slickers had gotten their comeuppance. Exaggerated accounts of investors taking fancy dives from upper-story ledges underscored the urban nature of stock investing in the '20s. Unlike the 2009 crash, the 1929 debacle didn't topple major banks or corporations. It simply wiped out a generation of speculators.
 In retrospect, the 1929 crash stands as the dark gateway to the Great Depression, though not its direct cause. In its aftermath, government moved with unwonted vigor to shore up the economy. George Harrison, head of the New York Fed, bought large amounts of government bonds and slashed the rediscount rate. President Hoover pleaded with business to preserve wage levels, and some major companies increased their dividends. In mid-November, a tremendous rally drove stocks up 25 percent in a few days. By February 1930, The New York Times editorialized that ''the patient'' was now headed for a complete recovery. The next month, Hoover predicted that the ''worst effects of the crash'' would soon be over, and by April the stock market had recouped almost half of its October losses.
 The cheerleading proved premature. In the fall of 1930, cascading bank failures signaled a full-blown economic disaster. The stock market began to sink, not with huge selling bursts, but in an unrelenting slide that whittled stock prices daily, shaving almost 90 percent of the Dow's value from its September 1929 peak to the summer of 1932. Aside from those bankrupted by margin calls, the worst calamities occurred not among investors who sold in panic after the crash, but among bargain-hunters who swooped down afterward in what had seemed a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity.
 Starting in 1933, a secret history of the crash was unearthed by Ferdinand Pecora, the chief counsel of the Senate Banking Committee, who interrogated witnesses in sensational hearings. He revealed that Charles Mitchell and other National City executives had cushioned their stock losses by tapping interest-free loans from a special bank fund, while Albert Wiggin made millions selling short his own bank's shares. Such revelations dashed forever the notion that Wall Street could effectively police itself. With Pecora's help, the Roosevelt administration created a transparent regulatory framework that has shaped financial markets to the present day. 
 New Deal financial reformers were fortunate that the crash had followed the satisfying script of a morality play, with sin and repentance followed by redemption. The wicked ways of Wall Street in the '20s could be comfortably told in a fireside chat. Franklin Roosevelt had a bunch of rich rascals to chastise -- unscrupulous individuals rather than irresponsible institutions, as in our own recent decline. The blatant stock market abuses were comprehensible to ordinary citizens, quite unlike the exotic credit derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that baffle us today. And the Great Depression that followed the 1929 crash fostered a climate for reform that has proven hard to replicate. 
 However severe, our current predicament seems mild compared to the calamitous unemployment of the early 1930s. Hence, average Americans, mystified by the complexities of finance today, still await a new season of financial reform.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Profit Falls On Delivery Cuts

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service said third-quarter profit fell 43 percent as the recession weighed on demand for domestic package-delivery shipments. 
 Net income slid to $549 million, or 55 cents a share, from $970 million, or 96 cents, a year earlier, U.P.S. said Thursday in a statement. Revenue fell 15 percent to $11.2 billion.
 U.P.S. said its shipments in the United States fell 5.1 percent, the seventh consecutive decline, as businesses curbed purchases to lower costs. The company is considered a proxy for the American economy because it handles half of all packages sent.
 The company said earnings in the final quarter of this year will be 58 to 65 cents a share; analysts estimated 63 cents.

 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
'THE BOYS ARE BACK' (PG-13, 1:40) And the mom is dead -- again! Clive Owen takes his turn as a widowed dad in this unconvincing macho weepy, from the Austrian director Scott Hicks. (A. O. Scott)20091022
 'BRIGHT STAR' (PG, 1:59) Jane Campion, following the biographical record closely, tells the story of John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), star-crossed literary lovers of the Regency period. Thanks to the passionate performances and the director's rough, almost breathless style, what might have been a prettified period drama becomes a seething, swooning inquiry into the nature of love. (Scott)20091022
 'CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY' (R, 2:06) Michael Moore tracks the end of a troubled romance. (I knew they weren't meant for each other!) (Manohla Dargis)20091022 
 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS' (PG, 1:21) This better-than-expected 3-D animated film takes its title and premise from the children's book about a town where menu items rain down like manna. Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) is a young inventor who wins the town's appreciation for his climate-changing machine until, of course, the technology runs amok. The film only lightly touches on the dangers of junk food, obesity and solid waste, but its inspired lunacy leaves the audience sated. (Daniel M. Gold)20091022
 'COCO BEFORE CHANEL' (PG-13, 1:10, in French) Less a biopic than a study in the manners and morals of a bygone era, Anne Fontaine's film follows the complicated love life and budding ambition of Gabrielle Chanel (Audrey Tautou) on her path from early poverty and heartbreak through independence toward eventual fame. Ms. Tautou, wary and astringent, is excellent, as is Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays Coco's aristocratic lover, Etienne Balsan. (Scott)20091022
 'FAME' (PG, 1:47) Like Alan Parker's 1980 film, Kevin Tancharoen's version has great dancing and brisk editing. What's missing is the original's real sting of adolescent angst. (Andy Webster)20091022
 'GOOD HAIR' (PG-13, 1:35) Spirited, probing and frequently hilarious, Jeff Stilson's documentary follows the comedian Chris Rock as he investigates the complex, often troubled relationship between African-American women and their crowning glory. From beauty shops in America to a Hindu temple in India, the film coasts on the fearless charm of its front man and the eye-opening candor of its interviewees. Digging gingerly into wounds both political and personal, Mr. Rock transforms a world of hurt into a medium for insightful and often uncomfortable observations on race and conformity. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20091022
 'THE HERETICS' (No rating, 1:35) Joan Braderman's documentary about Heresies, a magazine of art and politics, gives a joyful sense of what it was like to be a feminist in the 1970s, a time when ''everything seemed possible.'' Ms. Braderman intercuts the story of the magazine with recent interviews with some of the original Heresies team. It's a pleasure to spend time in their company. (Rachel Saltz)20091022
 'THE HURT LOCKER' (R, 2:10) In this tense, insightful film about a United States Army bomb-disposal squad in Iraq, Kathryn Bigelow has made a crackerjack action picture that is also a drama of character, psychology and ideas. Jeremy Renner, as a soldier who approaches danger with the conviction of an artist and the compulsiveness of an addict, is simply amazing, and the rest of the cast, notably Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, is nearly as strong. (Scott)20091022
 'THE INFORMANT!' (R, 1:45) A pudged-up, very funny Matt Damon stars in this smart, cynical, deeply serious comedy from Steven Soderbergh about the not-at-all funny costs -- personal, political -- of white-collar crime in America. (Dargis)20091022
 'INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS' (R, 2:32) Quentin Tarantino signs up for giggly duty in this bloated, self-satisfied World War II fantasia. The Nazis, in specific, a charming SS officer brilliantly played by the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, win. (Dargis)20091022
 'THE INVENTION OF LYING' (PG-13, 1:40) Ricky Gervais stars and, with Matthew Robinson, directs this funny, melancholic, shoddily made defense of deceit. (Dargis)20091022
 'IRENE IN TIME' (PG-13, 1:34) A valentine to women and a letter bomb to men, Henry Jaglom's latest foray into supposedly female obsessions centers on Irene (Tanna Frederick), a loveless adult trapped in idolatrous memories of her long-gone, wastrel father. Smothering insightful moments in verbal and musical treacle (courtesy of Harriet Schock's sticky songs), Mr. Jaglom displays an endearing lack of cynicism but an equal lack of discipline. (Catsoulis)20091022
 'IT MIGHT GET LOUD' (PG, 1:38) Three giants of the electric guitar, drawn from different genres and generations -- Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, the Edge of U2 and Jack White of the White Stripes -- philosophize, reminisce and then sit down to jam. Pretty cool stuff, nicely captured by Davis Guggenheim. (Scott)20091022
 'JULIE & JULIA' (PG-13, 2:03) As Julia Child, Meryl Streep dominates Norah Ephron's attempt to tell two parallel stories, one about a culinary giantess and the other about a perky blogger. Amy Adams, as Julie Powell, the perky blogger, does her best, but the deck is stacked in favor of Julia, Paris and Ms. Streep. Still, even a lumpy sauce can taste good when made with the proper ingredients. (Scott)20091022
 'LOVE HAPPENS' (PG-13, 1:49) The vital signs in this tear-drenched drama about a widowed self-help guru (Aaron Eckhart) are faint. (Stephen Holden)20091022
 'THE MAID' (No rating, 1:35, in Spanish) Catalina Saavedra plays the title character in this Chilean movie about a live-in maid whose constricted world begins to crack, allowing life and air to slip in through the fissures. Sebastian Silva directs, slyly. (Dargis)20091022
 '9' (PG-13, 1:28) Sensitive automatons face killer machines in a post-apocalyptic landscape. Not the most original premise, perhaps, but Shane Acker's film, an expanded version of his Oscar-nominated animated short, is full of ingenious and beautifully realized visual ideas. (Scott)20091022
 'OPA!' (PG-13, 1:40) This sweet, nontaxing film is held back by Matthew Modine's bland performance in the lead role, that of an archaeologist who comes to the Isle of Patmos in search of St. John's chalice. He falls for a vivacious tavern owner played by the lovely Agni Scott, though why this character would be interested in this colorless fellow remains unclear. Nice supporting work from Richard Griffiths and Alki David, and the director, Udayan Prasad, isn't shy about soaking up the scenery. (Neil Genzlinger)20091022
 'PANDORUM' (R, 1:48) Presenting a scenario where the line between reality and hallucination is constantly shifting, Christian Alvart's apocalyptic nightmare unfolds aboard a spacecraft en route to populate a new planet. As two astronauts (Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster) battle memory loss and marauding mutants, Mr. Alvart proves an effective manager of atmosphere but an inept choreographer of movement. Worth seeing, however, are Richard Bridgland's stunning set designs, which alternately evoke coffinlike claustrophobia and sickening vertigo. (Catsoulis)20091022
 'PARIS' (No rating, 2:04, in French) Both a Parisian answer to Woody Allen's ''Manhattan'' and a multicharacter mosaic in the mode of Robert Altman's ''Short Cuts,'' ''Paris'' is much lighter fare than either. Even when tragedy strikes, its outlook remains buoyant. (Holden)20091022
 'THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE' (PG-13, 1:30) R. J. Cutler's glib, entertaining documentary zooms in on the creation of a single, very fat issue of American Vogue in a far-off gilded age (i.e., 2007), and the meanie in chief, Anna Wintour, who makes it happen. (Dargis)20091022
 'THE STEPFATHER' (PG-13, 1:01) Dylan Walsh of ''Nip/Tuck'' stars in this clumsy, shallow remake of the 1987 cult thriller. (Holden)20091022
 'SURROGATES' (PG-13, 1:29) Bruce Willis stars in a half-baked science-fiction flick about a near future, one that looks disappointingly like today, when people have become shut-ins who communicate and even fornicate through prettified avatars. (Dargis)20091022
 'TYLER PERRY'S I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF' (PG-13, 1:53) Mr. Perry adds music to his Madea formula in this sometimes comic drama, constructing a plot about a nightclub singer (Taraji P. Henson) that allows him to slide in knockout songs for Mary J. Blige, Gladys Knight and Marvin L. Winans (who all play secondary characters in the story). And a young actress named Hope Olaide Wilson, playing a 16-year-old who, with two younger brothers, is dumped into the care of Ms. Henson's self-destructive character, helps elevate the predictable story with a very convincing performance. (Genzlinger)20091022
 'VISUAL ACOUSTICS' (No rating, 1:24) Architecture aficionados and design mavens will have an agreeable time with this ode to the photographer Julius Shulman, a champion of Modernist Los Angeles architects, who died at 98 in July. The film is also a valentine to the graceful buildings he shot and to the well-to-do Californians who could afford them. But it does pay proper respect to an incomparable artist. (Webster)20091022
 'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' (PG, 1:40) Spike Jonze directs this alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful live-action adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children's book about a solitary boy, Max (Max Records), liberated by his imagination. The film has been pitched to a distinctly older audience than the picture book's original readers, and some younger children might be alarmed or scared by the snuffling, growling wild things (voiced by James Gandolfini, among others). (Dargis)20091022
 'THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD' (No rating, 1:27) It is great fun to watch Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno, the anti-globalization activists and satirical performance artists known as the Yes Men, pull off elaborate pranks that embarrass corporations. (Holden)20091022
 'ZOMBIELAND' (R, 1:21) Ruben Fleischer directs this minor, overly self-amused, splatter-slicked diversion about a world overrun with the undead. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson trade quips and zombie-killing techniques. (Dargis)20091022

HEADLINE: Strong Profit at American Express

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The American Express Company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday as it trimmed costs, a decline in consumer spending stabilized, and bad loans eased. 
 Net income fell to $640 million, or 53 cents a share, from $815 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said.
 Excluding a gain of $180 million related to foreign subsidiaries, American Express earned 44 cents a share, topping Wall Street forecasts for 38 cents a share.
 Revenue fell 16 percent, to $6.01 billion, from $6.96 billion.
 The company said expenses declined 17 percent, to $3.9 billion, as it trimmed jobs and cut expenses for marketing and its rewards program.
 Total card spending fell 11 percent in the United States from the third quarter of 2008. However, it showed an improvement against a 16 percent contraction in the second quarter.
 ''Overall billings have stabilized during the last few months and we saw indications that spending by corporate card members is beginning to pick up,'' the chief executive, Kenneth Chenault, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Compassion Deficit

 BODY:
It's far more than a local shame that a Pennsylvania pastor had to go to court to uphold the Bible's mandate to comfort the homeless and needy. The minister, the Rev. Jack Wisor, won as the town of Brookville agreed to pay $100,000 and let him reopen the Just for Jesus shelter after inspectors had broken into the church in a harebrained attempt to prove it had violated zoning laws. The shame grows far beyond Brookville as more and more local governments respond to the recession's hard times with similar variations on criminalizing homelessness. 
 New laws prohibiting loitering have increased 11 percent and bans on public camping are up 7 percent, according to a survey of more than 200 cities and towns by the National Coalition for the Homeless. Grass-roots meanness is too often on display. In Tampa, Fla., the Hillsborough County Commission backed away from a Catholic Charities plan for a fenced camp for the down and out. Politicians' self-preservation trumped community charity when alarmed residents protested they were arming themselves in fear of homeless criminals. 
 Vox pop need not be so shabby. In Daytona Beach, Fla., the government works with charities to provide constructive shelter services in which the homeless help clean the city. In Cleveland, instead of the anti-begging and anti-loitering route being taken elsewhere, the city government coordinates with homeless advocates to make shelter and food programs more efficient. 
 The need for localities and states to opt for charity over enmity only grows as the recession swells the homeless ranks. The flow now includes a sizable cohort of innocent renters locked out by foreclosed landlords. Charity can only begin at home and must be extended through hometown government. ''That's what this country has been founded on,'' one of the Hillsborough commissioners initially observed -- before fearful residents had him switch his vote and disinvite the homeless.

HEADLINE: Polar Bear Habitat Proposed for Northern Alaska Coast

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Interior Department on Thursday proposed designating more than 200,000 square miles of land, sea and ice along the northern coast of Alaska as critical habitat for the shrinking polar bear population.
 The area, the largest single designation of protected habitat for any species, encompasses the entire range of the two polar bear populations that exist on American land and territorial waters. Government scientists estimate that there are roughly 3,500 bears in the two groups, known the Chukchi Sea and the Southern Beaufort Sea populations.
 Officials said the bears' range was shrinking because of the disappearance of sea ice linked to global warming. 
 ''Proposing critical habitat for this iconic species is one step in the right direction to help this species stave off extinction, recognizing that the greatest threat to the polar bear is the melting of sea ice caused by climate change,'' said Thomas L. Strickland, the assistant interior secretary for fish, wildlife and parks. 
 In May 2008 the Interior Department declared, under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, that the polar bear was threatened with extinction. The Bush administration found that the bears' habitat was shrinking because of melting ice, along with commercial activities like shipping, oil and gas operations, hunting and tourism. 
 Yet Bush administration officials said at the time that they did not intend to use the Endangered Species Act to address global warming, a policy affirmed by the Obama administration.
 ''The Endangered Species Act is not the appropriate tool to directly address the carbon emissions that are root cause of climate change,'' Mr. Strickland said in a conference call Thursday afternoon. He said the government was dealing with climate change through legislation, regulation and international negotiation.
 Mr. Strickland and other officials said that the bears' habitat was not being set aside as a refuge and that oil and gas exploration and other activities could continue under the terms of the species act and other laws. He noted that the Shell Oil Company had been given permission this week to drill in the proposed protected area.
 ''This will not be a significant additional burden on the industry,'' Mr. Strickland said.
 The new designation requires a government agency or commercial interest to show that any proposed activity, including oil drilling or shipping, would not destroy or adversely affect the bears' habitat or accelerate the extinction of the species.
 Alaska officials are already challenging the federal protections afforded polar bears, saying they threaten the state's oil industry and broader economy.
 The Interior Department's polar bear policy has been under fire from environmental advocates as well. When the department listed the polar bear as threatened last year, it did not simultaneously designate critical habitat as the law requires. Conservation groups sued, and Thursday's announcement was part of a settlement of the case. 
 Some wildlife advocates said the announcement did not go far enough.
 ''If polar bears are to survive in a rapidly melting Arctic, we need to protect their critical habitat, not turn it into a polluted industrial zone,'' said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel with the Center for Biological Diversity. ''The Interior Department is schizophrenic, declaring its intent to protect polar bear habitat in the Arctic, yet simultaneously sacrificing that habitat to feed our unsustainable addiction to oil.''
 The habitat rule will be open to public comment for 60 days, and the agency will conduct additional scientific and economic studies of the proposal's impact. The agency is required to publish a final critical-habitat rule by June 30, 2010.

HEADLINE: European Bank Warns on Hedge Fund Rules

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank has warned that E.U. plans to tighten regulation of hedge funds and other alternative investors risk creating a two-tier playing field that could drive the industry out of Europe. 
 European governments and the European Parliament have the final say on a new law that will require a wide range of alternative investment fund managers to register and disclose information to supervisors if they want to operate in the 27-nation bloc. 
 In a legal opinion published on its Web site, the E.C.B. backed stronger controls for the lightly regulated sector but warned that unless other countries adopted similar rules, the plans would leave Europe at a disadvantage and could drive funds to shift to states with looser regimes. 
 ''An internationally coordinated response is necessary given the highly international nature of the industry and the consequent risks of regulatory arbitrage and evasion,'' the E.C.B. said. 
 ''The E.C.B. urges the Commission of the European Communities to continue the dialogue with its international partners, in particular the United States, to ensure a globally coherent regulatory and supervisory framework.'' 
 The new rules would requires funds to disclose the main types of assets it invests in as well as provide details on their use of short selling, one of the tactics blamed for stoking the financial crisis. 
 Unless non-E.U. managers comply with the rules within three years of the law coming into force, probably around 2015, they will be barred from offering their products in the bloc. 
 Britain, the European Union's main hedge fund and private equity centre, has mounted a strong campaign to water down several aspects of the draft law but faces stiff opposition from France, Spain and Germany, which all back strong regulation of the sector. 
 Consensus is emerging that a ''one size fits all'' approach to all the different funds that falls within the law's cope needed refining. 
 The European Central Bank raised serious concerns. ''The E.C.B. sees a potential risk of regulatory arbitrage between alternative investment fund managers, insurance companies and credit institutions, among which the proposed directive does not create a level playing field,'' it said. 
 It also flagged concerns over the new law's definition of a fund's leverage -- amount of debt compared to assets. 
 ''The definition of 'leverage' under the proposed directive does not, however, include specific leverage ratio concepts,'' it warned. ''The E.C.B. is concerned that, without additional clarifications inserted into the text of the proposed directive, it may be difficult to implement the proposed definition.'' 
 It also said that central banks should be shielded from the new regulations.

HEADLINE: Reports Run Hot and Cold

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
That was fast. A year after the financial downturn and a taxpayer-financed recovery, Wall Streeters are again circling the Bay Area's top universities for fresh talent. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to recruit at Stanford, while familiar names like UBS and Credit Suisse are pitching students at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Career counselors say the demand for their students is no greater than a year ago, but they take comfort in the fact that it has remained stable. As an industry, financial services has grown significantly as a source of jobs in San Francisco over the past five years, according to a government report due out next month.
News from the technology world could have induced whiplash. During the past week, Sun Microsystems announced 3,000 layoffs while Apple reported a 46 percent jump in quarterly profits driven by iPhone sales. Make no mistake: Silicon Valley's job market remains devastated, but outlooks vary by sector. 
 Job seekers in application development, Java programming and basic hardware design -- the work once sought by small businesses that are now retrenching -- still have scant pickings. But those working in mobile electronics and consumer chip-oriented design may be in luck.
 ''The mobile area is very hot right now,'' said Richard Englehardt of RGA Associates, a San Francisco recruiting firm. ''nVidia, Broadcom, Marvell, Intel and Apple, they're all making big moves in that direction.'' 
 In fact, employment in smart-phone-related industries soared 385 percent in the past year, Mr. Englehardt said.
 Bay Area workers in nontech sectors like residential construction still see a void where the jobs once were.
 According to data compiled this week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for The New York Times, the number of home building jobs in Contra Costa County as of March had fallen by 56 percent from its 2005 peak. Other counties hit especially hard include Alameda, which shed 44 percent of its home building jobs in that period, and Santa Clara, which lost 25 percent. 
 ''Construction stands out as the hardest-hit sector here,'' said Amar Mann, a regional economist for the bureau. ''It used to be the source of so much high-paying work. Now there are no big projects left, and people can only take odd jobs here and there.''

HEADLINE: Fed to Monitor Pay of Bankers To Curtail Risk

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Edmund L. Andrews and Eric Dash contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve announced Thursday that it would crack down on pay packages that encouraged bankers to take excessive risks, but officials acknowledged that the plan might not reduce the biggest paychecks on Wall Street. 
 While unlikely by itself to end the practice of lavish compensation, the Fed's plan is one of the most far-reaching responses yet to last year's financial crisis. It will subject executives, traders, deal makers and other employees of the biggest banks to regulatory scrutiny of their compensation and represent another increase in government intervention in the marketplace.
 The announcement was choreographed to coincide with the decision by the Obama administration this week to cut the pay of many high earners at the seven companies that received the most taxpayer help. Both decisions were announced amid growing public outrage over large pay packages at many of those companies. 
 ''Compensation practices at some banking organizations have led to misaligned incentives and excessive risk-taking, contributing to bank losses and financial instability,'' said Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman. ''The Federal Reserve is working to ensure that compensation packages appropriately tie rewards to longer-term performance and do not create undue risk for the firm or the financial system.''
 In one sense, the announcements by the Fed and the Treasury are a sharp departure from the hands-off approach to regulation that had dominated this city for decades. The abiding principle of both announcements was the same -- companies that make a lot of money over a sustained period will be allowed to reward their executives handsomely, while those who put the economy, the financial system, shareholders and the taxpayer at risk may not. 
 But the effectiveness of the new policies -- and whether they will curtail irresponsible business decisions designed to inflate bonuses -- will ultimately be dictated by how the new rules are enforced. Even in Washington, there was skepticism about whether the government would be able to keep ahead of practices that have allowed top executives and others to reap huge financial rewards while their banking companies turned in poor or unsustainable performances. 
 The principles proposed by the Fed for the nation's 28 largest banking companies are less strict than those from some European leaders and some members of Congress. They do not impose caps on pay or prohibit multimillion-dollar packages. One senior official predicted that they would do nothing to curtail the lucrative pay at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both regulated by the Fed since becoming bank holding companies last year during the financial crisis.
 Instead of pay limits, the Fed rules are intended to discourage pay packages that may encourage risky practices. The government wants to encourage pay packages that reward executives for long-term performance.
 Officials acknowledged that it could be months before they would be able to tell whether the Fed's changes would have the intended effect. Bank examiners will have to be trained on the ties between compensation and risk management. Moreover, compensation consultants have been adept at finding ways to get around pay restrictions.
 The officials emphasized that the plan was not intended to make pay packages more socially equitable but was part of a broader effort by the Fed to shore up the stability of the banking system. That effort has included tighter supervision of lending and trading practices and higher requirements for capital held as a cushion against losses.
 Even as the Fed was unveiling its plan, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Treasury official in charge of overseeing pay practices at the companies that received the biggest government bailouts, was providing details about his decision to curb the compensation of the 25 top employees of each of those firms.
 At those companies -- which include Citigroup, Bank of America, the American International Group, General Motors and Chrysler -- future bonus payments will be awarded only after senior executives set corporate performance goals in consultation with Treasury. The bonuses will have to be in the form of restricted stock that cannot be sold until the company repays the government. Executive perks of more than $25,000 for country clubs or corporate cars will need approval from Washington.
 But, bowing to concerns that too heavy a hand could lead to a mass exodus of executives, both the Treasury and Fed policies will permit top earners to reap millions of dollars. 
 Mr. Feinberg said that all the companies had made unacceptable requests. In most cases, he restricted the cash salary to $500,000 and imposed new restraints on stock grants and bonuses tied to company performance over several years.
 ''I found that the numbers that were submitted by the companies were almost without exception to have been not in the public interest,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''They were both too high and the wrong mix of stock and cash.'' 
 Mr. Feinberg said he had made one significant exception to his policy of slashing compensation -- for three senior executives at A.I.G. who had signed contracts long before his appointment for multimillion-dollar bonuses. And if Citigroup and Bank of America manage to heal, 22 of the top 34 earners could each wind up making more than $5 million over the next year.
 The Fed's plan, which will take effect some time after a 30-day comment period, will create a two-tier system of supervising pay, using different approaches for the nation's 28 biggest institutions and the thousands of smaller banks, which would be subjected to a review with their regular bank examinations.
 The money center bank holding companies, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, would have to present their compensation plans to bank regulators, who would then evaluate whether pay incentives properly balance goals of short-term growth and long-term stability. Bank regulators could demand changes, and would monitor pay practices as part of their regular examinations. 
 The plan would apply to senior executives and others, like loan officers and traders, whose individual or collective decisions could expose the firm to significant losses. 
 But the review, including discussions between regulators and the companies, would remain confidential, making it difficult for outsiders to glean any changes prompted by regulators 
 At Citigroup's investment banking offices, traders shrugged off the pay rules imposed by Mr. Feinberg as affecting only a handful of the company's 275,000 employees. 
 Eugene A. Ludwig, a former Comptroller of the Currency who runs a consulting firm that specializes in regulatory issues, said banking regulators had been reluctant to look at pay practices, thinking it is the province of management. Now, it is rising to the top of their agenda. 
 ''That will change behavior,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Adviser Predicts 10% Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
One of President Obama's top economic advisers warned on Thursday that the nation's unemployment was likely to climb above 10 percent by the middle of next year and that job growth would remain anemic through the end of 2010. 
 ''Unemployment is likely to remain at its severely elevated level'' through the end of next year, predicted Christina Romer, chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
 Ms. Romer said she agreed with private sector forecasters who expected that the economy would expand at a moderate pace through the end of next year as it slowly recovered from its deep recession.
 But she cautioned that unemployment usually recovered much more slowly than economic growth, and that the job creation had to make up for a great deal of lost ground from the last two years.
 And she warned that the rebound in jobs could actually be even slower than what White House officials and private forecasters had been predicting. That was a sharp contrast to the Obama administration's forecast at the start of the year, which predicted that unemployment would not climb much above 8 percent and was widely criticized as unrealistic and too optimistic.
 Ms. Romer said that a survey of economic forecasters prepared by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a research organization, forecast that unemployment would peak at 10.1 percent in the second quarter of 2010, up from 9.8 percent last month, and would be at 9.6 percent at the end of next year.
 Though Ms. Romer said that economic conditions had improved drastically in the last six months, and that the $787 billion stimulus program had contributed to that improvement, she said the rebound in jobs could actually be even slower than what White House officials currently expected.
 ''There is a substantial range of uncertainty around any forecast,'' she cautioned.
 Although the stimulus program will help the economy grow faster than it would have otherwise, she said, the effect of the stimulus will not be as pronounced as this year. 
 In addition, Ms. Romer warned, American companies had registered big productivity gains during the recession, just as they did during the downturn in 2001, and employers might be even more restrained than usual about rebuilding their work forces.
 The economy has lost 7.2 million jobs since the recession began almost two years ago, and economists say it needs to produce about 100,000 jobs a month just to keep up with increases in the population. All told, Ms. Romer said, the United States was about nine million jobs short of where it should be.

HEADLINE: Audit of Home Tax Credit Shows Errors and Abuses

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Just as Congressional leaders are calling for an extension of a popular $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, or even an expansion to all homebuyers, government investigators reported Thursday that audits suggest widespread abuse and errors in the program.
 A report from the Treasury Department's inspector general said that as of Sept. 30 the Internal Revenue Service had identified 167 possible criminal schemes and opened nearly 107,000 examinations of potential civil violations. 
 On Wednesday, in the first successful I.R.S. prosecution, a tax preparer in Jacksonville, Fla., James Otto Price III, was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for fraud in 2008. According to the Justice Department, he claimed the credit for ineligible clients, many of whom were unaware of the action, and electronically paid himself $1,000 of the credit's value each time.
 While government officials said many suspect claims could turn out to be simple errors, the report found examples of claimants who already owned homes or had not yet bought one. Some 582 taxpayers were under 18 years old -- as young as 4. Of the 1.4 million people who have claimed nearly $10 billion in credits for 2008 and 2009, 60 percent had incomes below $50,000, raising questions about whether some could afford a home. 
 The report was released at a hearing of the oversight subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. The subcommittee's chairman, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, announced afterward that he had introduced a bill to give the I.R.S. additional authority to detect and block questionable claims and to require that taxpayers provide documents with their returns to prove they had closed on their purchases. 
 It was unclear what effect abuses and errors would have on the debate over expanding the credit or extending it beyond its Nov. 30 expiration. Supporters said the remedies proposed by Mr. Lewis could help to blunt opposition based on the audit. 
 At the hearing, Mr. Lewis and other lawmakers in both parties indicated support for extending the credit because of continued weakness in the housing market and assuming the I.R.S. could better enforce the program. 
 But Mr. Lewis added, ''We must ensure that we are administering the credit accurately.'' 
 At the hearing's opening, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, J. Russell George, said, ''I am very concerned about the I.R.S.'s ability to administer the credit'' to guard against tax cheats. 
 The $8,000 credit is available to individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and couples up to $150,000. People above those limits can get smaller benefits, but the credit phases out at $95,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples. The credit is refundable, so taxpayers get a check for any amount beyond their tax liability.
 The Obama administration is lukewarm about extending the credit and opposes increasing it, officials say. But the housing industry is lobbying hard to expand the credit to as much as $15,000 and for including all homebuyers. 
 The program is also a priority of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who faces re-election in a state that has among the highest rates of foreclosures and credit claimants. 
 Of the 1.4 million home sales in which the credit figured, about 350,000 to 400,000 were believed to be a result of its availability, the real estate industry and independent economists estimated. 
 Extending the credit would cost about $1 billion a month, Congressional analysts say.
 The credit was created in mid-2008 and set at $7,500 in a stimulus law signed by President George W. Bush as the housing and economic crisis took hold. It was raised to $8,000 in the $787 billion economic recovery package that President Obama shepherded into law, and the law also dropped requiring homebuyers to repay the credit over 15 years. 
 The current credit applies to sales of primary residences that have closed between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1. It can be claimed on taxpayers' returns for 2008 or 2009. 
 Linda E. Stiff, a deputy I.R.S. commissioner, and James R. White, director of tax issues at the Government Accountability Office, testified that part of the problem for taxpayers and the I.R.S. had been confusion between the two overlapping versions of the temporary credit.

HEADLINE: Final New Jersey Debate Turns Into a Free-for-All

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
The third and final debate in the tightening New Jersey governor's race turned into something of a free-for-all on Thursday night as Gov. Jon S. Corzine tried to portray the state's battered economy as poised for a slingshotlike recovery, while his Republican rival, Christopher J. Christie, depicted him as lamentably out of touch.
 But the two were constantly harassed by a pesky Christopher J. Daggett, the independent candidate, who pointed to a new poll that showed him within striking distance, and who taunted Mr. Corzine and Mr. Christie over property taxes, corruption and the environment. 
 The hourlong debate, broadcast on the jazz station WBGO in Newark, broke little new ground, but allowed the three men to deliver their closing arguments.
 The two major-party rivals offered a positive case: Mr. Christie promised to deliver a needed ''change of direction'' and strong leadership, while Mr. Corzine warned that he alone would fight ''for what matters most.'' 
 Mr. Daggett slashed freely, assailing the Democratic governor's ''failed fiscal policies'' and saying that Mr. Christie's campaign lacked ''substance'' and ''intellectual integrity.''
 Mr. Corzine pointed to achievements like getting more children covered by health insurance and enrolled in preschool. He stressed that the recession was not his doing, but promised that his policies and ''tough choices'' would ensure that New Jersey pulls out of its economic slump ''sooner and stronger.''
 He suggested that Mr. Christie favored tax cuts for corporations over education, and said he had worked hard, if in some arcane ways, to make the state more ''user-friendly'' for business.
 ''There are a lot of companies that are looking at New Jersey the way I think most people would,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''We're moving forward.''
 But Mr. Christie cited rising unemployment figures to suggest that Mr. Corzine simply did not grasp the extent of the pain facing New Jersey residents.
 ''It's just astounding to me that you still don't get the fact that after getting rated the worst business climate for the last two years, you continue to say that things are going well here,'' Mr. Christie said.
 Apart from calling Mr. Daggett's property tax plan a ''gimmick,'' Mr. Christie largely refrained from attacking him. Instead, he focused on Mr. Corzine.
 On a day when the former Bergen County Democratic chairman, Joseph Ferriero, was convicted of corruption charges, Mr. Christie, who had prosecuted him, tried to trace his sins to Mr. Corzine's checkbook, since the governor had given heavily to the organization Mr. Ferriero led. 
 ''I believe the governor's an honest man,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But the fact is that his money has enabled people like Joe Ferriero to remain in power.''
 Mr. Corzine had none of it, saying his donations had been to help Democrats like Al Gore and President Obama carry Bergen, a pivotal electoral battleground, and noting that his running mate, State Senator Loretta Weinberg, had defied Mr. Ferriero.
 ''The idea that I have somehow enabled Joe Ferriero, when I stood up to him first along with Loretta Weinberg when he tried to run her out of the party, is just a joke,'' he said.
 Mr. Corzine, for his part, presented the election as a stark two-way choice, switching subjects at the last moment to warn voters that Mr. Christie would name ''very, very conservative'' judges to fill four scheduled openings on the New Jersey Supreme Court. ''Those individuals will have much to say about whether a woman has the right to choose, and what the constraints on that might or might not be,'' he said.
 Mr. Corzine, spurned by environmental groups this year, nevertheless noted that President Obama had named New Jersey's environmental commissioner to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Christie boasted of his endorsement by an environmental advocacy group and said he had been aggressive in prosecuting ocean dumpers.
 To which Mr. Daggett, who was a top official in the federal agency and the state environmental chief, did an audible double take. ''He said he got involved in stopping ocean dumping?'' Mr. Daggett said, calling the assertion ludicrous. ''That ended long before he was U.S. attorney.''

HEADLINE: Firearms Bubble May Be Bursting

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and UNA GALANI

 BODY:
Cerberus plans to float the gun maker Freedom Group soon. It better hurry. President Obama's election victory sent weapon sales -- and the valuations of firearms producers -- higher. Falling backlogs hint that sales could plunge. This gun bubble may backfire. 
 Two sparks set off this speculative burst. First, fears of economic calamity inspired sales of weapons. The assault-rifle-style autoload SR-556 is useful for shooting varmints and for ''personal defense,'' according to its maker, Sturm, Ruger & Company. Second, gun collectors feared a Democratic president would restrict gun ownership. The SR-556 is not available in blue state strongholds like Massachusetts and California. 
 There's plenty of anecdotal evidence of the mania. Retailers reported ammunition shortages. Gun show attendance overflowed. Firearms factories are running flat out.
 Meanwhile, insiders seem to be preparing for a slowdown. Smith & Wesson diversified into security systems. Cerberus said in Freedom Group's prospectus that the durability of recent demand was a risk factor. 
 Total domestic firearm sales should be around $3 billion this year. That's two to three times as much as is typically spent, according to estimates derived from Treasury excise taxes. Background checks over the last 12 months, which are a leading indicator of gun sales, were 50 percent higher than the levels reported during the middle years of the decade. 
 Rising sales lighted a fire to stocks of gun makers and sellers. Since the election, Smith & Wesson's shares rose 114 percent while Sturm, Ruger jumped 92 percent. Cabelas, a hunting superstore, gained 81 percent. 
 This bubble may already be deflating. Smith & Wesson's backlog hit $268 million early this year and shrank to $177 million last quarter because of cancellations and fewer orders. Considering it stood at only $50 million in April 2008, the backlog could have further to fall. Sturm, Ruger reported roughly similar trends. 
 If sales fell to more typical levels of recent years, up to two-thirds of gun sales could disappear. And they could fall further as there are up to 300 million functional guns already in circulation. And firearms have a very long lifespan if properly cared for.
 Gun buyers may well decide their racks don't need more company for a few years.
 Merger in the Making
 A fix for Verizon Wireless, the largest mobile phone company in the United States, could be on the horizon. Verizon Communications has 55 percent stake in it, and Vodafone of Britain owns 45 percent. The two have long not seen eye to eye, but there's now more reason to be hopeful for a solution. 
 Vodafone's issue is that Verizon Wireless, which has a 29 percent operating margin and generates roughly $12 billion of cash annually, hasn't distributed dividends since 2005. Verizon Communications has preferred to use the Verizon Wireless cash flow for other purposes. 
 Yet dividends may be coming soon. There are few domestic acquisition opportunities for Verizon Wireless, and it needs Vodafone's consent to expand abroad. Verizon Communications might also need to keep getting cash from the mobile venture, even after it finishes paying back loans in two years. The declining fixed-line business in the United States will generate just $1.3 billion of free cash flow after capital expenditure in 2011, according to Arete Research, well short of last year's $5 billion dividend payout. 
 The resumption of a dividend would be just a start. Vodafone would still be a powerless minority owner and Verizon Communications would be back to resenting its partner sucking up dividends. And Verizon would struggle to raise the estimated $70 billion needed to take full ownership. 
 This might be a good time to revisit the idea of a full merger between Vodafone and Verizon. The combination would create a $312 billion company, with Vodafone accounting for 54 percent of the value. 
 A deal wouldn't be easy. But the so-called social issues might not be a source of disagreement. Verizon Communications' chief operating officer left recently and Ivan Seidenberg, the chairman and chief executive, is 62 years old. That suggests a gap at the top. Vittorio of Vodafone Colao is only 48. If nothing else, a full merger could resolve succession issues.

HEADLINE: Gaza Report Author Asks U.S. to Clarify Concerns

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
Richard Goldstone, the lead author of a United Nations report that found evidence of war crimes committed by Israel and Hamas during last winter's Gaza war, challenged the Obama administration in an interview broadcast Thursday to explain what it has called serious concerns about his report. 
 In the interview on Al Jazeera, Mr. Goldstone, a South African jurist, said that the official American response to the 575-page report had been ambivalent. The Obama administration, he said, ''joined our recommendation calling for full and good-faith'' domestic investigations of the alleged crimes in both Israel and Gaza, ''but said that the report was flawed.''
 ''But I have yet to hear from the Obama administration what the flaws in the report that they have identified are,'' Mr. Goldstone said. ''I mean, I would be happy to respond to them, if and when I know what they are.'' 
 He added, ''Of course I'm concerned and would like to engage with the Obama administration, at least informally.'' 
 The report found evidence that some Israeli soldiers had intentionally killed Palestinian civilians during the three-week conflict in violation of the laws of war. It described the Israeli military assault on Gaza as ''a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability.'' 
 It also said there was evidence that the Palestinian militant rocket attacks on towns in southern Israel constituted war crimes. 
 The report's recommendations were officially endorsed last week by the Human Rights Council in Geneva, which has forwarded the document to the United NationsGeneral Assembly and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. The United States joined five European nations in voting against the resolution that endorsed the report, and Israeli officials have lobbied hard to discredit it.
 ''People generally don't like to be accused of criminal activity, so it didn't surprise me that there was criticism, even strong criticism, and it has come from both sides,'' Mr. Goldstone said in the interview. ''But I do regret the extremes to which some of the criticism has gone and the fact that it has been so personalized.''
 He then lashed out at his detractors, saying, ''I've no doubt, many of the critics -- I would say the overwhelmingly majority of the critics -- haven't read the report. And, you know, what proves that, I think, is the level of criticism doesn't go to the substance of the report. There still haven't been responses to the really serious allegations that are made.''
 Obama administration officials have made more detailed criticisms of the report, usually contending, as did Douglas M. Griffiths, the American delegate to the Human Rights Council, that it was unfair to Israel.
 Explaining his vote against endorsing the report, Mr. Griffiths said that, ''While Justice Goldstone acknowledged Hamas's crimes, in examining Israel's response sufficient weight was not given to the difficulties faced in fighting this kind of enemy in this environment.''

HEADLINE: Vote Backs a Financial Oversight Body

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT and STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House Financial Services Committee voted on Thursday to create an agency to protect consumers from predatory lending, deceptive credit card terms and other abuses.
 By a 39-to-29 vote, the panel moved regulatory legislation a crucial step forward on what was likely to be a long road toward final passage by the full Congress. President Obama, who has put financial regulation high on his domestic agenda, has said he wants a bill on his desk before the end of the year.
Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the committee, said after the vote that he was optimistic of final passage either late this year or early in 2010. Mr. Frank said he was confident that the pillars of the legislation would remain intact. 
 ''No bill I've ever had to share with anyone else has been everything I liked,'' Mr. Frank said, predicting that action in the House would create momentum in the Senate.
 The House panel also approved, by voice vote, a provision to impose new regulations for credit cards by Dec. 1, instead of mid-February, after Democratic members complained that lenders had been raising interest rates in anticipation of the legislation. 
 Mr. Obama immediately issued a statement lauding the committee action. ''This bill has now passed a major hurdle, and this step sends an important signal to the American people that we will not stand by and allow big financial firms and their lobbyists to mobilize against change,'' the president said. 
 ''They are doing what they always do -- descending on Congress, using every bit of influence they have to maintain the status quo that has maximized their profits at the expense of American consumers, despite the fact that recently those same American consumers bailed them out as a consequence of the bad decisions that they made.''
 Later, the White House issued a statement calling passage of the bill by year's end essential. ''And we think a central part of regulatory reform is a consumer finance protection agency that looks out for, in all of this, normal, everyday consumers,'' said Robert Gibbs, the president's chief spokesman.
 Mr. Gibbs said he understood that Senators Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the chairman and ranking Republican, respectively, of the Senate Banking Committee, were working ''quickly and expeditiously to ensure financial regulatory reform is something that happens and is written into law.''
 The House committee vote on creating a consumer financial protection agency was mostly along party lines. Two Democrats voted against the measure (Travis Childers of Mississippi and Walt Minnick of Idaho) and one Republican voted for it (Michael N. Castle of Delaware).
 The vote came a day after the committee voted to give the federal government the power to block states from regulating large national banks in some circumstances. That vote came after committee members reached a compromise on how much authority state regulators should have.
 The Obama administration opposed any efforts by the federal government to pre-empt state officials from imposing more rigorous banking standards. A group of Democrats with close ties to the banking industry sought a complete federal pre-emption, which would have the effect of sharply limiting any state regulation of banks. 
 Under the compromise offered by two House Democrats, Melvin Watt of North Carolina and Dennis Moore of Kansas, and approved by voice vote, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, would be able to override the states, but only if it found that the state law ''significantly'' interfered with federal regulatory policies.
 On another issue that has been hotly debated for months, the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday approved a measure to regulate derivatives, the arcane financial instruments that have been linked to the current financial crisis. The Financial Services Committee approved a similar measure last week. (The agriculture panel has jurisdiction because many derivatives involve trading in farm commodities.)

HEADLINE: The Chinese Disconnect

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Senior monetary officials usually talk in code. So when Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, spoke recently about Asia, international imbalances and the financial crisis, he didn't specifically criticize China's outrageous currency policy.
 But he didn't have to: everyone got the subtext. China's bad behavior is posing a growing threat to the rest of the world economy. The only question now is what the world -- and, in particular, the United States -- will do about it.
 Some background: The value of China's currency, unlike, say, the value of the British pound, isn't determined by supply and demand. Instead, Chinese authorities enforced that target by buying or selling their currency in the foreign exchange market -- a policy made possible by restrictions on the ability of private investors to move their money either into or out of the country. 
 There's nothing necessarily wrong with such a policy, especially in a still poor country whose financial system might all too easily be destabilized by volatile flows of hot money. In fact, the system served China well during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. The crucial question, however, is whether the target value of the yuan is reasonable. 
 Until around 2001, you could argue that it was: China's overall trade position wasn't too far out of balance. From then onward, however, the policy of keeping the yuan-dollar rate fixed came to look increasingly bizarre. First of all, the dollar slid in value, especially against the euro, so that by keeping the yuan/dollar rate fixed, Chinese officials were, in effect, devaluing their currency against everyone else's. Meanwhile, productivity in China's export industries soared; combined with the de facto devaluation, this made Chinese goods extremely cheap on world markets.
 The result was a huge Chinese trade surplus. If supply and demand had been allowed to prevail, the value of China's currency would have risen sharply. But Chinese authorities didn't let it rise. They kept it down by selling vast quantities of the currency, acquiring in return an enormous hoard of foreign assets, mostly in dollars, currently worth about $2.1 trillion.
 Many economists, myself included, believe that China's asset-buying spree helped inflate the housing bubble, setting the stage for the global financial crisis. But China's insistence on keeping the yuan/dollar rate fixed, even when the dollar declines, may be doing even more harm now.
 Although there has been a lot of doomsaying about the falling dollar, that decline is actually both natural and desirable. America needs a weaker dollar to help reduce its trade deficit, and it's getting that weaker dollar as nervous investors, who flocked into the presumed safety of U.S. debt at the peak of the crisis, have started putting their money to work elsewhere. 
 But China has been keeping its currency pegged to the dollar -- which means that a country with a huge trade surplus and a rapidly recovering economy, a country whose currency should be rising in value, is in effect engineering a large devaluation instead.
 And that's a particularly bad thing to do at a time when the world economy remains deeply depressed due to inadequate overall demand. By pursuing a weak-currency policy, China is siphoning some of that inadequate demand away from other nations, which is hurting growth almost everywhere. The biggest victims, by the way, are probably workers in other poor countries. In normal times, I'd be among the first to reject claims that China is stealing other peoples' jobs, but right now it's the simple truth. 
 So what are we going to do?
 U.S. officials have been extremely cautious about confronting the China problem, to such an extent that last week the Treasury Department, while expressing ''concerns,'' certified in a required report to Congress that China is not -- repeat not -- manipulating its currency. They're kidding, right?
 The thing is, right now this caution makes little sense. Suppose the Chinese were to do what Wall Street and Washington seem to fear and start selling some of their dollar hoard. Under current conditions, this would actually help the U.S. economy by making our exports more competitive. 
 In fact, some countries, most notably Switzerland, have been trying to support their economies by selling their own currencies on the foreign exchange market. The United States, mainly for diplomatic reasons, can't do this; but if the Chinese decide to do it on our behalf, we should send them a thank-you note.
 The point is that with the world economy still in a precarious state, beggar-thy-neighbor policies by major players can't be tolerated. Something must be done about China's currency.

HEADLINE: North Carolina Delays Release of Inmates

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
Dozens of violent prisoners serving life sentences in North Carolina since the 1970s will not be released until a new legal issue raised by the governor's staff is resolved, Gov. Bev Purdue announced Thursday. 
 Three weeks ago, the State Supreme Court found that at the time the prisoners were sentenced, a life sentence was defined as 80 years. Many of the prisoners had been given time off for good behavior, reducing their sentences by as much as half.
 But the law allowing time off for good behavior did not go into effect until 1981 and was not retroactive, said Chrissy Pearson, a spokeswoman for Governor Perdue, who is on an economic development trip to China. In 1983, the head of the Department of Correction made an internal policy change that in effect made the policy retroactive, Ms. Pearson said.
 ''There is real question whether the General Assembly intended for the D.O.C. to have that kind of authority,'' Ms. Perdue said in a written statement, referring to the Corrections Department.
 Ms. Pearson said the issue would be raised in court.
 Twenty of the inmates affected by the ruling were to be released next week, and more than 100 others were scheduled to be freed over the next several years. 
 Thomas Maher, the director of the state's indigent defense program, could not be reached for comment, but has said that the good behavior credits encouraged prisoners to ''engage in productive behavior'' and that blocking release now would be ''grossly unfair.''
 A life sentence is North Carolina is no longer defined as 80 years.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Environmental Record: Grand Plans and Small Steps Forward

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
He has dreamed of windmills atop skyscrapers, planted magnolia trees with Bette Midler and basked in the effusive praise of Al Gore. 
 More than any mayor before him, Michael R. Bloomberg has made the environment a central theme in his vision of urban life -- a surprising turn for a man who is a billionaire known mainly for his business savvy when he came into office.
 Along with education, Mr. Bloomberg said that his environmental efforts were what he would like to be remembered for.
 There is no question that the mayor has brought attention and zeal to the issue. But despite many small steps forward, the biggest pieces of his agenda have either failed to win approval or are still awaiting action. 
 Trash and Recycling
 The mayor can claim modest success in reducing the pollution and congestion generated by the transportation of the roughly 12,000 tons of residential trash the city collects every day.
 Since 2006, the city has relied more heavily on trains and barges, rather than trucks, to move collected trash to disposal destinations. To address the disproportionate number of garbage removal operations in poorer communities, the city also made each borough responsible for its own trash by requiring new waste transfer stations. 
 On recycling, the record is not as good. The city recycles about 16 percent of its residential trash, falling short of the 25 percent goal specified in its recycling law. That is also less than other cities, though Bloomberg administration officials said such comparisons were not appropriate because the city has so many large multifamily buildings, making recycling more difficult. 
 The City Council has also had to overcome the mayor's opposition when pushing for more recycling. The Council restored funding for residential recycling when Mr. Bloomberg cut the program's budget, and it overrode the mayor's veto of a bill mandating the recycling of electronic waste.
 Vision
 Asked to name Mr. Bloomberg's biggest achievement, most environmentalists point not to something concrete but to his long-term vision and his use of the bully pulpit to raise awareness about the environment. 
 He has set up a panel to come up with strategies to help the city adapt to the effects of climate change, painted rooftops white with Mr. Gore to keep buildings cooler, testified in Washington on carbon emissions, and plans to travel to Copenhagen in December for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.
 On Thursday, he announced that he would expand the city's green economic sector by using city and federal stimulus money for training and investment in renewable energy and other environmental sources of jobs.
 Steve Howard, founder of the Climate Group, a London-based organization pushing for an international agreement on climate change, called Mr. Bloomberg ''a rock star mayor'' for putting his environmental plan ''in the DNA of government.''
 It wasn't always this way. James F. Gennaro, chairman of the City Council's Committee on Environmental Protection, recalled, ''We had to impress upon the administration to get certain environmental bills done.''
 Then came PlaNYC, the environmental blueprint Mr. Bloomberg unveiled on Earth Day 2007, which included more than a hundred initiatives for a greener city.
 ''Clearly, in the fall of 2006 Mayor Bloomberg had an environmental apocalypse,'' Mr. Gennaro said. ''Something inspired him.''
 It was not an epiphany, but federal census data that prompted the mayor to act, aides said. The numbers suggested that the city would grow by a million residents by 2030, which would lead to heavier traffic and more use of electricity at the same time that the city would be grappling with floods and other effects of climate change.
 In a recent interview, Mr. Bloomberg said he was urged by aides like Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor, and Rohit T. Aggarwala, director of the Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability, to elevate the environment on his agenda. He followed their advice because, he said, ''it is the air we breathe, it is our economy and I have two daughters. I'd like them to live in a planet that's not falling apart.''
 The challenge, Mr. Bloomberg said, has been to persuade residents to support long-term changes though they may never live to see the benefits of them. To showcase more incremental progress, his staff keeps track of every milestone, no matter how small. 
 New Yorkers who log on to the city's Web site, nyc.gov, will learn that about 250,000 new trees have been planted, 200 miles of bicycle lanes have been added, and the city's greenhouse gas emissions dropped 3.5 percent last year. 
 The mayor also established the Office of Environmental Remediation to clean up moderately contaminated sites known as brownfields that are not covered by state or federal Superfund programs.
 But weightier initiatives are still in the making to meet the PlaNYC goal of reducing the city's emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to global warming, by 30 percent by 2030.
 ''The record is not perfect, but it certainly contains more pluses than minuses,'' said Eric Goldstein, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. ''Over all, the compass on environmental issues is pointed in the right direction.''
 Energy Efficiency
 In April, Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, proposed a package of bills that would reduce the city's carbon footprint by requiring that large buildings be upgraded to improve their energy efficiency.
 If passed, New York would go further than most cities, which have generally imposed such requirements only on new construction. New York would require the owners of existing buildings to undertake energy audits and upgrade everything from boilers to light bulbs. 
 The proposal has met with opposition from the real estate industry, however, and is not expected to be taken up by the Council until after the election.
 Mr. Bloomberg has won praise for jump-starting the effort by devoting 10 percent of the electricity bill of city-owned buildings to energy-saving upgrades. (This works out to $80 million to $100 million a year.) Among the most pleased are labor representatives, who say the renovations mean jobs -- work for electricians, insulation workers, energy auditors and others.
 ''It allows the city to lead by example and lower energy costs,'' said Joanne Derwin, director of Urban Agenda and chairwoman of the NYC Apollo Alliance.
 Traffic and Air Pollution
 Congestion pricing was the mayor's most ambitious environmental proposal, and its defeat his biggest setback. 
 In 2007, he put forth the plan to ease traffic and air pollution by imposing an $8 fee on cars entering the busiest part of Manhattan on weekdays. But the plan required approval from the State Legislature, no friend of the mayor's, and failed to gather much support in Albany. The mayor blamed legislators who were ''worried about what constituents would say.'' 
 But legislators and policy analysts said congestion pricing failed partly because of the mayor's dismissive attitude toward lawmakers and his heavy-handedness in doling out money to supporters of his ideas. 
 One of the chief opponents, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said congestion pricing lost on the merits. He opposed it, he said, because the fee would burden lower-income drivers as well as the subways and buses that would have had to make room for the drivers who stopped using their cars.
 But Mr. Brodsky also said that the mayor did not help himself. ''In the end, for all his charm and intelligence, there's a take-it-or-leave-it quality to how he deals with other institutions that has not served him well,'' he said. ''When it's decision time, he brooks no opposition.''
 Mr. Bloomberg has had more success with smaller gestures. He has established more than a dozen car-free pedestrian plazas, including one in Times Square and another in Herald Square, and added bike lanes throughout the five boroughs. 
 And while his ban on smoking in bars and small restaurants in his first term was primarily a public health measure, it also helped foster cleaner air.
 Development
 Mr. Bloomberg's fondness for development, including the building of high-rise towers, is well established, and he has rezoned a huge swath of the city to spur new construction. His aides said that he has consistently linked environmental improvement to economic projects. 
 At the community level, however, there are concerns that Mr. Bloomberg pushes for economic growth at the expense of livable neighborhoods. 
 On the West Side of Manhattan and in the Bronx, Mr. Bloomberg's advocacy of sports stadiums as economic engines drew opposition from residents concerned about traffic and the loss of parkland. In Brooklyn, the mayor argued that a proposed listing of the contaminated Gowanus Canal as a federal Superfund site would slow down a cleanup, but some suspect that he is more worried that the designation would discourage developers from pursuing projects along the canal's banks.
 Geoffrey Croft, president of NYC Park Advocates, a watchdog group, cited delays in restoring the 22 acres of parks lost to Yankee Stadium and the city's widespread use of artificial turf to replace grass in its sports fields as evidence that Mr. Bloomberg is no environmentalist. 
 ''He's gotten a free ride,'' Mr. Croft said. ''It's really about P.R.''
 Peggy M. Shepard, executive director of We Act for Environmental Justice, a Harlem-based organization focused on environmental issues affecting low-income communities, did not go as far, but she said that Mr. Bloomberg had sometimes neglected the people who needed environmental improvement the most. The green building package of bills, she noted, would not cover the smaller buildings that are fouling the air in many neighborhoods by using low-grade heating oil. 
 ''He's been great with macro stuff, but the micro stuff of how we live does not improve in some neighborhoods,'' she said. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said trade-offs are inevitable -- ''Do you want a teacher or recycling?'' he asked -- and is unapologetic about promoting more development as a source of jobs, housing and other needs. 
 If re-elected, he said, he would stay the course.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Chicanery

 BODY:
Congress blundered badly when it gave the credit card industry as long as 15 months to phase out the deceptive and predatory practices that were outlawed in a new law enacted in May. 
 Instead of backing away from exploitation, credit card companies have intensified it. For starters, they have driven up already outrageous interest rates by an industrywide average of about 20 percent, according to a report scheduled to be released next week from the Pew Charitable Trusts' Safe Credit Cards Project. The companies also have used sleight of hand to more than double rates on customers who spent prudently and paid their bills on time.
 The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act would end a great many odious practices. The companies, for example, could no longer deluge broke and unemployed teenagers with credit cards, driving them deeply into debt that they have no way of paying off. Credit card companies will have to verify the young person's ability to pay or get a signature from a responsible adult before credit is issued. 
 The law prohibits arbitrary rate increases, penalties for customers who are late paying an unrelated bill -- known as universal default -- and the all-too-common scams in which companies charge cardholders new interest on debts that they have paid a month or two earlier and rig due dates so that payments are late by definition and subject to a hefty penalty. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, acknowledged recently that moving up the effective date to Dec. 1 would allow consumers to get benefits and protections sooner. But he also expressed misgivings that the move might be difficult for companies that need to create new billing and accounting systems, along with other changes.
 Mr. Bernanke's opinion will hold less sway in the House than in the Senate, where lawmakers are notoriously deferential to regulators and to the banks and credit card companies whose biddings those regulators so often do. But pressure for action in this matter is clearly building in the House and among the voters, who have grown weary of being gouged, especially at a time when many of them are having trouble feeding and housing their families. 
 In any case, it is time that Congress looked out less for the credit card companies and more for American consumers. That means passing bills in Congress that would move up the effective date of the credit card law.

HEADLINE: Delta and Some Other American Carriers Continue Slump

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines posted a third-quarter net loss Thursday, joining other large American carriers, as tumbling passenger revenue during the recession offset benefits from lower fuel prices.
 US Airways Group, the sixth-largest airline by traffic, reported a net loss, while JetBlue Airways and Alaska Air Group posted profits. 
 The reports capped a quarter in which all six of the biggest domestic airlines fared better than analysts had projected. Industry executives tempered their comments on whether the worst of the travel slump has ended while signaling hope for a recovery. Airline shares pared earlier declines as broader indexes rose.
 The net loss at Delta, the world's largest airline, widened to $161 million, or 19 cents a share, from a year-earlier loss of $50 million, or 13 cents. Excluding some costs for severance and the 2008 purchase of Northwest Airlines, Delta beat analysts' estimates with a profit of 6 cents a share.
 Analysts projected an operating loss of 29 cents for the current quarter, based on the average of 10 estimates. Delta said it was reducing seating capacity on its main jet operations by as much as 11 percent, with a reduction of up to 16 percent on overseas routes. A 1.5 percent drop in September traffic for the six biggest American airlines was their smallest in 14 months. Adjusted results for the group -- including American Airlines' parent, AMR Corporation; United Airlines' owner, UAL Corporation; Continental Airlines; and Southwest Airlines -- exceeded analysts' estimates. Including Delta, their collective loss excluding some costs was $362 million.
 Delta was among airlines relying on keeping fares low to lure vacationers, which contributed to a 21 percent drop in revenue to $7.57 billion. US Airways' loss narrowed to $80 million, or 60 cents a share, from a loss of $866 million, or $8.46, a year earlier. Excluding costs and gains related to aircraft and fuel purchase contracts, the loss was 83 cents, less than a 93-cent average loss from nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 17 percent, to $2.72 billion.
 JetBlue reported earnings of $15 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $8 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier. The adjusted profit was 4 cents a share, trailing the 5-cent average among 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue fell 5.3 percent to $854 million, JetBlue said.
 Alaska had a profit of $87.6 million, or $2.46 a share, compared with a loss of $86.5 million, or $2.40. Sales dropped 9.2 percent to $967.4 million, the carrier said.
 Excluding aircraft and fuel contract costs, Alaska had income of $2.33 a share, better than the $2.29 average of nine analysts' estimates.

HEADLINE: Seeking One Voice Where Many Talk

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
''Who Speaks for Islam?,'' the title of a two-part series beginning on Sunday on Link TV, is a benign case of bait and switch. The answer to the question, we're told, is that no one speaks for Islam -- it is too vast and diverse, spreading across too many countries and cultures, to have a single, authoritative voice.
 As the Middle East analyst Reza Aslan puts it, Americans are looking for a ''united voice of condemnation'' of militant violence -- a representative of the world's Muslims who will unequivocally say the things they want to hear -- but ''there is no such person in Islam.'' The voices that fill the void are those of the militants, simply because they're loudest. 
 To hear the voices of Mr. Aslan and Dalia Mogahed, the two scholars interviewed by Ray Suarez in ''What a Billion Muslims Really Think,'' the program's first hour, might take some doing. Link TV exists as a freestanding network only on the Dish and DirecTV satellite systems. Various community cable channels carry pieces of its programming; in New York CUNY TV will rebroadcast ''Think'' at various times on Monday. It will also be streamed at linktv.org.
 This is not big-budget television. Both parts of ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' consist of Mr. Suarez and his interviewees at a table, Bill Moyers-style, talking for the better part of an hour. The program makes up for what it lacks in field reports and fancy graphics with a density of information, but viewers unaccustomed to broadcasting this high-minded may find themselves reaching for the remote.
 They also may find themselves unpersuaded. The program grew out of ''Who Speaks for Islam? What a Billion Muslims Really Think,'' a 2008 book written by Ms. Mogahed and John L. Esposito, which was in turn based on a continuing Gallup poll of hundreds of thousands of Muslims worldwide. Time is spent reciting and analyzing poll data showing that majorities of Muslims in many countries abhor violence against civilians and support democracy and free speech. 
 These results are presented as rebuttals of Western misconceptions, but there's a sensation here of two worlds talking past each other. You can imagine more than a few non-Islamic American viewers saying: Sure, most Muslims are as moderate as I am. But I don't really care about that as long as there are some Muslims who'd like to kill me.
 Mr. Suarez, a veteran public television and radio correspondent, lets Mr. Aslan and Ms. Mogahed (Americans of Iranian and Egyptian birth) pretty much have their way when it comes to the sources of Muslim militancy; their contention that it's more a product of Middle Eastern politics and economics than of religion is convincing. He pushes harder in two areas -- the place of women in Islam, and the furor over the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad -- where their explanations become convoluted and begin to sound like rationalizations.
 ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' concludes on Nov. 1 on Link TV (and Nov. 2 on CUNY TV) with a second hourlong discussion, ''Muslims on Screen,'' in which Mr. Suarez talks to Howard Gordon, an executive producer of ''24,'' as well as several Muslim Americans working in show business about depictions of Muslims and Arabs in Western pop culture. Mr. Gordon, asked about the prevalence of Muslim characters as terrorists on his television show, points out in his own defense that the bad guys in the most recent season were based on Blackwater Worldwide, the American private security company now known as Xe Services.

HEADLINE: ARIZONA MAY PUT ALL STATE PRISONS IN PRIVATE HANDS

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: FLORENCE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
One of the newest residents on Arizona's death row, a convicted serial killer named Dale Hausner, poked his head up from his television to look at several visitors strolling by, each of whom wore face masks and vests to protect against the sharp homemade objects that often are propelled from the cells of the condemned. 
 It is a dangerous place to patrol, and Arizona spends $4.7 million each year to house inmates like Mr. Hausner in a super-maximum-security prison. But in a first in the criminal justice world, the state's death row inmates could become the responsibility of a private company.
 State officials will soon seek bids from private companies for 9 of the state's 10 prison complexes that house roughly 40,000 inmates, including the 127 here on death row. It is the first effort by a state to put its entire prison system under private control. 
 The privatization effort, both in its breadth and its financial goals, demonstrates what states around the country -- broke, desperate and often overburdened with prisoners and their associated costs -- are willing to do to balance the books. Arizona officials hope the effort will put a $100 million dent in the state's roughly $2 billion budget shortfall.
 ''Let's not kid ourselves,'' said State Representative Andy Biggs, a Republican who supports private prisons. ''If we were not in this economic environment, I don't think we'd be talking about this with the same sense of urgency.''
 Private prison companies generally build facilities for a state, then charge them per prisoner to run them. But under the Arizona legislation, a vendor would pay $100 million up front to operate one or more prison complexes. Assuming the company could operate the prisons more cheaply or efficiently than the state, any savings would be equally divided between the state and the private firm.
 The privatization move has raised questions -- including among some people who work for private prison companies -- about the private sector's ability to handle the state's most hardened criminals. While executions would still be performed by the state, officials said, the Department of Corrections would relinquish all other day-to-day operations to the private operator and pay a per-diem fee for each prisoner.
 ''I would not want to be the warden of death row,'' said Todd Thomas, the warden of a prison in Eloy, Ariz., run by the Corrections Corporation of America. The company, the country's largest private prison operator, has six prisons in Arizona with inmates from other states. 
 ''That's not to say we couldn't,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But the liability is too great. I don't think any private entity would ever want to do that.''
 James Austin, a co-author of a Department of Justice study in 2001 on prison privatization and president of the JFA Institute, a corrections consulting firm, said private companies tended to oversee minimum- and medium-security inmates and had little experience with the most dangerous prisoners. 
 ''As for death row,'' Mr. Austin said, ''it is a very visible entity, and if something bad happens there, you will have a pretty big news story for the Legislature and governor to explain.'' 
 Arizona is no stranger to private prisons or, for that matter, aggressive privatization efforts (recently, the state put up for sale several government buildings housing executive branch offices in Phoenix). Nearly 30 percent of the state's prisoners are being held in prisons operated by private companies outside the state's 10 complexes.
 In addition, other states, including Alaska and Hawaii, have contracts with private companies like Corrections Corporation of America to house their prisoners in Arizona.
 For advocates of prison privatization, the push here breathes a bit of life into a movement that has been on the decline across the country as cost savings from prison privatizations have often failed to materialize, corrections officers unions have resisted the efforts and high-profile problems in privately run facilities have drawn unwanted publicity
 ''We have private prisons in Arizona already, and we are very happy with the performance and the savings we get from them,'' said Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and an architect of the new legislation authorizing the privatization. ''I think that they are the future of corrections in Arizona.'' 
 Under the legislation, any bidder would have to take an entire complex -- many of them mazes of multiple levels of security risks and complexity -- and would not be permitted to pick off the cheapest or easiest buildings and inmates. The state also wants to privatize prisoners' medical care. 
 Louise Grant, a spokeswoman for Corrections Corporation of America, said the high-security prisoners would be well within the company's management capabilities. ''We expect we will be there to make a proposal to the state'' for at least some of its complexes up for bid, Ms. Grant said.
 In pure financial terms, it is not clear how well the state would make out with the privatization. The 2001 study for the Department of Justice found that private prisons saved most states little money (there has been no equivalent study since). Indeed, many states, struggling to keep up with the cost of corrections, have closed prisons when possible, and sought changes in sentencing to reduce crowding in the last two years.
 As tough sentencing laws and the ensuing increase in prisoners began to press on state resources in the 1980s, private prison companies attracted some states with promises of lower costs. The private prison boom lasted into the 1990s. Throughout the years, there have been high-profile riots, escapes and other violent incidents. The companies also do not generally provide the same wages and benefits as states, which has resulted in resistance from unions and concerns that the private prisons attract less-qualified workers.
 Then the federal government stepped in, with a surge of new immigrant prisoners, and began to contract with the private companies. The number of federal prisoners in private prisons in the United States has more than doubled, to 32,712 in 2008 from 15,524 in 2000. The number of state prisoners in privately run prisons has increased to 93,500 from 75,000 in that time.
 With bad economic times again driving many decisions about state resources, other states are sure to watch Arizona's experiment closely. 
 ''There simply isn't the money to keep these people incarcerated, and the alternative is to free many of them or lower cost,'' said Ron Utt, a senior research fellow for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group whose work for privatization was cited by one Arizona lawmaker.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Agrees to Deadline in '11 for Setting Rules on Mercury Emissions

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency, resolving a lawsuit aimed at cutting the flow of mercury and other toxic substances from coal- or oil-burning power plants, has agreed to develop standards by late 2011 for limiting such emissions. 
 Environmental and public health groups that had sued the agency in pursuit of a deadline for issuing the standards said the agreement set the stage for closing longstanding gaps, which persisted through the Clinton and Bush administrations, in clean-air rules for power plants.
 But groups representing the energy industry and companies that require large amounts of electricity warned of higher energy bills and predicted more litigation when the rules emerge.
 According to the E.P.A., American power plants emit close to 50 tons of mercury a year, about a third of the nation's total emissions of the metal, along with traces of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, dioxins and other toxic substances. 
 Under the new agreement, made final in a consent decree issued late Thursday by the Federal District Court in Washington, the deadline for setting standards limiting those substances is Nov. 16, 2011.
 John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of a dozen groups involved in the litigation, said that as of last December, when the suit was filed, only 28 percent of the coal-burning power plants in the United States had basic scrubbers for such pollution, which he called ''a two-decade-old technology.'' 
 Mr. Walke said big cuts in these emissions would have substantial economic benefits, because tiny particles of toxic pollution have been linked to a variety of health problems, including an increased incidence of heart disease and strokes. 
 This week the National Academy of Sciencesreported that the annual cost of health damage related to emissions from coal and oil burning totaled about $120 billion in the United States, with half of that coming from coal.
 Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a group representing the energy industry, said the industry had been steadily reducing emissions for 20 years. Mr. Segal warned that speeding the process could raise electricity costs and push more manufacturing overseas, simply moving pollution instead of cutting it.

HEADLINE: Breaking Down Savings

BYLINE: By ANNE UNDERWOOD

 BODY:
Arthur Ullian is president of the National Council on Spinal Cord Injury and co-author of a coming analysis in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the economic benefits of a health care overhaul. Mr. Ullian spoke with Anne Underwood, a freelance writer, and the following is an excerpt: 
 QUESTION. The Congressional Budget Office projects costs of around $800 billion over 10 years for the Senate Finance Committee bill.
 ANSWER. It's not sustainable. But that's because no one is taking into account the health improvements that will result from covering millions of the uninsured. 
 Q. How does that help?
 A. There are two parts to this theory. The first relates to the expansion of the labor force as a result of improved health, stemming from health care reform and advances in medicine. ... We project that by 2020 there will be an additional 8.5 million workers over age 65. The increased tax revenues would add $312 billion to the U.S. Treasury in 2020 alone.
 The second part comes from Medicare savings. By providing the uninsured access to health care, millions of people will reach the Medicare eligibility age healthier than they do now, spending fewer Medicare dollars. We project that by 2020 the savings will be $242 billion. By 2030, they will be $530 billion. 
 Q. Combining the two factors -- the revenue from taxes plus the savings to Medicare -- are you saying that a health overhaul becomes revenue-neutral?
 A. The added revenue plus savings add up to $554 billion in 2020, or $1.457 trillion in 2030. That's way in excess of the estimated costs of health reform

HEADLINE: Downturn Opens Doors for Some Low-Cost Airlines

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Two and a half years after the low-fare airline Ryanair's chief first dangled the idea of cheap flights between London and New York -- with some tickets selling for as little as $10 -- no viable low-cost airline has taken wing across the Atlantic.
 But the financial problems facing long-established carriers may be changing the calculation. Jet leasing costs are falling as the full-service airlines increasingly idle jets. And large numbers of pilots, flight attendants and ground staff are looking for work.
 Two European low-cost operators have recently announced plans to start international service next year, seizing what they see as a prime opportunity. Meanwhile, more passengers are scouring the Internet for the cheapest fares, for business and leisure travel. 
 ''From the point of view of the supply side, it is a good time'' because established airlines ''are having enough troubles of their own that they can't devote the resources to try and run these kinds of competitors out of business,'' said Peter Morris, chief economist with Ascend, an aviation industry consultant in London. ''On the demand side, clearly the market is weak.''
 For more than a decade, both business travelers and backpackers have embraced the concept of no-frills transport over relatively short distances, like Paris to Pisa, Charlotte to Chicago, or Bangkok to Bali.
 But when it comes to longer distances, cheap air travel has always been a more difficult proposition, mainly for reasons of cost and logistics -- not to mention passenger comfort.
 So far, the only region where the low-cost, long-distance business model has truly taken off has been the so-called backpacker routes connecting Asia and Australia. Over the last couple of years, several airlines -- including Air Asia X, a unit of the Malaysian budget carrier Air Asia; Tiger Airways, 49 percent owned by Singapore Airlines; and Jetstar, a Qantas subsidiary -- have built up sizable networks, drawing on the brand familiarity -- and deep pockets -- of their parent companies. 
 Flying long distances on a low-cost carrier can mean savings of 50 percent or more in economy class compared with the fares charged by a conventional airline, but the ticket buys little other than a seat -- and not much leg room. Airlines will usually allow passengers to take a single carry-on bag, but checked luggage is subjected to extra fees. Passengers can choose to buy meals on board or bring their own, while extras like in-flight entertainment are similarly subject to additional charges. Those with checked luggage and a connecting flight usually have to recheck the bag at the transfer airport themselves.
 Some Asian low-cost airlines have tried to make the jump to Europe and North America, but few have succeeded.
 Oasis Hong Kong Airlines survived just 17 months in operation flying to London and Vancouver, before it collapsed late last year. 
 Air Asia X began offering five direct flights a week from Kuala Lumpur to Stansted Airport in London in March, and has said it expects to keep at least 75 percent of the seats on its Airbus A340s filled. This month, Air Asia X won French government approval to fly to Orly Airport in Paris, suggesting that demand is strong enough to justify further expansion.
 ''The challenges for low-cost airlines are the same as they have always been, but the fact that Air Asia X has been able to make a go of it has changed things,'' said David Bentley, a managing director at Big Pond Aviation, a low-cost consultant in Manchester.
 Feel Air, a Norwegian start-up that plans to begin low-cost services from Oslo and Stockholm to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and Bangkok International Airport next spring, is one of the companies convinced that the economic crisis will play in its favor.
 ''A downturn is actually a really good time to start an airline,'' said Feel Air's chief executive, Kai Holmberg. ''We regard the risk as much less now than some years ago.''
 Lease rates on wide-body jets like the Airbus A330 have fallen by almost 20 percent in the last 12 months, Mr. Holmberg said, and jet fuel prices, while still high, are well off their 2008 peak. Scandinavian Airlines, Feel Air's only local long-distance competitor, is saddled with losses and retrenching deeply.
 ''We do not see this as a crisis,'' Mr. Holmberg said. ''One man's loss is another's gain.''
 Iceland Express, an established low-cost operator that already flies between Reykjavik and more than a dozen cities in continental Europe, has said it will start a trans-Atlantic service to Newark Liberty International Airport in June. The carrier will use its base in Reykjavik to enable connections to Newark from several cities, including London, Berlin and Warsaw, at fares that will be 30 to 40 percent cheaper than Icelandair, which already flies similar routes.
 ''People are more price sensitive than in the past,'' said Matthias Imsland, chief executive of Iceland Express. ''We will compete on price but offer quality as well.''
 But analysts said the operating challenges for low-cost carriers were the same as they had always been.
 Those include the fact that it is almost impossible for an airline to recoup its operating costs by filling a 300-seat plane -- which burns as much fuel and pays the same airport taxes and fees as a conventional airline -- with cheap economy-class tickets.
 ''If you give up on the premium seats, you stand to lose an awful lot of money,'' said Mr. Morris of Ascend. ''Even when first and business class make up just 20 percent of the seats in the aircraft, they still generate more than 50 percent of the revenue.''
 Most of the successful long-distance, low-cost airlines operating today, including Air Asia X, do offer a small number of premium-economy and business-class seats on their planes to subsidize their cheaper fares. But even then, the logistics of long-distance airlines mean that an airline is not able to make as many flights a day, limiting the ability to make up in volume some of what it gives up on the ticket price.
 Stephen McNamara, a spokesman for Ryanair, said service across the Atlantic Ocean was still on the airline's agenda, but conceded that it was unlikely for another three to four years. The airline, which had originally envisioned a start in 2010, says the prices of Boeing and Airbus wide-body jets are still too high.
 ''We had expected the bottom to fall out of the market for long-haul aircraft, but so far that hasn't happened,'' Mr. McNamara said.

A chart last Saturday with an article about Britain's growing national debt misstated the amount of the United States' debt. According to the International Monetary Fund, the American government's gross national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2005 was 61.4 percent and the projection for 2010 is 93.6 percent. The figures cited in the chart, 37.5 percent in 2005 and 61.1 percent in 2010, were from the Congressional Budget Office and included only federal debt held by the public.

HEADLINE: 65 and Up, Looking for Work

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
It is well known that during the nation's gale-force recession, many older Americans who dreamed of retirement continued to work, often because their 401(k)'s had plunged in value.
 In fact, there are more Americans 65 and older in the job market today than at any time in history, 6.6 million, compared with 4.1 million in 2001.
Less well known, though, is that nearly half a million workers 65 and older want to work but cannot find a job -- more than five times the level early this decade and this group's highest unemployment level since the Great Depression. 
 The situation is made more dire because of numerous recent trends: many people over 65 have lost their jobs as seniority protections have weakened, and like most other Americans, a higher percentage of them took on debt than in previous generations. 
 The expectation once was to pay off your 30-year mortgage before you retired, or come close. Instead, the level of indebtedness among older Americans has risen faster than in any other age group, partly because so many obtained second mortgages to take money out of their homes. 
 This financial squeeze is one reason President Obama has proposed giving a special $250 one-time payment to all Social Security recipients. 
 Many out-of-work older Americans complain that they face foreclosure or have had to give up their car.
 ''It's a big deal for a lot of these people not to find a job,'' said David Certner, legislative policy director for AARP. ''That so many of them are still trying to find work shows how bad the economic situation is. A lot of people normally give up at that age.''
 The unemployment rate for older Americans is still much better than for others -- 6.7 percent compared with 9.8 percent in the general population. But 6.7 percent is more than double the level of two years ago -- and far higher than the minuscule 1.9 percent rate early this decade. 
 And unemployed older workers stay out of work longer -- 36.5 weeks on average, 40 percent longer than for the unemployed in general.
 Patricia Warmhold, who has worked as a translator and telemarketer, would love to retire, but at age 67, she says that is out of the question. 
 Her mortgage payment is nearly $1,500 a month, and her car payments and auto insurance are another $350. She receives $1,071 a month in Social Security and $918 in pension. 
 ''I have very little after the mortgage,'' she said. 
 Ms. Warmhold, who speaks German, French and Creole, was laid off a year ago from her job as an interpreter for a law firm. ''I've been looking for jobs ever since,'' she said. ''I applied to Nassau County and Suffolk County, and they don't call back.'' 
 A divorce worsened her financial situation, although her mother, who is in her 90s, helps by sometimes sending her $100. 
 ''In a month's time, I sent out 101 job applications,'' she said, including more than 50 to school districts, to no avail.
 The recession has battered young, middle-aged and old, although several modern trends have left older workers more vulnerable than in the past -- for instance, the shift toward 401(k)'s and away from traditional pensions that give retirees a monthly stipend for life has pressured many Americans to continue working well past 60. 
 Another force pushing Americans to delay retirement is that the percentage of companies that provide health coverage to retirees is half what it was two decades ago. Moreover, the age to obtain full Social Security benefits has increased to at least 66 for people born after 1942, from its traditional 65.
 The median income for those 65 and over was just $18,208 in 2008 -- a quarter of them had incomes under $11,139, according to Patrick Purcell, an expert on older workers and pensions with the Congressional Research Service. 
 The average Social Security recipient age 65 and over receives just $12,437 in annual benefits, he said, and among individuals 65 and older who received income from financial assets, half received less than $1,542 last year.
 While Social Security keeps most seniors above the poverty line, there are a substantial number near poverty ''who are just getting by,'' said Richard W. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Many economists say it is good that Americans are working later in life -- many are living longer and able to contribute longer.
 Still, many older job seekers insist they are losing out because of age discrimination. Last year, nearly 25,000 workers filed age discrimination complaints, a 29 percent jump over 2007, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
 ''I often get told that I'm overqualified,'' said Barbara Brooks, 71, who retired in 2003 after 30 years as an administrative assistant at the University of California, Los Angeles. She said being told that is code language for ''you're too old.'' But Ms. Brooks said she wanted to work -- and needed to -- citing her monthly mortgage of $1,500, which eats up half her monthly pension.
 ''I would like to be able to treat myself to a couple of dinners, maybe a movie,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''I think as long as people have excellent skills, and they can get around like a 40-year-old -- I've been told I look 40 or 50 -- why shouldn't I work?''
 For years, unemployment among older Americans was largely ignored because so few of them were jobless. But now more than a million Americans over age 60 are unemployed, two-and-a-half times the level two years ago.
 And at least jobless workers 65 and over are guaranteed health coverage through Medicare. Workers laid off before that age often have to fend for themselves to obtain health insurance, which is often prohibitively expensive for those over 60.
 One such worker is Michael Husar, 62, a former engineering manager who spent 38 years with General Motors and then its Delphi auto parts spinoff. Mr. Husar, a resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., retired in 2003 at age 56, but as a result of Delphi's bankruptcy, he now has to purchase his own health insurance. He pays $1,600 a month, which translates to $19,200 a year.
 Despite two engineering degrees, his search for consulting work has come up empty in recent months.
 ''There are two reasons I feel a need to continue working,'' he said. ''One, I still have a lot to offer, and two, I need the money.'' 
 Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, says older workers have fared better by and large than younger workers in this recession. The percentage of workers ages 25 to 54 with jobs has fallen to 75 percent, from nearly 80 percent two years ago, while the percentage of older Americans with jobs has risen slightly, to 16.3 percent.
 But that is fewer than the number who want to work.
 Patricia Piazza, 66, who worked for Chrysler for 30 years as an analyst, knows that all too well. 
 She and her 72-year-old husband, a longtime employee at General Motors Acceptance Corporation, had planned to retire by now, but she is hunting for job, and he recently landed one with the local transit system. 
 Their home in Warren, Mich., has dropped $100,000 in value, Ms. Piazza said, while their pensions, as former nonunion employees, will be far less than anticipated because of the auto company bankruptcies. 
 Chrysler recently took away her life insurance policy and optical coverage, she said.
 ''It's like the bottom fell out of everything'' she said. ''This isn't the way we planned retirement.''

HEADLINE: Hawaii: Protesting School Closings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Angry parents are protesting the loss of education for their children on the first day of Hawaii's statewide public school closings. The parents rallied at the Capitol in Honolulu as 256 schools shut down to help balance the state budget. In all, 17 furlough days are planned for this year and next. Organizers said the demonstration was meant to show elected leaders that they should not make children suffer for a lack of economic planning. Many hope the government will either raise taxes or dip into emergency money to restore Hawaii's school year. The cuts give Hawaii the shortest school year in the country, at about 163 days, compared with 180 days in most other states.

HEADLINE: The Mismeasure Of Woman

BYLINE: By JOANNE LIPMAN. 
Joanne Lipman, a former deputy managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, was the founding editor in chief of Conde Nast Portfolio magazine.

 BODY:
FINALLY! I hear we're all living in a women's world now.
 For the first time, women make up half the work force. The Shriver Report, out just last week, found that mothers are the major breadwinners in 40 percent of families. We have a female speaker of the House and a female secretary of state. Thirty-two women have served as governors. Thirty-eight have served as senators. Four out of eight Ivy League presidents are women. 
 Great news, right? Well, not exactly. In fact, it couldn't be more spectacularly misleading.
 The truth is, women haven't come nearly as far as we would have predicted 25 years ago. Somewhere along the line, especially in recent years, progress for women has stalled. And attitudes have taken a giant leap backward. 
 I never expected that we would be in this predicament. My generation of professional women took equality for granted. When I was in college in the 1980s, many of us looked derisively at the women's liberation movement. That was something that strident, humorless, shrill women had done before us.
 We were sure we were beyond it. We were post-feminists. After all, we lived equally with men. We felt that when we took our place in society, issues of gender -- and race too -- wouldn't be a factor. 
 Back in college, my friends and I never even had a conversation about balancing work and family. We had never heard of glass ceilings. We didn't talk about sexual harassment -- that was just part of life. As a freshman, I had an interview for a magazine internship in New York City. As I sat down, making sure to demurely close up my slit-front skirt over my knees, the interviewer barked, ''If you want the job, you'll leave that open.''
 We felt the same way when we went to work. After graduation, when I first joined The Wall Street Journal, I could count the number of female reporters there on one hand. The tiny ladies' room was for guests. The paper was written by men, for men. It didn't even cover industries that were relatively female-friendly, like publishing, advertising and retailing. When the newspaper finally did introduce coverage of those sectors a few years later, most male reporters weren't interested. So we women stepped up. 
 Our corner of the newsroom was promptly dubbed the ''Valley of the Dolls.'' But we gained respect after one of our number won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting on the tobacco industry. Of course, when Hollywood made the movie about the investigation, her role was played by a man. 
 During these years, we were competing with men and we were winning. We learned to curse like truck drivers and work our sources as well as the next guy. We broke major stories. And we dressed the part, out-machoing the men with our truly tragic wardrobe choices -- boxy suits with giant shoulder pads and floppy bow ties.
 I was promoted to a Page One editor while I was pregnant. When my children were babies, my bosses allowed me to work mostly at home. Eventually, I became The Journal's first female deputy managing editor. By the time I left the paper in 2005, more than a third of the paper's editors were female. And when I moved on to create Portfolio for Conde Nast -- the magazine company best known for titles like Vanity Fair, Vogue and The New Yorker -- half of our top editors were female.
 And yet during the last few years, I couldn't help but notice that the situation for women as a whole wasn't improving, and was even getting worse. 
 Consider the facts: When I graduated from college in 1983, women earned only 64 cents for every dollar earned by a man. 
 Today? Women earn just 77 cents. By other measures, women's gains have stalled: board seats and corporate officer posts have been flat -- or declined in recent years.
 More proof: According to the American Bar Association, women in 2008 made up almost half of all associates, but only 18.3 percent of partners. Only 15 women run Fortune 500 companies. 
 I am still one of the few women to have run a major business magazine. My career was recently summed up in a New York magazine article as leggy.
 And I got off easy. During the presidential primaries, while the news media was on their best behavior to avoid racial stereotypes, it was still O.K. to discuss Hillary Clinton's ''cankles.''
 Even the positive numbers we've heard about during the recession are misleading -- the ones that seem to indicate that women have suffered fewer job losses than men. The reason? Women are still concentrated in lower-paying fields, rather than the high-paying industries like finance and real estate that were hardest hit.
 So why have we stalled out?
 Part of the reason can be traced to the aftermath of 9/11. 
 Everyone's life was reshaped by 9/11. Like many New Yorkers, I experienced that day in an intensely personal way: I was in the World Trade Center with a colleague when the first plane hit. And we were just outside the second tower, making our way through burning debris, hunks of airplane seats and far worse when the second plane came in directly over our heads.
 In the aftermath of the attacks, Americans pulled together. Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, famously declared it was ''the end of the age of irony.'' 
 He was right. 
 And then he was wrong. Because, as so often happens in the wake of a traumatic event, the pendulum swung to the other extreme. The war in Iraq tore America apart. The Internet gave everyone a soapbox. The louder, the more offensive, the better.
 I don't think it's a coincidence that exactly at this moment, women began losing ground -- and not just in measurable ways, like how many women make partner or get jobs as chief executives. 
 I'm referring to how we are perceived. The conversation online about women, as about so many other topics, degenerated from silly and snarky to just plain ugly -- and it seeped into the mainstream. 
 Recently, before a TV appearance, I did an Internet search on one of the interviewers so I could learn more about her -- and got a full page of results about her breasts. 
 This was hardly an isolated incident. Whether it's Keith Olbermann of MSNBC calling Michelle Malkin, the conservative blogger, ''a big mashed-up bag of meat with lipstick on it,'' or Glenn Beck of Fox News suggesting that ''ugly women'' are probably ''progressive as well,'' women these days are portrayed as either witches or bimbos, with pretty much no alternatives in between. 
 I've been puzzled by these screeds, which are so at odds with the real achievements documented in the Shriver Report and elsewhere. And then it struck me: Part of the reason we've lost our way, part of the reason my generation became complacent, is that many of us have been defining progress for women too narrowly. We've focused primarily on numbers at the expense of attitudes. 
 I've spent my adult life in business journalism, where we calculate success using hard facts and figures. Researchers have evaluated women's progress the same way. But in today's noisy world, that approach isn't enough. We've got to include popular perceptions in the equation as well. Progress in one area without the other is no progress at all. 
 This isn't simply a woman's issue; it affects us all. It isn't about blaming men, or about embracing feminism, which remains a toxic term for some women. Instead, it is up to all of us to help change the conversation. 
 How do we get to there from here?
 First, we can begin by telling girls to have confidence in themselves, to not always feel the need to be the passive ''good girl.'' In my time as an editor, many, many men have come through my door asking for a raise or demanding a promotion. Guess how many women have ever asked me for a promotion? 
 I'll tell you. Exactly ... zero.
 Sure, it's a risk to ask for a raise. But women need to take risks -- and to realize that at some point they will fail. This is an incredibly hard thing to do, especially for women brought up in a culture that celebrates unrealistic perfection in every sphere, from beauty to housekeeping. The biggest professional risk I ever took was leaving a secure job at The Wall Street Journal to create a business magazine at a company known for glossy fashion titles -- and that at a time when all print was struggling. 
 There were plenty of naysayers, and I got to see myself portrayed as both a witch and a bimbo, a twofer! But I believed in our mission.
 At the end of the day, Portfolio couldn't survive the economic collapse. Still, we had created a magazine we were proud of that provided a venue for talented writers and editors, many of them women who hadn't had that kind of chance to shine before in the macho world of financial journalism. 
 Which leads me to another piece of advice -- have a sense of humor. Believe me, it's needed. 
 Case in point: My favorite Christmas card ever came from Martha Stewart -- while she was in prison in West Virginia. It was beautiful, on heavy paper stock, and showed a gorgeous wreath. And on the inside, homey as could be, it was engraved with holiday wishes from ''Martha Stewart, Alderson, West Virginia.''
 One final suggestion: don't be afraid to be a girl.
 Women do have a different culture from men. And that can give us some tremendous advantages. Women are built to withstand hardship and pain. (Anyone who has given birth knows what I'm talking about.) That's a big benefit at a time like this, with the unemployment rate at 9.8 percent and rising.
 Women define success differently; for some it may be a career, for others the ability to stay home with children. They also define themselves differently. I'm in the unfortunate position of witnessing many friends and colleagues laid off over the past year. But the women are less apt to fall apart -- and this goes even for the primary breadwinners -- because they are less likely to define themselves by their job in the first place. 
 Certainly, when you look at the numbers, women have made tremendous strides over the past 25 years. But in the process, we lost sight of something important. After focusing for so long on better jobs and higher pay, maybe the best thing -- the enduring thing -- we can do is make sure respect is part of the equation too.
 If we can change the conversation about women, the numbers will finally add up. And that's what real progress looks like.

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes Climb 9.4%

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
More foreclosures are looming, unemployment is surging and the economy remains in the tank -- but home buyers are apparently undaunted.
 Sales of existing homes in September were at their highest level in more than two years, the National Association of Realtors reported Friday. Sales were up 9.4 percent from August, to a seasonally adjusted level of 5.57 million units.
 ''A blockbuster month,'' said Michael D. Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research. 
 In an encouraging sign for sellers, the number of homes on the market dropped significantly. Inventory fell to 7.8 months of supply, from 9.3 months in August. In September 2008, the supply was 10.1 months.
 Behind the impressive figures, however, lurk indications that the recovery may have trouble sustaining itself. 
 The agents' association attributed many September sales to people eager to take advantage of the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers before it expires next month. First-time buyers accounted for nearly half of the market during the last year, according to an association survey, a historically high level.
 Housing industry groups, including builders, lenders and agents, are lobbying to have the credit extended or even enhanced through at least next summer. They argue that the credit is not only providing crucial support to the housing industry at a fragile moment, but say it is literally helping clear up the wreckage from the downturn.
 In the foreclosure hot spot of Las Vegas, for instance, many of the former owners trashed their houses before abandoning them to the banks, said Forrest Barbee, who manages a thousand real estate agents for Prudential Americana Group. 
 ''Folks stripped out the appliances, put holes in the walls, removed the plumbing, killed the landscaping,'' said Mr. Barbee. ''It's sick and twisted to say there was anything good about that, but buyers are using their tax credit to make repairs. It's helping the local economy.''
 Nevertheless, the Obama administration seems lukewarm to an extension. The Housing and Urban Development secretary, Shaun Donovan, told the Senate Banking Committee this week that ''these proposals can be very expensive'' and that the end of the credit would not cause a ''catastrophic'' decline in the housing market.
 A new Treasury Department report showing widespread abuse of the credit by individuals who did not qualify for it will probably not help the case for renewal. The administration is expected to make a decision in the next few weeks.
 Some analysts were not that impressed by the September numbers. They noted that sales had been so weak during the last few years, and the range of government assistance programs so extensive, that it was surprising more homes were not sold.
 ''When you consider the hundreds of billions spent to prop up the housing market,'' Mark Hanson of the Field Check Group wrote in a research note, the improvement in sales was ''really not that great.'' 
 One of those things propping up the market has been the Federal Reserve, which has been buying mortgage-backed securities to keep interest rates low. As the Fed begins to wind down its purchases in the next few months, rates will become less enticing. Analysts expect them to rise to at least 6 percent from the current 5 percent.
 Nearly a third of the transactions in September were distressed sales. In areas like Las Vegas and inland California, investors have been competing since the spring with first-time buyers for low-cost foreclosures. More expensive homes have languished, often because would-be buyers cannot get approved for loans.
 This has increased sales volume -- sales in the western states rose 13 percent in September -- while depressing median prices. But the supply of distressed houses is beginning to run low in California. That may be temporary and is undoubtedly good news for those facing foreclosure. But it is beginning to undercut the market's apparent vigor.
 ''You can't have it all,'' said Andrew LePage, an analyst for MDA DataQuick. ''The dwindling foreclosure inventory has brought the market closer to price stability, but it's making it more difficult to show annual sales growth.''
 The Northeast lagged in September with a 4.4 percent rise. But Timothy M. Warren Jr. of the Warren Group, which collects real estate data in Massachusetts, said he was ''pretty cheered'' by the prospects for the state's market.
 ''If history is to be our guide, six more months of improving sales volume and then median prices should turn the corner,'' he said. ''I think there is pent-up demand from a lot of people after the last four years. And recoveries in the stock market and retirement accounts take some anxiety out of the picture.''

HEADLINE: It's a Delicate Task To Sort the Garbage At a Nuclear Era Dump

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: LOS ALAMOS, N.M. 

 BODY:
No one knows for sure what is buried in the Manhattan Project-era dump here. At the very least, there is probably a truck down there that was contaminated in 1945 at the Trinity test site, where the world's first nuclear explosion seared the sky and melted the desert sand 200 miles south of here during World War II.
 But now a team of workers is using $212 million in federal stimulus money to clean up the 65-year-old, six-acre dump, which was used by the scientists who built the world's first atomic bomb. They are approaching the job like an archeological dig -- only with even greater care, since some of the things they unearth are likely to be radioactive, while others may be explosive. 
 The dump has become part of the $6 billion stimulus program to clean up the toxic legacy of the arms race, which is one of the biggest sources of direct federal contracts in the $787 billion stimulus act. More than $1.9 billion is being spent at the Hanford site in Washington, the home of the nuclear reactor that made the plutonium for the atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki. Another $1.6 billion is being spent cleaning up a Savannah River site, in South Carolina. 
 After the stimulus bill passed, some Republicans questioned the wisdom of devoting so much money to nuclear cleanups, noting that the Department of Energy's environmental management program had been bedeviled by cost overruns in the past. Democrats countered that the labor-intensive projects would create many jobs while advancing the stimulus act's goal of improving the environment. 
 They also noted that the money was only a down payment on what is still a staggering task: the Department of Energy is responsible for cleaning up 107 sites, with as much acreage as Delaware and Rhode Island combined, in work that could take decades and cost up to $260 billion to complete. 
 Nearly 73,000 people have applied for stimulus jobs cleaning up nuclear sites since the program was announced, the Department of Energy says, and more than 10,800 positions have been saved or created with the money.
 Here at Los Alamos, some of the first work involves tearing down buildings and cleaning up land at what is called Technical Area 21. It was an isolated mesa in 1945 when the laboratory moved its plutonium processing operations there after a fire broke out uncomfortably close to its original plant near the center of town. But the town has grown since then, and now several businesses -- including a hardware store, an auto repair shop and the local newspaper -- are right across the street from the old dump.
 Since the dump, the laboratory's first, was used only from 1944 through 1948, the cleanup team had to do a great deal of detective work to figure out what might be in it. 
 ''You look for every possible shred of evidence that you can to give you an idea of what kind of surprises you might encounter,'' said Allan B. Chaloupka, who directs the decontamination and decommissioning program. 
 The team members pored over wartime classified documents and interviewed old-timers to learn what materials might have found their way into the dump, and took soil samples to test their estimates of how much plutonium might be buried there. They debriefed a laboratory worker who, as a young man, once fell into it. 
 They asked scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory to come up with worst-case scenarios of how explosive the chemicals dumped there might have grown over the years -- and then they blew up the equivalent amounts of dynamite to test all the safety measures that they would be taking. While the laboratory has worked to assure the public that the work will be done safely, some of the site's closest neighbors are eyeing the project warily. 
 ''You wonder what's going on,'' said Ken Romero, 40, a machinist at the Jona Manufacturing Company, across the street. ''One day we looked across the street and there was a guy in a full-body white suit, and he was just 100 yards away from us.'' 
 On a recent visit, officials emphasized the extreme care they were taking. When they tore down an air-processing building early one morning, they did not use any explosives, for obvious reasons. Instead, an excavator tore a slice down the center of the building, and then surgically knocked the building's walls inward, so the debris would not hit any of the neighboring buildings. 
 Some of the workers did wear white body suits, but in this case they were for protection from asbestos, not radiation. The building was not contaminated, though some of its neighbors were. 
 So far, about 156 people -- many from small businesses in the area -- have been given jobs on the project, which will ultimately employ roughly 300 people, officials said. 
 ''Many are basically common laborers that come out of commercial operations,'' Mr. Chaloupka said, ''and we're teaching them to do something at a little higher level, and we're creating a cadre of people that can do other jobs later.''
 The government is under a consent order with the State of New Mexico to clean up the area, so there will be more work after the stimulus program ends.
 George Rael, an assistant manager for environmental operations at the Department of Energy's site office here, said that by clearing most of the mesa, the stimulus work would send a signal to the public. 
 ''This is going to be very visible skyline change that people will actually see and recognize,'' Mr. Rael said.
 Several of the buildings they are tearing down date to the Manhattan Project days, when a secret laboratory hastily thrown up here on the Pajarito Plateau at the site of a ranch school for boys produced the bomb that changed the world.
 The complex was top secret: eminent physicists who visited were given pseudonyms, the whole town was behind a fence, and the laboratory's inhabitants all had the same mailing address, ''P.O. Box 1663, Santa Fe,'' which was also used on the birth certificates of babies born there. 
 When the job here is done, and the waste is dug up and trucked elsewhere, officials said, the mesa will be clean enough for homes to be built on it.

HEADLINE: City Focuses on Recession-Proof Health Care Jobs

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Through the cycles of boom and bust that have roiled New York City's glossy finance, media and high-tech industries over the last 20 years, one segment of the economy has churned steadily along, reliably producing jobs and helping cushion even the sharpest downturns: health care. 
 Now, as the population ages and Congress dangles the possibility of a flood of newly insured patients seeking care, the city is looking to capitalize on growth in the field, which is expected to create more new jobs across the country than any other industry in the coming decade.
 On Monday, city officials plan to open an employment center dedicated to training workers for and placing them in health-related jobs, from home care aides to registered nurses. The aim of the center, the city's second employment office to focus on a single industry, is not just to find work for people, officials say, but also to help them start or advance full-fledged careers. 
 In the shift to working more closely with specific industries -- an approach to work force development that is becoming increasingly popular among government agencies nationwide -- officials hope to better anticipate job openings with higher wages and greater potential for advancement, as well as to recruit and train workers to fill them. 
 ''We spent a lot of time, and rightfully so, assessing people and helping people with their resumes and finding out what color their parachute was,'' said Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services, who has overseen adult job placement for the city since 2003. ''Now we're looking at the other side of the equation: What do businesses need?'' 
 The city opened the other center dedicated to a specific sector -- transportation and warehousing -- a little over a year ago in Jamaica, Queens, and there are more to come. Mr. Walsh plans to open a center focused on manufacturing, and hopes to create one devoted to tourism, hospitality and the culinary trades. 
 The health care center, at LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, Queens, seems particularly promising: Officials say that their health care job placements have nearly doubled over the past year and now represent 21 percent of all city placements. But even though the field has proved to be nearly recession-proof -- a bright spot of job growth in otherwise gloomy times -- some economists warn that it cannot make up for losses in other sectors, like finance or law, where the jobs are often higher paid, generating more tax revenue and stimulating more economic activity. 
 Every job on Wall Street, where average compensation is expected to be $410,000 this year, generates three and a half other jobs in the city, said Doug Turetsky of the city's Independent Budget Office. ''A home health aide doesn't earn enough to have anywhere near that kind of effect,'' he said.
 And James A. Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said that growth in what is mainly a service sector cannot not make up for shrinkage in so-called export industries like finance, law, information and manufacturing. ''It shouldn't be seen as sufficient to diversify the economy or replace declining export sectors,'' he said.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Parrott and others said that the sustained creation of new jobs, many of them attached to hospitals and paying middle-class wages, was clearly a positive development for the city and one that was likely to continue, regardless of the fate of federal health care legislation. 
 Demographics is one reason: The city's elderly population has grown consistently since the late 1990s, often faster than elsewhere in the nation, according to a recent analysis of the health care industry by Martin Kohli, the regional economist at the New York office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Starting in 2002, the number of city residents age 65 and over has grown faster on average than New York's overall population.
 Because the elderly generally have more medical needs and access to health insurance through Medicare, Mr. Kohli wrote, health care spending for that group has tended to be at least twice as high as that for all age groups.
 Indeed, Medicare and Medicaid spending in New York has helped finance the boom in health care employment, Mr. Parrott said. According to his analysis, medical benefits have generally grown as a share of personal income in the city since the 1970s, but increased sharply during economic downturns, like those in the early 1990s and after 2001.
 Mr. Kohli's analysis reported that from 1990 to last year, jobs in the city grew by 6.4 percent, but those in the health care sector -- excluding municipal jobs -- grew by 41.5 percent, to 402,200 from 284,200.
 And spending is poised to stay high. Between 2000 and 2005, the Medicaid rolls nearly doubled as the state expanded programs and the city made it easier for people to apply. These days, the federal government is picking up a bigger share of the tab through the stimulus program, Mr. Parrott said, bringing more money into the city and helping finance new hospital jobs in recent months. 
 In addition, the trend toward outpatient care and the push to computerize patient records is creating a demand for new jobs with new skills.
 ''Technology has changed in health care, driving different kinds of care, so much more focused on outpatient services and so much more focused on health information technology,'' said Kathleen Kearns, a senior vice president at Continuum Health Partners, which operates major hospitals in the city, and an executive of the city's Workforce Investment Board, which oversees employment efforts. ''If I had a niece who had any capacity and interest in this, I would push her into I.T. because health care I.T. is definitely a growth area for us.'' 
 The new health care employment center, which aims to harness all that growth and make sure New Yorkers have the skills to get the jobs, is located at LaGuardia Community College because the college has a health care training program, officials said. The center is working closely with health care businesses and providers to stay on top of their job needs, as well as to market the city's ability to find them qualified workers.
 The notion of creating sector-specific centers and linking them to the city's community colleges and their professional education programs grew from the Bloomberg administration's antipoverty commission's goal of helping people up to the first rung of a career ladder.
 Mr. Walsh wants to take that idea further and connect the centers to vocational high schools, where students often plan to take the skills they have learned straight into the work force rather than attend college. 
 ''If we build out these career centers, and we make links with the community colleges, the next logical step would be to make a further link'' with career/technical education schools, he said. ''That has not been there, and I think we can play a role given that we now have career centers that have relationships with a good variety of sectors.''

HEADLINE: What Now? Understanding What the Rent Ruling Means for Tenants

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
When the New York State Court of Appeals overturned some rent rules in place for more than nine years on Thursday, the decision opened a window for many market-rate New York City tenants, including some paying some of the highest rents in the country, to roll back rents and get the protections of the state government's rent regulation system. Here are some questions and answers about the decision.
 Q. What did the ruling say? 
 A. Landlords in rent-regulated buildings who received property tax abatements acted improperly when they deregulated apartments under state laws that allow for deregulation when the legal regulated rents rose above $2,000, according to the court decision. In 2000, the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal found that these owners could deregulate apartments. The case was brought by tenants at the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town complexes in Manhattan.
 Q. How many apartments are affected?
 A. As many as 80,000 market-rate tenants, mostly in Manhattan, may be affected by the decision. These tenants live in apartments in previously regulated buildings that received a tax abatement, known as J-51, intended to encourage owners to invest in their buildings. It is not yet clear whether tenants who have already moved out of apartments will be eligible for refunds for past overcharges. 
 Q. How do I know if my apartment is eligible for a rent reduction? 
 A. First check the history of your building's participation in the city's J-51 program by going through lists of J-51 buildings posted on the city's Department of Finance Web site. If you know your building's block and lot numbers, a quicker search is available. If the building has a J-51 tax break, check with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to confirm that the apartment was once regulated. Tenants can request a printout of an apartment's rent history going back to 1984 at a state housing rent office, but they must show identification and a copy of the lease or a rent bill. Tenants can call local offices and request the rent history, which will be mailed to the apartment address.
 Q. What would the reduced rent be?
 A. It is not yet clear how the reduced rent would be calculated. David E. Frazer, a tenant lawyer, said the rent could be based on the legal rent at the time the apartment was deregulated, plus any annual rent increases, and any additional increases permitted when an apartment became vacant in the past.
 But state rules, also under challenge in the courts, generally limit ''lookbacks'' to what the rent was four years before a complaint is filed, even if that rent is above $2,000. So an apartment could become rent-stabilized again with a rent well above $2,000. But the tenant would be eligible for protections like limited annual increases and guaranteed lease renewals.
 Q. How much of a refund of back rent might I be eligible for?
 A. The Court of Appeals left it to the lower courts to determine whether the decision would be applied retroactively, and this could take years of court hearings and legal maneuvering. ''Tenants think they won the lottery,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a lawyer who represents both tenants and landlords, ''but it might not turn out that way.'' Refunds, if paid, would include interest.
 Q. How do I go about getting my rent reduced?
 A. The state's housing agency is advising tenants who believe they are entitled to a reduced rent, and possible refund, to file an overcharge complaint at a state rent office, though Nancy Peters, a spokeswoman for the agency, said many questions had not been resolved by the courts. Tenants can also sue their landlords in state court, and might want to join with other tenants in their building and hire a lawyer. JOSH BARBANEL

HEADLINE: NATO MINISTERS SUPPORT GENERAL ON AFGHAN WAR

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and MARK LANDLER; Thom Shanker reported from Bratislava, and Mark Landler from Washington.

DATELINE: BRATISLAVA, Slovakia 

 BODY:
Defense ministers from NATO on Friday endorsed the ambitious counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan proposed by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, giving new impetus to his recommendation to pour more troops into the eight-year-old war.
 General McChrystal, the senior American and allied commander in Afghanistan, made an unannounced appearance here on Friday to brief the defense ministers on his strategic review of a war in which the American-led campaign has lost momentum to a tenacious Taliban insurgency.
''What we did today was to discuss General McChrystal's overall assessment, his overall approach, and I have noted a broad support from all ministers of this overall counterinsurgency approach,'' said NATO's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. 
 The acceptance by NATO defense ministers of General McChrystal's approach did not include a decision on new troops, and it was not clear that their judgment would translate into increased willingness by their governments, many of which have been seeking to reduce their military presence in Afghanistan, to contribute further forces to the war. 
 But it was another in a series of judgments that success there could not be achieved by a narrower effort that did not increase troop levels in Afghanistan substantially and focused more on capturing and killing terrorists linked to Al Qaeda -- a counterterrorism strategy identified with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 The NATO briefing, though held privately, thrusts General McChrystal back into the debate over what President Obama should do about Afghanistan -- a role that has raised tensions between the general and the White House in the past, and even drawn a rebuke from his boss, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates.
 NATO's support got no official reaction from the White House. But an administration official noted that an endorsement by defense ministers was not the same as an endorsement by the alliance's political leadership. Other officials were emphatic that Mr. Obama would not be stampeded in his deliberations and suggested that the NATO statement should not be taken as evidence that the White House had made a decision about how to proceed.
 ''In no way, shape or form are the president's options constrained,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, speaking to reporters at the State Department. 
 General McChrystal's review calls for adopting a full-scale counterinsurgency strategy that would protect population centers and accelerate training of Afghan Army and police units -- both of which would require significant numbers of fresh troops. NATO diplomats noted that it was difficult to see how an acceptance of this broad strategy could be viewed as anything but an endorsement of the need to increase both military and civilian contributions.
 Mr. Gates, who has kept his views about additional troops close to his vest and has discouraged his commanders from lobbying too publicly for their positions, declined to be drawn out on this assessment.
 ''For this meeting, I am here mainly in listening mode,'' Mr. Gates said in Bratislava after the NATO briefing, although he noted that ''many allies spoke positively about General McChrystal's assessment.''
 Mr. Gates said the administration's decision on Afghanistan was still two or three weeks away, and he cautioned that it was ''vastly premature'' to draw conclusions now about whether the president would deploy more troops. He said that allied defense ministers had not voiced concerns about the administration's decision-making process.
 Although NATO will not meet until next month to decide whether to commit more resources to Afghanistan, Mr. Gates did reveal that he had received indications that some allies were prepared to increase their contributions of civilian experts or troops, or both.
 Britain and other NATO members have had their own fractious political debates over troop levels. A retired top general in Britain recently said that the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown had rebuffed his requests for more troops, a charge Mr. Brown denied.
 Separate from his strategic review, General McChrystal has submitted a request for forces, which is now working its way through both the American and NATO chains of command.
 The options submitted by General McChrystal range to a maximum of 85,000 more troops, although his leading option calls for increasing forces by about 40,000, according to officials familiar with the proposal.
 The pressure for more troops was a theme throughout the day at the NATO meeting, as other senior international representatives told defense ministers of the need to increase their commitments in order to succeed in Afghanistan.
 The United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, who also flew to the Slovakian capital to meet the ministers, stressed that ''additional international troops are required.'' He also told the allies, ''This cannot be a U.S.-only enterprise.''
 Mr. Eide acknowledged that it might be difficult to rally public support for force contributions while allegations of election fraud continued to taint the government of President Hamid Karzai.
 Senior American military officers have already endorsed General McChrystal's overall strategy, including Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American commander in the Middle East. 
 Senior NATO officials made clear that additional commitments should go beyond combat forces to include trainers for the Afghan Army and police force, as well as civilians to help rebuild the economy and restore confidence in the government.
 ''What we need is a much broader strategy, which stabilizes the whole of Afghan society, and this is the essence in the recommendations presented by General McChrystal,'' said Mr. Rasmussen, the NATO secretary general. ''This won't happen just because of a good plan. It will also need resources -- people and money.''
 General McChrystal was not scheduled to make any public comments here. The general's reticence was not unexpected, as some administration officials have criticized his recent statements as an attempt to press the White House to act.
 The general and his aides have denied they were playing politics. General McChrystal said in a recent interview that success required a unified, government-wide strategy.
 NATO officials assessing the potential for allied troop contributions said that delicate negotiations were under way, and that NATO capitals were watching the Obama administration for signals even while they sent signals of their own.

HEADLINE: The New Jersey Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''For Governor of New Jersey'' (editorial, Oct. 18): 
 I very much agree with your endorsement of Jon S. Corzine for another term as governor of New Jersey. As your editorial stated, Governor Corzine has made the difficult choices that his predecessors simply wouldn't. These decisions haven't always been popular, but Jon Corzine is not your typical politician. 
 Contrast that with his Republican opponent, Chris Christie, who has sadly lacked specifics throughout the campaign, and one can clearly see why Jon Corzine is a better choice on Election Day.
 Steven M. Clayton Ocean, N.J., Oct. 18, 2009
 The writer is a Democratic committeeman in Ocean Township.
 To the Editor:
 Your tepid yet dogged endorsement of Jon S. Corzine for re-election was predictable, but still dismaying. After all the corruption, outrageous property, sales, income and antibusiness taxes, fiscal irresponsibility, high unemployment, waste, incompetence and general contempt for the public good that New Jersey has suffered from liberal Democratic governors, senators and their many local replicators, if my fellow New Jerseyans follow your advice it will represent another blow to any hope for genuine two-party representative government in this state.
 It might simply reflect the cynicism or hopelessness (and for some, cluelessness) of people all too used to unresponsive, arrogant public bureaucrats who have come to consider elective and appointive office their right rather than a trust to be earned.
 Even past New Jersey Republicans you have acclaimed would have little chance if a majority of my fellow voters wear such Democratic blinders.

HEADLINE: For Mayor of New York City

 BODY:
The real test of any mayor is how well the city works. In his eight years in office, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has managed to make the unpredictable city of New York work astonishingly well. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has been a first-rate steady hand during unsteady times. He guided the city out of the post-9/11 recession, then tucked away money during the boom years that followed. That foresight has helped New Yorkers weather one of the worst economic downturns in 80 years. Mayor Bloomberg has easily earned another four years.
 The Democratic nominee, Comptroller William Thompson, is a worthy opponent. Mr. Thompson has been a competent comptroller in a turbulent period and is a quiet, conciliatory man. But he has spent too much of his campaign attacking Mayor Bloomberg rather than explaining how he would manage the city, and Mr. Bloomberg is simply the stronger candidate. 
 What makes the mayor stand out is not his political skill, although he has come a long way since his first clumsy days in office. He has run the $60 billion government with a keen attention to accountability and efficiency. He has chosen some of the best people in the country to work for him, and he has mostly let them do their jobs. As a result, many city services operate better than they have for years. The garbage mostly disappears on time. The police and fire departments respond quickly. Mr. Bloomberg's 311 phone line allows New Yorkers to complain to a live human being. Often, they even see tangible results.
 Public education is better over all -- although parents still need more access to their children's teachers and schools. The mayor's new complaint line for parents should help, as will other changes imposed by the Legislature. But in a third term, the mayor and his team should still work harder to listen to those who hand over their children each morning to his educators. 
 Crime is down under Raymond Kelly, the police commissioner, although there is concern again about stop-and-frisk actions, which seem to focus too heavily on Hispanics and African-Americans. Mr. Bloomberg also has been a national leader in gun control. 
 The mayor's environmental efforts -- stalled in Albany -- show admirable concern about the city's future. And he has worked hard to improve the city's health -- most effectively with the smoking ban.
 His plans suit the times. With little city money to spend, Mr. Bloomberg wants to focus more on helping working-class and middle-class residents with cheap banking or aid in fighting foreclosures or finding jobs and housing. He wants to give a lift to small businesses.
 Like Mr. Thompson, who has made the mayor's wealth a major issue, most New Yorkers are concerned about Mr. Bloomberg's spending $85 million -- so far -- to win re-election. In his first campaign in 2001, he argued that he was spending so much to introduce himself. Now a nationally recognized figure, he argues that as a candidate running on Republican and Independent Party lines, he needs to fight for votes in a city that is so predominantly Democratic. 
 We think Mr. Bloomberg exaggerates his vulnerability. New York City's campaign finance system is one of the best in the country. He does everyone a disservice by not complying with the system's limits on spending.
 Mr. Thompson also argues that the mayor unfairly worked to get rid of term limits so that he could run this third time. We supported his efforts to do so because term limits unfairly limit voters' choices. But the mayor has sent signals that once he is elected, he will set up a charter commission to try to restore the limits. That is a bad call.
 Finally, like others who have not always agreed with the mayor, we worry about his difficulty brooking dissent. He should not allow that trait to spoil a third term.
 But those are small blemishes. We enthusiastically endorse Mayor Michael Bloomberg for re-election.

 BODY:
The relationship between Jay H. Walder, the new chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg may be fledgling. But so far it seems that Mr. Walder may be a man after Mr. Bloomberg's own social-engineering-happy heart. 
 This week, Mr. Walder said he was considering reducing subway fares late at night and on weekends in the hopes of increasing ridership then. 
 Mayor Bloomberg's social-engineering plans are often aimed at improving the health of New Yorkers or their environment -- taxes on cigarettes, surcharges on plastic bags and tolls on cars.
 By reducing fares on the subway during the wee hours, Mr. Walder is, appropriately enough, mostly looking to make a buck for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which sure could use it. A spokesman explained that Mr. Walder is not trying to reduce congestion by persuading people who are flexible to avoid rush hour; he is trying to get people who would ordinarily think, ''You know, it's 2 a.m., I'm staying home,'' to think instead, ''Hey, the subway's a bargain at this hour.'' 
 Would it work? Maybe, maybe not, but it's entertaining to contemplate how much behavior could be dictated by slavish devotion to a bargain. It's somewhat surprising, actually, that using price manipulation as a form of people manipulation has not caught on in many arenas of city life.
 Department stores reduce prices when business is typically slow, like right after Christmas. Why couldn't, say, the American Museum of Natural History impose a congestion surcharge for those rainy Sundays when its exhibits are teeming with more life forms than seems advisable?
 If the ever-crowded Shake Shack raised the price of Hand-Spun Shakes to $6.25 from $5.25 on perfect spring days, its customers would surely feel they had been shaken down; then again, they probably already do, and at least on those perfect spring days the higher prices might be spiritually offset by the time saved in shorter lines. Fairway should consider offering a bargain rate on, oh, brie and Earth's Best baby food from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., in the hope of reducing the number of elbows in its aisles from 5:30 to 7 p.m. 
 M.T.A. officials considering the lower off-peak fares cite the increased subway use on weekends after the introduction of unlimited-ride monthly MetroCards as evidence that a sense of a bargain might entice more people underground.
 DAN ARIELY, a behavioral economist and author of ''Predictably Irrational,'' said in an interview that monthly passes increase subway use partly because they let consumers skirt what's known as the ''pain of paying.'' When people do not have to shell out cash for every transaction, it hurts less, and encourages more use, Mr. Ariely explained; in Boston, he noted, authorities have found that people will drive through toll booths more often for shorter trips when they're using New England's answer to our E-ZPass. 
 Shelling out the $89 for a monthly MetroCard, on the other hand -- that hurts. And once you've done it, you want to swipe that card as often as possible, not so much because you are avoiding the pain of paying, but because it feels like beating the house, even if it means taking four different subways rather than a reasonably priced cab ride. A reduced subway fare on the weekend would not offer that same pleasure, although for someone undecided -- should I walk those 10 blocks or be lazy and hop on the subway? -- it might tip the balance (and undo whatever Mr. Bloomberg has accomplished by banning hydrogenated fats). 
 In Mr. Ariely's opinion, reducing fares on weekends and late hours ''is unlikely to be an effective approach.'' Instead of reducing all fares by 50 percent on weekends or late at night, he suggested, maybe the transit agency should make every other fare during those hours free, turning a turnstile into a slot machine of sorts. He remembered an experiment he was part of years ago at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, rigging a vending machine so that every third candy bar was free. Sales increased by 30 percent. 
 The fare card that Mr. Walder helped usher in in London -- the Oyster card -- replenishes itself from the holder's credit card whenever the balance is low. That kind of payment, possibly like what Mr. Walder would introduce here, is convenient, modern, speedy -- and savvy for the seller: It all but eliminates the pain of paying. For the physical and financial health of the city, let's hope Shake Shack does not hit on that idea.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Big City column on Saturday, about ways that off-peak pricing might work for places other than the subway, referred imprecisely to a method of payment offered by the London Underground Oyster card -- automatic replenishment from a customer's credit card account. EasyPay Xpress, a fare card used in New York, already offers the same payment method; it would not be a new feature of any fare card introduced in New York.

HEADLINE: At M.I.T., Obama Presses Case for Focus on Using Renewable Energy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Taking aim at business interests that have lobbied against an energy and climate bill moving through Congress, President Obama urged lawmakers on Friday to rally around the push toward using more renewable energy.
 In a wide-ranging speech on energy and the environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Obama called for legislation that would make ''the best use of resources we have in abundance, through clean coal technology, safe nuclear power, sustainably grown biofuels and energy we harness from wind, waves and sun.''
 Mr. Obama chided critics of the proposed legislation, saying, ''There are those who will suggest that moving toward clean energy will destroy our economy when it's the system we currently have that endangers our prosperity and prevents us from creating millions of new jobs.'' 
 He was apparently referring to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which oppose the proposal moving through Congress to cap emissions of greenhouse gases and allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. That approach, known as cap and trade, is meant to guarantee that emissions will decline, while providing market incentives for companies to invest in the most cost-effective technologies.
 The legislation ''provides the largest single boost in scientific research in history,'' Mr. Obama said.
 ''The closer we get, the harder the opposition will fight and the more we'll hear from those whose interest or ideology runs counter to action,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama made his remarks after touring an M.I.T. research laboratory that has been developing what the White House described as ''cutting-edge clean energy technology.'' He checked out a project involving a new kind of light-emitting diode, or LED, that gives off whiter light at lower energy cost and could replace existing light bulbs or fluorescent lights. 
 ''There is also another myth we must dispel,'' Mr. Obama said in his speech after the tour. ''And it is one far more dangerous than any attack made by those who wish to stand in the way of progress -- and that's the idea that there is little or nothing we can do. 
 ''That is the pessimistic notion that our politics are too broken and our people too unwilling to make hard choices. Implicit in this argument is the sense that we've lost something important -- that fighting American spirit, that willingness to tackle hard challenges and the determination to see those challenges to their end.''
 Legislation addressing energy use and the related problem of climate change from fossil-fuel emissions faces significant challenges in Congress, where some Democrats, too, remain worried about lost jobs and rising energy costs in the parts of the country most heavily dependent on coal and manufacturing. From the outset, the bill's proponents have sought to make the case that it will create high-tech jobs and save money on energy costs in the long run.
 The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin hearings on Tuesday on the climate change and energy bill introduced last month by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts (who hitched a ride home to Boston with Mr. Obama aboard Air Force One) and Senator Barbara Boxer of California. Mr. Obama's speech appeared timed to give the legislation a strong liftoff. 
 But the timing on any committee action, let alone passage by the full Senate, is highly uncertain and depends not only on the environment committee but also on action by several other Senate committees, not all of them as friendly toward strict caps on emissions. The White House has said it does not expect final Senate action on climate and energy before next year, and certainly not before the big climate change summit in Copenhagen in December.
 Mr. Obama's trip to New England also included campaign fund-raisers for Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, and a stop later in Stamford, Conn., to stump for Senator Christopher J. Dodd.

HEADLINE: We Know What He Means

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
I wasn't at all surprised at Rudy Giuliani. He couldn't find his way off the low road with a handful of maps and a GPS device. But I was very surprised at Mayor Bloomberg.
 One of the signal successes of Mike Bloomberg's tenure is that during his two terms as mayor of a rough, tough, extremely contentious city, he has helped lower the racial temperature. You can say whatever you want about his policies, you can like him personally or not, but he has not played that cheap and tired game of ethnic politics. He has not tried to divide people along racial, ethnic or religious lines, exploiting fears and pitting groups against one another. And he has stood up against those who would do so.
 The city has benefited from this. So it was truly disheartening, dismaying, to have the mayor turn his back on all that last Sunday during an appearance with Mr. Giuliani before an Orthodox Jewish group in Borough Park, Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Giuliani, campaigning on Mr. Bloomberg's behalf, warned that if the mayor is not elected to a third term on Nov. 3, the city could become unsafe -- a place of escalating crime and heightened tensions and fear. 
 Homing in with the instincts of a born divider, Mr. Giuliani suggested that an environment filled with danger might be right there on the next horizon if the voters were to elect ''the wrong political leadership.'' The ''wrong'' leadership in this case would be Mr. Bloomberg's opponent, the City Comptroller William Thompson, who is black.
 Giuliani said he worries daily that the city might revert ''to the way it was before 1993,'' the year he was elected mayor. He then pointedly added, so that no one within earshot could mistake his not-so-coded meaning: ''And you know exactly what I'm talking about.''
 It was vintage Giuliani, as subtle as a heart attack, deliberately fanning the fears of a community that has long been the locus of tensions between blacks and Jews. And Mayor Bloomberg sat there, allowing that lousy message to be delivered on his behalf.
 Mr. Bloomberg has had many opportunities to disavow Mr. Giuliani's remarks, to say that as a city we're better than that, to repudiate (as he has before) the very idea that exploiting fear and division for political gain is acceptable in this great city. But he has chosen not to. He chose instead, later that same day, to raise the specter of one of the worst big-city tragedies in American history: Detroit, which was laid low by every ill you can imagine, including a catastrophic race riot in 1967.
 Detroit, said Mr. Bloomberg, ''went from a great city with lots of good-paying jobs to a city that's basically holding on for dear life.'' 
 Well, that's true. But what's that got to do with New York City, or this year's mayoral election? New York is not an incipient Detroit. New York will not become Detroit if Mike Bloomberg is not re-elected.
 The mayor disingenuously said that Detroit's decline was more about economics than ''some other things.'' But anyone who knows the sad history of Detroit knows about those ''other things.''
 This had all the appearance of Mayor Bloomberg piggybacking on Giuliani's fear-mongering. He picked the worst-case urban scenario available, a crime-ridden, destitute city from which most whites have long since fled, and offered it as a suggestion of what might be in store for New York, a thriving metropolis filled with people from virtually every ethnic group on the planet.
 Open a window, please. Some fresh air is in order.
 The Mike Bloomberg that New Yorkers came to know during his first two terms as mayor was not the same man who remained shamefully silent last Sunday, willing to benefit politically from Mr. Giuliani's toxic remarks. 
 Many of us have seen New York convulsed over the decades by one racially charged controversy after another, sometimes violently convulsed. They come easily to mind: The Central Park jogger case, the police killings of Eleanor Bumpurs, Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond, the vicious racial attacks in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, the Tawana Brawley affair, the Crown Heights riot and on and on and on.
 The Bloomberg administration has helped shield the city from similar convulsions. That the mayor is now willing to lock his principles in a safe deposit box and start riding the broomstick of ethnic politics suggests that he's worried about the outcome of his race against Mr. Thompson (even though public opinion polls and most of the people I talk to expect Bloomberg to win).
 One of the ironies at work here is that it is during the toughest economic times that a city, more than ever, needs a mayor who is committed to bringing people together, not playing them off against one another for short-term political gain. This is absolutely the worst time for that point to have slipped Michael Bloomberg's mind.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Political Quest Is Costliest Ever in U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, the Wall Street mogul whose fortune catapulted him into New York's City Hall, has set another staggering financial record: He has now spent more of his own money than any other individual in United States history in the pursuit of public office.
 Newly released campaign records show the mayor, as of Friday, had spent $85 million on his latest re-election campaign, and is on pace to spend between $110 million and $140 million before the election on Nov. 3. 
 That means Mr. Bloomberg, in his three bids for mayor, will have easily burned through more than $250 million -- the equivalent of what Warner Brothers spent on the latest Harry Potter movie.
 The sum easily surpasses what other titans of business have spent to seek state or federal office. New Jersey's Jon S. Corzine has plunked down a total of $130 million in two races for governor and one for United States Senate. Steve Forbes poured $114 million into his two bids for president. And Ross Perot spent $65 million in his quest for the White House in 1992 and $10 million four years later.
 ''I have never seen anything like this -- it's off the charts,'' said Jennifer A. Steen, a lecturer in political science at Yale who has studied self-financed candidates for the last decade. ''He's in a league of his own.''
 Mr. Bloomberg has used his wealth, estimated at $16 billion, to establish what appears to be insurmountable financial dominance in the race. 
 He has spent at least 14 times what his Democratic rival in the race, William C. Thompson Jr., has: $6 million. A Thompson campaign spokeswoman on Friday called the mayor's spending ''obscene.'' 
 Since late September, the pace of Mr. Bloomberg's spending has drastically accelerated: He is now sending nearly $1 million a day into the city's economy. The bulk of the money is devoted to advertising on television, radio and the Web, but much of it bankrol ls a first-class approach to parties, snacks and travel. 
 The campaign has spent $322,521 on food, $293,953 on transportation, $176,066 on furniture and $39,858 on parking.
 His lavish spending has confounded political consultants and campaign finance experts, who said that his popularity with New Yorkers, and his built-in advantages as a two-term incumbent, should be sufficient to win him re-election. 
 ''The main thing money does is allow you to get name recognition,'' said Meredith McGehee, policy director of the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group in Washington. ''But in this case, with Bloomberg, because he's so well known, it's more like, he can do it, so why not?''
 With more than 100 employees, his campaign now has a staff larger than 97 percent of all businesses in New York City. And his political operation has become a one-man economic stimulus program, buying $8,892 worth of pizza from Goodfellas Brick Oven Pizza on Staten Island and in the Bronx. The company had suffered a big drop in business since the start of the recession. 
 ''It's a huge help,'' said Marc Cosentino, one of the owners of Goodfellas. ''They don't have to economize like everyone else.''
 Squier Knapp Dunn, the media company responsible for the mayor's television ads, has taken in $48,313,776. While most of that money pays for TV time, media companies typically receive fees of about 15 percent. 
 ''A number of firms are practically living off of this,'' said Steve Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
 The spending has drawn howls of protest from good-government groups and advocates of campaign finance reform. In interviews, several said, angrily, that the mayor's decisions to rewrite New York City's term limits law and then spend wildly to secure re-election, have undermined democratic principles. 
 ''Whether Bloomberg wins or loses, the toxic combination of mega-spending and crass use of his office to bypass the voters on term limits will always be a stain on his mayoralty,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group. 
 ''These twin assaults on municipal democracy will undermine his political clout in a third term and sadly fuel public skepticism about elections and elected officials,'' Mr. Russianoff said.
 A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, Howard Wolfson, defended the spending, saying, ''Voters in this race have a choice between one candidate who is independent and doesn't take a dime from special interests and another who practices politics as usual.''
 Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, has had the unenviable task of trying to raise money in the middle of a deep recession, when many voters already assume that Mr. Bloomberg will prevail. Their lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Thompson's candidacy was reflected in his latest campaign finance disclosure, which showed he had raised $270,000 over the last three weeks.
 While donations came in at a much brisker pace than in the previous three-week reporting period, when he raised $114,000, that is unlikely to make a dent in Mr. Bloomberg's advantage. Factoring in public matching funds, Mr. Thompson will have $3 million in the final week and a half of the race. 
 ''This is a clear indication that the momentum of the mayoral race continues to shift towards Bill Thompson,'' said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Thompson campaign. 
 But Mr. Thompson's fund-raising still badly trails that of the two last Democrats who lost to Mr. Bloomberg: the former public advocate, Mark Green, and Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president. 
 The newly released records show that Mr. Bloomberg is handsomely rewarding top aides who take leaves from their City Hall posts to join the campaign. His first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris, is earning about $28,000 a month. It is a healthy raise: At City Hall, she made about $21,000 a month. 
 The mayor also typically showers the aides with additional bonuses after Election Day.
 All that money shows how far Mr. Bloomberg has come, wealth-wise. His campaign spending this year will nearly equal what his boyhood hometown of Medford, Mass., population 55,000, devotes to its annual budget.

HEADLINE: Our Cars, Ourselves

BYLINE: By MARC FITTEN. 
Marc Fitten, the editor of The Chattahoochee Review, is the author of the novel ''Valeria's Last Stand.''

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
 I DECIDED to buy a car. Actually, I didn't decide so much as realize that at 198,000 miles, even my ever-trusty Honda couldn't last forever. Now, I didn't trade it in with cash for clunkers. I got rid of it the old-fashioned way. I sold it for $500 to a college student who was thrilled to have it. She took my old/her new Honda to a mechanic, gave it a wash, put a Coldplay bumper sticker over the dent and went on her merry way. And I decided to get out there, do my part and buy American. I grew up in a Chevy family, after all, so I figured I'd return to my roots. 
 But then I drove by the very empty General Motors plant in Doraville, north of Atlanta. One hundred and sixty five paved acres is a lot of land, and in the middle of a city its silence is obvious. I slowed down to take a closer look. The plant was eerily still under the open sky. Its smokestacks loomed over my head with nary a puff. Nature was struggling to reclaim the space, and grass was growing through the cracks around the lot. It looked as if a meadow was trying to break through the asphalt. But the grass was already turning yellow. 
 Luckily, the folks in Michigan have a sense of humor, and they put a billboard up to lift my spirits. A billboard advertising a Chevy pickup towered above the empty plant. It's arranged so that folks stuck in traffic on the Interstate alongside can see it. Well, then I got kind of angry. 
 You want to know what G.M. means to me? Twelve-hundred people out of work at this plant, four to five times as many other people affected in the Atlanta area, and a blow to a proud, struggling town. The whole thing is a fiasco. I'm not even going to mention the three empty G.M. dealerships down the street. And G.M. can't even let a meadow be a meadow.
 But later on when I'm test-driving a not-Chevy car, I hear something that makes my stomach start doing flips: the 165-acre tract where the G.M. plant stood for 60 years is not even being marketed to sell. It's being left to rot. A ruin. In the middle of the city! There are real estate prices to think of, I guess, and G.M. is looking for top dollar, maybe $70 million or so. The county appraises the land at only $53 million, but counties are silly that way. And while there was a $45 million bid, fair by today's standards, G.M. said no thanks. Why should it? What incentive does it have to sell? It already has my money, your money, our children's money. 
 So, to recap: G.M. closes said plant and lays off 1,200 people in time for the economic crisis to begin. G.M. gets $19.4 billion in government bailout money. This doesn't help G.M.'s problems and it goes bankrupt anyway. So G.M. gets an additional $30 billion. The company sheds brands and more jobs. Real estate nosedives. Developers move in to buy the tract, but G.M., with its corporate coffers full of our billions, doesn't sell. Nature tries to take over and make a meadow out of the lot, but can't break through the asphalt. Employed economists say the recession is over. I sell my Honda to a college student who needs one, and now that I'm buying a car, I'm supposed to open my wallet and give G.M. $20,000 plus interest?
 This sort of nonsense is why most car buyers are abandoning their old brand loyalties. And the craziest part of all? G.M. is my company! Mine and yours -- 60 percent of it owned by us. It is in all our interests for all of us to buy their vehicles and get G.M. off the dole. I get it. Save American manufacturing. But I can't do it. G.M. already got $50 billion of my money and your money this year. What problem could you possibly have that $50 billion can't fix? With that kind of cash, every driver in America, every 10 years on our birthday, like clockwork, should get a Chevy free for life... along with a card.
 So I won't be buying that Chevy, not for a long while. Not until General Motors has responsibly sold every empty plant across this country to the benefit of every American town that had its back for the last hundred years. At the very least, it should let the grass grow.
 Oh, I forgot to mention what I bought. It was a car from the one American automaker that didn't take any bailout money. A Ford! Can you believe it? It's as if the sky turned purple and we all speak Martian.

HEADLINE: If Lenders Say 'The Dog Ate Your Mortgage'

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR decades, when troubled homeowners and banks battled over delinquent mortgages, it wasn't a contest. Homes went into foreclosure, and lenders took control of the property. 
 On top of that, courts rubber-stamped the array of foreclosure charges that lenders heaped onto borrowers and took banks at their word when the lenders said they owned the mortgage notes underlying troubled properties. 
 In other words, with lenders in the driver's seat, borrowers were run over, more often than not. Of course, errant borrowers hardly deserve sympathy from bankers or anyone else, and banks are well within their rights to try to protect their financial interests.
 But if our current financial crisis has taught us anything, it is that many borrowers entered into mortgage agreements without a clear understanding of the debt they were incurring. And banks often lacked a clear understanding of whether all those borrowers could really repay their loans. 
 Even so, banks and borrowers still do battle over foreclosures on an unlevel playing field that exists in far too many courtrooms. But some judges are starting to scrutinize the rules-don't-matter methods used by lenders and their lawyers in the recent foreclosure wave. On occasion, lenders are even getting slapped around a bit.
 One surprising smackdown occurred on Oct. 9 in federal bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York. Ruling that a lender, PHH Mortgage, hadn't proved its claim to a delinquent borrower's home in White Plains, Judge Robert D. Drain wiped out a $461,263 mortgage debt on the property. That's right: the mortgage debt disappeared, via a court order.
 So the ruling may put a new dynamic in play in the foreclosure mess: If the lender can't come forward with proof of ownership, and judges don't look kindly on that, then borrowers may have a stronger hand to play in court and, apparently, may even be able to stay in their homes mortgage-free. 
 The reason that notes have gone missing is the huge mass of mortgage securitizations that occurred during the housing boom. Securitizations allowed for large pools of bank loans to be bundled and sold to legions of investors, but some of the nuts and bolts of the mortgage game -- notes, for example -- were never adequately tracked or recorded during the boom. In some cases, that means nobody truly knows who owns what.
 To be sure, many legal hurdles mean that the initial outcome of the White Plains case may not be repeated elsewhere. Nevertheless, the ruling -- by a federal judge, no less -- is bound to bring a smile to anyone who has been subjected to rough treatment by a lender. Methinks a few of those people still exist.
 More important, the case is an alert to lenders that dubious proof-of-ownership tactics may no longer be accepted practice. They may even be viewed as a fraud on the court. 
 The United States Trustee, a division of the Justice Department charged with monitoring the nation's bankruptcy courts, has also taken an interest in the White Plains case. Its representative has attended hearings in the matter, and it has registered with the court as an interested party.
 THE case involves a borrower, who declined to be named, living in a home with her daughter and son-in-law. According to court documents, the borrower bought the house in 2001 with a mortgage from Wells Fargo; four and a half years later she refinanced with Mortgage World Bankers Inc. 
 She fell behind in her payments, and David B. Shaev, a consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan, filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan on her behalf in late February in an effort to save her home from foreclosure. 
 A proof of claim to the debt was filed in March by PHH, a company based in Mount Laurel, N.J. The $461,263 that PHH said was owed included $33,545 in arrears.
 Mr. Shaev said that when he filed the case, he had simply hoped to persuade PHH to modify his client's loan. But after months of what he described as foot-dragging by PHH and its lawyers, he asked for proof of PHH's standing in the case. 
 ''If you want to take someone's house away, you'd better make sure you have the right to do it,'' Mr. Shaev said in an interview last week. 
 In answer, Mr. Shaev received a letter stating that PHH was the servicer of the loan but that the holder of the note was U.S. Bank, as trustee of a securitization pool. But U.S. Bank was not a party to the action. 
 Mr. Shaev then asked for proof that U.S. Bank was indeed the holder of the note. All that was provided, however, was an affidavit from Tracy Johnson, a vice president at PHH Mortgage, saying that PHH was the servicer and U.S. Bank the holder. 
 Among the filings supplied to support Ms. Johnson's assertion was a copy of the assignment of the mortgage. But this, too, was signed by Ms. Johnson, only this time she was identified as an assistant vice president of MERS, the Mortgage Electronic Registration System. This bank-owned registry eliminates the need to record changes in property ownership in local land records. 
 Another problem was that the document showed the note was assigned on March 26, 2009, well after the bankruptcy had been filed. 
 Mr. Shaev's questions about ownership also led to an admission by PHH that, along the way, it had levied an improper $450 foreclosure fee on the borrower and had overcharged interest by an unstated amount. 
 John DiCaro, a lawyer representing PHH at the hearing, was in the uncomfortable position of having to explain why there was no documentation of an assignment to U.S. Bank. He did not return a phone call seeking comment last week. Ms. Johnson, who couldn't be reached for comment, did not attend the hearing. 
 According to a transcript of the Sept. 29 hearing, Mr. DiCaro said: ''In the secondary market, there are many cases where assignment of mortgages, assignment of notes, don't happen at the time they should. It was standard operating procedure for many years.'' 
 Judge Drain rejected that argument, concluding that what had been presented to the court just did not add up. ''I think that I have a more than 50 percent doubt that if the debtor paid this claim, it would be paying the wrong person,'' he said. ''That's the problem. And that's because the claimant has not shown an assignment of a mortgage.''
 Mr. Shaev said he was shocked when the judge expunged the mortgage debt.
 ''We are in uncharted territory,'' he said. ''Right now I am in bankruptcy court with a house that has no discernible debt on it, yet I have a client with a signed mortgage. We cannot in theory just go out and sell this house because the title company won't give a clear title on it.'' 
 Among the next steps Mr. Shaev said he would take is to file an amended plan or sue to try to get clear title to the property. 
 Late last week, PHH appealed the judge's ruling. But Mr. DiCaro and PHH are in something of a bind. Either they will return to court with a clear claim on the property -- including all the transfers and sales that are necessary in the securitization process -- or they won't be able to produce that documentation. If they do produce it, they will then have to explain why they didn't produce it before. 
 Oh, what a tangled web these mortgage lenders weave.

HEADLINE: An Epoch Locks Its Doors

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
No doubt many saw the recent opening of Dallas's imposing new performing arts center as a welcome sign of civic confidence during hard times. But it also signaled a closing.
 A dynamic moment in American architecture -- the explosion of art museums, concert halls and performing arts centers that transformed cities across the country over the last decade -- is officially over. The money has dried up, and who knows when there will be a similar boom.
 Some are thrilled. For years critics have railed against these cultural complexes as pointlessly grandiose expressions of vanity -- a poisonous brew of architectural egotism and excessive wealth that was destroying America's urban centers. Why all the fancy forms, they argued? Wouldn't the money be better spent on something more valuable, like schoolbooks?
 Yet as the dust settles on the last of these projects, what begins to emerge is a more complex image of America's cultural values at the birth of a new century. The formal dazzle masks a deeper struggle by cities and architects to create accessible public space in an age of shrinking government revenue and privatization. At their most ambitious, they are an effort to rethink the two great urban planning movements that gave shape to the civic and cultural identity of the American city. 
 The more influential of these was the City Beautiful Movement in the late 19th century. Modeled after the Beaux-Arts grandiosity of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, the movement was an expression of a newly confident, ascendant America -- a country of national monopolies and sprawling rail networks. The homogeneity of the architecture, with its classical facades typically arranged around formal parks, reflected the desire to create a symbolic language of national unity after the Civil War. Emulated in cities like Washington, Cleveland, Denver and Detroit, the movement gave the country its first uniform vision of city planning.
 The urge returned during the cold war in New York's Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center in Washington, the Los Angeles Music Center. These sprawling cultural complexes, cut off from their surrounding neighborhoods, not only reflected tabula rasa planning orthodoxies of their time, but all of them used a mix of modern and imperial styles and themes to portray a progressive vision of America rooted in classical ideals. 
 I suspect that many of those who criticize the eclecticism of recent years miss the confidence the two earlier eras conveyed. Most likely, they liked aspects of their homogeneity, too. The problem with freedom, after all, is that it allows for horrifying imaginative failures as well as works of stunning genius. When artists fail, you can ignore their work. When architects fail, you walk by their buildings every morning on your way for coffee shaking your fist. (The Milwaukee and Denver art museums come to mind.)
 Yet this period produced powerful efforts to create a new model for the post-cold-war American city. The most obvious of these is Chicago's Millennium Park, a somewhat traditional arrangement of cultural buildings and sprawling lawns built on top of a derelict rail yard. Completed in 2004, the park is mobbed with office workers and tourists on an average weekday. It feels as if it has been part of the city's life for decades. 
 Its uncommon power, though, stems from the symbiotic relationship between opposing architectural visions: the rambunctious steel forms of Frank Gehry's Pritzker Pavilion and Renzo Piano's glass-and-steel addition to the Art Institute of Chicago. The two -- one a vision of riotous emotions, the other of quiet serenity -- square off directly across from each other. And they lock the park into a larger urban composition of mismatched late-19th-century and early-20th-century office buildings and 1980s towers.
 A cultural district in Miami -- the only one still in the planning stages that looks likely to move ahead since it was financed years ago -- will take a similarly eclectic approach. The project will stand on a 30-acre landfill framed by Biscayne Bay and what was once the city's main commercial boulevard. A strip of undulating dunes, which block the view from the boulevard and made the area a hot spot for crime in the 1970s and 1980s, will be removed. New science and art museums are to be tucked alongside the park. As in Chicago, the buildings will present contrasting architectural styles that confront each other across a plaza. The science museum, by Grimshaw Architects, is all curves; Herzog & de Meuron's cheekier art museum, raised up on a concrete plinth, resembles a cold-war-era performing arts center that has been surgically reconstructed and then swallowed up by the surrounding park.
 Both the Chicago and Miami developments reflect the evolution of architectural thought at the beginning of the current millennium. Both favor heterogeneity over conformity; both seek to express the clash of values that define a historic city rather than suppress it. At the same time, they are carefully interwoven with the urban fabric that surrounds them.
 But their success has as much to do with context and scale as with the quality of the architecture. Millennium Park and the Miami cultural district abut relatively healthy, historically rich urban districts. And neither is bigger than a few city blocks.
 When an arts district flounders, the causes are often found in the social history of its site. Particularly in the aftermath of the highway construction and slum clearance strategies that reached their height in the Eisenhower era, the question has been not only how to create vibrant public spaces but how to repair social, racial and economic scars that are decades old. 
 This was especially true in Dallas, where the freeways that border the arts district site to the north and east were built with money partly from the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act. In a pattern repeated across America, these projects were bulldozed through thriving African-American and Latino communities, cutting them off from the city center. By the time planners unveiled the first proposals to build a new arts district, in the 1970s, much of the site had deteriorated into a wasteland of empty lots, industrial buildings and corner bars. Planners envisioned a necklace of cultural institutions along a 68-acre site that extends east from the Museum of Art along a tree-lined street.
 The results could have been worse. The enormous steel canopy of Norman Foster's opera house has a pleasant, almost affectionate relationship with the low Cubist forms of Brad Cloepfil's performing and visual arts high school next door. Rem Koolhaas's and Joshua Prince-Ramus's cool and somber aluminum-clad theater tower across the street, by contrast, is an aggressive rejection of the visual noise that many have come to expect when a star architect is hired to design a cultural building. What's more, the new buildings sit comfortably alongside older structures like I.M. Pei's concert hall and Edward Larrabee Barnes's art museum, extending the conversation across generations as well as contrasting architectural philosophies. 
 What the planners could not easily overcome, however, was the scale of destruction, and the resistance many felt toward breaking down old barriers. Nearly 30 years after the plan was unveiled, most of the commercial lots remain empty. And the divisions that continue to separate this enclave of high culture from the nearby communities remain deep.
 No project better illustrates these tensions than Los Angeles' downtown arts district, which was conceived in the 1950s as an elite cultural citadel fortified against the surrounding Latino neighborhoods. To build it, civic leaders approved the bulldozing of a sprawling, decayed residential neighborhood of two-story Victorian houses. The Music Center, completed in the 1960s, was isolated on a concrete base in the style of Lincoln Center. The Harbor Freeway, partly built around the same time, cut the site off from the city to the west. The area's isolation was further reinforced in the 1980s with the construction of sterile corporate towers and plazas, which formed a barrier against the Latino communities that occupied the old historic corridor nearby.
 Walt Disney Concert Hall, completed six years ago, was the first sincere effort to reverse this trend. Frank Gehry went to great pains to fuse his building with the city around it. The ribbons of shiny stainless steel that envelop the structure lift up seductively along Grand Avenue to draw passersby into the lobby. Just above, the facade swells out to echo the curves of the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion next door, a gesture that gives the old structure sudden, unexpected grace.
 But if Mr. Gehry's creation has brought instant vitality to the street, it also demonstrates architecture's limits as an agent for social healing. Even as the building was rising, Mr. Gehry and a choir of other voices were lobbying hard to break down the physical barriers that isolated the avenue from the rest of downtown. Many of the solutions were obvious. Mr. Gehry produced an elegant design to bring the Music Center's plaza down to the level of the avenue. Civic leaders envisioned a park that would extend east from the base of the Music Center down to City Hall, linking the arts district to downtown's civic core. So far these proposals have come to naught, and just as in Dallas, vast lots bulldozed decades ago remain undeveloped. 
 The failures in Dallas and Los Angeles, in the end, have less to do with too much creative freedom, the quality of the buildings and the master plan, or even the basic concept of an arts district, than with scale and context. They reflect the long battle between those who want to tear down old barriers and those who simply want to replace them with new ones. Solving that conflict will be left to a future epoch.

HEADLINE: San Jose Improves Its Airport; Now, Just Flights Lag

BYLINE: By VINDU GOEL

 BODY:
These days, it is only a slight exaggeration to say that Mineta San Jose International Airport, which serves the 10th-largest city in the United States, offers nonstop service to nowhere.
 Located about 50 miles from San Francisco, San Jose views itself as the capital of Silicon Valley and once boasted of direct flights to foreign capitals like Tokyo, Taipei and Paris.
Now, it relies on two daily flights to Mexico to justify the ''international'' in its name. Although flights to California cities are abundant, San Jose travelers can board only one plane a day to the East Coast -- a red-eye to New York on JetBlue Airways, which recently decided to cancel all other service from the city. 
 The recession, which has battered the finances of the region's technology companies as well as the airlines, deserves some of the blame. Over the past two years, San Jose's airport has lost 22 percent of its available seats as embattled airlines try to cram more passengers onto fewer planes, according to data from OAG Worldwide. The airport in nearby Oakland has been hit even worse. 
 But the weak economy is not the whole story. Capacity at San Francisco International Airport, the main airport in the region, remains at 2007 levels, as Virgin America started service and other carriers decided to consolidate Bay Area flights there.
 No, the decline of San Jose's airport really reflects a broader struggle for respect. San Jose is the area's biggest city, with about one million residents and a dynamic hometown industry, but San Francisco is the belle of the bay. And no one will let San Jose forget it.
 ''It's true of everything we do in San Jose -- we're overshadowed by San Francisco,'' said Terry Christensen, a professor of political science at San Jose State University. ''It's a matter-of-fact, working town.'' 
 San Jose's shrinking air service comes even as its airport will soon look better than ever. A $1.3 billion makeover is replacing old-fashioned rolling jet stairs and cramped check-in areas with modern jet bridges, sunny concourses, free wireless Internet and the latest technology to detect bombs in baggage.
 ''We have not had a good product,'' admitted Bill Sherry, the director of aviation.
 Residents have agitated for a better airport for years, but when Mr. Sherry took over in 2005, he quickly realized that the airlines and travelers that pay for the airport's operations through rents and fees did not need -- and could not afford -- the city's planned $4.5 billion expansion. The project was scaled back. As the recession sliced into revenues, the airport laid off workers and cut costs to keep on track. 
 When the upgrade is completed next summer, Mr. Sherry said he would finally have something worth peddling. ''Now, you've got to market it,'' he said.
 It will not be an easy sell. From a practical perspective, the Bay Area's three airports are close enough to one another that most travelers are willing to drive to whichever meets their price and scheduling needs.
 ''When you have three good-to-great options all within a half-hour drive, no one owns the market,'' said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, an association of the area's largest companies.
 Mr. Guardino said local business leaders were far more concerned with other issues, like getting more visas for skilled immigrants and extending the Bay Area Rapid Transit train line to San Jose. 
 Chuck Reed, the mayor of San Jose, which owns the airport, also has bigger worries. A practical nuts-and-bolts manager who rarely flies, Mr. Reed is trying to figure out how to close a projected $90 million budget deficit for the next fiscal year, lure new businesses to empty office towers and bring the Oakland A's to a new stadium in downtown San Jose. Since the airport is not paid for by taxpayer money, it is not a pressing issue. 
 Meanwhile, the dot-com bust and the current recession have taught many businesses to get by with far less flying. Cisco Systems, a network technology giant that employs nearly 18,000 at and near its San Jose headquarters, has permanently cut its travel budget in half, replacing much of it with videoconferencing, which is a major Cisco product line.
 John T. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said his employees could still get where they needed to go. And he sympathizes with the financial straits of the airlines. ''Flights will be provided when there is traffic to go,'' Mr. Chambers said.
 JetBlue, which is canceling its three daily flights from San Jose to Long Beach, said they had never been profitable. The carrier has decided to reallocate its Long Beach slots to flights from San Francisco and Oakland.
 More ominously for San Jose's expansion prospects, a JetBlue spokesman, Sebastian White, said the airline learned that few people, especially on the East Coast, knew where the city is. ''San Francisco is the city that our customers prefer to fly to,'' Mr. White said.
 American Airlines, which had a mini-hub in San Jose a decade ago, has steadily downsized it since the Sept. 11 attacks. This summer, it eliminated its popular twice-daily ''nerd bird'' service from San Jose to the Texas technology hub of Austin. American now has just 19 flights a day from San Jose and will cut that to 14 in November.
 Daniel P. Garton, executive vice president of marketing at American, said the airline recently decided to concentrate more on serving Dallas, Chicago, Miami, New York and Los Angeles. 
 ''We believe it's important to win some battles as opposed to being mediocre across the board,'' Mr. Garton said. ''It's a matter of where you're going to make your stand.''
 If such trends continue, San Jose could end up with only low-cost airlines like Southwest running short, frequent flights. 
 ''It's almost like San Jose is a rail station,'' said Manoj Khiani, who lives in San Jose and takes 40 to 50 plane trips a year as director of sales engineering for Liquid Machines.
 Southwest, which operates about half of all flights from San Jose, has maintained virtually all of its service there over the past two years. Unlike many rivals, it says it can make money flying planes that are two-thirds full, and offering high-frequency service within California is a key part of its strategy.
 San Jose is ''operationally a very reliable airport,'' said Martin Pritchard, who plans capacity at Southwest. ''We try not to fix it if it isn't broken.''
 Alaska Airlines, a regional carrier with significantly lower costs than American, also sees opportunity in San Jose. It jumped in with a flight to Austin when American pulled out and plans to add a second one in March. 
 ''We have been working on the West Coast high-tech community for years and years,'' said Steve Jarvis, vice president of marketing, sales and customer experience at Alaska. ''There definitely is a market there.'' 
 Those small signs of support -- and indications that the economy is picking up -- give Mr. Sherry hope that he will be able to reverse San Jose's traffic slide.
 Once the construction is finished, he intends to approach local business leaders and show them how much they would save -- in money and valuable employee time -- if they could help him persuade airlines to add flights to San Jose.
 Mr. Sherry predicts that the airlines will also realize they are fighting a destructive price war in San Francisco and shift some flights to the south.
 For Mr. Khiani, more flights would be nice, but the airport, like the city, does the job well enough. ''The people who chose to live in San Jose know what they signed up for -- same as the people who live in Jersey, right?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Putting a Smile on Drivers' Faces

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
SINCE it arrived on the scene in 2004, the Mazda 3 has performed a valuable public service, showing Americans that compact cars aren't always about lowered expectations or lowest price. 
 Like the Mini Cooper, the tidy Mazda demonstrated that small and premium can coexist happily. Handsome, smartly appointed and more fun to drive than its rivals from Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai, Ford or Chevrolet, the Mazda 3 lapped up praise and awards. Among its achievements, this well-bred underdog has done stints atop Canada's best-seller list in 2009, displacing the Honda Civic from its perennial perch. In the United States, the 3 is Mazda's go-to player, representing 44 percent of the company's sales last year. 
 Like the previous version, the new-generation model generally costs more than its thrift-focused competition. When loaded up with options or high-performance tweaks, a 3 can top $25,000, pushing it out of reach for some people. But as with the Mazda 3's closest competitors -- the equally well-equipped Volkswagen Golf and Jetta -- a lot of customers have found the Mazda to be a persuasive example of getting what you pay for. 
 The new 3 still shares its refined platform with the European-market Ford Focus as well as Volvo's stylish C30 hatchback and S40 sedan. (The kissing-cousin relationship springs from Ford's stakes in Mazda and Volvo). 
 Among the advantages of that relationship is a driving experience reminiscent of the small-but-satisfying Euro cars you may have rented to explore Provence or tour Tuscany. Unfortunately, the restyled 3 looks like one of those callow tour guides who, for no apparent reason, wears an ever-present grin. 
 Much has been said about the car's new face, which the company says is meant to be polarizing. (Mission accomplished, Mazda!) The front end does help to route more air over the hood and sides, reducing aerodynamic drag. On the other hand, friends who saw the car likened it to a baby baleen whale ingesting krill, or a loopy jack-o'-lantern.
 Though the smiley face gives some viewers the willies, the rest of the restyling improves an already endearing car, whether in the form of a hatchback or a sedan. Flared fenders nod to the Mazda RX-8 sports car, and new creases in the sheet metal add definition along the sides. Exterior dimensions are subtly changed, including a 3-inch stretch in length, though there's negligible gain in passenger or cargo space. 
 The remade cabin does its bit to uphold Mazda's reputation. Instead of the Wal-Mart malaise that wafts through some rivals, the 3 draws you in with smart design, expensive-looking materials and classy switches. 
 An owner of modest means could proudly invite a parent or a finicky boss into the passenger seat, even in the basic 3i Sport sedan, which at $17,575 is the least-expensive version available with an automatic transmission. (For the devoted bottom-line shopper, a bare-bones 3i SV sedan starts at $15,795 with a 5-speed manual, though you're unlikely to find many of those in showrooms.) 
 Plusher models, including the Grand Touring, offer options that can't be found in many competitors in this class, including leather seats, 8-way power memory seats; dual-zone climate control; a navigation system; keyless locking; xenon adaptive headlamps that pivot up to 15 degrees around curves; and a Bose surround-sound audio system. The top-shelf Grand Touring model with an automatic transmission kicks the cost of entry to $23,050.
 Standard features include four-wheel antilock disc brakes with brake assist; six air bags, including a new faster-inflating side-curtain design; and active head restraints. 
 The seats are generously bolstered for driving hijinks, with an especially long bottom cushion. The back seat is a bit claustrophobic because of the high window sill and smallish side glass, but there's room for two adults. Folding the rear seat, which is split 70/30, offers plenty of space for not just groceries but for bicycles or other bulky gear. 
 The Mazda takes a novel approach to navigation. To keep the option more affordable, the GPS unit combines steering wheel controls with a miniature screen that peers from beneath the arch of the dash. It's part of a $1,195 technology package, which also adds keyless locking, a Sirius Satellite Radio subscription and an alarm. Surprisingly, the steering wheel controls proved reasonably efficient for adjusting the screen or entering destinations.
 That screen, smaller than a postcard and not very close to the driver's eyes, is tricky to read and translate while you're in motion, though it does a bang-up job at displaying trip and audio information. There's another quirk: the driver's red-and-blue analog gauges seem either too dim or searingly bright, with little adjustment in between. 
 Lower-price models get an engine carried over from 2009, a 2-liter 4-cylinder with an adequate 148 horsepower and 135 pound-feet of torque. That engine is rated at 24 miles a gallon in the city and 33 in highway driving, with a new 5-speed automatic helping to raise mileage by 10 percent from last year. 
 People who favor the practical hatchback model have only one engine choice, though a good one: the 167-horsepower 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, a bored-and-stroked upgrade from the previous generation's 2.3-liter unit. The bigger engine is extremely smooth, with generous midrange torque urging the Mazda to 60 miles per hour from a stop in the mid-seven-second range. 
 For buyers who want to drive the Mazda at maximum capability but don't want the runaway-terrier personality of the hard-edged Mazdaspeed 3, the 2.5-liter is a must-have. Let's hope that in the future Mazda will give hatchback fans a less expensive admission ticket by offering a hatch with the base engine.
 The winding road is where the Mazda 3 really pulls away from the budget-car herd, revealing a pleasing level of sophistication. A new electro-hydraulic rack-and-pinion steering replaces a fully hydraulic unit. While its effort is light, the sensitive feel and limber suspension allow you to point-and-shoot the Mazda with joyful precision. Even in the low-power base model, once you're up to speed the 3 mows down preconceptions of how an economy car is supposed to handle.
 The clutch is a tad stiff, but the manual shifter's action is direct and trustworthy. And even the automatic-transmission models are equipped for fun: the adaptive controls recognize when you are braking hard into a corner and can automatically downshift to provide engine braking, all while selecting the proper gear to shoot out of the turn. 
 Even if the new 3 is not the roomiest or cheapest car in the compact class, it's about the most fun you can have without blowing the budget on the Mazdaspeed version, on a VW GTI or on all-wheel-drive assassins like the Subaru WRX STI and Mitsubishi Evolution. 
 If only we could do something about that face.
 INSIDE TRACK: 3's the charm.

HEADLINE: In Defense of the 'Balloon Boy' Dad

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
FOR a country desperate for good news, the now-deflated ''balloon boy'' spectacle would seem to be the perfect tonic. As Wolf Blitzer of CNN summed up the nation's unrestrained joy upon learning that the imperiled boy had never been in any peril whatsoever: ''All of us are so excited that little Falcon is fine.''
 Then came even better news. After little Falcon revealed to Blitzer that his family ''did this for the show,'' we could all luxuriate in a warm bath of moral superiority. No matter what our own faults as parents, we could never top Richard Heene, who mercilessly exploited his child for fame and profit. Nor could we ever be as craven as the news media, especially cable television, which dumped a live broadcast of President Obama in New Orleans to track the supersized Jiffy Pop bag floating over Colorado. 
 Or such are the received lessons of this tale. 
 Certainly the ''balloon boy'' incident is a reflection of our time -- much as the radio-induced ''War of the Worlds'' panic dramatized America's jitters on the eve of World War II, or the national preoccupation with the now-forgotten Congressman Gary Condit signaled America's pre-9/11 drift into escapism and complacency in the summer of 2001. But to see what ''balloon boy'' says about 2009, you have to look past the sentimental moral absolutes. You have to muster some sympathy for the devil of the piece, the Bad Dad. And you can't grant blanket absolution to those in the American audience who smugly blame Heene and television exclusively for the entire embarrassing episode.
 It would be lovely, for instance, to believe that cable audiences doubled in size that afternoon because they were rooting for little Falcon's welfare. But as Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler would say on Weekend Update at ''Saturday Night Live,'' ''Really?!?'' Many of those viewers were driven by the same bloodlust that spawns rubberneckers at every highway accident: the hope of witnessing the graphic remains of a crash, not a soft landing. 
 It would also be nice to think that the ''balloon boy'' viewers were the innocent victims of a dazzling Houdini-class feat of wizardry -- a ''massive fraud,'' as Bill O'Reilly thundered. But even slightly jaundiced onlookers might have questioned how a balloon could waft buoyantly through the skies for hours with a 6-year-old boy hidden within its contours. That so few did is an indication of how practiced we are at suspending disbelief when watching anything labeled news, whether the subject is W.M.D.'s in Iraq or celebrity gossip in Hollywood.
 ''They put on a very good show for us, and we bought it,'' the local sheriff, Jim Alderden, said last weekend, when he alleged that ''balloon boy'' was a hoax. His words could stand as the epitaph for an era. 
 In this case, the show wasn't even that good. But, as usual, the news media nursed it along, enlisting as sales reps for the smoke and mirrors. While the incident unfolded, most TV anchors hyped rather than questioned the aeronautical viability of a vehicle resembling the flying saucers in Ed Wood's camp 1950s sci-fi potboiler, ''Plan 9 From Outer Space.'' But no sooner had the balloon been punctured than the press was caught in another flimflam. Reuters and CNBC delivered the bombshell that the United States Chamber of Commerce had abruptly reversed its intransigent opposition to climate-change legislation. The ''spokesperson'' source turned out to be the invention of liberal activists who had attempted to stage a prank press conference at Washington's National Press Club.
 Next to the other hoaxes and fantasies that have been abetted by the news media in recent years, both the ''balloon boy'' and Chamber of Commerce ruses are benign. The Colorado balloon may have led to the rerouting of flights and the wasteful deployment of law enforcement resources. But at least it didn't lead the country into fiasco the way George W. Bush's flyboy spectacle on an aircraft carrier helped beguile most of the Beltway press and too much of the public into believing that the mission had been accomplished in Iraq. The Chamber of Commerce stunt was a blip of a business news hoax next to the constant parade of carnival barkers who flogged empty stocks on cable during the speculative Wall Street orgies of the dot-com and housing booms.
 As ''balloon boy'' played out, the White House opened fire on one purveyor of fictional news, Fox News, where ''tea party'' protests are inflated into a national rebellion rivaling the Civil War and where Glenn Beck routinely claims Obama is perpetrating a conspiracy to bring fascism to America. But the White House's argument is diluted by the different, if less malevolently partisan, fictions that turn up on Fox's competitors. On CNN, for instance, Lou Dobbs provided a platform for the nuts questioning Obama's citizenship. When an ABC News correspondent insisted that Fox was ''one of our sister organizations'' in an exchange with the president's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, last week, he wasn't joking.
 Richard Heene is the inevitable product of this reigning culture, where ''news,'' ''reality'' television and reality itself are hopelessly scrambled and the warp-speed imperatives of cable-Internet competition allow no time for fact checking. Norman Lear, about the only prominent American to express any empathy for little Falcon's father, vented on The Huffington Post, calling out CNN, MSNBC, Fox, NBC, ABC and CBS alike for their role in ''creating a climate that mistakes entertainment for news.'' This climate, he argued, ''all but seduces a Richard and Mayumi Heene into believing they are -- even if what they dream up to qualify is a hoax -- entitled to their 15 minutes.''
 None of this absolves Heene of blame for the damage he may have inflicted on the children he grotesquely used as a supporting cast in his schemes. But stupid he's not. He knew how easy it would be to float ''balloon boy'' when the demarcation between truth and fiction has been obliterated. 
 There's also some poignancy in his determination to grab what he and many others see as among the last accessible scraps of the American dream. As a freelance construction worker and handyman, he couldn't find much employment in an economy where construction is frozen and homeowners are more worried about losing their homes than fixing them. Once his appetite had been whetted by two histrionic appearances on ''Wife Swap,'' an ABC reality program, it's easy to see why Heene would turn his life and that of his family into a nonstop audition for more turns in the big tent of the reality media circus.
 That circus is among the country's last dependable job engines. More than a quarter of prime-time broadcast television is devoted to reality programs. And so, with only a high-school education, Heene tried to reinvent himself as a cable-ready tornado-chasing scientist. Robert Thomas, a Web entrepreneur who collaborated with Heene on a pitch to ABC for a science-based reality show, saw the ''balloon boy'' stunt as a sad response to his economic plight. ''I think in this case the desperation was too much for Richard to bear,'' Thomas said in an interview with Gawker.com. (It's no less desperate a sign of the times that Thomas insisted on being paid for his interview.)
 Heene is a direct descendant of those Americans of the Great Depression who fantasized, usually in vain, that they might find financial salvation if only they could grab a spotlight in show business. Some aspired to the ''American Idol'' of the day -- ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour,'' a hugely popular weekly talent contest on network radio. Others traveled the seedy dance marathon circuit, entering 24/7 endurance contests that promised food and prize money in exchange for freak-show degradation and physical punishment. Horace McCoy's 1935 novel memorializing this Depression milieu was aptly titled ''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' 
 In 1939, the year that John Steinbeck published ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' his Depression classic about dispossessed Dust Bowl sharecroppers migrating to California's Salinas Valley in search of work, Nathanael West published ''The Day of the Locust,'' about those equally destitute Americans who traveled to Hollywood hoping to land in the movies. ''They have been cheated and betrayed,'' West wrote. ''They have slaved and saved for nothing.'' He could have been describing Americans who lost their jobs, homes and 401(k)'s in our own Great Recession. 
 The role models for today's desperate fame seekers are ''Jon & Kate Plus 8,'' not Gable and Lombard. But even if they catch a break, as Heene did on ''Wife Swap,'' they still may end up betrayed by a stacked system. As The Times reported in August, many reality shows are as cruel as the old dance marathons. The usual Hollywood workplace rules allowing breaks for rest or meals often don't apply. Nor, sometimes, does the minimum wage. Let 'em eat fame.
 If Heene's balloon was empty, so were the toxic financial instruments, inflated by the thin air of unsupported debt, that cratered the economy he inhabits. The press hyped both scams, and the public eagerly bought both. But between the bogus balloon and the banks' bubble, there's no contest as to which did the most damage to the country. The ultimate joke is that Heene, unlike the reckless gamblers at the top of Citigroup and A.I.G., may be the one with a serious shot at ending up behind bars.

HEADLINE: The Problem With Mandates

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
 AMERICANS seem to like the idea of broadening health insurance coverage, but they may not want to be forced to buy it. With health care costs high and rising, such government mandates would make many people worse off.
 The proposals now before Congress would require just about everyone to buy health insurance or to get it through their employers -- which would generally result in lower wages. In other words, millions of people would be compelled to spend lots of money on something they previously did not want, at least not at prevailing prices.
 Estimates of this burden vary, but for a family of four it could range up to $14,000 a year over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Right now, many Americans take the gamble of going without insurance, just as many of us take our chances with how much we drive or how little we exercise. 
 The paradox is this: Reform advocates start with anecdotes about the underprivileged who are uninsured, then turn around and propose something that would hurt at least some members of that group.
 To ease the burdens of the insurance mandate, the reform proposals call for varying levels of subsidy. In some versions, such as the current Senate bill, subsidies are handed out to families with incomes as high as $88,000 a year. How long will it be before just about everyone wants further assistance, and this new form of entitlement spending spins out of control? It's possible to lower insurance subsidies, but then the insurance mandate would impose a bigger burden on the people we are trying to help.
 A subtler problem is what economists call ''implicit marginal tax rates.''
 The fiscal reality is that not all income groups can receive equal subsidies; as a family earns more, its subsidy would probably decrease, eventually falling to zero. But then we are taking money away from the poor as they climb into higher income categories. This is a disincentive to earn more, and the strength of the disincentive increases with our initial generosity. For many people, the health insurance aid would phase out when food stamps, housing vouchers and the earned income tax credit also end and the personal income tax kicks in. 
 This structure of incentives would likely discourage many parents from earning a better life for their children. Congress could tweak the subsidies so they don't phase out so quickly, but then we're back to very high fiscal costs and subsidies for many families in the higher income classes. 
 Defenders of a broad health insurance mandate argue that it will lower average costs in the health care market. The claim is that many of the uninsured are young, healthy or both, and that bringing them into the insurance pool might lower average premiums by spreading risk across low-cost groups. Yet Massachusetts has had a health insurance mandate for several years and this cost-saving mechanism does not appear to be kicking in. 
 At this point, it seems more plausible that the cost of health insurance will keep rising, just as the costs of health care services have continued to climb. The upshot is that the burdens of mandatory purchase, the subsidy costs and the associated implicit marginal tax rates will all increase, eventually to the point of unsustainability. 
 A further problem is ''mandate creep,'' which we've seen at the state level, as groups lobby for various types of coverage -- whether for acupuncture, alcoholism and fertility treatments, for example, or for chiropractor services or marriage counseling.
 There are now about 1,500 insurance mandates among the various states, and hundreds of others are under consideration. The dynamic at work here is that the affected groups have a big incentive to push for mandates, while most other people are unaware of the specific issues and don't become involved.
 Because mandates don't stay modest for long, health insurance would become all the more expensive. The Obama administration's cost estimates haven't considered these longer-run ''political economy'' issues. 
 IF there is a problem with mandates, why do they seem to work in countries like Switzerland and the Netherlands? One answer is that mandates are more effective when health care cost inflation is under control, and both of those countries fare better at technocracy than the larger, less tightly ordered United States.
 And mandates also fare better in those nations because of their greater equality of incomes. In other words, it's less of a stretch to offer poorer people coverage that is roughly comparable to that of the wealthy. 
 If anything, however, European mandates will face growing problems, as health care cost inflation is spreading globally. 
 We're often told that America should copy the health care institutions of Western Europe. Yet we're failing to copy the single most important lesson from those systems -- namely, to put cost control first. Instead, we're putting our foot on the gas pedal and ratcheting up the fiscal pressures on the system, in the hope that someday, somehow, it will all work out. 
 As it stands, we're on the verge of enacting a policy that is due to explode, penalizing many of the very people that it was ostensibly designed to help.

HEADLINE: Can Atlantic City Raise the Stakes?

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

DATELINE: Atlantic City 

 BODY:
 CARS and buses cruising down the Atlantic City Expressway pass billboards promoting ''$150,000 Money Madness,'' casinos that have ''so many ways to spin and win,'' and places offering ''free buffets on Monday and Wednesday.'' Closer to the heart of the city, where a long strand of casinos sits tight against the ocean, yet another sign proclaims: ''Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada.''
 What? 
 The billboard -- a promotion by Harrah's, a casino operator with strongholds here and in Las Vegas that is offering to send frequent gamblers out West -- smacks of an underlying and unavoidable vibe in Atlantic City these days: Most people would rather be anywhere else. 
 Talk about a city with an inferiority complex.
 Just a few years ago, Atlantic City was boomtown U.S.A. Day-tripping retirees plunked quarter after quarter into slot machines at the casino warehouses lining the Boardwalk. The city was in the midst of a huge building expansion as casinos invested billions of dollars to build new hotel towers and to dress up fading interiors. Plans for a handful of megacasinos were on the drawing board, promising to bring lots of Las Vegas-style sex and sizzle to this seaside resort. 
 Today, Atlantic City, in the eyes of one gambling executive, Tim Wilmott, is in a ''death spiral.''
 Rows of slot machines stand eerily empty. Over the summer, the Tropicana was sold in bankruptcy court; another 3 of the town's 11 casinos are currently under bankruptcy protection. The lender for yet another, Resorts International, is in talks to take it over and could by year-end. Resorts was the first casino outside of Las Vegas to offer legal gambling, in 1978.
 Many of the rooms stuffed inside luxurious towers built during the high times are empty during the week. And plans for a majority of the megacasinos have been shelved. Only one, the Revel, is under construction -- and many question whether its developers will be able to raise enough money to finish the project.
 The economic slowdown has shown that the gambling industry is not quite as recession-proof as was so long believed. Gambling on the Las Vegas Strip is falling on a par with Atlantic City, and many other gambling locales nationwide are also hurting. But Atlantic City's challenges may be greater than those faced elsewhere. A second blow -- and one that most of the local casino operators here underestimated -- is coming from gambling operations that opened in recent years in nearby states. 
 Retirees who once hopped on buses to Atlantic City to play slots for a few hours can now happily play much closer to home -- in eastern Pennsylvania or the New York metro area, for example. American Indian casinos in Connecticut, while struggling mightily themselves, have also sucked business away. And some analysts say the tough times in Atlantic City may get worse as states like Maryland move closer to offering gambling and new slot facilities open near Philadelphia in the next few years.
 So how to fix -- or even save -- Atlantic City has invited much hand-wringing and debate here. 
 Some pin their hopes on the completion of the Revel, arguing that it will drive curious gamblers back into the city's arms. Others suggest that state regulatory changes allowing for different casino and hotel layouts could attract new construction. Still others say the city has to think even bigger -- maybe theme-park big -- to reinvent itself and to bring in visitors who want to do more than just gamble.
 More than just casinos have a lot riding on the next big bet. With gambling revenue down in New Jersey, so is the tax revenue that supports programs for the elderly and the disabled in the state. And the industry, which is one of the state's largest employers, has cut its work force to 39,000 from nearly 50,000 in 2003.
 Mr. Wilmott, the president and chief operating officer of Penn National Gaming, has gambling operations elsewhere in the country, but his company has passed on opening anything here. He views his ''death spiral'' prediction, made at an industry panel discussion last spring, as a rallying cry for local and state government leaders to clean up the city so that visitors feel safe outside of casino walls.
 Others are convinced that Atlantic City's descent can be slowed or stopped. 
 ''We need as a state and as a community to be a little more business-friendly with the industry and do everything we can to foster new development,'' says Jim Whelan, a former Atlantic City mayor who is now a New Jersey state senator. ''When people describe the city as being in a death spiral, that's a pretty big wake-up call.'' 
 ''SO are you writing a story about the death of Atlantic City?'' asks Nick Ribis, a glint in his eyes as he smoothes down his suit and takes a seat in his small office in Manhattan just moments after showing off pictures of his grandchildren. 
 ''Atlantic City has been up, down and everywhere in between. But let me tell you this,'' says Mr. Ribis, leaning forward and peering out from beneath a helmet of perfectly coiffed silver hair. ''There is a future for Atlantic City.''
 Mr. Ribis, 65, has seen the ups, downs and in-betweens of Atlantic City over the years. A former lawyer who spent years inside Donald Trump's casino and real estate operation, Mr. Ribis today oversees the troubled Resorts casino in Atlantic City. His stake, along with that of the private equity firm that owns the property, Colony Capital -- run by the golden-touch real-estate investor Thomas J. Barrack Jr. -- would be wiped out if Colony handed over Resort's keys to its lender later this year. 
 The Resorts casino has been hit harder than most in the economic downturn. Its revenue, known as ''casino win,'' is down 18 percent this year through the end of September, versus an average decline of 14 percent for the city's 11 casinos, according to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
 But as is the case with so many other casino properties, the much more pressing problem for Resorts is its debt load. In March 2007, just before the credit bubble burst, Resorts took out a $350 million loan with a lending affiliate of Credit Suisse. It used the money to refinance its debt, expand and refurbish parts of the hotel, and to make a $38 million payment to Colony and its private equity investors. Colony originally bought Resorts for $144 million in 2000, of which $60 million was its equity investment. Colony declined to comment. 
 Resorts hasn't made any interest payments on the $350 million loan in nearly a year, hence the likelihood that its bank will take it over. (Separately, Colony and Mr. Ribis are co-owners of the Atlantic City Hilton, which missed an interest payment on its debt this summer and was in default on a $348 million loan. In filings with the casino commission, the company said it was in negotiations with its lender to modify the loan's terms.)
 All of this is a far cry from the hubbub surrounding the Resorts casino when it opened its doors in 1978 as the first cash cow created by the legalization of gambling in New Jersey two years earlier.
 Billed as a ''great experiment'' in urban redevelopment, legalized gambling was pitched to voters as an effort to reverse Atlantic City's long decline from a Victorian- and vaudeville-era destination of choice.
 When Resorts opened on Memorial Day 31 years ago, the singer Steve Lawrence, who, with his wife, Eydie Gorme, was the hotel's stage show, lost the first $10 wagered at the casino, according to a news report at the time. Many others, like Stephen Meszaros, stood in long lines outside for their chance to go inside and gamble. 
 ''It was so crowded that they had to let two people out before they would let one person in,'' recalls Mr. Meszaros, 87, who travels twice a week by bus to Atlantic City from his home near Woodbridge, N.J. But he says he doesn't spend much time at Resorts. ''Resorts has been falling apart,'' he says, shrugging.
 These days, what action there is in Atlantic City happens two miles down the road at the sleek and sexy Borgata.
 Early on a weekday night, the Borgata is already hopping. A blond woman in a short -- very short -- electric-blue dress teeters on white pumps while a Britney Spears song pipes in on speakers overhead. The slot machines and card tables are bustling. A long line snakes around the casino's noodle restaurant while other visitors pay $70 for the lobster pot pie at Michael Mina's establishment.
 While other Atlantic City casinos have seen double-digit drops in casino wins, or revenue, so far this year, the Borgata is down less than 5 percent. Even so, the Water Club, a $400 million hotel addition to the Borgata, remains largely empty on weeknights during the post-summer lull.
 Nevertheless, the Borgata's relative strength is testimony to how much of a game-changer it was for Atlantic City. When it opened in 2003, the property, a venture of Boyd Gaming and MGM Mirage, was the first new hotel in Atlantic City in 13 years. 
 Featuring high-end restaurants, shopping and suites, the Borgata showed that a bit of the Las Vegas formula -- glitz married to revenue streaming from nongambling activities -- could succeed here. ''The Borgata had an entirely different business model than any other property in Atlantic City had ever adopted,'' says Michael Pollock, a managing director with the Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm. ''There was pent-up demand for something different here.''
 The race was on. In the months and years after Borgata opened, numerous casinos in Atlantic City, including the Trump Taj Mahal, Resorts and Harrah's, built new hotel towers and updated older facilities. A host of other casino operators jockeyed for property and unveiled plans to build futuristic and sleek casinos that they vowed would transform the city.
 MGM Atlantic City, for instance, considered a project estimated at $5 billion that would have included three hotel towers, the largest casino floor in town, 5,000 slot machines and 200 game tables. Last fall, MGM postponed those plans.
 And still empty is the lot where the former Sands Hotel Casino stood until Pinnacle Entertainment demolished it in a spectacular fireworks show in October 2007. While a Web site for the project contends that ''excitement is building,'' a spokeswoman for the company said the project is on ''indefinite hold'' because of the credit crisis.
 In fact, only one of the planned luxury megacasinos -- the Revel -- actually survived to begin construction.
 A sleek glass structure soaring into the skyline at the far northeastern edge of the Boardwalk, the Revel, with its planned 1,900 rooms, has been topped off at 47 floors, and its developers say they expect to enclose the top floors by the end of November. Even then, the developers still need to raise an additional $1 billion or so to finish the project.
 Some gambling executives question whether the Revel will ever be completed and, even if it is, whether it will deliver hoped-for crowds or simply split or steal away Borgata's upscale audience. Others say that the Revel must be finished because the city's future is riding on it.
 ''The best thing that could happen is to make sure that the Revel project is completed,'' says Mr. Pollock. ''If there's one thing on the horizon that can be a game changer right now, that's it.''
 GUSTS of wind whip through an open construction elevator as it slowly climbs the glass exterior of the Revel. Kevin DeSanctis, wearing heavy boots, a construction vest and hard hat, smiles broadly as the elevator makes its way higher. 
 ''We've been told it's the second-windiest spot in the country,'' explains Mr. DeSanctis, the chief executive of Revel Entertainment and a veteran of the industry, as he steps off the elevator to show a visitor the sweeping views of the city and the ocean from the top of the tower. 
 Back near ground level, as he steps over wires and strides through puddles of water, Mr. DeSanctis lays out his vision for the Revel. Here, he says, spreading his arms in front of a huge cement expanse, will be the casino floor. Up there, pointing several floors higher, a three-story glass nightclub. Here is one of three theater areas, and over there is the indoor pool. Hotel guests will be able to swim under a waterfall to reach the outdoor pool, which will be heated and open all year long, he says.
 His vision expands beyond the Revel's glass walls. On one side, he sees a six-lane highway connecting visitors directly from a major highway to the Revel property. On the other, he sees an expansion of the Boardwalk itself and the addition of several feet of beach. 
 Unfortunately, there's still the $1 billion standing between Mr. DeSanctis and his vision -- that and a number of speculators who have acquired what appear to be shacks right next door to the Revel and are offering them for sale for hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Mr. DeSanctis is asking the city to enforce existing building codes regarding abandoned properties and to put a demolition program in place that would designate the homes as blights and wipe them out.)
 But even if the Revel is completed, is it Atlantic City's salvation? After all, there's little to no consensus among the town's leaders as to what it should become. For decades, Atlantic City's bread-and-butter customer was the day-tripping slot player. But now, competition is drawing that customer away.
 ''We know that the low-end slot customer finds it more convenient to go to Pennsylvania to play,'' said Mark Juliano, the chief executive of Trump Entertainment, which owns three properties in Atlantic City and filed for bankruptcy this year. ''They're not coming now, and I don't think they're ever coming back.''
 Mr. Juliano says Atlantic City needs to become a destination town, a place where visitors want to stay for a few days. ''We are definitely challenged right now,'' he says, ''but what this is doing is helping to force us into that transformation.'' 
 But if the city is to transform itself, others argue, it will need new properties, even beyond the Revel.
 ''A lot of people are saying Revel is going to be the last $1 billion-plus property built anywhere for a while,'' notes Mr. Whelan, the state senator. ''All right, can we get someone to step up and build a $250 million project?'' 
 Still others say the city needs to think even bigger if it truly wants to become a visitor destination.
 ''The last thing we need is another casino in Atlantic City,'' growls Mr. Ribis. ''We have to have something like Opryland. Not another casino. We have to have more than just buses coming in with tourists for a day.''
 ON a sunny weekday afternoon, two Atlantic City patrol cars and a beach buggy screech up to the Bally's hotel and casino on the Boardwalk. As police officers race to the entrance, one draws his weapon, sending tourists scrambling for cover. 
 ''A sign of the times,'' mutters a bystander in a crowd as the police finally usher out a young man in handcuffs who is wanted on a federal warrant and was believed to be in possession of a weapon.
 In a headline-grabbing case, in May of this year, an employee of the Trump Taj Mahal was shot and killed in a back room of that casino. 
 The more things change, the more they stay the same. Even when times were good for the casino industry, Atlantic City struggled to scuff off the grit and grime that has long seemed to be attached to the city. 
 The bulk of the casino taxes are funneled into statewide programs for the elderly and the disabled. Another agency, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, was created in the 1980s with the mandate to oversee the 1.25 percent of gross revenue that casinos have to put into programs it backs. 
 While the C.R.D.A. has financed housing, day-care centers and facilities for the elderly, along with libraries and gardens in Atlantic City itself, others say too much money has been channeled away over the years to projects in wealthier areas, like a community theater in Morristown, N.J.
 ''There are parts of this town that look like downtown Beirut,'' the gambling analyst David Berman of Regal Capital Advisors remarked this spring at a conference here. ''You've got to put money into this town to bring back the luster.''
 If there is any consensus in Atlantic City these days, it is that legislators need to re-evaluate where those funds go. ''The C.R.D.A. tax receipts should be used in Atlantic City before they are used around the state of New Jersey,'' says Mr. Ribis.
 However well intentioned these efforts, some industry analysts have a tough time imagining just what Atlantic City or its casino operators can do to pull the town out of its rut. 
 ''Remember, it took Las Vegas operators to bring the Borgata to Atlantic City,'' says Keith Foley, an analyst at Moody's. At the time, he said, other Atlantic City casino owners ''were like, 'No, nobody wants that -- this is where senior citizens come to play slot machines.' ''
 ''So they missed the ball on that one,'' he says, pausing. ''Whatever visionaries are now in Atlantic City -- if there are any -- they're not speaking up.''

HEADLINE: Christopher Wheeldon, Unbowed

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON wasn't feeling cheerful. As he sat in a restaurant in Lower Manhattan in April, his usual store of ebullience seemed spent as he offered a startlingly frank assessment of his ballet company, Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company, which he started with much fanfare almost three years ago. 
 ''I intend to give it everything I've got,'' he said. ''But I have to be realistic. I don't know whether we will make it.'' 
 Mr. Wheeldon, 36, is one of the most important choreographers in the world, and one of the few considered to have the potential to keep classical dance a vibrant, evolving form. That kind of talent is a scarce commodity in the ballet world, which is ever seeking an heir to Balanchine; just as rare is the expensive proposition of a new company. So Mr. Wheeldon's initial announcement that he was forming his own company was met with a glare of publicity and a flurry of speculative reports about his plans. 
 Mr. Wheeldon, who was the resident choreographer of New York City Ballet from 2001 to 2008, put forward an ambitious vision. He would create a collaborative environment for choreographers, composers, designers and filmmakers; a more empowering role for dancers; make ballet more accessible to audiences and draw in people closer to his own age. As he memorably put it, he wanted to show that ballet need not be ''a big, puffy, pink, glittery nightmare.'' 
 But as Morphoses prepares to open its third season at City Center on Thursday, Mr. Wheeldon is facing a crucial moment in which the viability of his venture seems highly uncertain. His contracts with the Vail International Dance Festival and City Center in New York will end this season, and renewals must be negotiated. In the current economic climate fund-raising possibilities could hardly look more dire. 
 He is nowhere near his original goal of a $5 million annual budget. As a result he has no immediate prospect of hiring the 20 full-time dancers that he promised at the outset, who are vital to establishing a company's identity and to his work as a choreographer. Instead he works with freelance dancers or members of other companies: in the first two seasons his use of stars from City Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Bolshoi and other companies prompted some critics to dismiss the troupe as a pickup company, with no permanent home or artistic ethic of its own. (This year there are fewer big names; most of the 16 dancers are freelancers, half of whom have danced with Morphoses previously.) 
 The stakes are enormous for Mr. Wheeldon personally, but the survival of Morphoses is also a bellwether for the health of the dance scene and the cultural world in New York. Mr. Wheeldon, along with the Russian choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, is considered the most important creative figure working in ballet today. If he can't attract the financing and support for his work, it suggests that New York may no longer be a place where smaller, less institutional performing arts groups -- even one with the built-in marquee value of Mr. Wheeldon -- can be created and flourish.
 ''Chris and his company are one of the great treasures of ballet,'' said George Steel, the artistic director of New York City Opera, who programmed an evening of Wheeldon ballets in 2005, during his tenure as executive director of the Miller Theater. ''Artistically they are essential to the field.''
 Sitting in the restaurant close to his office on lower Fifth Avenue (donated, ''thank heavens,'' he said, by the Broadway producers Shorenstein Hays Nederlander), the always articulate and affable Mr. Wheeldon showed some of the strain of running a precarious venture in the spotlight -- strains, he said, that he was warned of but that he didn't fully comprehend when he left City Ballet. (It's notable that ballet's other shining star, Mr. Ratmansky, made the opposite move, resigning as the director of the Bolshoi Ballet to become artist in residence at Ballet Theater, in order to focus on his own work.)
 ''There was a major reality check,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''I was very protected at City Ballet. I didn't have to worry about where money was coming from to pay for the ballets. I just had to show up and make work. I don't think I took that for granted, but I don't think you are ever prepared for the number of problems that come with running something. It's like waking up every day to an assault course. You jump one hurdle and another immediately pops up.''
 Since he first moved to New York to join the City Ballet in 1993, Mr. Wheeldon has enjoyed consistent acclaim for his innovation, musicality and mastery of the classical vocabulary. A certain toughness of character is suggested by his willingness to take on the more complex role of artistic director. As he has discovered, directing a ballet company isn't simply a matter of choosing dancers and learning to compose stimulating, well-balanced programs. There are contracts to negotiate and visas to obtain for foreign dancers; commissions and royalties to pay; insurance, travel and transportation of sets and costumes to organize; injured dancers to replace, donors to court, letters to write. ''We are producing art at the level of City Ballet, American Ballet Theater,'' Lourdes Lopez, the executive director and co-founder of the company, said recently. ''And there is no one behind the wheel except Chris, me and our company manager. That takes a toll on everyone.'' 
 Mr. Wheeldon's inexperience was most obvious in Morphoses' first season, when the program was crowded by too many unvarying ballets. Reviews -- particularly from the fearsome London critics -- were often unsparing. Clement Crisp, writing in The Financial Times, called it ''a relentlessly pauperish show, its manner anxious, its costuming singularly hideous, its effects small-scale and morose.'' 
 Recalling the critical response to the first Morphoses season, Mr. Wheeldon said: ''I felt like a scolded child. It knocked my confidence for a while.''
 The harsh reaction forced him to think harder about balanced programs. ''Balanchine was really on the money when he said that putting together a program is like balancing a meal,'' he said. ''We want people to understand that there are many facets to ballet. It can go from being a remarkable musical sculpture to something that is cathartic and emotional to a kind of mathematical problem.''
 At City Center this year Mr. Wheeldon designed a first program to pay tribute to the spirit of the Ballets Russes, with his 2008 ''Commedia,'' Mr. Ratmansky's ''Bolero,'' created for the Bolshoi Ballet in 2004, and Morphoses' first commission, from the Australian choreographer Tim Harbour, ''Leaving Songs.'' The second program contains two pieces by Mr. Wheeldon: his new ''Rhapsody Fantaisie,'' to Rachmaninoff's ''Suites for Two Pianos'' and the 2002 ''Continuum,'' to music by Ligeti. Both programs offer what Mr. Wheeldon describes as a ''palate cleanser'' -- a duet, ''Softly as I Leave You,'' by the British-Spanish choreographers Paul Lightfoot and Sol Leon. 
 Despite the clouds, Mr. Wheeldon says he has achieved many goals. He has programmed a diverse mix of dance makers, both experienced (William Forsythe, Mr. Ratmansky) and little known (Emily Molnar, Mr. Harbour). He has commissioned new ballets and scores and consistently presented work with live music. He has also stuck to his plan to involve artists from other domains. Narciso Rodriguez and Isabel and Ruben Toledo have created costumes and sets; this season, Hugo Dalton will create a set in London for his new ballet, and the Cuban duo Los Carpinteros will do the same in New York. 
 From the outset, in an unusual attempt (for ballet) to connect directly with the public, he has offered audiences chatty explanations of his choices of ballets or music and held preseason open rehearsals. And he has showed short films before each work to offer some insight into the creative process. ''No art, not even opera, is more clad in snobbery than ballet,'' Joan Acocella wrote in The New Yorker after Morphoses' first New York performances in 2007. ''These little movies were an attack on that, and God bless them.'' 
 The response to his second season was far more positive, both critically and from other theater directors: after City Center, the troupe goes to Amsterdam; next year it is scheduled to tour to California, Ottawa, Paris, Washington and Chicago, apart from its regular slots in Vail, Colo.; London; and New York. Ticket sales, meanwhile, were down roughly 30 percent at City Center in the second season but have rebounded this year, according to a spokesperson.
 Even so, Morphoses is continuing to operate on a shoestring. Its current budget is $1.3 million, raised mostly, Mr. Wheeldon said, through individual appeals and small donations. (The $5 million figure that Mr. Wheeldon originally aimed for, by the way, is not grandiose: Ballet Theater runs on a $36 million budget, City Ballet on $59 million, though both have at least four times more dancers than Mr. Wheeldon seeks.)
 That he doesn't have the money to hire full-time dancers is a persistent thorn in Mr. Wheeldon's side -- taken together with the troupe's itinerant status, it's an index against which many judge Morphoses' success.
 ''It is terribly frustrating,'' Mr. Wheeldon said after a long day of rehearsal at the Vineyard Arts Project on Martha's Vineyard, where the company spent six weeks in August and September. ''Here I am in the middle of this incredibly creative period. I'm making new work, Tim Harbour is making new work. Alexei Ratmansky is here rehearsing his ballet, we are setting repertory. All the plans, the hopes, are coming to fruition. If I could keep the dancers, think how fantastic this could be.''
 Beyond the symbolic value of having full-time dancers are practical considerations. Choreographers work better with dancers attuned to their process and movement vocabulary. And keeping ballets in repertory is next to impossible if the dancers are continually changing. It is also difficult to create work, plan and rehearse without permanent studio space. This year his troupe spent January in Australia, rehearsing and performing, then had to disband for months until it could move to the Vineyard Arts Project, then the Margo and Bill Winspear Opera House in Dallas during the summer and fall. As a result Mr. Wheeldon lost dancers who moved on to other work.
 Many of Morphoses' current woes have to do with timing. Like all arts organizations the company has been hit hard by an economy that Mr. Wheeldon couldn't have anticipated when he dreamed of raising millions. Donations are down, foundations are more cautious with grants. 
 The difficulty in gaining financial momentum may also have to do with the critical reception to the company; there is a great deal of good will toward Mr. Wheeldon, but also resistance among some critics to his choreographic tastes. Alastair Macaulay, responding recently in The New York Times to the Lightfoot-Leon duet, wrote that ''Softly as I Leave You'' did ''a great deal to confirm my worst misgivings about Morphoses itself'' and featured ''most of the worst cliches of European postwar choreography.'' 
 There might be an intermediate solution. Sadler's Wells, which made a commitment to Morphoses at its inception, has offered monthlong residencies each spring in addition to regular fall appearances. That model (Morphoses gets a temporary home; the theater expands its profile) might be the prototype for partnerships outside New York, providing rehearsal space and allowing Mr. Wheeldon to retain dancers. 
 Mr. Wheeldon, who is British but lives in Brooklyn, said he and Ms. Lopez were thinking about that option. But he sounded wistful about the dream of basing his company in New York. ''I don't know whether I'm just stubborn, but I do want to stay here,'' he said. ''I'm not giving up yet.''

Neoliberalism, which dominated the decade before 9/11, had an exuberantly simple vision. Communism and authoritarianism had failed; therefore markets and free elections were the answer. Free-market democracy, conveniently spread by globalization, would transform the world into a community of productive, peace-loving nations. Instead, the ensuing years saw repeated economic crises outside the West, genocide in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, intensifying fundamentalism, virulent anti-Americanism and finally the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
 Enter neoconservatism. At its core, the neoconservative program was premised on the aggressive, interventionist use of American military force, with or without international approval, to effect regime change and nation building. If 9/11 sent neoliberalism into a tailspin, the Iraq quagmire did the same for neoconservatism.
 Then came the financial meltdown of 2008, which dealt the deathblow to both. Neoconservative power depended on immense disposable wealth to finance American military might abroad. Neoliberal economics assumed that American capitalism would produce that wealth. Today the dreams of both lie shattered, and policy makers are at sea. 
 A recent outpouring of foreign policy books and essays attempts to forecast and shape the next big movement. Among these, a handful remain bravely optimistic about America's continuing global dominance. For example, the influential historian Niall Ferguson, the author of ''The Ascent of Money,'' argues convincingly that it is far too early to write off the United States. As he observed earlier this year in an essay for The American Interest, American business has repeatedly rebounded from disastrous financial crises through technological innovation -- RCA, DuPont and I.B.M. after the Great Depression; Microsoft and Apple in the 1970s. Ferguson further notes that the American credit crunch, as bad as it seems at home, is ''having much worse economic effects abroad.'' 
 Even more bullish about America is George Friedman, the founder of the private intelligence agency Stratfor and the author of ''The Next 100 Years.'' Remarkably, Friedman asserts that ''the United States -- far from being on the verge of decline -- has actually just begun its ascent.'' Perhaps anachronistically, Friedman argues that naval power remains pivotal, even in the 21st century. Because America controls both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it ''is virtually assured of being the dominant global power.''
 Far more observers of American foreign policy are pessimistic about America's trajectory. Perhaps the most persuasive work in this vein is Andrew Bacevich's searing manifesto, ''The Limits of Power: The End of American Exceptionalism.'' Excoriating American profligacy and delusions of military invincibility, Bacevich calls for a foreign policy rooted in humility and realism. One of Bacevich's most interesting arguments is that the astronomical costs of the Iraq war -- not just unregulated hedge funds and subprime mortgages -- contributed directly to the 2008 financial collapse. By 2007, he writes, ''the U.S. command in Baghdad was burning through $3 billion per week. That same year, the overall costs of the Iraq war topped the $500 billion mark.'' Nor does Bacevich go easy on the Obama administration. He describes Barack Obama's national security team as ''establishment figures, utterly conventional in their outlook.'' He sees Obama's stimulus package and commitment of more troops to Afghanistan as ominous signs of continuing ''self-destructive behavior.''
 Despite such conflicting perspectives, however, it's a sign of the times that the major thinkers are virtually all proposing a return to something old. Critics of the Bush-Cheney era depict those eight years as disastrous departures from traditional American principles. Supporters of the Bush administration present their new prescriptions as consistent with earlier eras of successful American foreign policy. 
 A striking example among the Bush supporters is the neoconservative Robert Kagan, who is now reaching back to the ideas of the cold war. In ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams,'' he writes that ''international competition among great powers has returned.'' As in the cold war, the chief adversaries of the free world remain Russia and China, and nations ''are increasingly choosing up sides and identifying themselves with one camp or the other.'' Kagan is openly nostalgic for the Reagan years.
 Bacevich, a harsh critic of neoconservatives like Kagan, also favors a return to cold war policies, but in his case to a strategy of ''containment.'' Bacevich urges the United States to ''let Islam be Islam. In the end, Muslims will have to discover for themselves the shortcomings of political Islam, much as Russians discovered the defects of Marxist-Leninism.'' Similarly, there are hints of neo-cold-warriorism in Leslie H. Gelb's ''Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy.'' Gelb, who was head of the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that deterrence is much underappreciated as a policy weapon, though it was critical to America's victory in the cold war. He asserts that ''deterrence has worked on almost all occasions when presidents positioned it clearly and firmly.'' 
 While Bacevich and Gelb emphasize American restraint, others look backward to a kind of neo-Wilsonianism: a return to multilateralism, global cooperation and soft power. This is the theme uniting Fareed Zakaria's ''Post-American World,'' Strobe Talbott's ''Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation'' and Parag Khanna's ''Second World: How Emerging Powers Are Redefining Global Competition in the Twenty-First Century.'' 
 And what of the Obama administration? Richard Posner, most recently the author of ''A Failure of Capitalism,'' sees in current policy a case of ''Roosevelt envy.'' There may be some truth to this. Like the Roosevelt White House, the Obama administration seems committed simultaneously to renewing internationalism, overhauling regulation and spending its way out of economic crisis.
 Nonetheless, if any foreign policy camp best captures mainstream American opinion in 2009, it is probably neo-isolationism: a return to the inwardness of the post-World War I years, when the country refused to join the League of Nations. Even as intellectuals call for cosmopolitanism, more and more Americans are declaring themselves anti-outsourcing, anti-foreign-products, anti-immigration, anti-international-law -- and pro-protectionism. According to a February 2009 Gallup poll, nearly half of Americans view foreign trade as a ''threat to the economy,'' and 65 percent believe the government is spending ''too much'' on foreign aid. 
 It may not be a bad thing that almost no one in foreign policy circles is proposing anything new. Foreign policy is not modern dance; tried and true may be better than avant-garde and visionary. Still, in today's world, marked by unparalleled threats and characterized by a striking division between elite ideas and broad public opinion, it's hard to believe that America's way forward is a return to the past.
 This is the eighth in a series of essays exploring dominant themes and currents of thought in particular areas of American life. The ninth and final essay in the series is scheduled to appear in this space next month. An archive can be found at nytimes.com/crossroads.

HEADLINE: Tables Turned, Former Hirers Can't Get Hired

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Md. 

 BODY:
NANCY FINK is a career coach for Maryland's department of labor, running seminars for the most skilled unemployed workers.
For 17 years, she has counseled professionals, business managers, engineers, accountants, scientists -- people who are mature, middle-aged, highly motivated, well-educated, well-spoken. But in all that time, she's never seen so many of the jobless with such impressive skills as this last year. ''Last week I had seven lawyers in this room,'' she said. ''I've had lots of folks from TV and The Baltimore Sun. This week I've got five human resources directors -- I've never had that.''
 The number of professionals and managers in unemployment programs at this suburban work-force center halfway between Baltimore and Washington is the highest it has been since the state first made this group a target for outplacement support in 1992. 
 They ask questions young workers don't. David Kozlowski, 52, a systems vice president laid off in June, wanted to know how far back to go when an interviewer inquires about his work experience in information technology. ''I've had 30 years in I.T.,'' he said. Many of the 53 people at a recent two-day seminar had themselves hired employees before being fired. When Ms. Fink quizzed them on the first question interviewers ask, Jim Chrzanowski, 45, a systems engineer who once oversaw 83 workers, knew immediately. '' 'Tell me about yourself' -- it was the first question I always asked,'' he said.
 During a discussion on cover letters, Ms. Fink wondered if the human resources directors in the room had any thoughts. ''It can make a big difference,'' said Hal Hamil Jr., 56, unemployed since August, but before then, a senior vice president of PNC Bank making $130,000 a year. Mr. Hamil said that last March he posted three openings for tellers paying $10 an hour and got 1,008 applications. ''I hired two of them because of their cover letters,'' he said.
 Ms. Fink urged rehearsing before an interview, and Arlene Hernandez, 44, who was a human resources director doing the hiring for a 150-person retail company until last month, agreed. ''People who took too long to make their point, I'd be thinking about what I was cooking for dinner,'' she said.
 They strategized about befriending the receptionist when going for an interview. ''You get that receptionist on your side, it frames the interview,'' Ms. Fink said. '' 'Nancy is here,' versus 'Your 10 o'clock is here.' And later you write the receptionist a thank-you note. She'll show her boss. It will make an impression.''
 ''So,'' Ms. Fink continued, ''you've made friends with the receptionist. Now, what do you do while you're waiting to be interviewed?''
 ''Start working on your thank-you note,'' said Ellen James, 49, a contractor whose home-improvement business collapsed in March.
 Shelley Nituama, 50, an unemployed librarian with two master's degrees, said, ''We could start a new society with all the talent in this room.''
 Maryland, with its proximity to the federal government, is usually insulated from severe downturns, but even here in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, unemployment is the highest in decades. The number of jobless professionals taking these seminars at the work-force center -- one of 34 statewide -- has doubled in a year, to 210 a month. Nationally, the unemployment rate for managers and professionals increased to 5.2 percent in September, from 2.8 percent the year before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Many, like Mr. Hamil, who as a human resources director provided services for 3,500 workers at PNC Bank, had never needed a government program before. ''I find it useful to be with other people and hear their ideas,'' he said. ''I've had all the time I needed at home cutting the lawn and reseeding the lawn.''
 They were wowed by their fellow jobless. ''It's wonderful to be with people of this caliber,'' said Ms. Nituama, the librarian, who said she never went for an interview without memorizing the employer's mission statement.
 There were handouts galore: 12 tips for making small talk; the Noel Smith-Wenkle salary negotiation method; inspirational quotes (Victor Borge: ''The shortest distance between two people is a smile''); advice from the man Ms. Fink described as, ''the father of modern job search, Richard Nelson Bolles.''
 Some exercises let them vent. Ms. Fink asked them to list what kind of workers employers wanted and several shouted, ''Cheap.''
 ''Young,'' said Jeffrey DeBois, 58, who had been a construction manager with the same company for 21 years.
 ''They want experience but they want youth,'' said Steven Dembo, a photographer dressed in coat and tie.
 ''They want a senior player at entry level pay,'' said Mark Roper, 50, an information technology specialist whose daughter had to move home and transfer to a local community college after he lost his job.
 ''I don't think they know what they want, the job description doesn't match the interview,'' said Pamela Robb, who was taking down Ms. Fink's tips on her laptop.
 Ms. Fink warned: ''You could find yourself being interviewed by a millennial. As a boomer, you're thinking that could be my kid. Your instinct is to use their first name. Don't. They could have an M.B.A. from Wharton. It should be Ms. or Mr.''
 They posed questions Ms. Fink had no answers for. ''Why do they bring me in, then tell me I'm overqualified?'' asked Amy Studnitz, 59, a former accounting manager who made $68,000 in her last job.
 ''How do you know,'' Ms. Nituama asked, ''if you're being brought in and they already have an insider for the job?''
 They discussed how to respond when an interviewer asked them to describe a weakness.
 ''I say, 'Sometimes my expectations are too high,' '' said Marlene Manley, an analyst with T. Rowe Price making $73,900 until she was laid off in April.
 ''Absolutely,'' Ms. Fink said.
 ''Can you say 'I don't have a weakness,' '' Ms. James, the contractor said. '''I'm just even-keeled'?'' 
 ''No, no,'' Ms. Fink said, ''you need a weakness that's not really a weakness -- they want to see you dance around the question.''
 As a group they joked, but one-on-one many sounded scared. ''I've been discouraged these last few days,'' said Ms. Nituama, a single mother of 9-year-old twins. ''In job interviews, I try not to come across as desperate. I try to seem relaxed.''
 Jim Hess, 46, a former comptroller for a construction company, said he had cashed in his 401(k).
 ''If something doesn't happen soon,'' said Ms. Studnitz, the former accounting manager, ''I'm in real trouble.''
 Richard Mantsch, 52, who was projects manager for an engineering firm that closed in July, said he was hoping that he, his wife and their children, 10 and 12, could hold onto their home. ''It's the only house we've known as a family,'' he said. When he first lost his job he was embarrassed when people found out, he said, but lately, he's stopped trying to hide it.
 After the seminar, Ms. Fink said a lot of what she does is therapy -- helping worried people feel less isolated.
 Her boss, Stephen Gallison, who directs the program for skilled workers known as the Professional Outplacement Assistance Center, said that in the past people typically found jobs within five months, but in this economy that's not a reliable gauge. Asked if he saw any hopeful signs, he said: ''No. Nothing. Not yet.''

HEADLINE: The Makeup Floor at Bloomingdale's Puts On a New Face

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER. 
E-mail: kaminer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The girl with the checkerboard eyes is winking at you. On bus shelters and in magazine ads, she lowers her lid to reveal a fuchsia feather where the rest of us have mere lashes, and alternating rows of black squares where some might think light blue to be daring. 
 Elsewhere she's smiling, her lips decorated with the same checkerboard pattern. She's trying to send you a message. The message is, Come Back to Bloomingdale's. 
 Come back, we've changed, and we have fuchsia feather eyelashes to prove it. 
 Bloomingdale's, at its current location since 1886, is not just a store, it's a story of American consumerism, of attempts to push or catch up with the higher-end shopping experience. Over the last century Bloomingdale's grew into a powerhouse that influenced the entire fashion industry. But in more recent years consumers began abandoning department stores for luxury boutiques, in one direction, and discount stores, in the other. 
 That history is not visible at the Bloomingdale's flagship at 59th and Lexington, which this month unveiled a redesign of its first-floor cosmetics bazaar that was 11 years in the making. The past is not on display, and neither, really, is the present. There is no hint of the dismal economic climate that today clouds all commercial ventures. 
 And why should there be? Who goes to a makeup counter for a lesson in sociology? Makeup is by its very definition fiction, an escape from the inescapable reality that we physically inhabit. It's a chance to greet the world with a new face. Or at least a new mascara that leaves your lashes longer, fluffier and more defined. In its previous design, the vast makeup floor -- a tourist destination in its own right -- was a grid of glass counters and display cases, with four-foot-wide checkerboard aisles. The bustling pathways lent a sense of urgency to any visit, but also to any departure, lest migraine set in. Especially when sales people interrupted the traffic flow every few feet threatening to spritz you with perfume.
 In the new space, the aisles are paved with the same black and white checkerboard, but they are almost twice as wide, and run in some cases the whole length of the store. You can walk easily, you can orient yourself easily, and you can breathe easily, with nary a spritzer in sight. Partial walls unobtrusively divide the city-block-sized space into three smaller, more manageable zones. 
 As for the glass counters, their metal edges warmed by the display lights inside, they have been replaced by what Bloomingdale's calls event-driven boutiques -- 26 open stations dedicated to upscale brands, with distinctive designs and a variety of places to sit. At La Mer, that means cream-colored leather and a coral-reef fish tank. At Clinique, it's a spotlessly clean laboratory with notes of pale blue-green. 
 Overhead, enormous panels illuminate the room without casting any shadows. The dominant color is black, in high-energy high gloss. And everywhere, but everywhere, there is video. At Kiehl's, an animated acai berry comes winging out of a 3-D screen with such free-radical-fighting intensity that a reasonable person's impulse is to duck. 
 The staff also comes out at you. After an extensive re-education in customer service -- which they absolutely swear they enjoyed -- clerks now wrap your purchase up nicely and walk it around the counter to place it in your hands. A few weeks later they may call to see how you like it and whether you need a refill. Jimmie O'Connor-Taylor, working in the Jo Malone boutique, cheerfully told me he writes at least 10 thank-you notes a day to customers. 
 As I walked toward the Clarins boutique, a woman asked what my skin care routine was. Nothing, I mumbled. Oh, don't tell me nothing! she said with a laugh, as though I might be hiding the name of a competing brand. So I confessed: soap and water. 
 For her horrified look, I might as well have said battery acid. 
 Her colleague sat me down and smoothed a cream onto my face. ''I'm going to use the pressing method,'' she announced, gently pushing her fingers against my skin then lifting them away with a flourish. ''This helps with suction.'' Next came a chamomile toner, some eye serum and a cream for neck and decolletage. She smiled confidently as she slid her moistened hand down into my shirt. 
 It's odd enough to get that kind of attention from a stranger. It's odder still to do it as busy people whiz by to find silk boxer shorts or designer key chains. Bloomingdale's has addressed that problem by providing different levels of privacy. At La Prairie, whose padded banquette and crystal beaded chandelier give the air of a powder room in a 1950s supper club, a corner door hides a small chamber where the secrets of women's pores can be kept that way. 
 At Sisley, I sat in full view as Leticia Rosado and Michelle Cook told me about the virtues of their company's line, which they referred to as a ''luxurious product.'' I was not quite sure what that meant until they pulled out the Hydra Global, a lotion that costs $240 for 1.4 ounces. Luxurious indeed. They took great care making me over, but the resulting look felt a bit alien -- better suited to the kind of Park Avenue stalwart who would spend $240 on a small vial of cream. 
 Over at Chanel, Jennifer Nam, a makeup artist who taught herself the trade while at military boarding school, allowed that the redesign does not suit everyone. ''But younger customers, they come and it's like'' -- here, she gasped -- ''It's like a show!'' While she spoke, Ms. Nam redid my makeup for a younger, more dramatic look -- equally impressive work, but equally strange for me to see painted across my face. And that was nothing compared to the false eyelashes (thankfully, not fuchsia) that a woman at the fashion-forward Shu Uemura glued onto my lids.
 Broad, easy-to-navigate aisles, varied design, comfortable points of access and a range of brands from hip to haute: the only thing missing from Bloomingdale's extreme makeover is, alas, the hordes of people stampeding their way toward armloads of merchandise. The ratio of black-clad sales associates to actual customers was distractingly high, which is either a sign of luxury or of the passing of an era, or possibly both. 
 The store has scheduled some 500 special events, sales promotions, ''master classes'' and the like on the new makeup floor in the next three months. How many special events does it take to get busy people over to 59th and Lexington when the refill they need is just a click away? How long can the store maintain that ribbon-cutting, Champagne-popping celebratory pace? No one knows the future. But next month, the Chanel makeup artist told me excitedly, a psychic lip reader will be on hand to reveal your ideal lipstick shade.

HEADLINE: It Takes a Village to Open a Bistro

BYLINE: By TOBY BARLOW. 
Toby Barlow is the author of ''Sharp Teeth.''

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 I WAS recently sitting at the bar of Le Petit Zinc talking to the owner, Charles Sorel, when he said something I found shocking: ''I can't imagine opening a business anywhere but Detroit.''
 From a local, I would have just written it off as city pride, but Charles is, as he himself puts it, a citizen of the world. Born in the French Caribbean and reared in Paris, he ran a French joint in Brooklyn's Fort Greene and lived in Brazil before winding up here. When I pointed out the risks of starting up in a city as troubled as Detroit, he shrugged it off. ''When I moved to New York in the late '80s there was not a day when someone in the city wasn't robbed or beaten or killed,'' he said. ''This is so much better than that.'' 
 A year ago, Charles opened Le Petit Zinc with the simple belief that there was a market here for a creperie and cafe that served fresh organic food at a decent price. But that was certainly no guarantee of success. Not only was the economy cratering, but the building itself, an abandoned day care center tucked between a working-class Irish neighborhood called Corktown and a few abandoned warehouses, was on a street with no foot traffic. The only thing the place had going for it was a rundown playground out back that was good for outdoor seating. For the first five weeks after opening, when he was the cook, waiter, busboy and janitor, he had no idea what to expect.
 Now, we are all raised to think of business as a sort of vicious spy-versus-spy, cutthroat activity where every competing establishment is out to stick a shiv into the other. You'd think that this kind of blood thirst would be even worse in Detroit, which -- with Jimmy Hoffa's disappearance, Eminem's lyrics and our old, quaint Devil's Night tradition of burning down houses -- has acquired a certain reputation for toughness. But Charles discovered that the neighboring Detroit restaurants actually had quite a different reaction to a new competitor.
 The owner of Slows, a barbecue place nearby, not only helped him get his permits, but also built tabletops for him at no cost. Jordi, the owner of the Cafe con Leche coffee shop, hooked him up with his coffee supplier. Dave, who had recently opened Supino Pizza, even dropped everything one day to get the paper Charles needed for his credit card machine.
 Most surprisingly, just as Charles was starting up, Torya Blanchard was opening another downtown crepe place called Good Girls Go to Paris. Instead of treating Charles like a rival, Torya happily exchanged recipes with him, even coming in one day to help make his batter, an act of creperie solidarity that would surely have made Detroit's founder, Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac, extremely proud.
 ''They want their neighbor to make it,'' he says. ''It's different from anywhere I've been. Here, your success is their success.'' Even his suppliers have shown a generosity he finds surprising: the Avalon bakery charges him wholesale prices even if he orders just one loaf.
 In other ways, too, Charles seems to have timed things well, opening just when Detroit residents with an agricultural bent were beginning to take advantage of the 40 square miles of unoccupied open land here, an area almost the size of San Francisco. Greg Willerer, for instance, sells Charles spinach, flowers and zucchini at an affordable price, all grown within the city limits. Charles also planted his own garden out by the patio, putting in tomatoes, basil, peppers, thyme, parsley and beets.
 Maybe it's that adage that nothing brings a community closer than having a common enemy. For the restaurateurs, the residents, the urban farmers and the community activists now working to reshape the city, the enemy is Detroit's own reputation. They know they will succeed only if they are a part of a larger, collective success, one that makes downtown a thriving destination again, and so they're working together to make it happen.
 Which leads to another entrepreneurial advantage Detroit possesses: instantaneous and automatic publicity. ''Open a business anywhere else, and no one will notice,'' Charles said. ''Open it in Detroit and everyone talks about it.'' 
 Sure enough, people are now driving in regularly from affluent suburbs like Bloomfield Hills and Grosse Pointe to try his smoked-salmon crepes and ratatouille, a considerable achievement considering many suburbanites come downtown only for Tigers games or a night at the symphony. While I was there, the place was bustling with a diverse crowd that seemed more than satisfied.
 ''This is the best restaurant ever. I would eat here all the time if I had more money,'' beamed a woman dining alone at the bar.
 ''Somebody send that lady a dessert!'' shouted Charles with a smile.

HEADLINE: More Matter, With Less Art

BYLINE: By SHEELAH KOLHATKAR. 
Sheelah Kolhatkar is a contributor to Time magazine and a contributing editor at New York magazine.

 BODY:
IT has been a tumultuous year for Rebecca Smith, who owned a well-known contemporary art gallery until last June.
 The recession delivered an economic shock to the art market, and Becky's New York City gallery struggled for months before she decided to shutter it. In the process, she came into conflict with some of the artists she worked with -- she owes them money, they owe her. She moved out of her apartment and borrowed cash from her parents. She was too poor to visit her family in Pittsburgh for Christmas. ''I spent the holiday in my sublet eating Kraft cheese and saltine crackers,'' she said.
 Becky, 43, is not one of the blonde wisps usually seen working at chic Manhattan art spaces -- she has a big head of curly black hair and chunky eyeglasses. Shortly after she founded the Bellwether Gallery in Brooklyn, in 1999, she was the subject of a profile, in The New York Times Magazine, titled ''How to Become an Instant Art Star,'' and she did, indeed, become a star. 
 She moved her gallery to Chelsea in 2004, and maintained a frenetic pace on the international art fair circuit. She hired a gallery director, a manager and an art handler. ''I felt like I was one of the members of my generation who could become one of the next representatives to major artists,'' Becky said. 
 She specialized in emerging art, finding and cultivating cutting-edge new artists like Adam Cvijanovic, Ellen Altfest and Marc Swanson, building their careers up through gallery shows, and selling their pieces for increasingly large sums of money, mostly to rich financier-collectors. Buying the work of unknown young artists was especially appealing to Wall Streeters, because it was an accessible way to start building an art collection and it offered the possibility of ''discovering'' artists and making a fortune as their work shot up in value -- not unlike the thrills of the stock market. 
 Galleries sprouted up all over town to cater to this new cohort of collectors as well as members of the old guard, who could be counted on to pluck artworks off the walls like meringues from a plate. Now, however, Rembrandts are still selling, while video installations and dead cows encased in beeswax are another matter.
 Becky ran through some numbers for me: her gallery's rent was about $10,000 a month. Her highest overhead, when she had four full-time employees and was maintaining a hectic pace of exhibitions, ran to $75,000 -- in a lean month it might have been closer to $50,000. The revenue came through the sale of art; a gallery usually takes 50 percent of the sale price.
 Once sales dried up by the fall of 2008, Becky called three of her largest collectors, pleading for some business -- ''I tried playing it cool, and then I tried playing it direct,'' she said. She recounted a typical conversation: ''I need to sell you something to continue to be here,'' she would tell a collector. 
 ''I'm just not buying,'' was the reply.
 ''Did you hear me? I have this artist you collect who will have to get another job. If I can't sell you something right now, I'll have to close,'' Becky would say, but the response was the same. ''I felt forsaken,'' she recalled. ''All these collectors who supported me and my artists, they just disappeared. They didn't care.''
 She became desperate. Her sales for the first half of 2009 were 16 percent of what they'd been in 2008 and 11 percent of 2007. ''One morning as I was sobbing uncontrollably in the shower, the unthinkable became thinkable: I needed to close the gallery,'' Becky said. By then, she'd already laid off her staff, and her lease was up. Packing up was a relief. Still, she said, ''It's an awful, awful feeling, to be in my 40s and have nothing.'' 
 I met with Becky over coffee in Greenwich, Conn., where she's now living with her boyfriend, John Ford, whom she met online last April. They bonded over how much they have in common. After many years on Wall Street, he's out of work, too, figuring out what to do next while caring for his father who is fighting cancer. 
 Becky is helping him, slowly selling off her art collection while she contemplates a new career, maybe the possibility of writing a book. She says she's done with the art world and she's no longer transfixed by its glamour. Instead, Becky talks about John with the same fervor she once did about her artists. They just decided to marry.

HEADLINE: In This 10-Year Race, Bonds Win by a Mile

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
WHEN the Dow Jones industrial average climbed back to 10,000 this month, the achievement was widely noted but barely celebrated, and for good reason. 
 ''Haven't we done this several times before?'' asked Edward Yardeni, the economist and investment strategist. 
 In fact, we had. The Dow had crossed 10,000 on more than 20 occasions, starting in late March 1999, when the market was so hot that stock-picking seemed to have become the national pastime. In that year, the book ''Dow 36,000'' confidently declared that stocks were ''actually less risky than bonds'' and that the Dow would more than triple in value within a few short years. 
 As investors know all too well, the financial history of the last decade turned out a bit differently. Stocks proved to be extremely risky. Despite the recent rally, in the 10 years through September, most stock investors lost money. 
 What may be less widely understood is that over that same 10 years, while the stock market's overall returns were disappointing, the bond market produced handsome gains. Bond rallies have not generated the hoopla that the stock market customarily receives, but over the last 10 years, investors have had more reason to celebrate if they held bonds, not stocks, in their portfolios. 
 Calculations performed for Sunday Business by Morningstar, using data from its Ibbotson Associates subsidiary, show that the stock market underperformed important bond categories over the 10 years through September -- with an annualized loss of 0.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, versus annualized gains of 8.1 percent for long-term government bonds and of 7.8 percent for long-term corporate bonds. 
 What's more, the S.& P. 500 underperformed long-term government and long-term corporate bonds over the last 20 years as well. Over longer periods -- 30 years, 40 years, and in an 83-year stretch from 1926 to 2009 -- the Ibbotson numbers indicate that stocks did outperform bonds, sometimes by more than three percentage points, annualized. But bonds were far less volatile throughout. And the further back in history you go, the less directly comparable is the data. 
 Writing in the May-June issue of the ''Journal of Indexes,'' Robert Arnott, chief executive of the investment firm Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., declared that bonds had been neglected by the financial press and by many investors. He reviewed market returns going back 207 years, and found that stocks outperformed bonds by only 2.5 percentage points, annualized. This ''2.5 percentage point advantage over two centuries compounds mightily over time,'' he said. But for very long stretches, bonds have done better than stocks. 
 The wild ride of the last decade or so does not mean that stocks will underperform bonds in the months or years ahead. If only it were that simple.
 For one thing, past returns never provide a clear guide for the future -- especially when technology, innovation and government policies are changing the structure of financial markets and transforming the global economy as rapidly as they are right now. 
 For another, it can be argued that the recent stretch of relative stock market weakness and bond market strength is precisely why stocks are likely to do better than bonds. Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the author of ''Stocks for the Long Run,'' advocates stock holdings for people with long horizons but acknowledges that some periods have been painful for equities.
 He says that the environment is auspicious again. ''Historically, whenever you've had long periods when bonds outperform stocks, that sets up an excellent time to invest in stocks,'' he said. ''So looking forward, things look very favorable for stocks and not favorable for bonds, certainly not Treasury bonds.'' 
 In part because of market intervention by the Federal Reserve, yields on long-term Treasury bonds remain extremely low, and prices, which move in the opposite direction, are high. When and if the economy recovers, bond yields are likely to rise and prices are likely to fall. Low yields, meanwhile, make it cheaper for many companies to finance their operations, which could help generate outsize profits. 
 Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm in Westport, Conn., who says he believes that we are in the middle of a vigorous bull market for stocks, has studied the long-term returns of many asset classes. He has found that from 1970 to 2008, emerging-market stocks outperformed the S.& P. 500, the bond market and alternative assets like oil, gold, real estate and diamonds.
 But Mr. Birinyi recommends sticking mainly with domestic stocks and bonds, perhaps adding a sprinkling of foreign stocks that ''don't replicate your domestic stock holdings.'' 
 ''My issue with diversification beyond that,'' Mr. Birinyi said, ''is that an incremental or arithmetic increase in the number of decisions you make leads to a geometric increase in the degree of difficulty.'' 
 The logic for treating domestic stocks and bonds as the two central asset classes was outlined in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, the fathers of value investing. In their classic work, ''Security Analysis,'' they emphasized safety -- favoring bonds, and only those of the highest quality, as far more suitable for small investors than stocks, which attracted ''speculators.'' 
 Because shares of common stock are much riskier than bonds, they need to have the potential for a much higher return to induce investors to hold them, Mr. Graham and Mr. Dodd said. But they wouldn't have been surprised by long stretches of bond market outperformance.

HEADLINE: SMALL BUSINESS FACES SHARP RISE IN HEALTH COSTS

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Congress nears votes on legislation that would overhaul the health care system, many small businesses say they are facing the steepest rise in insurance premiums they have seen in recent years. 
 Insurance brokers and benefits consultants say their small business clients are seeing premiums go up an average of about 15 percent for the coming year -- double the rate of last year's increases. That would mean an annual premium that was $4,500 per employee in 2008 and $4,800 this year would rise to $5,500 in 2010.
 The higher premiums at least partly reflect the inexorable rise of medical costs, which is forcing Medicare to raise premiums, too. Health insurance bills are also rising for big employers, but because they have more negotiating clout, their increases are generally not as steep. 
 Higher medical costs aside, some experts say they think the insurance industry, under pressure from Wall Street, is raising premiums to get ahead of any legislative changes that might reduce their profits. 
 The increases come at a politically fraught time for the insurers, as they try to fight off the creation of a government-run competitor and as they push their case that they have a central role to play in controlling the nation's health care costs. 
 President Obama, in his Saturday radio address, said the Democrats' health insurance overhaul would help small businesses and stimulate the economy by providing relief from ''the crushing costs of health care -- costs that have forced too many small businesses to cut benefits, shed jobs, or shut their doors for good.'' 
 The insurance industry has already been under sharp attack by Democratic lawmakers who favor creating a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. Without that competition, proponents say, insurers will continue to price coverage beyond the reach of many Americans. 
 Small businesses, which employ about 40 percent of the private labor force, are a big constituency for both parties. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said the sharp rise in premiums for small businesses offered the latest evidence that Congress must act swiftly on health care legislation. 
 ''This underlines the urgent need for health insurance reform, including a public option,'' she said in an interview. ''We need to have competition for the insurance companies to keep premiums down.'' 
 Insurers say there is no need for a government-run insurance plan and argue that their health plans are already responsible for many of the initiatives, like programs to coordinate care for chronic conditions, that ultimately lower costs.
 Insurers' ''profits are not responsible for increased health care costs,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the industry's trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans. 
 Like the insurers, Republican lawmakers, who portray themselves as champions of small business, argue that the proposed legislation would raise premiums across the board because sick people would be more likely to enroll than healthy people. 
 They also say the taxes and other ways of paying for the program would be passed on to employers in higher premiums, only making matters worse for small businesses.
 The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said in a response to the president's radio address, ''We can't support a bill that will raise premiums.'' The big insurance companies declined to comment. 
 With negotiations over next year's premiums still under way, data on rate increases are mostly anecdotal. Formal surveys have not yet been completed by the health benefits consultants who track the figures. And in some parts of the country, experts say rates are not overly high.
 But benefits consultants say there is no doubt that premiums are soaring for many small businesses. Edward Kaplan, a consultant with the Segal Company, said his clients were seeing renewals for coverage at prices 15 to 23 percent higher this year. Last year, he said, they typically faced increases of 7 to 12 percent.
 The brokers and consultants say the price jumps seem hard to justify. ''Frankly, I'm mystified by the size of the increases,'' said one broker, Charles J. Newman, who works with small employers in the New York area. 
 Some say the threat of an overhaul may be at least part of the reason. Joshua Miley, a consultant with HighRoads, which analyzes benefit information for employers, said the ''undercurrent of health reform is driving part of the renewal increases.'' 
 HighRoads projects that premiums will rise 14.4 percent for an individual in a health maintenance organization plan at a typical small employer.
 There is no question that insurers are under pressure from Wall Street. In recent years, insurers were often not quick enough to raise their premiums well above the rising cost of medical care. 
 But they have heard from angry investors disappointed by the companies' earnings. 
 ''There's no one out there who hasn't had to do a mea culpa to Wall Street,'' said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst for Pali Capital who follows the companies. While the industry is particularly vulnerable now in Washington, she said, ''it seems like they're more afraid of Wall Street.''
 Michael A. Turpin, a former senior executive for UnitedHealth, the insurer, and now a top official at USI Holdings, an insurance brokerage firm, said insurers were now ''under so much pressure to post earnings, they're going to make hay while the sun is shining.'' 
 Along with many Republican lawmakers, the insurers say the current Congressional proposals do too little to address the underlying reasons for high premiums -- the unabated rise in medical costs and effects of a weak economy. Hospitals, for example, have been treating greater numbers of people who have lost their jobs and their insurance, and they are passing along some of those costs by charging higher prices to private insurers.
 The industry also points to low government payments to hospitals and doctors, which insurers say result in higher prices for employer-based coverage to make up for the shortfall.
 In an analysis released two weeks ago by America's Health Insurance Plans, insurers said premiums would rise even faster under the legislation under study in Congress -- an assessment fiercely disputed by Democratic Congressional leaders and some health care economists but shared by many Republicans. 
 Small businesses, besides having less negotiating leverage than big employers, tend to pay more for the same coverage because they cannot spread the cost of expensive medical conditions or hospitalizations over large numbers of workers. Premiums can be especially high if they have sick or older workers. 
 Owners of small companies say the lack of options is why they have been paying increasingly higher premiums for less and less coverage -- this year perhaps more than ever. 
 In August, when Walter Rowen, who owns Susquehanna Glass in Columbia, Pa., sought to renew his company's coverage for two dozen employees, he said his insurer demanded a 160 percent rate increase. Mr. Rowen said he was told his work force was ''getting too old and very expensive.'' 
 Mr. Rowen said his insurance broker found that any other health plan was likely to charge 30 to 50 percent more than he paid last year. He chose a less generous plan from a different carrier for 44 percent more.

HEADLINE: Donmar's Impact Echoes From London to New York

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
IN the opening minutes of the new production of ''Hamlet'' on Broadway the massive stone towers at the rear of the stage slide slowly apart to reveal another looming facade, a craggy expanse of brick painted shiny black.
 That brick wall, like a monumental sculpture bathed in silvery light, will look distinctly familiar to avid theatergoers. It has become a stylistic signature of sorts for the Donmar Warehouse, the tiny London theater near Covent Garden that has become a busy theatrical generator of first-class productions in London and New York.
 The brick slab echoes the actual back wall of the Donmar stage, but it has become something akin to the company's unofficial logo, like the roaring lion that used to brand MGM movies, promising prestige and class. Get a glimpse of that black brick, and you know what you're in for: most likely a starkly designed, insightfully acted revival of a classic play, or possibly a starkly designed, insightfully acted revival of a classic musical. Last season's acclaimed production of ''Mary Stuart'' was a Donmar transfer in the classic mold: lean, mean and full of meaty acting. 
 This fall Broadway is already playing host to two shows with ties to the Donmar. ''Hamlet,'' starring Jude Law at the Broadhurst Theater, is a Donmar production originally seen in the West End. ''After Miss Julie,'' Patrick Marber's adaptation of August Strindberg's drama ''Miss Julie,'' at the American Airlines Theater, was first seen at the Donmar in a different production. This season the company has also made its first foray to Los Angeles, with a revival of the musical ''Parade'' at the Mark Taper Forum directed and choreographed by Rob Ashford. In the spring the Donmar's revival of Strindberg's ''Creditors,'' directed by Alan Rickman, will travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
 Aside from the National Theater the Donmar has become the most influential and productive theater in London, despite its diminutive size. Tucked away on a cobbled street off the Seven Dials, the former warehouse once used for ripening bananas contains about 250 seats. Although the warehouse had been used as a theatrical space for many years, the company's climb to current prominence began in 1992, when Sam Mendes, then still in his 20s, took over the boarded-up space and began producing and directing seasons of attention-getting theater.
 Among the productions from Mr. Mendes's years to move to Broadway were ''Electra,'' starring Zoe Wanamaker; ''The Blue Room,'' starring Nicole Kidman; and David Leveaux's revival of ''The Real Thing.'' The biggest splash, of course, was made by ''Cabaret,'' which Mr. Mendes restaged on Broadway with Rob Marshall, and which went on to become one of the longest-running musical revivals in Broadway history. Remarkably, the company's influence and integrity have remained intact under Michael Grandage, who took over as artistic director after Mr. Mendes moved on in 2002.
 If you haven't been to the Donmar, you are missing one of the great theatergoing experiences available today. Although the company has become such an established entity that tickets for virtually all of its shows can be hard to come by, I would unhesitatingly recommend making it a top priority on a London visit, no matter what happens to be playing. 
 Chances are good that you'll see something great; chances are better that you'll at least see something well produced, well acted and substantial. The theater's size -- there is little wing space, and complicated sets would destroy sightlines -- poses an aesthetic challenge to designers and directors. It enforces an economy of means that puts a rigorous, even ruthless emphasis on the text and the actor.
 The results are often powerful, sometimes almost overwhelming. The last production I saw at the Donmar, Mr. Grandage's heart-rending 2007-8 production of ''Othello,'' starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ewan McGregor, was among the high points of my theatergoing experience. But I'd probably be content to watch a feeble revival of ''Run for Your Wife'' in this inviting and intimate space. (Comfortable I would not call it; you sit on upholstered benches, with the seats marked by numbers and no armrests to delineate the spaces.) 
 Yet not everything the Donmar touches turns to theatrical gold; that roaring MGM lion often introduced a fancy turkey. Mr. Grandage's thoroughly routine ''Hamlet'' is a glaring case in point, and one that also suggests the dangers of establishing a house style and allowing it to dictate the artists' approach to a play. I have to confess my heart sank a little when I saw that brick wall, perhaps because just two days before I'd seen small shards of it in the designs for the superior production of ''Parade'' in Los Angeles, featuring sets and costumes by Christopher Oram and lighting by Neil Austin.
 Both of those talented designers also worked on ''Hamlet,'' but their more generic designs for Mr. Grandage's staging do little to enhance the evening's effectiveness. Mr. Oram's drab, monolithic set could be used for any number of Shakespeare plays, or for that matter ''Mary Stuart.'' It also dwarfs the actors, too many of whom prove easily dwarfed. The modern costumes all come in shades of black and gray and might have been snatched from the sale racks of a lesser fall collection from Hugo Boss. The stark shafts of light Mr. Austin deploys throughout the evening are beginning to strike me as an overused cliche; sometimes everyone in a Donmar show seems to carry around his or her own little halo of smoke-suffused luminescence. 
 None of this would matter, of course, if the performance of the play were exemplary. But the Donmar's minimalist design aesthetic, which trains the audience's focus on actor and text, where it properly belongs, can also throw weaknesses in stark relief. With little to beguile the eye, mediocre Shakespeare can be unrelievedly ponderous, and such is the case here. 
 As my colleague Ben Brantley noted in his review, Mr. Law's Hamlet is cleanly spoken and lively, but the energy is all on the surface. His animated arms, marking every phrase with some sort of gesture, never stop moving, but of Hamlet's inward journey, from confusion and mourning, through rage and self-scorn into resignation, we get very few glimpses. A general peevishness is the dominant, ultimately monotonous key note of the performance. 
 The key relationships in the play are likewise devoid of emotional substance. It seemed to me that Mr. Law's Hamlet and the Ophelia of Gugu Mbatha-Raw were merely glancing acquaintances, so empty of feeling are their brief exchanges. Nor does the complicated love between Hamlet and his mother, Gertrude (Geraldine James), achieve the turbulent pitch it should, despite the inevitable tussling during their famous closet scene together. (The sensible ensembles Ms. James sports cannot have helped her much in inhabiting the soul of a reigning queen. ''Pants?'' my companion hissed in dismay.)
 Over all the production left the impression that Mr. Grandage was content to coast on a trademark style -- and a star presence -- and let the substance take care of itself. The result was a ''Hamlet'' as dreary and emotionally arid as any in recent memory. 
 It may be notable that the two most disappointing Donmar Warehouse productions I've seen were not actually staged at the company's small home base. A house style, after all, cannot always be expected to translate comfortably toa new house. Like ''Hamlet,'' Mr. Grandage's mediocre 2005 revival of ''Guys and Dolls'' was produced directly in the West End. Starring an underwhelming Mr. McGregor and Jane Krakowski, it was staged in the same stark style as the company's more successful dark excavations of American musicals. But who wants to see ''Guys and Dolls,'' one of the most joyous of golden-age Broadway shows, performed in a cistern? 
 Then again, perhaps I've been unlucky in the West End-originating productions from the Donmar I've managed to see. The reports of Mr. Grandage's ''Ivanov,'' with Kenneth Branagh, and ''Twelfth Night,'' with Derek Jacobi, both part of the company's season at the Wyndhams Theater in the West End, were enough to make me want to hop on a plane forthwith. A little glitch known as the global economic collapse forestalled any such plan.
 Things are tentatively looking up on the economic front, we are told. So I hope to make a journey to London soon, after a painful absence of more than a year. My disappointment in ''Hamlet'' notwithstanding, the first question I'll ask is ''What's on at the Donmar?''

HEADLINE: Designing for High, Low and in Between

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PETER PENNOYER and Anne Walker, the authors of erudite, luxuriously illustrated monographs about lesser-known architects, have now published ''The Architecture of Grosvenor Atterbury'' (W. W. Norton). This versatile architect ranged from town houses to model tenements, from country estates to loft buildings, with perfect ease. But he was a thinker, particularly interested in how to make not just better mansions, but better cities. 
 Atterbury was born in 1869, and his interest in architecture was perhaps piqued in 1887 by Sugar Loaf, the country house his parents built in Shinnecock Hills, hard by the emerging swelldom of Southampton. He was about 19 when Stanford White designed the long series of rolling bays, sheltered by a deep shingled roof, and he soon apprenticed with White's firm, McKim, Mead & White, following that with study in Paris. He set out on his own in 1895. 
 Atterbury quickly developed a country house practice, especially on Long Island. His early dwellings seem as long as aircraft carriers, but as low as submarines, just barely rising from the ground. The shingled house he built for Dr. Albert Ely in Shinnecock Hills undulated, broad and low, under a long tile roof imitating thatch, the whole melting into the grassy site. The pattern of shadows cast by the many facets of the roof of his house for Henry Trevor in Southampton was an architectural inkblot test, the shifting planes sure to evoke a different reaction in viewers' eyes. 
 In 1897, the sugar manufacturer Henry Havemeyer gave the neophyte a dream commission, to lay out an entire waterfront summer community oriented around artificial canals in Islip, N.Y. The houses that Atterbury designed were spare and square, faced in stucco, like Foreign Legion outposts in the deserts of Morocco. By comparison, his neo-Georgian New York town houses, although in impeccable taste, wind up being wan and tepid.
 Curiously, Atterbury's own house, at Lexington and 70th Street, is unique in New York, a charming, idiosyncratic collection of copper bays, oriels, greenhouses and other projections that he plastered on to an old brownstone. The interior was an elegant souk of crushed velvet, linen-fold paneling and salvaged bits of old architecture. 
 Only late in his career did he create for someone else a town house of distinctive character, the half-timbered double-lot building at 225 East 49th Street. Commissioned by the composer Efrem Zimbalist and his wife, the soprano Alma Gluck, it looks like a small literary or music club. 
 Town and country houses were the stock in trade for Gilded Age architects, and what sets Atterbury apart from most is his continued interest in housing and other social issues. His 1907 Phipps Model Tenement on East 31st, now demolished, had colossal portals, a checkerboard brick facade and a roof pergola that might have been for the urban elite of Vienna rather than the working poor of New York. 
 In the same year, and for the same family, he designed the Phipps Natatorium, a public pool in Pittsburgh, in a dizzy polychrome of glazed green tile, marble and terra cotta. 
 Margaret Sage, the widow of the financier Russell Sage, used $10 million to create a foundation to improve urban living conditions, which then hired Atterbury to design the 142-acre Forest Hills Gardens in Queens. Atterbury and others worked to import the English idea of the garden city, creating a network of curving streets, green parks and compact but civilized building lots. Single, double and multiple houses drew in different economic classes. His 10-house group called Slocum Crescent recalls, in a modest way, the sprawling mansions that were simultaneously on his boards. 
 Atterbury became convinced that creating humane housing was going to cost money, too much money unless building costs themselves were lowered by scientific research. At Forest Hills he experimented with molded concrete slabs for wall construction, dropping costs by 20 percent, even building test houses on a lot in Sewaren, N.J. He continued such experimentation through his lifetime, although his prefabrication ideas did not catch on. 
 Mr. Pennoyer and Ms. Walker say in their book that in the 1930s, John D. Rockefeller Jr. ''essentially kept him afloat,'' with commissions on Mount Desert Island in Maine for barns and two achingly beautiful gatehouses, rich with alternating brick and stone coursing, half-timbered facades and steep roofs. Another work in this vein is in Newport, R.I., his entrancing Surprise Valley Farm, a rough stone complex evocative of a rocky alpine village built for Arthur Curtiss James. 
 By the time Atterbury died in 1956, his practice encompassed a particularly broad range, including the majestic collegiate Gothic sweep of the Trinity-Pawling School in Pawling, N.Y., the Meso-American modernist Pond house in Tucson, and large-scale housing projects. 
 Mr. Pennoyer says that he and Ms. Walker chose Atterbury for their third book, after works on Warren & Wetmore and Delano & Aldrich, because ''he was a romantic who was also a scientist.'' In this book, both the romance and the science of the man come through.

HEADLINE: Hammer to Fall on Condos

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE Solaria, a 20-story condominium on West 237th Street in Riverdale, the Bronx, towers over the surrounding low-rise neighborhood with a glass-walled facade that echoes the sleek buildings now seen all over Manhattan. 
 It has a rooftop observatory with a telescope, a children's playroom, an entertainment center and lounge, balconies, on-site parking, large layouts -- in short, everything except buyers.
Soon after the Solaria went on the market in fall 2006, the development announced that 20 percent of the 64 apartments had been sold. 
 Since then, the developer has offered a variety of incentives: a one-time $30,000 educational credit, a promise to make mortgage payments for up to a year if a buyer were to be laid off, and even a free iPod for everyone who showed up at a marketing event.
 But as of last week, only 10 buyers had actually closed on apartments, the last in September 2008, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial panic.
 Now the developer is offering the remaining 54 units at auction on Nov. 22 in what Jim Corum, the president of REDC, the California auction company that is handling the sale, called an ''accelerated marketing plan.'' While auctions of large blocks of homes are not unknown in more distressed parts of the country, this will be the largest auction in the current downturn in the Northeast, he said.
 Joseph Korff, the developer, said he was not facing pressure from lenders, but was frustrated because buyers who seemed to like the project were uncertain about where the market was headed and how much apartments were worth. ''Now that we have bottomed out, according to the experts,'' he said, ''the approach is, Let the market speak. Price discovery will come out of the process.''
 Mr. Korff said the minimum bids would typically be about 55 percent of current asking prices, with the lowest-priced unit, a lower-floor one-bedroom, offered for a minimum of $299,000. The lowest asking price pre-auction was about $660,000. 
 A large upper-floor three-bedroom now has an asking price of more than $1.5 million. 
 The auction will take place at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers on Seventh Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan. The on-site Solaria sales office, at 640 West 237th Street, is open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

HEADLINE: Campaign to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Levels Picks a Number to Make a Point

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Campaigners against global warming have drawn on an arsenal of visually startling tactics over the years, from posing nude on a Swiss glacier to scaling smokestacks at coal-fired power plants. 
 On Saturday, they tried something new with the goal of prodding countries to get serious about reaching an international climate accord: a synchronized burst of more than 4,300 demonstrations, from the Himalayas to the Great Barrier Reef, all centered on the number 350.
 For some prominent climate scientists, that is the upper limit for heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, measured in parts per million. If the gas concentration exceeds that for long, they warn, the world can expect decades of disrupted climate patterns, rising sea levels, drought and famine. The current concentration is 387 parts per million. 
 Organizers said their goal, in the prelude to global climate talks in Copenhagen in December, was to illustrate the urgent need to cut emissions by pointing out that the world passed the 350 mark two decades ago. Yet while agreeing that unabated emissions pose serious risks, some prominent scientists and economists focusing on climate policy said the 350 target was so unrealistic that the campaign risked not being taken seriously -- or could convey the wrong message. 
 ''Three-fifty is so impossible to achieve that to make it the goal risks the reaction that if we are already over the cliff, then let's just enjoy the ride until it's over,'' said John M. Reilly, an economist at M.I.T.
 ''The message needs to be that there are risks at the current level, and those risks increase the further we push the system,'' he said.
 In a prominent recent study, scientists concluded that carbon dioxide levels were almost certainly headed beyond any levels experienced on the planet in the last 15 million years. 
 Michael Oppenheimer, a former scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund who is now at Princeton, said it would be a herculean accomplishment to hold concentrations below 450 parts per million in decades. 
 But Bill McKibben, the author and activist who founded 350.org, the group coordinating the protests, defended its approach, saying that settling on a concrete goal articulated as a number was the only way to build a ''global community'' for climate action. 
 ''We need to be thinking about reducing, not going up more slowly,'' he said. ''Three-fifty is the number that says wartime footing, let's see how fast we can possibly move, and let's hope against hope that it's fast enough.''
 Mr. McKibben spent Saturday morning in an office in downtown Manhattan with 20 volunteers coordinating an accelerating flow of videos and photographs from other time zones that captured demonstrations planned in 170 countries. Events focusing on the numberwere held on every continent and from pole to pole, with climbers unfurling a banner on a mountain peak in Antarctica and artists forming a 350 out of hunks of ice on a gravel beach in Greenland, in the Arctic. 
 The Cairo Cyclist Club posed with a banner and activists in front of one of Egypt's great pyramids, while more than 350 roller skaters swept through Tel Aviv.
 Some participants had gotten a head start. On Friday, thousands of students assembled in a plaza in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, waving ''350'' placards. Grinning American soldiers in eastern Afghanistan e-mailed photographs of a 350 fashioned from sandbags. 
 Robert J. Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University who analyzes environmental campaigns, expressed a mixed view of the 350 campaign. It represents ''a new wave of civic environmentalism'' that has proved vital to solving problems, he said, but that approach was abandoned long ago by many big environmental groups that now focus mainly on legislation and litigation.
 But Dr. Brulle questioned the core symbol and message of 350.org. He suggested that it might be too technical and that it focused on deeply cutting emissions without providing a clear path for accomplishing the task. Nonetheless, the effort has been endorsed by dozens of prominent figures, including James E. Hansen, a NASA scientist who has been most closely associated with defining the climate threshold as 350 parts per million. He has campaigned for halting emissions from coal burning altogether by 2030.
 The demonstrations were also endorsed by Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Desmond M. Tutu, the former leader of the Anglican Church in South Africa.
 Mr. McKibben of 350.org said it was up to national leaders to assume a moral obligation to match their actions to the science.
 On Saturday, as the pictures flowed in via e-mail and the Web, he noted that there were hardly any showing celebrities or officials. ''Ordinary people are just haunted by this,'' he said. ''Now they're saying one thing very loudly, and very beautifully.''
 Gavin A. Schmidt, a climate scientist who works with Dr. Hansen and manages a popular blog on climate science, realclimate.org, said those promoting 350 or debating the number might be missing the point.
 ''The situation is analogous to people trying to embark on a cross-country road trip to California, but they've started off heading to Maine instead,'' Dr. Schmidt said. ''But instead of working out ways to turn around, they have decided to argue about where they are going to park when they get to L.A. 
 ''If you ask a scientist how much more CO2 do you think we should add to the atmosphere, the answer is going to be none.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about demonstrations that call for a reduction in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million, which some prominent scientists consider the limit to avoid disruptions from global warming, misstated the job at the Environmental Defense Fund formerly held by Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University scientist, who said it would be a herculean accomplishment to hold those levels below 450 parts per million. It was chief scientist, not scientist.

HEADLINE: Meet the Farmers

BYLINE: By LAN SAMANTHA CHANG. 
Lan Samantha Chang, the director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, is the author of ''Inheritance.''

DATELINE: Iowa City 

 BODY:
 LEO AND DEANNA FUHRMEISTER own a beautiful farm in what my husband, Rob, calls the Yosemite Valley of Iowa City. Rob, a landscape painter, noticed their land from the highway. ''They've got it all,'' he said, admiringly. ''Rolling cornfields, a winding stream, cows and massive oak trees.'' He knocked on their front door, and he's been painting their farm ever since.
 The Fuhrmeisters have been farming near Iowa City for generations. They view themselves as caretakers, and practice crop rotation and no-till farming to protect their fields from erosion. Leo, 71, was born on their farm, and so was Leo's father. In fact, Fuhrmeisters have owned part of this land since 1868. Theirs is a Century Farm, which means, as Leo said with gentle humor, ''I can put a sign on my fence if I want to.'' 
 But even in our farm state, many city folk are detached from the Fuhrmeisters' way of life. The Fuhrmeisters are the only farmers Rob and I know, even after four years in Iowa. ''Most people in farm states really don't know a farmer,'' Deanna said. ''Many children don't even have a clue how their food reaches a grocery store.'' She added, ''I find that scary.'' 
 Like many Iowa farmers who are surviving the recession, the Fuhrmeisters were never seized by credit fever. They are subject to so many forces of the market and of nature they can't control but one thing they can control is debt. In addition, Leo keeps his labor costs minimal. He is lucky: all of his five sons live nearby. None of them has a farm, and during busy times, as he said, ''If Dad hollers loud enough, I get help.'' 
 But Leo makes a punishing investment of his own labor. In the frigid winter, he must chop ice from that picturesque winding stream so his cattle can drink. And at this time of year, harvest time, Leo is outdoors working 16 hours a day. 
 It has been a strange year for corn. Despite the cool summer and frequent rains, the 2009 crop was, at one point, projected to be the largest in state history -- not good news for farmers. ''Last year I got $7.05 for a bushel of corn,'' Leo told me two weeks ago. ''This year it's around $3. That's a heck of a downturn.'' Suddenly, a spate of record rainy days seems to have hampered the harvest, causing a sudden jump in commodities prices and confirming the unpredictability of the market.
 The skyrocketing prices of seed corn and seed beans haven't helped either. Or the fact that fertilizer costs went up with the price of fuel and, unlike fuel prices, didn't come down in time for planting. Rent also rose last year and has been slow to come down. The Fuhrmeisters, like many farmers, must rent land in order to farm 1,000 acres, the minimum required these days to make ends meet. 
 Just as many of us city folk don't know people like Leo and Deanna, we also don't realize how closely connected the economic fates of farmers and non-farmers, residents of the same state, really are. The steadiness of farming has shielded Iowa from the worst of the recession, but the plunging price of our largest crop has resulted in greatly diminished tax revenues.
 With commodities prices low, and modest consumer spending, this means that our state will have a projected budget deficit of 10 percent. Our governor this month ordered an emergency 10 percent spending cut. That means fewer repairs, fewer services and reduced educational resources for every Iowan. 
 My family and the Fuhrmeisters are facing this future together.

HEADLINE: Homeless Deaths Rise, And Anchorage Copes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
A man was down, immobile at the edge of one of this city's busiest intersections. No sirens sounded, no ambulance rushed to the scene. Dealing with the scourge that has consumed Alaska's biggest city is often delegated to two men in a white van, the Community Service Patrol.
 ''We have about 50 to 100 regulars that we pick up on a daily basis,'' said Josh Wilson, one of the patrol workers. 
 The man down was homeless and had passed out, drunk, like he often does. Mr. Wilson knew him by name. The Community Service Patrol would soon take him to the city sleep-off center, where by the next morning, if he was sober enough, he would be free to go. 
 Mr. Wilson said odds were good that he would once again drink and pass out, putting himself and possibly others at risk and demanding intervention from this city's frayed social safety net.
 ''Worse,'' Mr. Wilson said when asked how things had changed in his two years with the patrol. ''Absolutely tenfold worse.''
 The police and social service providers say Anchorage has as many as 400 people they call ''chronic public inebriates,'' with up to 25 percent of them regarded as the most difficult cases. This year, after the deaths of at least 13 homeless people since the spring, there has been a widespread sense that the city's response has been inadequate and must change. 
 The new mayor, Dan Sullivan, a Republican, has created a staff position and a task force devoted to addressing homelessness. The police recently gained the authority to dismantle homeless encampments with just 12 hours' notice. Citizen groups are patrolling parks where homeless camps have been the site of rapes and other violence. But in perhaps the biggest and most controversial break from how the city has handled the problem in the past, a Salvation Army detoxification and alcohol abuse treatment center has begun accepting chronic inebriates who have been taken there essentially by force.
 With $1.2 million in new state financing pushed through by one of Alaska's more liberal Democrats, State Senator Johnny Ellis of Anchorage, the facility, the Clitheroe Center, is accepting people committed under a state law, Title 47. Under the law, a judge can order people into secure treatment for 30 days, and potentially for months, if the police, a doctor or family members convince the judge that the person's abuse of alcohol has made them a threat to themselves and others. The person does not need to have committed a crime.
 ''Ten years ago, there would have been a community outcry that Johnny Ellis is locking up people with the disease of addiction,'' Mr. Ellis said. '' 'How can he do that and say he's still a progressive?' ''
 Now, Mr. Ellis said, the problem has increased so much ''that for various motivations people are saying let's try something new.'' He added, ''The people dropping dead during the summertime really got this community paying attention.''
 One homeless person drowned. Another was hit by a car. One died from hypothermia. Most had been drinking, and several had four or even five times the blood-alcohol level above which a person is considered too drunk to drive. Experts say the problem of public drunkenness is part of a larger homeless problem that disproportionately affects Native Alaskans, particularly men who have moved in from rural parts of Alaska and lost their way in the city. The recession has also played a role.
 Involuntary commitment of homeless alcoholics has been used elsewhere in the country. Some homeless advocates say it infringes on civil rights, and they question its effectiveness. Here in Anchorage, several longtime advocates said the severity of the situation had made them open to giving it a chance.
 ''If the access to services and treatment and supportive resources are there, perhaps this Title 47 will be a good thing for people,'' said Michael Burke, an Episcopal priest who has worked with homeless alcoholics for two decades. ''But if those latter pieces are not present, then you simply have a complex issue for which the only solution is let's lock up the people who are disturbing us. That's not an effective solution, and in the end it won't work.''
 Mr. Burke was among several people who said that cuts to longer-term treatment programs in the past had made detoxification efforts ineffective and could render the Clitheroe program irrelevant if they happen again. Mr. Ellis blamed ''the Republican budget-cutting era'' that took hold in the state capital, Juneau, in the 1990s. ''We lost a lot of our treatment capacity,'' he said.
 He said the new program was deliberately small, paying for just 10 beds at the center.
 Several homeless advocates say that new Republican interest in the issue, as well as the comfort level liberals have with Mr. Ellis, is helping to build a coalition of business owners who want to keep streets clean and safe and homeless advocates who are willing to experiment with more assertive tactics. Jeff Jessee, the chief executive of the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, which provides a wide variety of social services and financing for them, said that while Mayor Sullivan often says, ''We can't continue to allow these people to take over our public spaces,'' he also says, ''These chronic inebriates are also citizens, and we owe them better.''
 Robert Heffle, the director of the Clitheroe Center, said that political motives were irrelevant to him, and that he was simply glad to get the resources to try something new.
 ''If we keep doing what we been doing,'' Mr. Heffle said, ''we're going to keep getting what we've been getting.''

HEADLINE: Who Should Get Affordable Homes?

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
AFFORDABLE housing has long been a contentious subject in the exclusive suburb of Darien. So earlier this year advocates took notice when, after lengthy and heated debate, Darien officials adopted a zoning policy intended to generate cheaper housing. 
 Called ''inclusionary'' zoning, the policy requires every new multifamily development, as well as every subdivision of at least five homes, to designate 12 percent of its units as below-market-rate housing. 
 In a town where about half of all single-family home sales top the $1 million mark, and less than 2 percent of the overall housing stock meets the state's definition of affordable, the inclusionary zoning action deserves ''five gold stars, because this housing is sorely needed,'' said David Fink, the policy director of the HOMEConnecticut campaign for affordable housing. 
 If Darien officials have begun to act on that need, however, the wording of the ordinance suggests that they still have reservations. Under the heading ''Priority Population,'' the ordinance lists seven categories of household that must receive priority when affordable units are offered for sale or rent. Residents or workers in Darien make up the first five. The sixth is for people who used to live there and want to move back. 
 Individuals and families outside of Darien are at the bottom of the list. 
 The policy reflects the tension running through many Connecticut communities as they wrestle with the issue of below-market-rate housing. When officials begin talking about the need to loosen density restrictions or contribute town-owned land to accommodate such housing, residents often want assurances that locals will reap the benefits. 
 ''We get phone calls all the time from people who say: 'Hey, I hear you're building some housing. I could use some help -- I work here, you know,' '' said Christine Nelson, the town planner in Old Saybrook, which has entered a partnership with a nonprofit group to build 16 units of affordable housing.
 When state or federal housing dollars are involved, however, fair-housing laws prohibit such assurances. And predominantly white suburbs like Darien could run afoul of those laws if their policies effectively gave residents a 100 percent advantage, and locked out minorities, fair-housing lawyers say. 
 Evonne Klein, Darien's first selectwoman, said the policy had been reviewed by the town's counsel and was not meant to be exclusionary. Rather, she said, it acknowledges the growing need within the town. ''We have wait lists for all of our affordable housing,'' she said, ''and we have a good number of Darien residents on those lists.'' 
 But Diane Houk, the executive director of the Fair Housing Justice Center in New York, called Darien's population preferences ''highly suspect,'' given that 95 percent of the town's population is white. ''If I were the town,'' she added, ''I would want to have an assessment done on what the impact will be.''
 The justice center did the investigation that led to a recent discrimination lawsuit over residency preferences in Smithtown, N.Y., on Long Island. The town was alleged to have manipulated its waiting list for Section 8 vouchers, the federal assistance program for low-income renters, to routinely favor residents over a larger pool of minority applicants from elsewhere. 
 In March, without admitting wrongdoing, the town settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay monetary damages and to move applicants previously passed over to the top of the list. 
 The law does allow for residency preferences in affordable housing, said Michael Santoro, a community development specialist in the state Department of Economic and Community Development. But if public subsidies are involved, communities must give equal preference to qualified applicants from groups that constitute minorities for that area -- those people considered ''least likely to apply,'' he said. ''It's not in violation to pass a residency preference, but implementing it has the potential to be.'' 
 Old Saybrook did not write a residency preference into its new affordable-housing ordinance, ''wisely, I think,'' said Maryann Amore, the executive director of the HOPE Partnership, the nonprofit organization working with the town on the 16-unit project. Her agency does plan on giving some advantage to applications from residents and local workers, but can't make guarantees, she said. 
 Zoning ordinances in Westport and Wilton do make reference to residency preferences for affordable housing. Wilton specifies a formula for the affordable units that it requires in all multifamily developments: one out of every three must be offered to eligible town employees first, and school employees second. 
 The city of Stamford left residency preferences out of its six-year-old inclusionary ordinance. ''We sort of like diversity,'' said Robin Stein, the city's director of planning and zoning. ''Maybe Darien doesn't.''
 Mr. Stein said that in Stamford, experience had shown that when offering condominiums to lower-income buyers, the challenge was finding applicants who could qualify for a mortgage.
 To some degree, residency preferences reflect fear of the unknown, but those fears are often misguided and unwarranted, said Seila Mosquera, the executive director of NeighborWorks New Horizons, a nonprofit housing agency serving south-central Connecticut. 
 She recalled the resistance her agency encountered in the coastal town of Guilford around 2001 when it was developing 21 units of housing. Neighbors ''were afraid of what was coming into the neighborhood,'' she said. More specifically, she explained, they feared an influx of low-income minority-group members from New Haven. 
 As it turned out, 90 percent of the families and individuals who live in the housing now are from Guilford, although not because NeighborWorks didn't reach out to New Haven. ''The reality is that people from New Haven don't want to live in Guilford,'' Ms. Mosquera said. 
 One New Haven family did move in initially, she said. But they felt so isolated by the absence of public transportation that they returned to the city within the first year.

HEADLINE: Dominicans Try Shots to Boost Rising Players

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Robert Gebeloff, Andrew Keh and Elena Gustines contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic 

 BODY:
The effort to build a better baseball player begins early here, with boys as young as 14 routinely receiving injections of over-the-counter vitamins and painkillers from handlers who stand to profit from their players' prowess.
 The handlers, who are known in Spanish as buscones, are part agent, part trainer and part coach. They make no secret of the injections, which are given to the boys several times a week as they prepare for a chance to play Major League Baseball. 
 The goal, the handlers said in interviews, is to strengthen players for tryouts that could yield signing bonuses of $10,000 to $3 million, of which handlers receive 10 percent to 50 percent.
 Major League Baseball officials said they believed the financial enticement, combined with a culture ingrained with the notion that shots can improve performance, helped explain why Dominicans test positive for banned substances at a far greater rate than players from anywhere else. 
 Dominican-born players make up about 17 percent of major league and minor league rosters in the United States and Latin America, but about 38 percent of the players who tested positive for steroids and other banned substances since 2005. 
 Since 2008, when Major League Baseball instituted drug penalties here, more than half of all suspensions have occurred in the Dominican Summer League, where many newly signed Dominicans begin their careers.
 When investigators for Major League Baseball asked why they tested positive, several players said their handlers had provided them with the substances, according to people in baseball who were briefed on the interviews. Some said they received the substances before they signed with major league teams, the people said. 
 Baseball officials have provided Dominican law enforcement authorities with evidence that some handlers provide performance-enhancing drugs, the people said. A spokesman for baseball declined to identify the handlers but said in a statement that Commissioner Bud Selig had ''devoted a massive amount of resources'' to fighting age and identity fraud and drug use here. 
 Sandy Alderson, a longtime baseball official, was appointed to make comprehensive recommendations to address the issues. The spokesman said that ''given the scope of the problems, however, the cooperation of the Dominican Republic government will be necessary to achieve fundamental reform.''
 Handlers interviewed here in recent weeks said they gave players injections containing only vitamins and painkillers. They said their favored solutions contain vitamin B12, which they said increases the players' appetites, energy and muscle strength, and anti-inflammatory painkillers. Some said they arranged for their players to receive injections at pharmacies and doctors' offices. 
 ''I can't afford to give them meat,'' the handler Victor Baez said, explaining why he injects his 30 players.
 Medical authorities in the United States said that regardless of the substances' makeup, the practice of giving regular injections to teenagers raised medical and ethical concerns.
 ''It borders on child abuse,'' said Thomas H. Murray, a medical ethicist who has written about performance-enhancing drugs for more than 30 years, noting that B12 would have little to no effect on making a player stronger and that painkillers given to boys could have detrimental effects over time. ''It's saying that the road to success is paved with hypodermic needles.'' 
 Murray added: ''Even if it's only a painkiller that you are giving them, you don't want to mask pain of a kid at 14 or 15 because the pain is telling the kid that they are pushing their bodies too far. It can have lasting damage to the joints to push too far, and you need to know when to stop.''
 Dr. Michael J. O'Brien, a sports medicine specialist at Children's Hospital Boston and lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said anti-inflammatories were often injected for a short time for severe pain. 
 ''I am uncomfortable with the idea of a doctor not overseeing any type of injectable drug, particularly an anti-inflammatory,'' O'Brien said. ''Anti-inflammatory injections should be administered in the short term because they can lead to ulcers and kidney disease, especially if they are given in high doses or for a long period of time.''
 The buscone system has developed as this island has become a rich producer of major league talent over the past two decades. It has produced myriad problems for Major League Baseball. Some Dominican stars, like David Ortiz and Sammy Sosa, have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. 
 In the past year, several scouts for major league teams were fired for a kickback scheme in which they conspired with handlers to steal from players' bonuses. The Washington Nationals gave a $1.4 million bonus to a player, then discovered that he and his handler had lied about his age; the player was actually four years older.
 Baseball has little authority to monitor how a player is handled before he is signed. Dominican law prohibits drug testing on any citizens until they are employed, so players cannot be tested for drugs until they sign with major league clubs. 
 Beyond the health issues, baseball has economic incentives regarding players' possible use of performance-enhancing drugs. A pitcher who can add 5 miles an hour to his fastball may add hundreds of thousands of dollars to his signing bonus. So, too, can a hitter who adds 10 feet to his line drive.
 But a player who has inflated his performance through drugs faces a stark choice after signing. He can continue to use the substances and risk testing positive -- which results in a 50-game suspension for a first-time offense -- or he can stop using the substances and risk losing the extra zip with his arm or his bat.
 Gaining the cooperation of the Dominican government has been difficult. Major league officials began lobbying top Dominican law enforcement officials for help in 2008. This summer, Dan Halem, a top baseball labor lawyer, and Alderson told the Dominican authorities that if the government did not address the problems, major league teams would probably begin to close facilities where they develop young players. That would drain millions of dollars from the island's economy. The Dominican authorities agreed to appoint a special prosecutor to look into suspicious handlers, and the baseball officials agreed to provide the evidence they had uncovered. No charges are known to have been brought.
 During the 1990s and the first part of this decade, Major League Baseball was slow to react when performance-enhancing drugs became a major issue. When law enforcement officials tried to gain baseball's cooperation, league officials said they either knew little about the problem or could not help. 
 Now some handlers say they believe Major League Baseball is trying to hurt their credibility so teams can pay less for their players. Baez, who said he has never given his players performance-enhancing drugs, said Major League Baseball's top investigator tried to question his players about whether he had given them steroids.
 ''I called him back and said, 'What do you want, a lawsuit?' '' Baez said. ''None of the 22 players I have had signed ever tested positive.''
 The handlers also blame baseball for wanting to sign younger players. Over the past three years, the handlers said, major league teams have become more interested in signing players at 15 1/2, the minimum age under Dominican law. They said that has prompted them to start giving young players injections and to make their training more strenuous. The handlers said that they now seek 11- and 12-year-olds and try to project how good they will be when they are 15 1/2, and that this has encouraged others to lie about their players' ages. 
 ''It has forced guys that have a really good 19-year-old to present him as a 16-year-old; that's if they don't do the legal thing,'' said Geovanny Blan Veras, who handles two pitchers.
 Felix Guillen, a young handler here, said he learned which substances were safe to inject in his players by taking a sports medicine class at the local university. He said he clears the injections with parents and goes to the players' houses to administer the shots, which he said he gives to each player every three days.
 Guillen said he believed the sports medicine class set him apart from other handlers and gave parents more confidence that he knew what he was doing.
 ''That's the only way to explain how I've been able to go above programs that have been around seven to eight years,'' he said.
 Ramon Mariano, a husky 21-year-old left-handed pitcher, said that he began receiving B12 injections when he was 15, from his handler and at local pharmacies. In 2008, he was expecting a promotion to an Arizona Diamondbacks minor league team in the United States but those plans fell apart after he tested positive. Mariano did not blame the injections, instead saying he believed it was a protein shake that his handler had told him to take. 
 ''Right now, I'll stay home and practice to see if I can get a new contract,'' he said recently, sitting in the living room with his parents, who used his signing bonus to build their home. ''I have been offered to play for Mexico, but I would like to try to sign with another one of the organizations.''

HEADLINE: A High-Fiber Diet for Cars

BYLINE: By STEVEN ASHLEY

 BODY:
WHAT the world could use right now is an affordable plastic car. After all, a car with a plastic frame and body would be lighter than a comparable steel vehicle, get better fuel economy and produce less carbon dioxide. 
 The reality is that the most popular plastic car in American driveways is red and yellow, and is foot-propelled: the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe.
 Alas, that solution is not scalable. The auto industry has for decades waited for the necessary polymer materials to become practical and cheap enough to make mass production of a roadworthy plastic car feasible. That situation may be about to change. 
 The best materials for vehicles are carbon-fiber composites, which are polymers reinforced with embedded carbon fibers. Not only are the substances light, but they are also remarkably strong -- considerably stronger pound for pound in comparison with most metals. This high strength-to-weight ratio is why such polymer composites first replaced metals in military jets like the F/A-18 Hornet. 
 Plastic car structures still face the same obstacles they did in the past: high fiber costs and slow manufacturing throughput. The fibers are tricky to manufacture and therefore expensive, and composite parts have to be baked for hours under high pressures and temperatures in large chambers called autoclaves. Fabrication slows to a crawl. 
 Among others, chemists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and at Japanese textile makers like Toray Industries are working to cut prices by using cheaper, easier-to-process starting materials. 
 Engineers at MAG Industrial Automation Systems, a machine-tool maker in Germany, are also on the case. Daniel Allman, director of MAG's automotive composites business unit, said the company was ''developing a high-performance fiber-reinforced composite material suitable for structural automotive components at a cost that is palatable to the industry.'' 
 Crucially, the new materials do not require autoclave processing. MAG, Mr. Allman said, is looking to complete new production machines that would be able to fabricate structural composite car parts as rapidly as stamped-metal assembly lines.
 Progress in this area may be further advanced than we know. Executives at Toray, which has already spent several hundred million dollars to commercialize carbon fiber auto platforms, have suggested that the first mass-produced plastic car prototypes may be only three to four years away.
 As one might expect of an exotic material, carbon fiber became a fashion statement because of its link to racecar construction. The exposed -- though clear-coated for protection -- weave soon became the rage among the ''Fast and Furious'' tuner crowd and the advanced materials began showing up in trim on all sorts of cars. 
 It is mostly for show. The carbon-fiber roof on the BMW M3 coupe, for instance, saves a dozen pounds and lowers the car's center of gravity a bit, but it is only an exterior surface panel that is supported by a conventional metal substructure underneath.

HEADLINE: Does a Homeless Person Really Need a Watch?

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Here's a sign the recession is not over: New York City this year may stop buying scarves, backpacks, even watches, for the homeless at Christmas.
 Watches?
 For the homeless? 
 Since 2002, the city has spent about $25,000 buying more than 6,500 watches -- and thousands more on scarves and other gifts -- for single men and women in the shelter system. Officials said they try to keep the cost below $10 a person. Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said that she had never heard of the program, and that it struck her ''as surprising if not shocking.''
 ''I have a waiting room of people every morning in desperate need of help,'' Ms. Brosnahan said, ''and I've been at the coalition for 20 years and never heard anyone say they needed a watch.'' 
 But Philip F. Mangano, former executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, in Washington, applauded city officials for their generosity in trying to serve an often invisible minority. He said watches are a sensible gift for homeless people, who need to be punctual for shelter curfews and job interviews.
 ''It fosters a bit more of a sense of independence,'' Mr. Mangano said. ''Some taxpayers, I'm sure, might say, 'Oh, that might seem frivolous or luxurious in a certain way,' not realizing the nuances that are again taken for granted by most of us about that aspect of daily life.''
 In 2006, the city paid $6.75 apiece for 1,500 watches, nearly twice the price in previous years. Officials said the city did not select the lowest bid that year because the cheaper watches would have needed a new battery after 12 months. The last batch came from Finesse Creations of Brooklyn and was a water-resistant, metal-band men's watch with a quartz movement.
 For the past two years, there have been no watches, though the city says it has kept buying gifts like scarves, gloves and backpacks for the homeless. 
 Robert V. Hess, the commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, said the shift in gifts was not because of any dissatisfaction with the concept of giving watches, or with the watches themselves.
 ''Generally, people felt it had some value, and clients were benefiting,'' he said.
 Now, though, the gift-giving tradition may come to an end. ''These are very difficult economic times,'' Mr. Hess noted.
 (Gifts for homeless children would not be affected because they are traditionally donated by others.)
 Advocates for the homeless say financial strains are evident throughout the city's $700 million homeless-services system. David Obele, one of three monitors charged with checking on shelter conditions under a 1981 consent decree, said the city often does not meet a court-ordered requirement to provide basic items like fresh linens weekly.
 ''When they can't have pillows, why give them watches?'' he asked.
 City officials said the gifts were distributed at shelters that served single adults, though they refused to say which ones, citing client confidentiality. 
 At one such shelter, for men, at the corner of Bedford and Atlantic Avenues in Brooklyn, several men who said they had lived there for several years did not recall ever getting a gift from the city, but said they would welcome a watch.
 ''You want to know what time it is, you got to ask someone,'' said Gregory Session, 49. 
 Three other homeless men yanked up their sleeves to show they indeed did not have timepieces.
 ''Hey, I'm late, man,'' joked Willie Fluellen, 48, gazing at his naked wrist.

HEADLINE: Foreclosed Delusions In Reality TV's Home Market

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
ACCORDING to latest reports from the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, a closely followed measure of the residential real estate market, we are, if not in end-times, still enduring a grim and ugly passage. Although housing prices showed slight gains in July over the previous month, they are still sunk at levels not seen in six years. And so, surely you have wondered -- once you have contemplated the depressing fate of families caught in foreclosures, the ghost-town atmosphere of cul-de-sac enclaves in southern Florida -- what has this meant for reality television? 
 During the high times, of course, when every wood-frame bungalow in the San Fernando Valley held the promise of Apple stock in 1997, channels like HGTV and Bravo fostered our faith in a market of seemingly limitless escalation. An entire subgenre of television arrived -- a spate of series promoting the idea that anyone with access to a line of credit could reap a fortune buying a house, installing a Sub-Zero fridge and some marble sinks and selling it at a 100 percent profit. If Jeff Lewis, the jerky Los Angeles speculator and subject of Bravo's ''Flipping Out,'' could make a buck turning houses, why couldn't you? This is a man who sent his cat, Monkey, to an acupuncturist. 
 In response to the Great Recession, dueling schools of real estate reality have emerged on the air, each appealing to opposing inclinations. One indulges the pleasure we take in the suffering of the many Jeffs we used to envy and emulate who are now stuck with properties they cannot unload. The other speaks to our sympathies, showcasing remorseful buyers who bought at the height of the market with money they didn't have. 
 As for Jeff, he (joy!) has lost a third of his net worth. Unable to buy anything with 10 percent or 20 percent down, he is also missing out on some incredible deals, as banks now demand the 30 percent he hasn't got. If you have watched ''Flipping Out'' in the past, and observed Mr. Lewis abusing his underlings, screaming at them for not arranging his Evian bottles correctly, and found yourself throwing spoiled fruit at his image, then his shift in circumstance will feel like a Candygram delivered from your television. 
 That his delusions continue to persist only add to the thrill: ''I might have to start off small again, like I did 10 years ago,'' Mr. Lewis reflected at the season's outset. ''Maybe buy those $700,000 houses for 450 and put in 50 and sell them for 650.'' 
 His welcome comeuppance has come in multiple ways throughout the series's third season (which officially concludes with a reunion show on Tuesday). An adviser, for instance, tells him the market will tumble for another 5 or 10 years. With flipping no longer much of a viable career option, Mr. Lewis returns like Cinderella after the ball, to the more debased business of remodeling, figuring that with so few houses selling, homeowners will hunker down and refurbish rather than subject themselves to the indignities of a stagnant market. 
 Among his clients are an obnoxious couple paying him a pittance. They complain about everything and present him with debris from their garden to prove that his workers are slobs. The couple also feel the need to call and let him know when their midday coitus has been interrupted by the sudden appearance of the help. A study in the psychology of egomania, ''Flipping Out'' also lays fraud to the idea that misfortune builds character and makes us better people. Mr. Lewis does not become a better person. He remains greedy, petulant, small-minded, arrogant without justification, ill-tempered, ungenerous -- singularly detestable. 
 The real estate agents depicted on the Bravo series ''Million Dollar Listing'' (shown Mondays) seem to lack his demonic potential, offending instead with an attitude of smarmy imperiousness. Chad Rogers, Madison Hildebrand and Josh Flagg -- brokers presiding over various moneyed precincts in West Los Angeles and young enough never to have toiled through a downturn -- sell with bleached teeth and flurries of condescension. As one of the three, who moves $7 million houses in Malibu and $75,000-a-month summer rentals, explains while getting laser hair-removal treatments, ''It really pays to have good grooming.'' 
 Styling, though, cannot help with the task at hand: convincing wealthy and entitled clients that the market can no longer sustain the exorbitant and overinflated asking prices they are demanding. Madison, for instance, is stuck with a nut case who consults a numerologist and spiritual adviser to determine how much she should get for her house, landing on the sum of $2,996,000. (Why? Because if you add up all the digits you get 26, and if you add up those two digits you get 8, which she has been told is fortuitous for her purposes.) 
 Another broker insists his client needs to come down and wonders how it can be that she believes her house is worth $800,000 more than the nine already for sale in the area. He has an equally tough time talking a sex advice writer out of her own anachronistic boom-time fantasies. The owner of a 6,000-square-foot estate in Malibu, Laura, who seems to have been born with the genetics of Barbara Eden and the surgical tastes of Joyce Wildenstein, wants what she wants, and she is reluctant to come down from the $6 million she seeks for her property, regardless of the new turbulence. The strange effect of ''Million Dollar Listing'' is to ensure that your sympathies lie with brokers in sports cars who wage daily war against the smug hallucinations of the even richer. 
 If reality television can be taken as sociological inquiry, then one conclusion is that middle-class homeowners seem to have retained what they have read about the recent year in housing-crisis news more readily than their counterparts at the higher end of the tax bracket. On ''Real Estate Intervention'' (HGTV, Thursdays) homeowners, many sucked in by zero-percent financing, realize that their houses aren't worth what they've paid for them. 
 Each episode features a real estate consultant, Mike Aubrey, coming in to help sellers price their properties in accordance with the market realities of their neighborhoods. Typically he takes sellers to houses of comparable size and appeal, only to inform them gloomily how little they've recently commanded in price. Often the seller under his tutelage has been out of work, forced to move, on the verge of raiding a personal retirement account or child's college fund to get by. Occasionally his advice -- which more or less always boils down to price reduction -- meets with resistance. More memorably it also meets with tears.

DOROTHEA LANGE
 A Life Beyond Limits
 By Linda Gordon
 Illustrated. 536 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $35
 Any list of the most enduring American photographs of the past century is likely to include Joe Rosenthal's ''Flag Raising on Iwo Jima''; John Filo's image of a young woman at Kent State kneeling in anguish over the body of a mortally wounded college protester; and Richard Drew's ''Falling Man,'' showing the fatal descent of a solitary figure from a high floor of the World Trade Center on 9/11. But perhaps the most iconic image -- gracing textbooks, hanging from dormitory walls, affixed to political posters, even adorning a postage stamp -- is Dorothea Lange's ''Migrant Mother,'' taken at a California farmworkers camp in 1936. The photo shows a woman nurturing three young children, one in her arms, the others leaning on her for support. Her manner is strong and protective, yet her face shows the worry of someone overpowered by events beyond her control. She has trekked west from the ravaged Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, finding fieldwork where she can. Gazing into space, she represents the spirit of America itself in the midst of history's worst economic disaster -- the mix of courage and compassion that will lead a proud, invincible nation to endure. 
 ''Migrant Mother'' has a serendipitous history, as Linda Gordon makes clear in ''Dorothea Lange,'' an absorbing, exhaustively researched and highly political biography of a transformative figure in the rise of modern photojournalism. Lange had been hired by the Farm Security Administration, one of the New Deal's more progressive agencies, to document the plight of farmworkers in the Great Depression, a mandate that covered everyone from Southern black sharecroppers to Dust Bowl refugees to Mexican-American migrants in the fields stretching from Texas to California. Led by Roy Stryker, a phenomenal talent spotter, the F.S.A. photography project schooled the likes of Walker Evans, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein and Ben Shahn. Most came from urban backgrounds. ''I didn't know a mule from a tractor,'' Lange admitted. What bound them together was their devotion to the principles of social justice represented by the New Deal. 
 Lange's territory included all of California, which she covered by automobile. Driving north on Route 101 on a miserable winter's day, she passed a hand-lettered sign reading ''Pea-Pickers Camp'' near the town of Nipomo. Lange drove on for 20 miles before something pulled her back. On the job for almost a year, she had come to understand the rhythms of migrant life, the periods of physically exhausting labor followed by even longer (unpaid) periods of emotionally draining inactivity. In the Nipomo camp, Lange met Florence Thompson, 32, the mother of 11 children, five born out of wedlock. The family was in desperate straits, living off stolen vegetables from the fields. Lange took a half-dozen photos, putting Thompson and her children in different poses. She took the photos from just outside their tent, even moving a pile of soiled laundry aside, so as not to embarrass the subjects by noting their squalid living conditions. (Though Gordon doesn't mention it, Lange may have decided to use only three of the children to avoid the public perception of ''Okies'' as irresponsible ''white trash.'') For the key photo, she ''made the unusual decision to ask the two youngsters leaning on their mother to turn their faces away from the camera,'' Gordon writes. ''She was building the drama and impact of the photograph by forcing the viewer to focus entirely on Florence Thompson's beauty and anxiety, and by letting the children's bodies, rather than their faces, express their dependence on their mother.'' 
 Gordon, who teaches history at New York University, is a leading scholar of gender and family in modern American life. (I teach part of the year at N.Y.U. but have rarely crossed paths with her.) Not surprisingly, she spends a fair amount of space on Lange's personal life and role as a female photographer in a male-dominated profession. Born in Hoboken, N.J., in 1895 to middle-class German-American parents, Lange faced two handicaps as a child: a severe bout with polio that left her with a permanently weakened leg and an absentee father who abandoned the family and never returned. As Gordon sees it, Lange overcame the physical handicap a lot more easily than the emotional one, though each increased her empathy for people on the margins of society. Showing little interest in school, Lange apprenticed herself to a string of portrait photographers in New York, where she learned the mechanics of the trade and the art of bonding seamlessly with her subject. ''Photography was a new profession and therefore not defined as a uniquely male skill or tradition,'' Gordon says. In San Francisco, where Lange moved in 1918, she created a portrait studio ''successful beyond her dreams.'' 
 She was married twice: first to the artist Maynard Dixon, who introduced her to the wonders of nature; next to Paul Schuster Taylor, an economics professor, who kindled her interest in progressive reform. Gordon expertly analyzes the political culture of Depression-era California, where the enormous power of big agriculture kept tens of thousands of landless workers in peonage and despair. She portrays Lange as an ambivalent radical, deeply sympathetic to the plight of the migrants yet uncomfortable with the chaos that social conflict inevitably produced. Early in the Depression, Lange had tried but failed to photograph the labor protests that shook San Francisco. ''Much of the action was so fast-moving and so violent that slow-moving Lange could not or would not get close,'' Gordon writes. ''This was the territory of the new breed of adventurous photojournalists.'' Lange's talent lay elsewhere. 
 Gordon is more in tune with the politics of Paul Taylor, who believed in organized protest to redress economic grievances, than she is with Lange's more passive approach. A portrait photographer at heart, Lange stressed the inner emotions of those facing injustice and deprivation. ''Her documentary photography was portrait photography,'' Gordon says. ''What made it different was its subjects, and thereby its politics.'' An individualist at heart, Lange provided an alternative to the photography of wretchedness, which centered on the misery of beaten-down victims, as well as to the Popular Front mythology, which showed earnest, well-muscled men and women laboring together in fields and factories to produce a Soviet-style paradise on earth. Lange saw America as a worthy work in progress, incomplete and capable of better. By portraying her subjects as nobler than their current conditions, she emphasized the strength and optimism of our national character. She became, in Gordon's words, ''America's pre-eminent photographer of democracy.'' 
 But not for long. Though Lange would go on to photograph the dehumanizing process of Japanese-American internment during World War II and produce a number of elegant spreads for Life magazine, her unique brand of photojournalism -- dignified, personal, contemplative -- was overwhelmed by the action of wartime photography and the more abstract avant-garde imagery to come. In some ways, Lange, who died in 1965, remains frozen in the '30s -- a relic of the Depression and the enormous creative energy it unleashed. But even a glance at ''Migrant Mother'' reminds us of the timelessness of her best work. ''A camera is a tool for learning how to see without a camera,'' she liked to say. Gordon's elegant biography is testament to Lange's gift for challenging her country to open its eyes.

HEADLINE: ON THE WATERFRONT

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE. 
Andrew Rice is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
 THE GOWANUS CANAL runs one and a half miles through brownstone Brooklyn, cutting a disreputable gash between two of the most desirable residential neighborhoods in New York City. Sunken below street level, no more than 100 feet across at most points, the canal does not really flow -- it skulks. On sunny days, its waters take a greenish hue and are clear enough to afford glimpses of rotting bulkhead timbers, mud-caked tires and other submerged detritus. When it's overcast, the water turns an inert gray. In the lawless old days, industries along the canal's banks fouled it with all kinds of pollution. Today, the canal is mostly disused, a corridor of warehouses and razor wire, and the most enduring reminders of its colorful past emanate from several underground deposits of coal tar, which belch up oily bubbles. The residue forms a prismatic sheen on the canal's surface, reflecting shimmering visions of the landscape. 
 Created in the mid-19th century out of a tidal creek named for an Indian headman, the Gowanus long resisted attempts at reformation, in sluggish defiance of generations of city planners, civic do-gooders, editorialists and speculators. But over the past decade, the government has cleaned up the water a bit, allowing the canal to be recolonized by some hardier forms of natural life -- shore crabs and cormorants, silvery bait fish -- along with enterprising humans. First came the artists for the cheap studio space, then the hipsters for the decayed authenticity, and finally, in the inevitable progression, residential developers arrived. 
 The Bloomberg administration, sensing a chance for revitalization, rushed to rezone 25 blocks of the Gowanus area for nonindustrial uses, identifying more than 60 development sites with a potential to generate at least $500 million in tax revenue. It didn't appear to be a deterrent that the canal was, quite literally, still something of a cesspool. New York is, after all, a city where people have proved themselves willing to live almost anywhere, where no location, be it smelly or notorious (think the meatpacking district or Hell's Kitchen or Brooklyn's Myrtle Avenue, formerly known as Murder Avenue), seems to be beyond the reach of gentrification. But the case of the Gowanus Canal has put that assumption to an extreme test. The redevelopment process was creeping forward when, in April, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was considering adding the Gowanus Canal to its Superfund cleanup program, which is reserved for the nation's worst hazardous-waste sites. The move surprised and enraged city officials, who warn that the ''stigma'' of being included in the program could halt economic improvement indefinitely.
 ''What some people say is, 'Well, everybody knows the Gowanus Canal is polluted,' '' says Cas Holloway, a mayoral adviser. ''That is true, but the Superfund designation, in itself, is an important signifier in the marketplace.''
 As the environmental debate rages on, the Gowanus Canal has been left to wait on the verge of metamorphosis, no longer one thing but not yet another. ''It's this area of transition,'' a real estate broker named William Duke told me recently. It was a warm weekday evening in September, and we were standing at the trash-strewn terminus of a street that dead-ends into the waterway. ''Between the old and the new, the natural world and the man-made world,'' Duke went on. ''It's poetic.''
 Duke is a canal enthusiast, a member of the small and quirky community that congregates around it, like so much flotsam, and a member of the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club. Once or twice a week, club members lend canoes to anyone willing to sign a liability waiver. Duke handed me and my sister, my canoeing companion, life jackets and paddles and helped us put into the water for an exploratory trip. High above us loomed a long-abandoned powerhouse for the old streetcar lines, now tagged with anticorporate slogans. A couple of years ago, it was taken over by squatting punks, who were rousted by foreign investors, including a diamond magnate close to Vladimir Putin. They announced plans to knock down the structure and replace it with Gowanus Village, a set of Brutalist-looking apartment buildings designed by a renowned architectural firm.
 It was the same story everywhere along the canal: developers had come bearing watercolor renderings of an idealized blue waterway, flanked by condo buildings and walkways full of joggers and strollers. At Carroll Street, next to a landmarked retractile bridge, we saw a grove of poplars and an informal outdoor performance space that was slated to make way for a 450-unit complex of condominiums and town houses developed by Toll Brothers, the national luxury homebuilder. Farther along, past a string of moored boats of uncertain seaworthiness, there was another proposed residential development site. Doubling back to the canal's south end, where there was a strong smell of petroleum, we paddled by a six-acre lot, owned by the city, that was intended for a 770-unit, mixed-income apartment complex, with an adjoining park, boathouse and waterside cafe. Then, near the Seussian pile of a scrap-metal yard, there was the coup de grace of impending yuppification: a construction site that was supposed to become a Whole Foods.
 All of these projects were proposed at the height of New York's real estate boom, and nowadays, regardless of the outcome of the Superfund controversy, some of them look very much like the products of mania. But whether they actually come to fruition, the plans have already altered the canal's identity, after decades of neglect, by making it into something valuable enough to fight over. Since the arrival of the developers, numerous competing interests have stepped forward to stake their own claims to what Bill Appel, the head of the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation, calls ''a vast wasteland.'' The urban homesteaders who have moved there want it to remain an eccentric hideaway; artists want to preserve its postapocalyptic look; a civic group, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, proposes to create a public park atop an innovative filtration system that acts like an artificial wetland.
 ''A few years ago, if you said 'Gowanus' to people, it had a connotation of rundown, derelict, even toxic, space,'' says Sharon Zukin, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College and author of the forthcoming book ''Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places.'' But in a city where industry is increasingly invisible, it's perhaps only natural that the canal would come to be prized, precisely because it retains some qualities of a vanishing, unsterilized version of the city. ''It goes back to an earlier period when Brooklyn was new,'' Zukin said, ''and it offers a path back to a time that we don't know.''
 IT WAS THE day before the September Democratic primary election in New York City, and Salvatore Scotto -- known as Buddy to friends and foes alike -- was in his natural element. Sitting in a small coffee shop on Court Street in Brooklyn, he greeted gray-haired men in Italian, reminding them to vote for his favorite City Council candidate and jovially pressing them to buy tickets to a community group's fund-raiser. ''The mayor is going to be there,'' Scotto promised. ''He's going to tell us something about the Gowanus Canal.''
 One of the city's senior Gowanus enthusiasts, Scotto is a funeral-home proprietor and neighborhood politico, a cheerfully anachronistic clubhouse character. Scotto, who is 81, likes to call himself the mayor of the Gowanus Canal and takes credit -- much of it deserved -- for seeing the waterway's potential when others simply held their noses. In an era before modern sanitation, the canal was designed to serve not only as a commercial port but also as a discharge point for the city's sewer system. By the time Buddy Scotto's grandfather arrived in Brooklyn in 1898, a public campaign against the canal's revolting smell was already afoot, with some calling for the corridor to be closed down and filled in. Instead, the city built a tunnel that circulated water from New York Harbor through the canal. But that solution never completely worked, and when the tunnel broke down in the 1960s, no one bothered to fix it. ''The stench was clear up to Court Street in the summertime,'' Scotto recalled. How the canal started to get clean, as he tells it, is an ornate tale of vintage municipal intrigue: he got a new sewage treatment plant built through horse-trading with Nelson Rockefeller and extracted a promise of financing to restore the flushing tunnel from a congressman weakened by a sex scandal. Bureaucratic delays kept the tunnel work from being completed for years, but finally in 1999 it began pumping in hundreds of millions of gallons of harbor water.
 By this time most waterfront industries had deserted the canal. Scotto had a model for its revival: the picturesque river that runs through San Antonio, which is lined by restaurants and hotels. And sure enough, once the flushing system began to dissipate the infamous odor, life began to stir. High-priced development was marching toward the canal in a pincer movement, from Carroll Gardens on one side and Park Slope on the other. The 2006 announcement that Toll Brothers planned to build a $250 million residential complex on the canal marked a watershed moment. The publicly traded company was the quintessential suburban luxury brand, best known for its lavish estate homes. The idea that it would consider the Gowanus Canal a comfortable place to settle made Scotto feel vindicated. ''I want that development badly,'' he said. ''I mean, getting Toll Brothers to prove that you can have people living on that canal!'' 
 Other builders rushed to follow Toll Brothers' slipstream. But local opposition materialized just as quickly. The divide was clannish: fixtures of the old Italian neighborhood were increasingly outnumbered by the artsy types who had gained a foothold along the canal and the professionals who had paid millions for town houses on the tree-lined (and now stink-free) streets nearby. Some critics objected to the scale of the project, others accused it of corporate blandness, but the chief rallying cry was environmental. 
 In March 2009, the City Council voted to let Toll Brothers proceed with its project, but within weeks the E.P.A. threw up a new obstacle: the proposed Superfund listing. Toll Brothers and the other developers recoiled in horror. ''You can't sell a condominium on a Superfund site,'' says Robert Pascucci, whose construction company has tentative plans to build a 360-unit residential complex along the canal. To Scotto, it seemed that the E.P.A. was carelessly throwing a lifetime's worth of work into doubt.
 SINCE THE E.P.A.'S announcement, all the other issues surrounding the canal, including the city's rezoning initiative, have been superseded by an argument over federal intervention. Superfund supporters say that the E.P.A.'s move confirmed what they always suspected: that the canal is too dangerous to develop. ''It's a swamp,'' says Marlene Donnelly, an architectural designer and a leader of group called Friends and Residents of Greater Gowanus, or Frogg, which meets in the back of a wine store on fashionable Smith Street. ''It's not the place for this kind of development.''
 There are multiple dimensions to the canal's pollution problems. First there is the ongoing problem of the water. The city's ancient sewer system runs both stormwater and household waste through the same overloaded pipes, and when it rains, some of the overflow is redirected into the canal; an estimated 300 million gallons of dirty water, including untreated sewage, flood into the Gowanus each year. Riverkeeper, the environmental advocacy group, has detected unsafe levels of pathogens in regular tests of the water. ''There are extremely high concentrations of a lot of really, really nasty things,'' says Joshua Verleun, a Riverkeeper staff lawyer.
 That's obviously not a selling point for real estate, and as part of its redevelopment efforts the city had already announced a $175 million plan to limit the sewer overflow. But that would do little to address an even nastier problem: the bottom of the canal, which hasn't been extensively dredged since 1975 because of the complexity and expense involved in dumping the sediment. Core samples contain a horde of chemicals, some of them now banned, and heavy metals like lead, mercury and arsenic. Probably the most vexing contaminant is coal tar, a byproduct of a 19th-century process for manufacturing gas for lighting. There were once three gas plants along the Gowanus, and they left behind spreading subterranean lakes of ooze that have since seeped into the canal's bed.
 Walter Mugdan, the E.P.A. official who coordinates the Superfund program in New York, says that bringing the canal into the program is the best way to assure that it gets completely remediated. (When I asked him about the wisdom of canoeing the canal, he replied, ''Try not to tip.'') The Bloomberg administration has vehemently opposed the proposal on grounds that the Superfund process is litigious and glacially slow, and it has proposed its own alternative plan that is tied to multiple, but uncertain, financing sources, including Congressional earmarks. 
 Toll Brothers has made it clear that if the designation is made, it will almost certainly walk away from the Gowanus Canal. ''We're talking decades'' for a Superfund cleanup to be completed, says David Von Spreckelsen, the Toll Brothers executive leading the project. He says that existing city and state programs have already made great progress without hindering investment. ''For a really valuable area in the heart of New York City, the heart of Brooklyn, is Superfund really the way we want to go?'' Von Spreckelsen asks. ''Because we're writing it off for a really, really long time.''
 Of course, there are plenty of other forces conspiring against development at the present moment. Like most homebuilders, Toll Brothers has been hit hard by the nationwide real estate collapse -- it has reported $644 million in net losses so far this year -- and some local observers wonder whether the economic impetus that drove the wave of investment in the Gowanus may have ebbed. For instance, despite price cuts, Satori, a high-profile 34-unit condominium development across the street from the canal, has recorded only 12 sales since it hit the market in the late summer of 2008, according to streeteasy.com. The developers who proposed Gowanus Village have already given up and put their land back on the market. As the final decision on Superfund listing sits with E.P.A. authorities in Washington, it looks increasingly likely that, for the immediate future, the canal will continue to belong to those who are already there -- the pioneers.
 ''I think the economy has saved the artists,'' says Joshua Marks, a sculptor who is a coordinator of a Gowanus studio tour, held every October, called Agast. The bohemians have been drawn to the canal by many of the very qualities that its self-appointed saviors hope to eliminate. They have shown an arch appreciation for its toxic reputation, making the Gowanus landscape into a subject of their work and finding inventive ways to reuse its rundown structures. A few years ago, a group of artists took over a decrepit World War II-era Navy rescue boat and turned it into a floating gallery space. This summer, a company called Macro Sea set up some trash container bins on a parking lot, lined them with plastic, filled them with water and started a postindustrial pool club. One of the canal's most distinctive sights is a pair of silo-shaped structures, former storage tanks that have been retrofitted as artist studios by a local investor and impresario named David Lefkowitz. The past two years, Lefkowitz has teamed with a party promoter to put on summertime musical events next to the silos and the dock where he parks his motorboat.
 If the canal's recent history is a conflict between what is and what could be, Lefkowitz has a foot on each side of the transition. Practically, he's a speculator, but temperamentally he's an enthusiast. A ruddy man of diverse pursuits, he bought his land a decade ago, and he speaks about the waterway in almost mystical terms. ''Even if the water was dirty, you could feel that magic,'' he told me one recent afternoon, as he piloted his motorboat toward the Ninth Street Bridge. We passed a metal yard, where a massive crane was loading salvaged scraps onto a barge -- a fine metaphor, Lefkowitz suggested. ''It's a miracle of rebecoming,'' he told me. ''What's exciting to people is that they can stand there and fantasize about what it could become.''
 The narrow corridor opened up into Gowanus Bay and then the bobbing expanse of New York Harbor. Lefkowitz explained why, after many years of trying out various enterprises, he finally agreed to sell his property to Toll Brothers, at a considerable price. ''There is no other dream that makes sense,'' he said. ''The usage that's coming is the usage of its time.'' 
 As we headed back up the canal, we passed a group of teenagers hanging out at the end of a dead-end road, smoking something. ''Where does this lead to?'' one of them yelled across the dark green water.
 Lefkowitz shouted back, ''Heaven!''

HEADLINE: San Jose Improves Its Airport; Now, Just Flights Lag

BYLINE: By VINDU GOEL

 BODY:
These days, it is only a slight exaggeration to say that Mineta San Jose International Airport, which serves the 10th-largest city in the United States, offers nonstop service to nowhere.
 Located about 50 miles from San Francisco, San Jose views itself as the capital of Silicon Valley and once boasted of direct flights to foreign capitals like Tokyo, Taipei and Paris.
Now, it relies on two daily flights to Mexico to justify the ''international'' in its name. Although flights to California cities are abundant, San Jose travelers can board only one plane a day to the East Coast -- a red-eye to New York on JetBlue Airways, which recently decided to cancel all other service from the city. 
 The recession, which has battered the finances of the region's technology companies as well as the airlines, deserves some of the blame. Over the past two years, San Jose's airport has lost 22 percent of its available seats as embattled airlines try to cram more passengers onto fewer planes, according to data from OAG Worldwide. The airport in nearby Oakland has been hit even worse. 
 But the weak economy is not the whole story. Capacity at San Francisco International Airport, the main airport in the region, remains at 2007 levels, as Virgin America started service and other carriers decided to consolidate Bay Area flights there.
 No, the decline of San Jose's airport really reflects a broader struggle for respect. San Jose is the area's biggest city, with about one million residents and a dynamic hometown industry, but San Francisco is the belle of the bay. And no one will let San Jose forget it.
 ''It's true of everything we do in San Jose -- we're overshadowed by San Francisco,'' said Terry Christensen, a professor of political science at San Jose State University. ''It's a matter-of-fact, working town.'' 
 San Jose's shrinking air service comes even as its airport will soon look better than ever. A $1.3 billion makeover is replacing old-fashioned rolling jet stairs and cramped check-in areas with modern jet bridges, sunny concourses, free wireless Internet and the latest technology to detect bombs in baggage.
 ''We have not had a good product,'' admitted Bill Sherry, the director of aviation.
 Residents have agitated for a better airport for years, but when Mr. Sherry took over in 2005, he quickly realized that the airlines and travelers that pay for the airport's operations through rents and fees did not need -- and could not afford -- the city's planned $4.5 billion expansion. The project was scaled back. As the recession sliced into revenues, the airport laid off workers and cut costs to keep on track. 
 When the upgrade is completed next summer, Mr. Sherry said he would finally have something worth peddling. ''Now, you've got to market it,'' he said.
 It will not be an easy sell. From a practical perspective, the Bay Area's three airports are close enough to one another that most travelers are willing to drive to whichever meets their price and scheduling needs.
 ''When you have three good-to-great options all within a half-hour drive, no one owns the market,'' said Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, an association of the area's largest companies.
 Mr. Guardino said local business leaders were far more concerned with other issues, like getting more visas for skilled immigrants and extending the Bay Area Rapid Transit train line to San Jose. 
 Chuck Reed, the mayor of San Jose, which owns the airport, also has bigger worries. A practical nuts-and-bolts manager who rarely flies, Mr. Reed is trying to figure out how to close a projected $90 million budget deficit for the next fiscal year, lure new businesses to empty office towers and bring the Oakland A's to a new stadium in downtown San Jose. Since the airport is not paid for by taxpayer money, it is not a pressing issue. 
 Meanwhile, the dot-com bust and the current recession have taught many businesses to get by with far less flying. Cisco Systems, a network technology giant that employs nearly 18,000 at and near its San Jose headquarters, has permanently cut its travel budget in half, replacing much of it with videoconferencing, which is a major Cisco product line.
 John T. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said his employees could still get where they needed to go. And he sympathizes with the financial straits of the airlines. ''Flights will be provided when there is traffic to go,'' Mr. Chambers said.
 JetBlue, which is canceling its three daily flights from San Jose to Long Beach, said they had never been profitable. The carrier has decided to reallocate its Long Beach slots to flights from San Francisco and Oakland.
 More ominously for San Jose's expansion prospects, a JetBlue spokesman, Sebastian White, said the airline learned that few people, especially on the East Coast, knew where the city is. ''San Francisco is the city that our customers prefer to fly to,'' Mr. White said.
 American Airlines, which had a mini-hub in San Jose a decade ago, has steadily downsized it since the Sept. 11 attacks. This summer, it eliminated its popular twice-daily ''nerd bird'' service from San Jose to the Texas technology hub of Austin. American now has just 19 flights a day from San Jose and will cut that to 14 in November.
 Daniel P. Garton, executive vice president of marketing at American, said the airline recently decided to concentrate more on serving Dallas, Chicago, Miami, New York and Los Angeles. 
 ''We believe it's important to win some battles as opposed to being mediocre across the board,'' Mr. Garton said. ''It's a matter of where you're going to make your stand.''
 If such trends continue, San Jose could end up with only low-cost airlines like Southwest running short, frequent flights. 
 ''It's almost like San Jose is a rail station,'' said Manoj Khiani, who lives in San Jose and takes 40 to 50 plane trips a year as director of sales engineering for Liquid Machines.
 Southwest, which operates about half of all flights from San Jose, has maintained virtually all of its service there over the past two years. Unlike many rivals, it says it can make money flying planes that are two-thirds full, and offering high-frequency service within California is a key part of its strategy.
 San Jose is ''operationally a very reliable airport,'' said Martin Pritchard, who plans capacity at Southwest. ''We try not to fix it if it isn't broken.''
 Alaska Airlines, a regional carrier with significantly lower costs than American, also sees opportunity in San Jose. It jumped in with a flight to Austin when American pulled out and plans to add a second one in March. 
 ''We have been working on the West Coast high-tech community for years and years,'' said Steve Jarvis, vice president of marketing, sales and customer experience at Alaska. ''There definitely is a market there.'' 
 Those small signs of support -- and indications that the economy is picking up -- give Mr. Sherry hope that he will be able to reverse San Jose's traffic slide.
 Once the construction is finished, he intends to approach local business leaders and show them how much they would save -- in money and valuable employee time -- if they could help him persuade airlines to add flights to San Jose.
 Mr. Sherry predicts that the airlines will also realize they are fighting a destructive price war in San Francisco and shift some flights to the south.
 For Mr. Khiani, more flights would be nice, but the airport, like the city, does the job well enough. ''The people who chose to live inSan Jose know what they signed up for -- same as the people who live in Jersey, right?'' he said.

SIXTY FEET, SIX INCHES
 A Hall of Fame Pitcher and a Hall of Fame Hitter Talk About How the Game Is Played
 By Bob Gibson and Reggie Jackson with Lonnie Wheeler
 273 pp. Doubleday. $26
 For 15 years, from the mid-1960s to the late '70s, two players dominated October baseball. The first was Bob Gibson, perhaps the most imposing pitcher in the game's history. In 1964, working on two days' rest for the St. Louis Cardinals, he helped to end the Yankee dynasty of Mantle and Berra by pitching all of Game 7 of the World Series. Three years later, he beat the Boston Red Sox three times in one World Series. The next year, he set a Series record by striking out 17 Detroit Tigers in one game. 
 After Gibson retired, he was soon replaced on the October stage by a player who eventually took that month as his moniker: Reggie Jackson, Mr. October. Today, fans tend to recall his three home runs, in three straight at-bats, against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977. But there was so much more: a steal of home for the Oakland A's in the 1972 playoffs; the Most Valuable Player award in the 1973 Series; the illicit (but unpunished) twitch of his hip on the base paths in the 1978 Series, which deflected a throw from one Dodger fielder to another. 
 Gibson and Jackson weren't just great players. They were clutch players. They were forerunners of Derek Jeter, the Yankee captain, who, thanks to a World Series home run he hit just after 12 o'clock on Halloween Night eight years ago, is sometimes called Mr. November. ''What he's done better than the next guy is produce in the clutch,'' Jackson says of Jeter in ''Sixty Feet, Six Inches,'' a 273-page conversation between Jackson and Gibson. ''That's mental makeup.'' 
 The question of clutchness may be the biggest flash point in baseball's current ideological war. To traditionalists, clutchness is a self-evident concept that is at the game's core. Just look at Jeter compared with Alex Rodriguez, a notorious choker in previous playoffs. Or look at the players great and less great -- not just Christy Mathewson, Willie Mays and Josh Beckett, but also Johnny Podres, Gene Tenace and Billy Hatcher -- who did their best when it counted the most. Their success wasn't just about talent. It was about mental makeup. 
 However, to the game's analytically minded fans, writers and front-office executives -- like the ones described in Michael Lewis's ''Moneyball'' -- clutchness is overrated. More often than not, it's a story created after the fact. It is only rarely a character trait that tells us what's likely to happen in the future. Mays made his spectacular, game-saving catch in the 1954 Series. But he was also a mediocre hitter in his Series appearances. Mays's godson, Barry Bonds, was Rodriguez's predecessor as the symbol of postseason failure (yes, even into the years when he was apparently using steroids). Then, in 2002, he had one of the greatest Series a hitter has ever had. Even Gibson and Jackson found their clutch powers wanting in some of their biggest moments. Jackson struck out against a young Bob Welch to end a game in the 1978 Series. In 106 subsequent postseason at-bats, he hit just .236.
 ''Sixty Feet, Six Inches'' is a ringing defense of the traditional view of baseball, the one that knows clutch when it sees it. The book is an edited transcript of a series of conversations between Gibson and Jackson, overseen by Lonnie Wheeler, the collaborator on Gibson's autobiography, ''Stranger to the Game.'' This book's reason for being, Wheeler writes in the introduction, is the ''sacred place in October where only the two of them have been.'' As such, ''there's a language . . . that only they can speak.'' 
 At its best, the book is an oral history, and not just of baseball. Gibson and Jackson were part of the generation of black players, between Jackie Robinson and Jeter, who were accepted without being fully so. Gibson tells the story of an off-season barnstorming tour through the Southwest, in which the all-black Willie Mays All-Stars played the all-white Harmon Killebrew All-Stars. To find something to eat after games, the Mays All-Stars would sometimes send one of their players into a restaurant dressed as a chauffeur, and he would emerge with food for the team. ''Or Sam Jones, who was light-skinned,'' Gibson says, referring to a journeyman pitcher, ''would pull a stocking cap down over his head, pass as white and pretend he was a deaf-mute.'' 
 Gibson comes off as the more introspective of the two. He says he would not have been tempted by steroids when he was at his peak, but he doesn't know what he would have done by 1974 or 1975, ''when my knees were shot and my legs were gone.'' Jackson, meanwhile, is the upbeat, ego-driven celebrity New York remembers. ''You can't drink, smoke and chase women,'' he says, recounting a lesson some older players once gave him. ''You can do one and get by. Two will shorten your career. Three will end it.'' 
 Despite its engaging moments, though, ''Sixty Feet, Six Inches'' is mostly unsatisfying, because Gibson and Jackson play their roles as the grizzled veterans too predictably. ''I learned that if you stay within the limits of your ability and play the game the way it should be played, good things will happen,'' Jackson says in the opening chapter. The men go on to lament aspects of today's game, like batters who take too many pitches, managers who baby their pitchers and anybody who puts too much faith in scouting reports. Gibson and Jackson fail, unfortunately, to teach us much about the game they clearly know so well.
 The book often feels like a counterreformation project from 2003, just after Michael Lewis told the story of baseball's rising generation of analysts. At the time, traditionalists were falling over themselves to undercut the new guys. But that moment should have passed. The Red Sox have won two World Series, thanks partly to their focus on analysis, and the Tampa Bay Rays -- with an owner who once worked for Goldman Sachs -- won the American League pennant last season despite a meager payroll. The new guys aren't going away.
 Yet they don't have all the answers, either. The Red Sox have had far less success rehabilitating veterans than the more traditional Cardinals have. The Arizona Diamondbacks, the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers -- as well as the A's, the subject of ''Moneyball'' -- are all run by the statistically inclined, with limited recent success to show for it. 
 The baseball memoir we're still waiting for is the one that treats the recent information revolution not as a sign of cultural decay but as something worthy of thoughtful challenge. Of course a scouting report can't tell a player how to hit the ball. But given all the data now available and given the infinitesimal window during which players make decisions, what kind of scouting report is most useful? How could the new fielding metrics be improved? Why did so many of yesterday's celebrated workhorse pitchers break down, while others did not? And what kind of clutch, or unclutch, hitters are really likely to remain so for the rest of their careers? 
 The reason many of us count October as one of our favorite times of year is that we don't know what playoff baseball will bring. We don't know whether a Bob Gibson will once again win Game 7 -- or whether, as in 1968, he will lose it. We don't know who the next redeemed choker will be. If the outcome were clear, baseball would be like so manyother forms of entertainment, and, quite frankly, it wouldn't be all that interesting.

HEADLINE: The Fifth Down: For Vikings, Spirits of Super Bowl Past And Hopes of One in the Near Future

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
Mike Tanier of FootballOutsiders.com is a co-author of ''Football Outsiders Almanac 2009'' and a contributor to The Fifth Down blog.

 BODY:
At 6-0, this may be the greatest Minnesota Vikings team ever assembled, better than the 1998 flash in the pan that finished 15-1, better than the 1970s conference powerhouse that this team so closely resembles. The 1973-75 Vikings were led by an old daredevil quarterback (then Fran Tarkenton, now Brett Favre), a stalwart defensive line (the Purple People Eaters then, the law firm of Allen, Williams & Williams now), and a two-headed running game (Chuck Foreman and Ed Marinaro then, Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor running circles round them now). In 1974, the Vikings went 10-4, forced 33 turnovers and netted 4,611 yards of total offense, which is more than three miles when you adjust for inflation. They beat the Cardinals and the Rams en route to Super Bowl IX, which they lost to the Steelers. 
 It's easy to overlook host Pittsburgh (4-2) as it goes about its business. The Colts and the Broncos have better records, but the Steelers are experienced marathoners more likely to peak in January than October. The Steelers are pressuring quarterbacks again -- 17 sacks after a slow start -- and although they are still having some problems with turnovers and special-teams mistakes, their offense is good enough to overcome the miscues. Ben Roethlisberger has no reason to envy Favre in their first-ever meeting. Favre has a higher passer rating right now, but Roethlisberger has twice as many Super Bowl rings.
 More than a rematch of Super Bowl IX, this could be a preview of Super Bowl XLIV. 
 1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 4
 Saints (5-0) at Dolphins (2-3)
 The 1999 Rams outscored opponents, 193-60, in their first five games, making them the Greatest Show on Turf. The 2007 Patriots outscored opponents, 182-65, in their first five games, making them the most hated team on the planet. The New Orleans Saints have outscored opponents this season, 192-93. Whether that makes them the Bourbon Street Bombers, the Greatest Show on the Bayou or something else hasn't been determined, but the Saints have a multidimensional offense (10 offensive players have scored touchdowns) worthy of comparison to the best ever. 
 Defending Miami is like trying to punish someone who likes confined spaces and gruel. Hold the Dolphins to 4 yards per play, and they thank you. Force them to drive seven minutes for every score, and they will happily aerate the field as they go. The assistant David Lee takes credit for the Wildcat, but Ivan Denisovich was also an influence.
 The Dolphins can hold the Saints under 30 points, but only because they will hold the ball for more than 40 minutes. The Dolphins have a poor pass defense, so when the Saints want to score -- and when the good men of the 104th aren't sitting on the ball -- they will score. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Saints by 6 1/2
 Falcons (4-1) at Cowboys (3-2)
 Jerry Jones was forced to import superstars to fill the new Cowboys Stadium. U2 played the palace during the bye week, and Tiger Woods watched the show from the owner's box. ''He's the greatest athlete of all time, in my opinion,'' said the backup quarterback Stephen McGee, who shares a locker room with roustabouts like DeMarcus Ware and Felix Jones. For the crime of elevating a golfer above football players, McGee will have to write all the names on the Cowboys Ring of Honor 100 times.
 Dallas won't have Tiger or Bono in attendance Sunday, but the Cowboys are getting some of their best athletes back. Felix Jones and Roy Williams practiced last week, so Jason Witten and Miles Austin won't buckle while carrying the offense themselves. 
 4:15 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 4
 Eagles (3-2) at Redskins (2-4)
 Stripped of his play-calling duties, Jim Zorn is now like Puyi in ''The Last Emperor.'' He can order around the eunuchs and canoodle with Ar Mo, but he has little decision-making power. The offensive consultant Sherman Lewis becomes the eighth person to call plays for Jason Campbell in college and the N.F.L., and most of those coaches had widely differing offenses. 
 Andy Reid, meanwhile, stripped himself of run-calling duties on Sunday: the Eagles rushed just 12 times in an embarrassing loss to the Raiders. Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Eagles by 7
 Cardinals (3-2) at Giants (5-1)
 The Giants could have fielded nine men on defense and still beat Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Oakland, so it's no surprise that the Saints found weaknesses that previous opponents couldn't exploit. Kevin Dockery and C. C. Brown are mediocre pass defenders, and if you watch the Saints highlights from Sunday (allow two hours minimum), you'll see Drew Brees picking on those two defenders over and over again. 
 The Arizona Cardinals, like the Saints, can create some matchup problems in the secondary, but they lack the running game and offensive line that make the Saints nearly impossible to defend. The hot-and-cold Cardinals live and die with their receivers, and they haven't beaten a team with a winning record. They may get a Larry Fitzgerald-versus-Dockery touchdown, but they'll pay for it with a handful of sacks. 
 8:20 p.m. Line: Giants by 7
 Patriots (4-2) at Buccaneers (0-6)
 Here's a game to play while watching the telecast from London. Award yourself 2 points for each awkward Boston Tea Party or Boston Massacre reference. Award a point whenever an American broadcaster says ''Jolly Good'' or ''Merry Olde.'' Shots of Big Ben (the clock tower, not the Steelers quarterback), Buckingham Palace or Stratford-Upon-Avon are also worth a point. Award the following points for celebrities in attendance: royalty (on or in line to the throne), 5 points; surviving Beatle, 3 points; David Beckham, 3 points; Posh Spice, no points. Award a half-point for every Tom Brady or Randy Moss jersey in the crowd and 10 points if you see a spectator wearing the jersey of a current Tampa Bay player. If you score 17 points or more, you've just outscored the Buccaneers. Tally ho. 
 1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 14 1/2
 49ers (3-2) at Texans (3-3)
 Michael Crabtree, San Francisco's top draft pick and conscientious objector, will make his debut. Crabtree got up to speed during the bye week by catching passes from the backup quarterback Alex Smith, who needed an activity to wile away the hours between clipboard waxings. If Crabtree, Smith and tight end Vernon Davis merged into one person, they'd create the ultimate first-round disappointment: a contact-averse softie with tiny hands who does not report to camp and associates with M. C. Hammer. Crabtree may start against Houston. After a week with Smith, he will be eager to catch some passes from a real N.F.L. quarterback, or at least Shaun Hill.
 1 p.m. Line: Texans by 3
 Chargers (2-3) at Chiefs (1-5)
 The Chargers are 2-3 for the third straight year, prompting the usual whispers about Coach Norv Turner. ''Players are quietly questioning Turner's grip on the collective psyche, the discipline instilled and the ability to motivate,'' Kevin Acee wrote in The San Diego Union Tribune, probably for the third time in his career. Turner has 15 years of experience at wriggling out of this net: the Chargers will rally, starting with this two-game stretch against the Chiefs and the Raiders, and finish just above .500. That may cost Turner his job, but he'll resurface as the Buccaneers' offensive coordinator in 2010, lead them from 31st to 23rd in the league in offense, and parlay that success into the Seahawks' coaching job when Jim Mora is fired in 2011. 1 p.m. Line: Chargers by 4 1/2
 Bills (2-4) at Panthers (2-3)
 Teachers have a saying: ''If it doesn't work by Columbus Day, it isn't going to work.'' Football coaches follow the same philosophy. John Fox figured out that Jake Delhomme cannot throw an interception while handing off, so he called 32 runs in a victory over the Redskins, then 47 runs -- 15 on the final drive -- in last week's win against the Buccaneers. At this rate, Carolina will soon be able to replace Delhomme with a vending machine. The Bills scrapped their no-huddle offense, taking away one of the last vestiges of their identity; the next step is to use acid to burn off their fingerprints. Buffalo's offense was no better after huddling, but the extra 15 seconds between plays helps delay the inevitable. The Panthers must win here before a tough trip to Arizona and New Orleans.4:05 p.m. Line: Panthers by 9
 Colts (5-0) at Rams (0-6)
 Bob Sanders, the second-most-important player on the Indianapolis Colts, is back after missing a month with a knee injury. The free-agent kicker Matt Stover, who goes back so far that he was Bernie Kosar's teammate on Bill Belichick's Browns, gives the Colts the peace of mind that they lacked while Adam Vinatieri battled knee and hip injuries. Forcing St. Louis to play the rested, healthy, post-bye Colts is like asking the wounded gazelle to wait in a narrow canyon until the cheetah catches its breath. 
 1 p.m. Line: Colts by 13
 Jets (3-3) at Raiders (2-4)
 So much for the easy part of the schedule. The Dolphins ran right through the Jets, and the California native Mark Sanchez reacted to a windy autumn day as if he expected to see emperor penguins huddling on the sidelines. Sanchez needs healthy receivers more than he needs West Coast weather. Jerricho Cotchery and Brad Smith will be out for one more week, so there will be more Ben Hartsock and Wayne Hunter sightings. Oakland jumped on a banged-up opponent last week, but Rex Ryan and Brian Schottenheimer won't repeat the Eagles' mistakes. Thomas Jones and Leon Washington will control the clock, and Ryan's defense will force the Raiders' offense to look like ... the Raiders' offense.
 4:05 p.m. Line: Jets by 6
 Packers (3-2) at Browns (1-5)
 Josh Cribbs led the Browns in rushing last week. He also threw two passes (one was intercepted), scored one touchdown, set up the other by forcing the Steelers to squib kick in the second half, and returned a punt 26 yards. He's the only player on the team with two touchdowns, and his hard work on special teams led directly to Cleveland's only win when he helped pin the Bills inside the 5 on several punts. Cribbs's salary is roughly an eighth of what Brady Quinn makes to stand on the sideline looking like the singer for a My Chemical Romance cover band, but the Browns refuse to renegotiate Cribbs's contract or trade him to a new team. Think about that the next time you feel underappreciated by your boss. 1 p.m. Line: Packers by 7
 Bears (3-2) at Bengals (4-2)
 The Bears are a .500 team right now, even if they're one game over. They have passed for 1,145 yards and allowed 1,089, and they've gained 449 rushing yards (3.8 yards per carry) while allowing 442 (3.7). Chicago holds a 10-second edge in time of possession and has allowed 29 of 72 third-down conversions while making 26 of 67. A blowout win over the Lions skewed the Bears' record; all of their other games were close contests decided by a few plays. The Bengals began their course correction with last week's loss to the Texans, and they will take another step back this week. This is an important game for Cincinnati running back Cedric Benson, who wants revenge against the team that cut him just because he was ineffective, unreliable and mired in controversy.
 4:15 p.m. Line: Bengals by 1 1/2

HEADLINE: Merkel Picks Team To Govern In Germany

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Saturday announced a center-right government with her new coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, saying it would ''bravely solve the problems that are lying ahead of us.'' 
 After a final marathon round of talks that ended four weeks of negotiations here, Mrs. Merkel, who was re-elected as chancellor a month ago, made a surprise appointment by choosing Wolfgang Schauble as finance minister. 
 It is one of the most important positions in Germany, requiring close coordination with the chancellor, as well as European and American financial authorities.
 Mr. Schauble, who has used a wheelchair since 1990 when a man who was later declared mentally ill tried to assassinate him, was the interior minister the past four years in Mrs. Merkel's first term. 
 Mrs. Merkel will visit the United States in early November, soon after she is sworn in for a second time as the leader of Europe's largest economy. Government officials said economic and security policy would dominate the agenda during her visit.
 Mrs. Merkel faces big challenges in her second term in both domestic and foreign policy.
 On the domestic front, Mrs. Merkel, who is also the leader of her party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, pledged Saturday to cut taxes, starting in January. 
 ''The burden on families has to be lessened; the burden on companies and inheritance tax has to be reformed,'' she said during a news conference here after she had clinched an accord with the Free Democrats. 
 The proposal calls for taxes to be cut by 24 billion euros, or about $36.1 billion, even though Germany's budget deficit is projected to increase. The tax cuts would come at a time when Germany's finances are in poor shape. According to the Finance Ministry, net new borrowing is expected to soar next year to $129 billion from a record $71 billion this year. 
 Separately, Mrs. Merkel is also expected to embark on an ambitious plan to reform health care in two years' time, the details of which are not yet known.
 Foreign and defense policy should prove to be difficult, too.
 The new foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, who is the leader of the Free Democrats, wants to rid Germany of the remaining American nuclear weapons stationed here, signaling a big shift in relations with NATO and the United States because the issue until now has been largely taboo. 
 But the biggest foreign policy challenge for Mrs. Merkel is expected to be Afghanistan. 
 The new defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, who is a member of the Christian Social Union, the sister party of Mrs. Merkel's party, will undoubtedly be under pressure from the United States to send more German troops to Afghanistan. Germany has more than 4,000 troops there.

HEADLINE: To Promote Creativity, Let's Start in the Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The New Untouchables'' (column, Oct. 21):
 Thomas L. Friedman says we need to fix our schools to teach ''entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity'' so students can emulate the ''new untouchables'' in our work force today. As a public high school math teacher in New York City for 11 years, I couldn't agree more. Unfortunately, the trend today is for more test-driven data collection and the use of test-prep textbooks in the classroom. 
 Curriculum should be project-based and created by the teachers themselves. Students could be graded by meeting project deadlines, finding their mistakes and working with others to complete complex goals. Students could write their own textbooks and tests. Now that's innovative!
 There's nothing entrepreneurial about assigning Problems 1 through 20 in a textbook. But most teachers don't have the permission or motivation to do anything else but prepare for an exam.
 Forget exams! Give teachers the freedom and incentive to be entrepreneurial, innovative and creative in their jobs. Show students by example what a good education is all about.
 Seth Blum New York, Oct. 21, 2009
 To the Editor:
 How Thomas L. Friedman concludes his column is correct: ''So our schools have a doubly hard task now -- not just improving reading, writing and arithmetic but entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity.'' 
 Creativity goes hand in hand with innovation in building a strong work force for the 21st century, and developing arts literacy among our children is a key component.
 An arts education rich in creativity develops the precise skill set students need to thrive in a global economy driven by knowledge and ideas.
 Business leaders and school administrators agree. A 2008 study, ''Ready to Innovate,'' issued by the Conference Board with Americans for the Arts as a partner, touts the importance of arts education in building the 21st-century work force. The report revealed that 99 percent of the surveyed school superintendents and 97 percent of the surveyed employers believe that arts training is crucial to developing creativity.
 Innovation is the key to our continued economic recovery and global competitiveness.

HEADLINE: State of Distress

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes on national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
I.
 These days, as he pleads with New Jersey voters for a second term as governor, even moments of satisfaction in Jon S. Corzine's world seem to extract their small humiliations. In early September, for instance, on the day that President Obama delivered his heralded (and controversial) televised pep talk to public-school students, Corzine traveled to Camden, one of the country's poorest cities, his government-issue black S.U.V. weaving through a postapocalyptic landscape of overgrown fields and shuttered row houses. The neighborhood was celebrating the opening of the sparkling new H. B. Wilson Elementary School, one of 45 new schools that Corzine's administration has constructed and opened, despite the state's acute economic troubles, and Corzine, who displays an obvious passion for all things educational, had arrived to bask in the achievement and to join a class of fourth graders in watching President Obama's speech. The students, dressed in their crisp yellow uniforms, seemed buoyant as they filed in, eyeing a small mountain of brand-new backpacks donated by the local bar association. Not much that's new and shiny turns up in Camden, whose broken city government has been taken over by the state and whose choicest piece of waterfront property is blighted by a state prison. 
 Surrounded by city officials and a clutch of TV cameras in the classroom, Corzine settled into a front-row desk amid the excited children. It soon became apparent, however, that the school's plan to stream the president's speech on its new state-of-the-art broadband connection wasn't going to work. The classroom fell into an embarrassed silence as the president's voice cut in and out unintelligibly, a sweaty staff member working desperately to fix the problem. A more able and extroverted politician might have taken control of the situation, rising to deliver his own motivational talk. But Corzine isn't that politician, and so instead he smiled wanly and waited, striking up an awkward conversation with Xavier Diaz, the fourth grader sitting next to him. ''This always happened in our old class,'' Xavier explained to the governor. You could almost see Corzine's heart sink in his chest.
 At last, someone switched on a radio for the last few minutes of the speech, but the kids could barely hear it, and by then they had grown dispirited and bored, resting chins in hands or staring dejectedly out the window. When the president finished speaking, Corzine twisted in his chair to address the children. 
 ''What do you think?'' he asked. ''Inspirational, no?'' The students eyed him quizzically.
 ''How old are you?'' the boy sitting behind him asked.
 ''How old am I?'' Corzine repeated, blinking. ''That's the hardest question I've had all day!'' 
 ''He's 62,'' Xavier piped up helpfully.
 Corzine pressed ahead. ''The most important thing that happens in any school is what you guys get out of it, what you learn,'' he told the kids before rising from his chair with a look of relief. ''We love you, and we want you to do well. God bless you.''
 A lot of New Jerseyans would like to say more or less the same thing to Corzine on Nov. 3: We wish you well. God bless. Even in the best of times, New Jersey's highly taxed voters are a chronically cantankerous lot, and no one's likely to confuse these with the best of times. The state's three major industries -- pharmaceuticals, shipping and financial services -- have been hammered by the recession. Unemployment has soared to nearly 10 percent (about even with the struggling nation as a whole, but significantly higher than in surrounding states) at the very same moment that the state's infamous corruption has reached a level of near parody, with Sephardic rabbis accused of illegally selling body parts and using the money to bribe local politicians. Property taxes are among the highest in the nation, and the state could be facing an $8 billion shortfall in its next fiscal year, or more than a quarter of its total budget. If California collapsed of its own weight and drifted off into the Pacific, New Jersey would instantly become the most dysfunctional state in the country.
 Corzine, the onetime Wall Street titan who spent more than $100 million of his own fortune getting himself elected first to the Senate, in 2000, and then, in 2005, to the governor's office, is the only governor in the nation unlucky enough to have to seek re-election during this season of national unease. (In Virginia, voters are choosing between two nonincumbent candidates.) Like governors of both parties around the country, Corzine, a Democrat, has seen his standing with the voters take a battering in direct proportion to his state's economy. More than 60 percent of voters say they're dissatisfied with the state's direction, and a majority say Corzine is bad at his job. (Among the state's independent voters, by far its largest bloc, Corzine fares even worse, with about a third giving him passing marks.) Corzine has been forced to slash billions from his state's budget, while at the same time scraping together and defending emergency relief for families verging on hunger and homelessness. As if this didn't make for enough drama, the governor also managed to very nearly get himself killed in a car crash (the prickly Corzine refused to wear a seat belt), and he has gone to court to protect the secrecy of his e-mail messages to an ex-girlfriend who also happened to lead one of New Jersey's major unions. 
 Everywhere he goes now as he campaigns around the state, Corzine talks about ''the worst recession since the Great Depression,'' a phrase intended to convey to voters that what they are going through, he and they together, is as much beyond his control as the coming of the tides along Asbury Park. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent, the former United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie, has run the classic ''at least I'm not that guy'' campaign, offering little by way of workable solutions but framing the race, instead, as a straight up-or-down vote on the governor's performance. For months, it seemed as if that would be enough, but recent polls show that Corzine has managed to erode what once seemed an insurmountable deficit, leaving the outcome very much in doubt. To make matters more unpredictable, a lapsed Republican running as an independent, Christopher J. Daggett, who once ran the state's environmental protection department, outshone both of his better-known opponents in the first debate. As the election approaches, Daggett is going after Christie, Christie is attacking both Corzine and Daggett, and Corzine is trying to persuade the state's ornery voters that the human pinata they know is better than one they don't.
 The larger impact of all this is hard to determine, which is why observers of the national political scene -- starting with those in the White House -- have taken an avid interest in New Jersey, trying to figure out exactly what's going on and what, if anything, it might portend for the coming midterm Congressional elections, not to mention the 37 other governors who will face the voters next year. Theories abound as to which factor is to blame for the tenuousness of Corzine's hold on power in a state that has tilted so strongly Democratic in the last few elections. Some, including Corzine himself, say he is simply a victim of the legacy of the Bush years: financial collapse and mismanagement, yawning inequality and unemployment. Others blame Corzine's arrogance and his obstinate demeanor, or they point to the Wall Street credentials that helped Corzine sweep into office four years ago but that now make him a convenient target of populist revolt. Republicans hope Corzine's struggles signify the leading edge of a reaction against Obama and pro-government liberals, though if Corzine prevails, Democrats will inevitably portray his victory as a validation of the president's continuing popularity. For those whose business is the forecasting of the next political moment, the operative question isn't so much whether Corzine will ultimately win or lose the election, but what, exactly, his winning or losing might mean.
 II.
 NEW JERSEY COULD raise up its own army and invade Pennsylvania, and all the state's voters would want to talk about, still, would be their property taxes. No other issue so dominates the political landscape of a state. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, 41 percent of voters said taxes were the main issue in this year's gubernatorial contest, compared with 17 percent who cited economic factors and just 4 percent who registered concern about the state's rampant corruption. 
 The outrage has given rise to a predictable ritual: every candidate for governor solemnly vows to tame the property-tax beast, and every governor leaves office having knelt before its awesome power. In 1977, the state enacted its first income tax, every penny of which was, by law, to be used to offset local taxes. As it happened, though, the state spent the vast majority of that money on the kind of grants to local communities -- primarily school aid -- that it probably would have paid for in any event, and the effect on property taxes was negligible. New Jersey now spends more than half its $30 billion budget on various things that fall under the rubric of ''property-tax relief,'' including $1.6 billion in direct rebate checks to homeowners, and yet property taxes grow higher by the year -- while voters grow ever more restive.
 The question of why property taxes keep rising could keep a symposium of budget experts arguing for a week, but at its core, the property-tax problem hints at a deeper, structural flaw in the state, a defect that's more cultural than it is fiscal. Basically, New Jersey is sliced into so many local fiefs -- 21 counties, 566 municipalities, more than 600 school districts -- that it's just about falling apart. Some municipalities are merely dots on the map, maybe a mile wide, surrounded on all sides by a larger township. Some school districts are so small that they actually have no schools. (They pay larger townships to teach their kids.) And yet most little hamlets retain their own officeholders and paramedic squads, just as each tiny school district has its own administrator and school board. It would be far cheaper for everyone, of course, if these small jurisdictions merged into larger ones or agreed to pool their services, but no politician or fire chief actually wants to give up his part-time job, and the taxpayers in these districts -- despite moaning endlessly about their taxes -- routinely reject any suggestion that they should give up their autonomy. 
 This duplication of every imaginable service means that New Jersey residents are paying so many different entities, all in a single property-tax bill, that they can't keep them all straight. (It also, no doubt, adds to the state's legacy of corruption, since a lot of smaller entities are run by local machines and are subject to little if any public scrutiny.) And because each little jurisdiction cuts its own deal on contracts for teachers and cops, wealthier towns -- New Jersey has some of the wealthiest in the nation -- tend to drive up the cost of municipal contracts for everyone else, creating a vacuum that is constantly sucking local tax rates higher. 
 That vacuum, in turn, puts political pressure on the governor and the Legislature to do two irreconcilable things: cut state taxes and increase the amount of money they send down to the local level. Think about it this way: if voters are constantly screaming about out-of-control property-tax burdens in their towns, then the only sensible political thing for a governor to do is to save the day by cutting state income taxes and issuing bigger rebate checks, right? Now consider that the state also needs ever-growing sums of cash to finance the generous benefits packages it guarantees to state employees, and you can see why New Jersey's governors, even more so than strapped governors in many other states, routinely find themselves retreating to a kind of fiscal Honalee, a make-believe world in which the state can magically raise less revenue and spend ever more of it. Recent governors have made it their mission to come up with creative, complex and thoroughly ill advised ways to balance the budget, as they are required to do by law -- or at least to make the budget look balanced, if you look at it from a distance, and maybe squint.
 In 1993, Christine Todd Whitman, a political neophyte, rode into Trenton at the vanguard of a national wave of anti-tax conservatives and trimmed income taxes by almost a third. To make up for lost revenue, she came up with a scheme to issue $2.8 billion in bonds -- the kind of borrowing normally used to build schools or prisons -- and deposit the money into the state's employee pension fund. The idea was that the money would grow along with the stock market, where pension funds are invested, thus freeing the state from having to make its annual contributions to keep the retirement plan solvent. Of course, the stock market ultimately cooled, the fund didn't grow as Whitman had projected and the state's pension system ran into deficit.
 When Whitman left in 2001 to join the Bush administration, she was replaced by Donald DiFrancesco, a Republican who as State Senate president was next in the line of succession and who, in the time-honored tradition of politicians everywhere, decided that the best way to get elected to the seat was to give a lot of stuff away. He rewarded state workers by increasing the state's pension obligations by 9 percent, and he doled out another $400 million in property-tax relief to the voters -- all while counting on nearly $3 billion in income-tax revenues that never materialized. The next governor, the Democrat James McGreevey, came up with his own novel approach to avoiding new taxes: he securitized the state's payment from the nationwide tobacco settlement and twice used the money from the sale of those securities to ostensibly balance the budget. When that money ran out, he started simply borrowing money, issuing bonds to keep the government operating, a gimmick so egregious that the state's Supreme Court later declared it unconstitutional.
 This is the mess Jon Corzine inherited after he won office, in 2005, as a reformer, the latest in a line of candidates who vowed to beat back property taxes and straighten out the state's finances. Although he had been a United States senator for five years at that point, Corzine was still thought of mainly as the former C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, a man who didn't need money from unions or other interest groups and who knew how to square a balance sheet in the time it took to eat lunch. He presented himself to the voters as New Jersey's answer to Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor across the Hudson River who was busy making government run like a business. By the time Corzine arrived in Trenton, the state had accumulated north of $100 billion in debt and unfinanced pensions and health care benefits for state employees and teachers. By any common understanding of the word, New Jersey was bankrupt, and things were about to get worse.
 III.
 DESPITE HIS FORMER life on Wall Street, where by his own admission he didn't quite fit in, Corzine was known to be one of the most traditionally liberal members of the Senate. As Corzine himself told me at one point, he would have preferred to govern at a time when he could have spent billions of dollars securing preschool for every child in the state, job training for every released prisoner, a universal health care system and so on. But whatever else people want to say about Jon Corzine -- and if you listen long enough, you'll hear just about everything -- it's hard to argue that he didn't make some unusually hard and courageous choices aimed at getting the state's budget back to something resembling reality. With a stubbornness that enraged legislators in his own party, Corzine shut down New Jersey's government in a showdown over the sales tax, which he ultimately succeeded in raising by a penny, and hiked toll rates on the state's iconic highways. He also raised taxes on households making more than $400,000. Taking on a powerful Democratic constituency, he readjusted New Jersey's pension formula to lower the state's funding obligations and forced workers, for the first time, to contribute toward their own lifetime health care benefits. Corzine put more than $3 billion into the pension fund -- more, he likes to point out, than the previous four governors combined. 
 Then came the 2007 car crash that kept him submerged in an induced coma for 11 days, followed the next year by the crash on Wall Street, which had much the same effect on the state's economy. Corzine set about passing the first of two stimulus bills, handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to businesses at the very same moment that revenue from income and sales taxes plummeted. Like other states, but more so, New Jersey now faced excruciating choices on how to balance its budget, and this time the implications went well beyond state employees' contracts and an extra penny for a Snickers bar. Corzine felt compelled to slash aid to local municipalities and to revoke property-tax rebates for families making more than $75,000 -- decisions that lighted a fuse on the most combustible issue in New Jersey politics. He did impose a 4 percent cap on any property-tax increases statewide, a strategy intended to force some jurisdictions to merge their services, but property-tax bills have continued to creep skyward. 
 Meanwhile, the governor's budget cut back on money for a planned expansion of preschool programs, for enhanced 911 systems and grants in the sciences and the arts, for state colleges and programs for the disabled -- services a good Democrat would abandon only in his nightmares. For some liberal interest groups, the kind that should be expected to line up quickly behind a Democratic incumbent, this round of cuts marked the final betrayal. A lot of union members are still fuming over the changes in state contracts. Some black activists, led by the local N.A.A.C.P., deeply resent another of Corzine's signature achievements -- the changing of the state's school financing formula, which they say will divert money from urban districts to suburban schools. 
 Leading environmentalists are incensed at Corzine's new policy aimed at speeding redevelopment of the state's roughly 20,000 contaminated sites; Corzine is letting land developers conduct their own environmental-impact studies, while cutting back the number of inspectors on the state payroll in order to save money. The Sierra Club went as far as to endorse Daggett, the independent -- the first time the organization has ever endorsed a non-Democrat for governor of New Jersey. ''Corzine's one of those people who talks a good game,'' Jeff Tittel, the Sierra Club's state director, told me, ''but when you look at his actions, especially on the environment, there's not a lot of difference between him and a conservative Republican.'' 
 Interest groups aside, however, Corzine's budget-balancing policies wouldn't be so damaging to his electoral prospects if New Jerseyans felt as if their own prospects were rebounding at the same time. Sometimes referred to as the ''medicine chest to the world'' because of its pharmaceutical plants, the whole state of New Jersey now feels as if it could use a giant Xanax. On the boardwalk at Point Pleasant Beach, I talked with a couple who were furious over the increased tuition for their four children in state colleges. The part-time mayor of tiny Woodbury Heights (population 3,300) told me he'd been laid off from his other job as a union pipe fitter at the local refinery. A year ago, he said, the refinery employed 50 pipe fitters; now it's down to 6. Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic majority leader in the State Senate, told me he'd been forced to vote to cut job programs for disabled adults, even though his own daughter has Down syndrome. ''I had to vote for it, and it stunk,'' he said. 
 Corzine isn't the only statewide politician whose public esteem has taken a hit; the state's two Democratic senators, Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, garner approval ratings well below 50 percent. But Corzine is the guy who seems to embody, for a lot of voters, a weariness with government generally, a sense that they're constantly being squeezed for more. ''People want lower taxes, the best schools, the best roads,'' Sweeney told me, shaking his head, ''and they want everything for free.'' 
 IV.
 ON LABOR DAY, all three gubernatorial candidates commenced the final stage of the election season by taking part in the state's largest parade, in South Plainfield, a union-heavy suburb just west of the old manufacturing cities of Elizabeth, Rahway and Perth Amboy. Before the parade, in the Police Athletic League parking lot that served as a staging area, I was introduced to Loretta Weinberg, who is Corzine's running mate for the newly created post of lieutenant governor. Weinberg, a 74-year-old state senator chosen mostly for her credentials as a reformer, told me she was enjoying the rigorous campaign schedule. But she had learned, she said, that when Corzine called her at the end of the day to check in on events, it was best not to say she had been having fun. ''He doesn't like that,'' she told me. Corzine considers campaigning to be serious work.
 It was a bright, warm morning, and Corzine, who had just stepped off a red-eye after attending his grandson's birthday party in San Francisco, wore a crisp white shirt with an open collar and pale gray slacks. Alongside him marched Patrick Diegnan Jr., a popular Democratic assemblyman from the district, who kept shouting, with hands cupped to his lips: ''Folks, meet the governor! Say hi to Jon Corzine, your governor!'' Apparently, people in New Jersey couldn't be expected to recognize their governor when he turned up on their front lawns.
 Corzine serpentined his way from one side of the street to the other, methodically, in a way that suggested he had recently been schooled in the lost art of parade campaigning. (While Corzine and Daggett walked the two-mile route, Christie, whose weight has been the subject of much whispering in the campaign, waved to the crowd from the back of a small truck, sort of like the pope.) Corzine's perfunctory handshakes and hugs lasted a second, with the barest of eye contact, before he turned away toward someone else. Rather than simply wave to those voters he couldn't reach, he would wiggle his hand at the wrist several times in short succession, a motion meant to convey that he was sending out a burst of personalized waves to everybody all at once. The sweat started as a streak on the small of his back, then spread to his face and his sides, so that halfway through the route his remaining hair was drenched and his shirt was plastered to his body. But still the relentless handshakes, the soggy half-hugs, the frantic, wiggling wrists. 
 Some voters greeted Corzine with something like genuine warmth. A few others heckled, like the guy at the reviewing stand who called out: ''Hey, where's our property-tax reform? Go back to your Wall Street crooks!'' (''Shhh, he's right there!'' an astonished woman said to the heckler, as if that weren't the whole point.) The majority of those lined up along the parade route, however, just sat in their lawn chairs and nodded neutrally, exchanging knowing glances as the governor passed. 
 Like a lot of people with famous names or towering fortunes who get into politics without ever having to cultivate the requisite grace and affability (Al Gore, the son of a senator, comes to mind, as does Corzine's fellow New Jerseyan, the basketball legend Bill Bradley), Corzine doesn't carry himself like a natural politician. If you met him and had no idea who he was, you might guess he was a cardiologist or an estate lawyer. Bearded and balding, with longish hair ringing his bald pate, Corzine seems, even at first glance, to be more deliberate than dynamic. His attempts at easy physical contact can feel forced and mistimed. (In a diner in South Jersey, I watched him, in a moment of shared laughter, rest his forehead on a man's arm, the voter looking momentarily stunned.) Corzine grew up on a farm in Illinois, and like most of the men who must have been his role models then, he doesn't have the instinct to share physical space or the intimate details of his inner life. He is comfortable discussing policy but can be abrupt, even antiseptic, in situations where small talk is in order.
 Perhaps this is why, nine years after Corzine first ran for state office, voters still seem to know so little about him. Corzine actually has, in the parlance of political consulting, a good story. He's a middle-class kid and ex-Marine who worked his way up through the world of high finance and never lost touch with his prairie populism. And yet the story he told during his first two campaigns, for reasons that seemed self-evident at the time, dwelled on his experience as a god of Wall Street, and now that that persona has taken on a certain level of toxicity, Corzine is finding that it's all anyone really knows of him. When voters in a poll conducted last month by Quinnipiac University were asked the traditional question about whether the governor ''cares about the needs and problems of people like you,'' 59 percent of independent voters said no. 
 At one point, when we were sharing lunch between campaign stops at one of those ubiquitous New Jersey diners, I suggested to Corzine that it might seem as if he didn't truly empathize with the state's worried voters. He leaned away from me in our circular booth, physically recoiling from the question. ''I . . . I . . . I don't think . . . ,'' he began, then paused. ''I think I analyze problems. But I don't think I'm. . . . '' Another pause. ''I don't know where you come up with that empathetic stuff. Maybe people say it. I don't know. It doesn't feel that way to me.'' He thought for a moment. On the stereo, Rick Springfield was loudly pining for Jessie's girl. 
 ''You know, being analytical about problems is also a necessary ingredient,'' Corzine said finally. ''Being a grown-up is, I think, something that needs to be done in government if we're actually going to address the long-term problems in society.''
 There's a lot of truth to this, of course, and just four years ago, in somewhat better times, it made for a pretty compelling argument. New Jersey has had more than its share of P. T. Barnum politics, colorful characters who grasped the anxiety of the voters and offered all kind of elixirs -- debt, tax cuts, endless giveaways. Corzine was supposed to bring a measure of sobriety to New Jersey's political circus. But when the bottom falls out, people want more than analysis; they also want to know that you understand and share their anguish in some way, that even if you have a few hundred million dollars in the bank, you still go home at night to your luxury condo in Hoboken and lie awake agonizing over the Hobson's choices you'll have to make the next day. It isn't in Corzine's nature to reveal such emotions, even if he feels them. And this is why the economy alone doesn't entirely explain Corzine's precarious situation or foreshadow, necessarily, the same thing for other incumbents running next year. As a governor, Corzine may be misunderstood, but as the comforting presence that voters are craving, he simply seems miscast. 
 V.
 ONE DAY LASTMONTH, during an hourlong conversation in his satellite office in Newark, I asked Corzine if he felt personally rejected by the same voters who had so convincingly elected him to the governorship. ''Sure,'' he answered quietly, then reconsidered. ''I don't know. 'Rejection' is too strong a word. It's an understanding that people don't like the conditions they're having to struggle with right now. And we're trying to do everything we can to change those terms and conditions.'' This is how Corzine talks, haltingly and in language that often makes it sound as if he's negotiating a merger. ''But we've been dealt a macroeconomic situation that wasn't created by New Jersey.''
 As he did several times in our talks, Corzine stressed that things were actually looking up in New Jersey, that the glass was half-full, as he saw it. He reeled off a litany of statistics that sounded pretty persuasive: better academic test scores than most states, rising income levels, a higher penetration of health insurance, more stability in housing prices than in most of the country. The state added 2,900 private-sector jobs in August, the second straight month of growth at a moment when most states were still losing jobs. Why doesn't anyone see all the progress? he wondered.
 Every flailing politician, of course, needs a culprit. If you blame the voters, you're finished. If you blame yourself, it's hard to get up in the morning, and anyway most people with the ego to run for office are constitutionally averse to blaming themselves for much of anything. And so a lot of politicians, Corzine included, find it easiest to ascribe their troubles to the news media, which Corzine accuses of eschewing any complex picture of what's going on in the state. And in the case of New Jersey, in fact, there is a reasonable case to be made that the economics of the news industry have adversely affected the political debate. A statehouse that used to be covered by dozens of reporters is now the province of only a handful of financially distressed daily papers. There is no major local TV news program in Newark or Trenton; most of the news that New Jerseyans consume is produced either in New York or Philadelphia, which means most voters watching TV hear more about Bloomberg or the statehouse in Harrisburg than they do about the internal workings of New Jersey government.
 ''My opponent's ads say 'failure, failure, failure,' because unemployment is up,'' Corzine noted. ''Well, wow. Our unemployment rate is up because unemployment is up in the nation and in the world. But that gets echoed in the media here. You never hear anything about the fact that in median income we're one of five states in the country that went up last year, or that we put 150,000 new people on health-insurance rolls last year. Because that wouldn't be consistent with editorial policy to talk about those things. So the public is bereft in its understanding of some of the good things.''
 And yet, even if this is partly so, it's also true that Corzine himself isn't very good at communicating his successes, which are tangible, if not overwhelming. He tends to reel off statistics, often in tortured syntax and with very little connective tissue. I found myself sympathizing with his plight. Corzine is like a captain whose ship, beset by a terrible storm, has listed badly and taken on water, and he can't seem to make his mutinous crew realize that, bad as the situation is, he has somehow managed to keep the miserable thing afloat. He can no longer conceal his own defensiveness. With voters, Corzine sometimes punctuates his answers with a single word -- seriously -- as if they otherwise might take him for a jokester. During our conversation in his office, I prefaced a question by acknowledging that Corzine had, indeed, gotten quite a bit done in his term. To my surprise, the governor leaned forward and cut me off. He seemed to think I was patronizing him. ''No, Matt, I don't know whether you believe this, but I think we have gotten a lot done!'' he said, clearly exasperated. ''That's the thing people don't get.'' 
 VI.
 NEW JERSEY REPUBLICANS with long memories, some of whom now advise Chris Christie, are haunted by a political obscurity known as the Bateman-Simon tax plan. The story goes like this: in 1977, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Raymond Bateman, had a big lead in the polls over the incumbent governor, the Democrat Brendan Byrne, who had just signed the income tax into law. Rather than simply rail against Byrne's apostasy, Bateman and his economic adviser, the former treasury secretary William Simon, came up with a detailed proposal to eliminate the income tax -- while also raising the sales tax to stave off any shortfall. The Bateman-Simon plan was immediately torn apart by Democrats and the news media (critics called it the BS plan for short), Bateman's double-digit lead evaporated almost overnight and Byrne won re-election. The lesson Republicans took away from that encounter is that campaigning against taxes is a winning tactic, as long as you don't pull a Ray Bateman and suddenly decide to tell people how you actually intend to pay for the things they want.
 This history probably explains why Christie has avoided offering details of a plan to bring down property taxes or reform the state's dire finances, instead running a campaign that is almost a caricature of the modern, tax-slashing conservative pitch. He says he would repeal all the sales taxes, toll hikes and surcharges imposed by Corzine and cut income taxes as well, while at the same time somehow offering more property-tax rebates -- a feat that would seem to defy the laws of economics, if not physics. Christie has also said he would decline any federal money that imposed restrictions on the state. To replace all of this revenue, Christie says he will rein in wasteful spending. Only about a fifth of New Jersey's budget, however, goes to pay for the actual bureaucracy of government; all the rest pays for sacrosanct programs like Medicaid and school aid. As his opponents never tire of pointing out, Christie could fire every single one of the 66,000 employees in state government, and still he wouldn't make up for the revenue he says he wants to eliminate.
 I was eager to press Christie for details as to how he was going to accomplish all this when I caught up with him earlier this month. But Christie was ready for me, and rather than allow himself to be pinned down with lots of facts and numbers, he pulled a bit of political jujitsu instead. ''New Jersey has had a string of politicians, Jon Corzine the latest, who made all types of specific promises that they knew they couldn't keep,'' Christie told me. ''New Jerseyans want to know what direction are you going to take the state in, what philosophy are you going to pursue. They're not looking for specific promises that can't be kept.'' Hai-yah! Christie was turning the traditional notion of political accountability on its head: not only was it not unprincipled to make a bunch of vague campaign promises that had almost no chance of becoming reality, but in fact it was also the only truly principled thing to do, because politicians never followed through on the details of their proposals, anyway. When he gets to Trenton, Christie assured me, ''We'll get in there and make it work.''
 Despite these evasions, Christie enjoyed a huge lead in the polls throughout the spring and summer and seemed like a lock to be the state's next governor. His zenith as challenger came in July, when federal marshals moved in and arrested 44 New Jerseyans -- including three mayors, two assemblymen and five rabbis -- on charges of offering, laundering and accepting cash bribes, including $97,000 stuffed into an Apple Jacks box. No one seriously suggested that Corzine himself had anything to do with the scandal (to Corzine, after all, $97,000 in an Apple Jacks box is what you call petty cash), but agents did raid the home of a member of his cabinet, and the entire affair seemed to suggest that a governor who came in promising reform had, instead, lost control of both his party and his agenda. The moment was made for a tough-talking prosecutor in the Rudolph Giuliani mold.
 But as the campaign went on, the local bribery scandal receded as an issue, and Christie's own credentials as a reformer took a pounding. First, it was reported that he had failed to disclose on tax returns income from a loan he made to a subordinate in his office. Then it surfaced that he once hit a motorcyclist while driving the wrong way down a one-way street -- and got off without a ticket. More recently, there was the video of an imperious Christie snapping at a breast-cancer survivor who confronted him on his health care stance, which would deregulate insurers in the state. Naturally, given his personal wealth, Corzine enjoys a huge financial advantage over his Republican challenger, and the governor's torrent of attack ads -- in what has been, even by New Jersey standards, an unusually venomous campaign on both sides -- has had its impact. In the most recent Quinnipiac poll, the number of voters who viewed Christie unfavorably had jumped 20 points since July, and voters were now evenly divided on whether Christie was someone they could trust. (That didn't mean they were particularly warming to the governor; as Christie's lead shrank, Corzine's approval ratings remained dismally low.)
 Then there's the improbable surge of Chris Daggett, a serious-seeming man who reminds you of the country-club Republicans who used to roam throughout the state like mastodons. Daggett's criticism of Corzine is that he hasn't gone far enough as a reformer. ''I'm willing to say he's done more than other governors and he's tinkered at the edges, but he hasn't done what's necessary,'' Daggett told me. Unlike Christie, Daggett does have a specific proposal for what ''necessary'' entails: Daggett would eliminate the inefficient practice of issuing property-tax rebates to homeowners, and he would expand the state's sales tax to a range of services that are now untaxed. Then he would use the combined revenue from both charges to create a $4 billion direct property-tax credit on state income-tax returns. What this means, practically speaking, is that New Jersey's voters could simply pay up to $2,500 less in property taxes each year. Given the recent political history, you might expect New Jersey to immediately reject such a proposal on the basis that it's far too simple and makes too much sense. But in fact, Daggett's support in recent polls rose to nearly 15 percent. Even if Daggett can't win the race, his rise is probably bad news for Christie, because he needs every anti-Corzine voter he can get.
 Washington Republicans have been hoping that a Christie win would portend a nationwide comeback next year. And yet, Corzine's the one who has been trying desperately to nationalize the campaign, hitching himself to the 44th president at every opportunity while handcuffing Christie to the 43rd. Whatever else is going on in the country, President Obama retains strong approval ratings in New Jersey, while the Republican brand remains badly damaged amid the detritus of the Bush years. One Corzine ad from earlier in the campaign ended with this not-so-subtle description of Christie: ''Bush's friend. Bush's policies. Bad for New Jersey.'' 
 For their part, Obama and his political aides, who have not been shy about inserting themselves into state and local races, seem to have decided, after some hesitation, that getting Corzine re-elected is a high priority. Early this summer, there was grumbling inside the White House that Corzine's political future was unsalvageable, much like that of New York's embattled governor, David Paterson, whom the White House rather clumsily and unsuccessfully tried to muscle aside. Obama's visit to New Jersey to campaign for Corzine at a rally last July was seen, at least internally, as the president merely doing his duty for a friend in trouble. Then in August, Obama's two top political aides -- his alter ego, David Axelrod, and his political director, Patrick Gaspard -- flew to New York for a blunt meeting with Corzine's strategists, the message being that if Corzine couldn't make a race of it, the White House wasn't going to be drawn in and embarrassed. Corzine's team laid out its political and financial strategy, arguing that there was still time to close the gap with Christie -- which, as it turned out, there was. 
 Not long after that meeting, Corzine hired Joel Benenson, Obama's main pollster and a native New Jerseyan, and since then the White House has dispatched Joe Biden and Valerie Jarrett, the president's trusted friend and aide, to shore up support in the state. And though Obama has kept his distance from Virginia, where the nation's only other gubernatorial contest is under way, he made plans to return to New Jersey to stand alongside Corzine at a rally. When I asked one White House aide why the president cared so much about New Jersey, the aide explained that it had more to do with perception than reality. I didn't meet anyone in the state who believed that Corzine's fate actually hinges on Obama's economic plan or health care or any of the other ideologically explosive debates going on 170 miles to the south; in New Jersey, the election is clearly about Corzine and his policies. But the worldview among Washington commentators is generally more egocentric than that, and if Corzine loses, it would no doubt touch off months of speculation on cable TV and in the papers about an anti-Obama reaction and its impact on the midterm elections in 2010. As far as the White House is concerned, the fact of a Corzine defeat would be regrettable, but the reverberating effect on the public debate could be truly problematic.
 VII.
 THERE IS ANOTHER, more fundamental way in which the fortunes of Obama and Corzine are linked in this moment of political instability. Both men -- Obama in his crusade for health care and other public investments, Corzine in his argument for painful taxes and budget cuts -- have tripped over a broken link in our basic understanding of civics. This shift probably has its roots in the 1970s, when voters saw their faith in government shaken first by Vietnam and Watergate and then by a series of economic calamities: soaring interest rates, inflation and gas prices, the onset of industrial collapse and global competition. This was when the anti-tax, antigovernment mentality got its foothold, and New Jersey, in fact, was at the center of this transformation. In 1978, Jeffrey Bell, a little-known conservative activist, took out the venerable Republican senator Clifford Case in a primary, waving around reproductions of the so-called Laffer Curve that would soon become synonymous with supply-side economics. Bell lost to Bill Bradley in November, but his argument didn't; during the early part of the Reagan years, a new generation of conservative lawmakers set about rolling back tax rates and looking for programs to kill.
 When, inevitably, it turned out that much of government really was desirable and that the revenue to pay for it was no longer sufficient, Washington and the states, much like ordinary consumers of the period, turned to borrowing. The more that elected officials borrowed and spent, the more disillusioned the citizenry became about their government and the more resistant they became to having to pay for it. In New Jersey, voters have for so long been deluged by budgetary schemes and antigovernment vitriol that a lot of them no longer seem to know how their tax system even works, or doesn't work. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, 85 percent of voters said there ought to be a cap on the rate at which property taxes can increase -- something Corzine has actually done. But when voters are asked if they are willing to pay more in sales or income taxes if it is necessary in order to lower property taxes, a majority say they aren't. At the same time, they also want to retain their costly tangle of tiny boroughs and school districts, attract the best teachers with high salaries and top-shelf benefits, build new schools and roads and (let's not forget) restore the state to solid financial health. Unless Paramus is sitting atop the world's largest undiscovered oil reserve, New Jersey's future holds more disappointment for its voters, no matter who becomes governor.
 To bring about reform now, politicians need to be not just good campaigners and public stewards but civics teachers too, able communicators who can reassert a connection in the public mind between costs and services, between the policies that Congress and state governments pursue and the money you end up paying your town for garbage collection and the local library. Corzine and Daggett are both trying to do this, in their own ways, though neither is the ideal vehicle; Corzine is a cautious reformer with little talent for explanation, and Daggett's campaign is too hard up for cash to communicate much of anything. Christie's campaign, on the other hand, seems lifted from the days before last year's economic collapse, when it seemed possible to have everything, and all at once. Those fellow governors who sympathize with Corzine are watching his campaign play out, hoping to find out whether the case for painful choices, as they see it, is any easier to make in this era than it was in the last. ''If Jon wins, and I believe he deserves to, I think a lot of other governors will say, It's O.K. to tell people the truth; it's O.K. to give out some tough medicine,'' Ed Rendell, the Democratic governor in neighboring Pennsylvania, told me. ''And I think more governors will be inspired to do that. If he loses, I think it will have a chilling effect.''
 On Labor Day, after the parade, Corzine drove north to Rutherford for an old-fashioned street fair. ''Come meet your governor, Jon Cooorrrr-zine!'' the Bergen County sheriff bellowed as they walked. And come they did. Corzine found himself mobbed by hand shakers and critics and beseechers, so that the narrow street soon became clogged with the amoebalike retinue surrounding him, and the governor could barely walk 10 feet in a minute. One woman wanted to know what Corzine was going to do about delayed construction of the new shopping mall at the Meadowlands. (He was pushing to get it done, Corzine said.) Why, a man asked, couldn't he clean up corruption? (His attorney general was prosecuting loads of cases.) Teacher salaries were rising too quickly and making property taxes spike! (That wasn't his purview.) Why wasn't he doing more for the environment? (''We're doing more on solar panels than any governor in the country. Seriously.'') 
 ''Stop the war!'' a woman shouted. 
 ''He can't do anything about the war,'' a man bellowed back. ''But the taxes!''
 Some guy in a chicken suit walked alongside the governor the entire way, saying nothing. Corzine seemed not to notice. Finally, driven by curiosity, I asked the chicken what he was supposed to represent. He held up a sign. It said: ''Jon Corzine raised your taxes. Ask him why.''

HEADLINE: Senate Global Warming Bill Is Seeking to Cushion the Impact on Industry

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate bill aimed at reducing global warming pollution will initially grant billions of dollars of free emissions permits to utilities and industry but will require the bulk of the money be returned to consumers and taxpayers, according to newly released details.
 The bill will also provide a cushion to energy-intensive manufacturing companies to ease the transition to a lower-carbon economy and to help them compete internationally, although the subsidies will disappear over time. The measure also sets a floor and ceiling on the price of permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 
 With these and other changes considered, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that overall cost of the bill at roughly $100 a year per household, similar to that of a House climate change and energy bill passed in June.
 The Senate measure, sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under a cap-and-trade system that sets a nationwide limit on emissions but allows polluters to buy and sell permits to meet it.
 The bill's targets for overall emissions reductions are 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050. The House bill's limits are similar, except the target for 2020 was set at 17 percent after negotiations with utilities and other major sources of emissions.
 Senators Kerry and Boxer introduced their bill in late September with a number of missing provisions. They filled in those blanks late Friday with a more detailed 923-page draft that spells out the formula for distributing pollution allowances and other provisions.
 The latest version includes new financing for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, more money for low-carbon transportation projects, additional assistance for rural communities and more favorable treatment for agriculture and forestry.
 ''We've reached another milestone as we move to a clean energy future,'' Mrs. Boxer said in a statement, ''creating millions of jobs and protecting our children from dangerous pollution.''
 The bill is before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which Mrs. Boxer leads. The panel has scheduled three days of hearings next week and has tentatively set markup to begin the following week.
 The E.P.A. analysis of the Kerry-Boxer bill found that its costs and impact were roughly equivalent to those of the House bill, which was sponsored by Democratic Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. The two bills would reduce overall American emissions by nearly the same amount over the next 40 years. The costs to consumers are also similar, the agency found.
 Neither bill would add to the federal deficit and both measures could actually produce some revenue from the sale of emissions permits, the agency found.
 The E.P.A. did not try to quantify the benefits to individuals or society of reducing greenhouse gas pollution.
 Other studies have found higher costs, although all such estimates are based on assumptions about how businesses and consumers would behave as energy costs rise and how quickly new technology would appear to replace increasingly costly fossil fuels.
 Senate Republicans dismissed the E.P.A. analysis as incomplete and have threatened to boycott committee action until a more thorough analysis is done.
 ''It's not unreasonable to demand that a committee, prior to legislative hearings, would actually have the bill in question with adequate time for review and analysis,'' said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the Senate environment committee.
 ''On top of that,'' added Mr. Inhofe, who is a global warming skeptic, ''one would think that, prior to legislative hearings, the committee would have a thorough, comprehensive economic analysis to understand how an 900-plus page bill, designed to fundamentally reshape the American economy, affects consumers, small businesses, farmers and American families.''

HEADLINE: Democrats See a Positive in a Bad Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The bad economy is good for President Obama and Democrats as they try to reinvent the health care system with scant Republican support.
 That is the conclusion of many Congressional Democrats, who say that economic insecurity and high unemployment stoke public support for their proposals to guarantee insurance for millions of Americans.
 Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said this was one of the biggest differences between the health care wars of 1993-94 and the battle today. When Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton fought for universal coverage, Mr. McDermott said, the economy was on an upswing, in the early stages of a 10-year economic expansion, which proved to be the longest in American history. 
 Today, by contrast, the economy is weak. Americans have struggled through the worst recession in decades. The unemployment rate is at a 26-year high.
 ''The mentality in the country is different,'' said Mr. McDermott, a psychiatrist who has served in Congress for two decades. ''In 1993, we were talking about the uninsured as 'them.' Now it turns out this is for us. When a bank like Washington Mutual in Seattle lays off 3,000 people, they lose health insurance. Millions of people with insurance are asking, 'What if I lose my job?' ''
 Mr. Obama is doing everything he can to highlight this sense of insecurity as he tries to persuade people with insurance that his proposals would help them. Worries about insurance are ''keeping more and more Americans awake at night,'' he said last month.
 The fate of health legislation may hinge on whether those anxieties trump concerns about the effects of the Democratic proposals. Republicans say ''Obamacare'' would kill jobs by imposing new taxes and destabilize the employer-based system of insurance on which 170 million Americans depend.
 The latest Census Bureau figures show that 15.4 percent of Americans -- 46.3 million people -- were uninsured in 2008. But a recent Treasury Department study said many more people had reason to feel insecure.
 Based on data from 1997 to 2006, the study said, 48 percent of Americans under the age of 65 can expect to go without health insurance for a month or more in the next decade, and 41 percent can expect to be uninsured for six months or more. Among young people, Mr. Obama said, the risk is even greater, as more than half of people under 21 today will be uninsured at some point in the next decade.
 A new report from the Department of Health and Human Services, titled ''Insurance Insecurity,'' hammers home the point. One in three working-age adults had a gap in coverage for at least one month in 2006 or 2007, it said, and ''one in six Americans with employer-sponsored insurance in 2006 lost that coverage by 2008.''
 Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, held a hearing recently to show that middle-class families with health insurance were filing for bankruptcy because they could not pay their medical bills.
 Democrats say a government-run insurance plan is the best way to allay fears about the loss of private insurance. Private insurers can increase premiums or withdraw from markets, they say, but a government plan will always be available and affordable.
 And Democrats have hit upon a new sales pitch: To make the cost of the bill smaller, they need to make government's role bigger. 
 Liberal Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi say that a public plan would put competitive pressure on private insurers to hold down premiums and costs.
 To save money, they say, the public plan should use Medicare rates as a basis for paying doctors and hospitals. Private insurers negotiate rates with doctors and hospitals, which have substantial bargaining power. The Medicare rates, set by law and regulation, are lower.
 The risk of setting rates too low is illustrated by the formula used to pay doctors treating Medicare patients. Doctors return to Capitol Hill year after year begging Congress to spare them from cuts in their Medicare fees.
 The House and Senate health care bills would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from projected Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers. 
 Richard S. Foster, chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the estimated savings were unrealistic because they were based on overly optimistic assumptions about gains in productivity in the health care industry.
 Under these proposals, Mr. Foster said, health care providers ''could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end their participation in the program, possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries.''
 The fight over a government health plan may seem arcane, but its outcome could help determine whether the legislation succeeds in expanding coverage and reducing costs, health economists said. At issue is the appropriate balance between public and private insurance -- the same question Congress faced when it added a drug benefit to Medicare in 2003.
 The drug benefit is delivered by private insurers under contract with the government. Insurers, seeing a lucrative business opportunity, rushed in to the Medicare market and compete aggressively. The program has worked better than many Democrats predicted, and the costs have been lower than expected.
 Republicans trusted private insurers. Democrats do not.
 ''If you're going to mandate that people must buy insurance,'' Ms. Pelosi asked, ''why would you throw them into the lions' den of the insurance industry without some leverage with a public option?'' 
 Democrats have also found that they can hold down the cost of their bill by significantly expanding eligibility for Medicaid. 
 It is less expensive for the federal government to cover low-income people under Medicaid than to provide them with subsidies to buy private insurance. Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals much less than private insurance, and states may eventually be required to pick up some of the cost -- a prospect that alarms many governors.

HEADLINE: Man's World at White House? No Harm, No Foul, Aides Say

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Does the White House feel like a frat house?
 The suspicion flared in recent weeks -- and not for the first time -- after President Obama was criticized by women's advocates and liberal bloggers for hosting a high-level basketball game with no female players. 
 The president, after all, is an unabashed First Guy's Guy. Since being elected, he has demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of college hoops on ESPN, indulged a craving for weekend golf, expressed a preference for adopting a ''big rambunctious dog'' over a ''girlie dog'' and hoisted beer in a peacemaking effort.
 He presides over a White House rife with fist-bumping young men who call each other ''dude'' and testosterone-brimming personalities like Rahm Emanuel, the often-profane chief of staff; Lawrence Summers, the brash economic adviser; and Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, who habitually speaks in sports metaphors. 
 The technical foul over the all-male game has become a nagging concern for a White House that has battled an impression dating to the presidential campaign that Mr. Obama's closest advisers form a boys' club and that he is too frequently in the company of only men -- not just when playing sports, but also when making big decisions. 
 While the senior adviser Valerie Jarrett is undeniably one of the president's closest White House confidantes, some women inside or close to the administration complain that Mr. Obama's female advisers are not as visible as their male colleagues or, they suspect, as influential. 
 ''Women are Obama's base, and they don't seem to have enough people who look like the base inside of their own inner circle,'' said Dee Dee Myers, a former press secretary in the Clinton administration whose sister, Betsy, served as the Obama campaign's chief operating officer. 
 Ms. Myers said women have high expectations of the president. ''Obama has a personal style that appeals to women,'' she said. ''He is seen as a consensus builder; he is not a towel snapper and does not tell crude jokes.''
 Mr. Obama, in an interview with NBC on Wednesday, called the beef over basketball ''bunk,'' saying that the players were largely picked from a regular Congressional game and that the list of invitees was reviewed by women on his staff.
 ''I don't think it sends any kind of message or signal whatsoever,'' said the president, who often points out that he is surrounded by strong females at home (where he is the only non-canine male). He added, in the interview, that he had hired women into ''some of the most important decision-making positions in this White House.''
 Ms. Jarrett similarly rejected the notion that the West Wing had been overrun by Y chromosomes, saying such complaints were ''a Washington perception that has nothing to do with the reality on the ground.''
 She cites the prominent women Mr. Obama has appointed to top positions, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and six other cabinet-level officials; Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor; the health care czar, Nancy-Ann DeParle; and the domestic policy adviser, Melody Barnes. According to figures provided by the administration, there is a 50-50 gender split among White House employees. 
 Still, some high-profile sectors of the White House -- economics and national security, for instance -- are filled with men and exude an unmistakable male vibe. Mr. Obama's inner circle includes Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Emanuel and his senior adviser, David Axelrod (''The Boys,'' as they are known to some female staff members).
 Women in important White House jobs tend to be less visible than their colleagues, even as the administration is trying to elevate their profiles. (In the same week as the basketball game, Anita Dunn, the White House communications director, hosted a group of women reporters for an off-the-record meeting with Ms. Jarrett over chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies.)
 One Democratic media strategist says that while Mr. Obama does place women in important roles, his comfort level with staff members is not always perceived as equal.
 ''There is a sense that Obama has a certain jocular familiarity with the men that he doesn't have with the women,'' said Tracy Sefl, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign who speaks regularly to some female aides in the administration.
 In interviews, five women who work in the White House or advised officials there described the culture with more of a collective eye-roll than any real sense of grievance or discomfort. One junior aide, who like the other women spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about appearing publicly critical, said that the ''sports-fan thing at the White House'' could become ''annoying'' and that her relative indifference to athletics could be mildly alienating. And while this is not uncommon in any workplace, sports bonding can afford a point of entree with the boss.
 Ben Finkenbinder, a junior press aide and scratch golfer, was recently invited into a foursome with Mr. Obama. (In records kept by Mark Knoller of CBS, the president has played 23 rounds of golf since taking office, none of which have included women, though Mr. Knoller allows that the press office does not always release the names of every player. A White House spokesman, Bill Burton, said Friday that Mr. Obama planned to play this weekend with Ms. Barnes.) 
 Mr. Obama is hardly the first commander in chief whose penchant for sports and other guyish stuff (comic books, ''Star Trek'') has become part of his presidential persona. The first President George Bush presented himself as a horseshoe-playing, pork-rind-eating Texan. He was followed by the Big Mac-gobbling, cigar-chomping Bill Clinton and the brush-clearing, bike-busting George W. Bush. It worked to good effect, said Mark McKinnon, a media adviser and mountain bike companion of the latter Mr. Bush. 
 ''We see them as president but know they can also shoot hoops and put the hammer down on a chain ring, which makes them more accessible, normal and likable,'' Mr. McKinnon said.
 Recreation is only one source of affinity within a White House culture, people there say. Obama veterans describe a camaraderie forged over a grueling campaign and a merciless nine months at the White House. It is not about gender, they say, but shared experience.
 ''Many of us have known each other for a long time, and we have brother-and-sister kind of relationships,'' said Jen Psaki, the deputy press secretary, who works in an office with seven other spokesmen under 35, all ''brothers'' from the campaign.
 Other women in the administration say that any discussion of White House culture should account for how politics has long been dominated by men but is now more inclusive. Ms. Dunn, who had to take a typing test three decades ago to work for a campaign, rejects the notion of a boys' club. She calls the Obama administration ''refreshingly un-self-conscious'' about matters of equality, maybe to a point where they neglected the ''optics'' of the all-male basketball game.
 Ms. Dunn said that she recently hosted a baby shower for an administration official and that no men from the office were invited. She is comfortable with that -- just as she is fine with never playing basketball with the president. 
 ''That is just part of the culture here that I am excluded from,'' she said. ''And I don't care.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Follies: The Next Act

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
It certainly sounded good. 
 Hoping, perhaps, to persuade a dubious public that curbing reckless business practices is indeed a Washington priority, the Obama administration and Congress produced a hat trick of financial reforms last week. The outlines of a consumer financial protection agency emerged from the House Financial Services Committee. The House Agriculture Committee spelled out ways to regulate risky derivatives trading, and the United States Treasury's compensation czar announced his plan to rein in runaway executive pay at seven companies that, in total, have received hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer help within the past year. 
 Not to be outdone, the Federal Reserve announced plans late Thursday to review pay practices at the nation's largest banks. It all left the question, would it make Wall Street safe for America? 
 For all the apparent action in Washington, some acute observers say that it was much ado about little. Last week's moves, they say, were tinkering around the edges and did nothing to prevent another disaster like the one that unfolded a year ago. 
 The white-hot focus on pay, for example, looks like a way for the government to reassure an angry public that they are making genuine changes. But compensation is a trifling matter compared to, say, true reform of derivatives trading. 
 ''The American public understands the immorality of paying people huge bonuses for failures that damaged the economy,'' said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former commodities regulator. ''What they don't understand is that those payments are only a small fraction of the irregularities that took place and that, in essence, the compensation problems, as bad as they are, are a sideshow to the casino-like nature of the economy as it existed, pre-Lehman Brothers, and as it exists today.''
 It is difficult enough for seasoned regulators or market professionals to assess whether various reform proposals will close pernicious loopholes and make the financial system safer. But for a crisis-weary public, such an analysis is almost impossible. Much easier to grasp are the cuts to executive pay announced by Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Treasury official in charge of setting compensation at bailed-out companies. 
 Mr. Feinberg reduced compensation across the board at American International Group, Citigroup, Bank of America, Chrysler, General Motors, GMAC and Chrysler Financial, the companies that received the most government help. He cut average cash payments by more than 90 percent and overall pay by around 50 percent. Trying to discourage the instant-gratification mindset that permeates trading desks and executive suites, Mr. Feinberg also required that the majority of the salaries he oversees be paid in stock that must be held for the long term. 
 It is certainly worthwhile to reduce outsize pay at companies receiving taxpayer support. But regulating derivatives is far more important to those interested in eliminating the possibility of future billion-dollar bailouts. These financial instruments, which trade privately and beyond the prying eyes of regulators, are central to the interconnectedness among companies that required some of the costliest rescues. American International Group, for example, had to be rescued to cover the costs of insurance it had written for customers intending to protect their mortgage holdings from default. The insurance is a derivative called a credit-default swap. The company has received $170 billion in taxpayer aid. 
 But the derivatives bill generated by the House Agriculture Committee contains a sizable loophole. It is designed to push the trading of these opaque instruments onto exchanges or clearinghouses where regulators and participants can better assess who is at risk. But the bill would let transactions remain private if they involve nonfinancial companies that are trying to protect against fluctuations in their costs of doing business, a practice known as hedging. For example, when Exxon buys or sells derivatives to hedge against shifts in the price of oil, those transactions would be exempt from having to be traded on an exchange or clearinghouse. Thus, many derivatives would not trade in the light of day. 
 Such companies argue that trading on an exchange will make their costs rise. But critics of the exemption say that if protecting the system from a meltdown costs participants a bit more, so be it. This last go-round has certainly been expensive for taxpayers, after all. 
 The consumer financial protection agency moving through Congress would also carve out an exemption that disturbs advocates for borrowers. It means that the agency will not oversee loans provided by auto dealerships. 
 Travis Plunkett, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America, said this is akin to exempting mortgage brokers from oversight in real estate finance. ''It's crazy to us not to cover the people who are offering the loans, who benefit from the loans and who sometimes have been found to participate in unfair lending,'' he said.
 None of this, mind you, addresses the most significant issue of all: how to make sure that companies do not grow to a point where they become too big or interconnected to be allowed to fail. The man with a plan to resolve that crucial problem is Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve who is revered for crushing the ruinous inflation of the early 1980s. 
 In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Volcker said the nation's commercial banks should not be allowed to hold and trade risky securities, a practice that generated deep losses for many of them in the credit crunch. The governor of the Bank of England made the same point last week. Separating these operations was the response the United States government took after the Crash of 1929, but today, the administration says it has no plan to break up the banks again in the manner Mr. Volcker suggests. 
 The former Fed chairman is certainly not alone in his fears about the threat that large institutions still pose. Neil Barofsky, special inspector general of Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, was asked last Wednesday by CNN about the changes being made to ensure that a disaster like the one starting last year would not recur. 
 ''I think actually what's changed is in the other direction,'' the refreshingly candid Mr. Barofsky said. ''These banks that were too big to fail, are now bigger. Government has sponsored and supported several mergers that made them larger. And that guaranteed that implicit guarantee of moral hazard. The idea that the government is not going to let these banks fail, which was implicit a year ago, its now explicit.'' 
 Then he added, ''So, if anything, not only have there not been any meaningful regulatory reform to make it less likely, in a lot of ways, the governments have made such problems more likely. Potentially, we could be in more danger now than we were a year ago.''

HEADLINE: Sony's Version Of Tracy And Hepburn

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 DAYS after Michael Jackson died last summer, an executive at Sony Music phoned Amy Pascal, the co-head of the company's movie studio, to tell her that the pop singer had left hours upon hours of rehearsal tapes for his planned run of 50 concerts in London.
 Ms. Pascal watched 12 minutes of the tapes and saw a surprisingly limber Mr. Jackson strutting across the stage. She told her partner at the helm of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Michael M. Lynton, that the studio should be aggressive in securing the movie rights. Mr. Lynton quickly agreed, and after days of negotiations, the pair sealed a deal with an offer to pay $60 million upfront. 
 The film created from those rehearsal tapes, ''This Is It,'' opens this week for a 14-day run at theaters here and abroad. Days before opening, it had already sold out at more than 1,600 theaters domestically, according to Fandango and MovieTickets. ''It's not 'Spider-Man,' but it can make us good money,'' Mr. Lynton says. 
 The Jackson deal was just the latest coup from a pair who are putting on a leadership display that is rare in any industry, outside of family-run businesses: a man and woman, equal partners, at the helm, and operating in sync. It has worked at Sony Pictures, say executives who know both people, because Mr. Lynton checked his ego after first being offered the job alone, while Ms. Pascal has put aside her resentment at not getting the chance to run the show herself after a long run at the studio. 
 What's more, they say, it combines Ms. Pascal's talents at picking films with Mr. Lynton's penchant for minimizing financial risk. During their tenure, the studio has had its best year at the box office, in 2006, when it released ''The Da Vinci Code,'' and, over all, raked in more than $1.7 billion domestically. 
 ''Amy is a gut-level decision maker,'' says Matt Tolmach, one of two presidents of Sony's Columbia Pictures, which is releasing the Jackson film. ''She responds very viscerally to material and to people. Michael is very analytical and Socratic.''
 It's an arrangement that sprang from strife six years ago, and one that few in Hollywood -- a land of ego, extravagance and desperate, daily scorekeeping -- gave a chance of succeeding. A result has been that Sony, which entered Hollywood in 1989 with the purchase of Columbia Pictures and suffered through bouts with dysfunction and chaos, now has a management team that has been more durable than those at some other major studios. 
 That stability is a big advantage at a time when the industry is facing deep despair over the economic recession and a steep decline in DVD sales, which have been the recent lifeblood of the industry. At the same time, the Internet and social networking have fractured audiences across the media universe. 
 In some ways, the economic realities of the movie business have necessitated a different style of leadership: fiscally conservative, cooperative and less top-down. 
 While keeping tight reins on their budget, Ms. Pascal and Mr. Lynton have also tried to change the hierarchical culture of the studio by creating a campus-style environment and eliminating executive perks like the corporate dining room (in favor of a commissary where rank-and-file eat alongside top management). 
 More important, in addition to playing down their personal rivalry, they have shown a willingness to set aside corporate rivalries within Sony. The studio has worked more closely with the company's electronics division, a sharp contrast to previous practices at the studio.
 The Jackson deal was a rare example of Sony's movie division and its music company, which held the rights to Mr. Jackson's recorded music, working together -- something that Howard Stringer, Sony's chief executive, has stressed during his tenure, but that in practice has been more aspiration then reality.
 Over breakfast recently at his office in New York, Mr. Stringer said of the partnership between Ms. Pascal and Mr. Lynton: ''I never really thought it wouldn't work. I didn't think it was as risky as people thought it was.'' 
 THE idea of creating an equal partnership between them was not Mr. Stringer's original thought.
 In 2003, when he phoned Ms. Pascal to tell her he planned to install Mr. Lynton, an outsider, as her boss, she was virtually apoplectic. She had served as president of Columbia since 1996, and felt that she had earned the promotion.
 Mr. Stringer says: ''I had complete confidence in Amy with the movies. Amy had a pretty good argument for, 'Why are you bringing in this guy?' ''
 But Mr. Stringer was trying to refashion Sony in a way in which its film, television and music business would serve its hardware business. A movie studio, he said, could no longer be viewed as a corporate faction where television shows and movies are made, but as a ''place where the future was invented.''
 He trusted Ms. Pascal as a movie picker but thought that Mr. Lynton, who formerly ran AOL Europe, was needed to navigate the changing media environment brought on by new digital technologies and to help Sony expand internationally.
 As Ms. Pascal recalls, ''I thought I should have your job,'' as she gestures toward Mr. Lynton, who is sitting on her left as they have lunch at the new commissary. ''Howard thought you should have it. I said, 'I'm leaving.' ''
 When Ms. Pascal protested, Mr. Stringer switched gears and asked Mr. Lynton if he would accept an equal footing with Ms. Pascal, with both reporting to Mr. Stringer. Ms. Pascal flew to New York to speak to Mr. Lynton, whom she had never met. Over drinks at the Sony Club, the two discussed the parameters of the relationship.
 ''Howard said, 'I think you need some alone time,' '' recalls Mr. Lynton. ''It was like a weird, arranged India marriage. The principle was it has to be equal and open.''
 The two couldn't be more different, in style, temperament or background. 
 Mr. Lynton, 49, grew up in the Netherlands, and his path to Hollywood was by way of Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard and, briefly, Wall Street. The scion of a wealthy family, he has an easy manner and runs in New York media circles.
 Ms. Pascal, 51, is a native of Southern California and grew up in a middle-class family -- her mother owned an artists' bookstore and her father was an economist at the Rand Corporation. She attended the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating with a degree in international relations. 
 ''Movies defined what was possible for a young ambitious girl growing up in Southern California,'' Ms. Pascal told employees last year at a town-hall-style meeting. 
 She got her first movie job as a secretary for Tony Garnett, a producer. The phone didn't ring much, so she read scripts and got to know screenwriters. Production executives at major studios sought her opinion, and eventually Scott Rudin, the producer, offered her a job at 20th Century Fox. It's a familiar Hollywood trajectory, even for men: Barry Diller got his start in the William Morris Agency's mailroom.
 Ms. Pascal moved from 20th Century Fox to Columbia Pictures when she was still in her 20s. In her early days at Columbia, she oversaw films like ''When Harry Met Sally'' and ''A League of Their Own.''
 Ms. Pascal acknowledges that she was reared in the industry when money from DVDs was flooding in.
 ''When DVD was growing, everything was growing,'' she says. ''Michael came in and said, 'This economy is going to change.' Howard saw it coming, and that's why he put the two of us together.''
 The two have a conference room adjoining their offices, and this is where they iron out their differences.
 ''We fight, for real, like people do,'' Ms. Pascal says. ''But nobody sees that but us. We do it in our mutual conference room.'' 
 Ms. Pascal says that Mr. Lynton talked her out of investing in ''Evan Almighty,'' a 2007 big-budget comedy put out by Universal that was not profitable. With a production budget of $175 million, the film had to ''really hit big'' to make money, said Mr. Lynton, who felt that it was too risky. 
 Despite his personal wealth, Mr. Lynton describes himself as cheap, and he often gets his haircuts from a barber on the lot. ''I grew up in Holland, which is Calvinist,'' he explains. ''They watch their pennies. I go overboard in that way sometimes.''
 After reading ''Superbad,'' a Seth Rogen comedy released in 2007, Mr. Lynton said he didn't understand the humor, while Ms. Pascal said she thought it would ''be fantastic and an anthem for this generation.'' But because the investment risk was so low, he relented.
 ''Amy said, 'You know what, you've just go to go with me on this one,' '' says Mr. Lynton, who adds that the movie was of the type that is ''never going to make sense on a piece on a paper.'' But Ms. Pascal's instinct was dead-on. ''Superbad'' cost about $18 million to make, and it generated about $120 million at the domestic box office, according to BoxOfficeMojo, which tracks ticket sales. 
 The pair say they have become genuine friends. They go to the same synagogue, Mr. Lynton used Ms. Pascal's architect for his house in Brentwood, and their children go to the same schools and have sleepovers.
 ''It's unique because we treat our partnership like a relationship, which I think two men would find hard to do,'' Ms. Pascal says. 
 Brian Grazer, the producer who worked with Sony on ''The Da Vinci Code,'' says of the two: ''Amy gets completely absorbed in the creative process of her work. I think that Michael, when he came in, was uniquely sensitive, and this is rare in the Hollywood equation. He was very sensitive to Amy and what her needs were.''
 And Jeff Blake, the studio's head of marketing, says, ''You never see any fissures between them, never any angle where you can start playing one off the other.''
 WHEN Mr. Lynton arrived at Sony in 2004, he set out to change the studio's culture. He found an environment, he says, ''in which people felt very reticent about sharing information, sometimes for personal reasons, and sometimes because they weren't in the same building.''
 The company recently spent millions, money committed before the recession set in, to build a new commissary and a gym. The new cafeteria, which is subsidized so employees can eat lunch for about $8, opened just weeks ago. 
 Mr. Lynton also shut down the Rita Hayworth dining room, a swanky space reserved for top executives and movie stars. 
 People around Hollywood have noticed an improvement in morale at the studio. Bryan Lourd, co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency, who often works with Sony on movie projects, says the new facilities have ''enticed people to want to work there.''
 He says the stability at Sony is in contrast to management upheaval that has afflicted other studios. In recent weeks, for example, two top executives at Universal Studios were ousted, and the head of Disney's movie studio was replaced. 
 ''Other studios aren't as stable because of management changes, or changes in the direction of the entire company,'' Mr. Lourd says. ''They are largely living quarter to quarter.''
 At Sony, he says, ''it's like walking into a hotel and the guy knows your name, and the bartender knows your name.''
 Of course, all of Sony's cultural change and fiscal discipline is in the service of an industry where keeping profits and revenue flat is considered successful. In Sony's most recently completed fiscal year, its movie unit generated operating income of $305 million, compared with $339 million in 2004. In the first quarter this year, revenue rose 6.5 percent, and the studio posted an operating profit of $19 million, compared with a loss a year earlier. Executives say the studio has had five profitable pictures in row: ''The Ugly Truth,''''Julie & Julia,''''District 9,''''Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs'' and ''Zombieland.''
 That said, no one is predicting much profit growth, mainly because of the decline in DVD sales, which have had more impact on profits than ticket sales.
 To survive, Mr. Stringer says, studios need to move past the egos and flamboyance that typified other eras of Hollywood.
 ''Studios collapse in on themselves when politics interferes,'' he says, noting that he had expected more sparks to fly when he made Ms. Pascal and Mr. Lynton equal partners. ''But there really hasn't been drama.'' 
 At many Hollywood studios, the management ranks have been thinning. Scene Stealer, Page 5.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Gearing Up for 2010 House Races

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
National Republican leaders are laying the groundwork to mount tough challenges against at least six Democratic members of the House of Representatives from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut next year, emboldened by President Obama's ebbing popularity and voter concerns over issues like federal spending and health care.
 Though Congressional elections are still a year away, the Republicans have already recruited a handful of candidates and have even run advertisements in an effort to weaken Democratic incumbents around the region, several of them newcomers who rode Mr. Obama's coattails last fall. 
 Among the areas of focus are eastern Long Island, Staten Island, Fairfield County, Conn., and the northern suburbs of New York City, where Representative John J. Hall has been attacked by the National Republican Congressional Committee and a candidate has emerged whom the party views as promising, a doctor who has pumped $150,000 of her own money into the race. 
 In the Utica area, Republicans have unleashed a series of negative radio and television advertisements against Representative Michael A. Arcuri, a second-term Democrat who narrowly won re-election in 2008, as they coax Richard Hanna, a wealthy construction executive who challenged him last year, to run again in 2010. And in New York's Southern Tier, party officials have rallied behind Tom Reed, the mayor of Corning, as he seeks to take on Representative Eric Massa, a first-term Democrat who represents one of four New York districts that Mr. Obama lost in 2008.
 The evidence that Republicans see opportunity in the region is noteworthy given their weak performance in recent elections. In 2006 and 2008, Democrats picked up nine House seats in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and now hold a 39-to-7 advantage in the three states' delegations.
 The strategy, which independent analysts say has some potential, is to appeal to independent voters in a handful of swing districts with broad, national themes that emphasize the poor economy and the increase in federal spending and debt under Democrats.
 A national Gallup poll of such independent voters this month said they preferred Republican candidates for Congress, 45 percent to 36 percent; a year ago, a similar Gallup poll showed them favoring Democrats, 46 percent to 39 percent.
 ''There is no doubt that there have been few Republican success stories in the Northeast in recent elections,'' said Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''But we're very encouraged by the strong bench of candidates who are stepping up in these races.''
 Representative Christopher Van Hollen, the head of the Democrats' campaign committee, however, expressed strong doubt about whether Republicans could actually mount credible challenges in the region next year. ''The last elections have demonstrated that the Republican Party in Washington is way out of the mainstream of these districts,'' he said.
 Nationally, the most recent campaign finance disclosure reports showed that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had $10.7 million on hand, compared with the $4.2 million that the National Republican Congressional Committee has. At such a financial disadvantage, it is unclear how much of an effort the Republicans will mount in the Northeast given the number of competitive races shaping up in parts of the country that are generally more hospitable to them.
 And in several districts that seem favorable to Republicans demographically, the party is struggling to recruit suitable candidates, even as potentially bruising primary battles among their own are taking shape in other districts. ''We still have a challenge ahead of us in the region,'' Mr. Lindsay acknowledged.
 In Connecticut, for example, Republicans see opportunity in the Fourth Congressional District, which stretches from the New York border to Bridgeport and beyond, since the seat was held by Republicans for nearly four decades before Jim Himes was elected in 2008. But Republican Party leaders failed to recruit their preferred candidate, John McKinney, the Republican leader in the State Senate, whose father once held the Congressional seat. Now, several lesser-known Republicans are fighting among themselves for the chance to challenge Mr. Himes.
 The party runs the risk of a similar setback in New York's 20th Congressional District, near Albany, where Republicans have an overwhelming registration advantage over Democrats.
 Party leaders have been trying to recruit John Faso, a former state assemblyman and the Republican nominee for governor in 2006, to run against Representative Scott Murphy, a Democrat who won a special election in April after Kirsten E. Gillibrand's appointment to the Senate. But Mr. Faso has so far declined to say what he plans to do.
 On eastern Long Island, in a swing district, Republicans are hoping to unseat Timothy H. Bishop, a four-term Democrat, with a well-financed challenger. Randy Altschuler, an entrepreneur, has pumped $450,000 of his own money into the campaign; his latest disclosure reports show about $540,000 in the bank; Mr. Bishop has $710,000.
 As they are doing elsewhere in the country, Republicans say they will seize on public concern about government spending under Democrats. Mr. Bishop was confronted on that issue this spring during a boisterous town-hall-style meeting in his district.
 Republicans also feel optimistic about their prospects on Staten Island, which John McCain also carried last year. Michael E. McMahon, who last November became the first Democrat in 28 years to win the district, is facing Michael Allegretti, an executive with the Climate Group, an environmental organization, who has nearly $155,000 in his campaign account, compared with Mr. McMahon's roughly $760,000.
 The early Republican effort in the Southern Tier, which encompasses more than a dozen counties along New York's border with Pennsylvania, offers a preview of what party leaders say is likely to occur next fall. For months, Republican Party operatives have kept a close eye on Mr. Massa, the district's freshman congressman, as he attempts to balance the conservative leanings of his district with the demands of his party's liberal base.
 In August, while attending a liberal bloggers' convention, Mr. Massa was caught on tape saying, in regard to his support of a government-run insurance plan, ''I will vote adamantly against the interests of my district if I actually think what I am doing is going to help.''
 The National Republican Congressional Committee immediately created a video called ''Democrats Think You're Stupid'' highlighting the comments, and distributed it to news organizations. Party operatives say it will almost certainly be fodder for campaign commercials next year.
 Mr. Massa, whose office has dismissed the attacks as partisan games, is leaving nothing to chance, aware that House members are most at risk of defeat when seeking their second term. In addition to raising more than $800,000 in the past year, he has maintained a furious pace of public appearances in the district, holding 64 town-hall-style meetings since the beginning of 2008.

 In the months before the war in Iraq began in March 2003, many American soldiers took part in huge mock tank battles against a mythical army known as the ''Kraznovians.'' The Kraznovians were modeled after the Soviet Army, which had evaporated more than a decade before, but the battles that unfolded at the National Training Center in the California desert were designed to resemble those that had been anticipated on the plains of Central Europe. Then the real war in Iraq began, and the American Army found itself disastrously unprepared for the conflict that unfolded. 
 It took a long time -- Iraq imploded, and 32,000 Americans were killed or wounded -- but the Army finally righted itself. The temporary buildup known as the surge may have helped stabilize the country, but what really pulled Iraq back from the abyss was that the Army fighting in the later years was vastly different from the one that went in at the start. The Army transformed itself in Iraq, and not a moment too soon. 
 The story of that transformation, and of the generals at the heart of it, is the subject of ''The Fourth Star'' by David Cloud, a correspondent at The New York Times from 2005 to 2007, and Greg Jaffe, the Pentagon correspondent for The Washington Post. (Cloud and I met once while he worked at The Times, and we contributed to two articles together and shared a byline on a third.) This book is about four generals -- David Petraeus and Peter Chiarelli, who led the transformation, and George W. Casey Jr. and John Abizaid, who were ultimately left behind by it. As ''The Fourth Star'' makes clear, it was only the efforts of Generals Petraeus and Chiarelli, and other like-minded officers, that saved America from a cataclysm in the Middle East. 
 ''The Fourth Star'' paints wonderfully dramatic portraits of the four senior officers highlighted here, but at its heart it's a story about bureaucracy. As an institution, the United States Army has much more in common with, say, a giant corporation like General Motors than with a professional sports team like the New York Giants. You can't cut players who don't perform, and it's hard to fire your head coach. Like General Motors, the Army changes very slowly, and once it does, it's hard to turn it around again. 
 The book begins with Vietnam. The Army was defeated in a guerrilla war there that upended many of the core principles on which it had lived and thrived. Yet its response to the Vietnam debacle was not to rethink those principles, but to erase the bad memories and pretend that the war had never happened. Instead of planning how to fight the next insurgency, the Army went right back to preparing for what it loved to do: fight big battles against big, uniformed armies just like itself. Training in guerrilla war, as Cloud and Jaffe show, was banished from the Army's curriculum. 
 Abizaid, Casey, Chiarelli and Petraeus all began their Army careers in the 1970s, when the Army was at its post-Vietnam nadir -- when drug abuse was so rampant and morale so low that it was said the military was incapable of actually fighting. All four men were exceptionally bright and hard-working, rising through the ranks as the Army struggled to rebuild itself. 
 ''The Fourth Star'' is at its best in sketching the lives and personalities of these young officers. John Abizaid, the great-grandson of Lebanese immigrants, learned Arabic and figured out early in his career that the Army would need to think deeply about the political and economic components of the wars it would probably have to fight. George Casey, the son of a two-star general killed in Vietnam, was determined to ensure that the experience of that war would not be repeated. Peter Chiarelli, perhaps the most down-to-earth general in the Army, started his career teaching social science and never abandoned his thoughtful approach to soldiering. 
 But the hero of ''The Fourth Star,'' as of the Army itself, is David Petraeus, the brightest and most driven of all the bright and driven men around him. Petraeus comes off here as almost fanatically ambitious. From the day he walked into West Point as a young cadet in 1970, he was determined to best his comrades in any competition, no matter how small. No detail escaped him: Petraeus told his men what types of haircuts to get and the way they should button their tunics. He irritated many of his fellow officers on his way up, but his drive was matched by brains and ability. Among other things, he completed a Ph.D. at Princeton University; his thesis, not coincidentally, was entitled ''The American Military and the Lessons of Vietnam.'' 
 The four men came together in the crucible of Iraq. Abizaid, as commander of all military forces in the region, and Casey, as the leader of American forces inside the country, figure together here as the men who presided over the war's nightmare years. Chiarelli and Petraeus served in Iraq during this period, too, first as division commanders and then in more senior posts. Both men realized very quickly that the Army's heavy-handed approach to fighting was driving the Iraqis away. 
 Abizaid and Casey, for all their talents, conceived and directed the strategy in Iraq that brought America to the brink of defeat. The essence of that strategy was to train Iraqi forces as quickly as possible so that American soldiers could come home. In practice, that meant pulling American troops from the streets and replacing them with Iraqi soldiers who were unwilling or incapable of fighting for their government. The result was anarchy and civil war. 
 This disastrous policy was reversed by the ''surge,'' dreamed up by a group of outsiders and ordered by President Bush in early 2007. Casey was promoted and brought back to Washington, Abizaid retired, and Petraeus took charge. (Chiarelli also went home, to become vice chief of staff of the Army, after serving an unhappy tenure as Casey's deputy.) At its heart, the surge was not merely about putting more troops into Baghdad but about deploying them in Iraqi neighborhoods to protect the civilian population and thereby isolate the insurgents -- the essence of counterinsurgency strategy. In the surge, Petraeus finally got a chance to put his ideas into practice on a broad scale. Within 12 months, violence in Iraq had dropped dramatically. 
 ''The Fourth Star'' is a very good book, readable, detailed and rich. The profiles of Abizaid, Casey, Chiarelli and Petraeus are nuanced and well drawn; the generals really come to life, as does the Army itself. 
 But I wish the authors had gone further analytically. What is missing from ''The Fourth Star'' is a sense of the magnitude of the Iraqi disaster -- not merely what the generals inherited, but also what they, especially Abizaid and Casey, wrought. The Iraqi strategy conceived by Abizaid and Casey -- and endorsed, it should be said, by Donald Rumsfeld and most others in the Bush administration -- led directly to the catastrophe that Iraq became. Despite clear and overwhelming evidence of the disaster, Abizaid and Casey pushed on, assuring the public that their strategy was working. Even a glance into the Iraqi streets proved otherwise. Sometimes ''The Fourth Star'' is a little too nice -- sometimes you have to tell a general he's wrong. Petraeus and Chiarelli would be the first to say so.

HEADLINE: A Weapon Called Fine Print

 BODY:
WHEN his new five-bedroom penthouse at 170 East End Avenue, the 19-story glass and stone condominium overlooking Carl Schurz Park, was ready after a wait of two years, Arvind Sanger, a hedge fund manager, refused to close.
 By that time, the economy was in turmoil and the market had turned. Mr. Sanger sued the developer, Orin Wilf, demanding his $250,000 deposit back, and complaining of a series of violations of a federal statute, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, intended to protect consumers who buy in large developments. 
 But last August, when the developer put the 5,000-square-foot penthouse back on the market, there was apparently a meeting of the minds. Mr. Sanger, the managing partner of GeoSphere Capital Management and an expert on energy markets, dropped his lawsuit and closed on the apartment. 
 The final price, according to city records, was $11.98 million, significantly below the $12.5 million Mr. Sanger agreed to pay in 2007, when the market was hot and the asking price was $14 million.
 With the fear of economic collapse fading, and the real estate market showing signs of perkiness, developers and reluctant buyers have begun settling more of their differences while their disputes wend their way through the courts and the attorney general's office, lawyers and brokers say. 
 Typically when deals are struck, the fine points are cloaked in confidentiality agreements at the request of developers, who don't want other buyers to think they are a soft touch. Mr. Wilf would not discuss the details of the settlement, but said in a statement, ''I wanted him in the building and I did what I had to do to close the deal.''
 The Related Companies, the developer of the Time Warner Center and other major projects, has made a point of insisting that it has not made any deals. But even Related was said to have been close to settling with several buyers of large apartments at the Brompton, a new building designed by Robert A. M. Stern at Third Avenue and 85th Street, according to brokers familiar with the building. 
 Negotiations at the Brompton got under way after a lawyer for several buyers, Adam Leitman Bailey, made a claim in federal court in Manhattan, also citing the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, that if upheld, could allow buyers in many Manhattan developments to get their deposits back.
 Among the buyers said to have reached an agreement in principle at the Brompton was Alex Shnaider, a Canadian steel magnate with large investments in Eastern Europe. He had agreed to buy four penthouses for $25.8 million in 2007. Settlement talks, which were to have included a confidentiality clause, were halted last week, according to several people familiar with the deal.
 Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Related, said in a statement that two-thirds of the 193 apartments in the 22-story building had already closed, ''all at original contract price with no concessions.'' 
 But company officials have acknowledged that there have been ''feelers'' out among the litigants, and others briefed on the discussions said that the latest negotiations became stalled when the company learned that a reporter had asked about them. 
 The claim pending in federal court relies on a provision of a federal law that allows a buyer in a large project to back out of a contract within two years unless it includes a legal description of the lot ''in a form acceptable for recording.'' 
 In New York City, individual condominium units are recorded in property records by lot numbers that are not assigned until the building is nearly finished, long after many contracts are signed. This makes it all but impossible for developers to comply with the plain meaning of the law.
 But during the boom years, when apartment prices were rising month by month, and buyers could flip at a profit, no one worried much about the fine print. Lawyers for condominium developers said they believed that contracts providing buyers with the lot number for the entire building, rather than the individual condo, would satisfy the requirement.
 The dispute at the Brompton has become unusually acrimonious. Ms. Rose said that Mr. Bailey had exaggerated the number of clients he had, and that out of 12 clients, 5 closed at ''full contract price,'' 4 surrendered their deposits, and 3 were still fighting the developer.
 After the breakdown in talks, Mr. Bailey accused Related of trying to delay in order to keep other buyers from learning about the issues he had raised. In a statement, he said that six clients were still fighting the Brompton, and that others had received concessions. He refused to discuss the negotiations.

HEADLINE: Yankees Promised a Park; Children Got Bus Rides

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Here are the final days of October. The new Yankee Stadium rocks with thrilling games. The Bronx kids who lost their parks for that new stadium travel the city for places to play.
 ''The Yankees gave us a bus -- actually, they gave us $37,500 for a bus,'' said Paul Krebbs, the president of All Hallows High School, just up the block from the stadium. ''So now we can travel to Staten Island for our home games.''
 Yankee Stadium is a kind of marker of civic values, and the end of the season is a good time to measure how those values have evolved. But it won't be easy. More than most sports, professional baseball is marinated in the cheap liquor of nostalgia. People get drunk on it and lose their judgment. So this history cannot walk a straight line. 
 As mayor, one of Rudolph W. Giuliani's jobs was to serve as landlord for the Yankees. Mr. Giuliani, who made his name as a corruption buster, was able to buy four World Series rings from the Yankees for about $16,000 -- which might well be less than a fifth of their retail value. Who knows if he has bells on his toes to go with the rings on his fingers, but Mr. Giuliani promised the team a sweet deal on a new ballpark.
 Then Michael R. Bloomberg became mayor and canceled the Giuliani arrangements. ''Everybody understands that given the lack of housing, given the lack of school space, given the deficit in the operating budget, it is just not practical this year to go and build stadiums,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in 2002. ''You have to set priorities, and the priorities this year do not allow for the construction of sporting stadiums.''
 That moment passed. The Bloomberg administration proceeded to negotiate a new deal -- turning over parkland for 40 years with no rent and no taxes, rebuilding streets and roads and a commuter rail station and letting the team use the city's tax-free bonding capacity.
 For a while, Mr. Bloomberg's aides haggled with the Yankees to get a luxury suite for the city. Now, it should be noted that the luxury suite consisted of 12 seats, so to say that it was for ''the city'' falls a bit short of being strictly accurate. The suite would have been for someone, but not ''the city,'' if that in any way means ordinary citizens. 
 In exchange for the suite, ''the city'' -- meaning, in this case, the public -- would allow the team an additional 250 parking spaces and three new billboards.
 This deal nearly fell apart when ''the city'' -- well, Mr. Bloomberg's aides -- demanded that the luxury suite also be stocked with free food, like other suites, where the food is free as long as you pay the $600,000 annual rental. 
 The Yankees gnashed their teeth. 
 ''It's really ridiculous, but it sticks like a bone in everyone's craw,'' a Yankee negotiator wrote to the city economic development officials. ''It's a little unseemly to require 'free' food.'' 
 What this meant, in plain Yiddish, was: Don't shnorr the small stuff.
 The shnorring -- begging with chutzpah -- took place in e-mail messages that were unearthed by Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic assemblyman from Westchester. Once they were made public, the Bloomberg administration said it was changing its administrative mind.
 It -- meaning, presumably, Mr. Bloomberg, who could buy the entire stadium and team out of his pocket -- did not really want the 12-seat luxury suite with the chicken wings. Instead, the Yankees should rent the suite on the commercial market, and the city should get the proceeds. Some of them, anyway: $100,000 is all that is guaranteed. The team is allowed to deduct marketing costs after paying that minimum.
 It turns out that so far, not a penny in rentals from this season has been turned over for the city's suite because it is not due until June, a spokesman for the mayor said Friday. So the actual value to the city is not yet known.
 THERE are other, higher stakes. The new stadium sits on what had been city parkland that had been used by generations of schools, neighborhood teams and lone athletes. 
 The lost parks are being replaced by a group of handsome new ones, but that process is now expected to last until the end of 2011. This is no fault of the Department of Parks and Recreation, but the trailing consequence of decisions made by the city -- that would be Mr. Bloomberg's economic development team -- to first shut down a public park so a profitable private company could build a stadium, and only then get around to replacing the lost park. 
 In the meantime, portions of the replacement parks are starting to open; they appear to be the first traces of what will be vibrant spaces, creatively designed. 
 When they are done, they will be a beautiful sight. But when they are done, the 14-year old kids who lost their parks in 2006 will be 19. That straight line doesn't bend.

HEADLINE: Adding Powerful Talent, Top Teams Flex Muscles

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
Money does not always buy happiness or success in the N.B.A., but the right transaction can occasionally deliver a slice of nirvana.
 On June 23, Richard Jefferson, a standout forward who averaged 19.6 points last season, was traded from Milwaukee to San Antonio for a package of nominal players. The Bucks' decision was mostly financial -- they had to shed Jefferson's $14.2 million salary to avoid paying the luxury tax. The Spurs' decision was purely competitive -- they needed Jefferson's talents to help win a championship.
 When the accounting was complete, Jefferson found himself surrounded by All-Stars and championship rings, nestled in a lineup featuring Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.
 ''Basketball heaven,'' Jefferson said after practice last week in San Antonio. 
 The deal energized Jefferson and instantly revitalized the Spurs dynasty, which had grown creaky. It served as another stinging setback for the Bucks. And it symbolized a potentially troubling new trend for the N.B.A., which opens its season Tuesday night.
 This is the year the rich got richer, while nearly everyone else gave up. Six elite teams, all recent finals contenders, added top talent this summer:
 The Los Angeles Lakers, just weeks after winning the championship, signed Ron Artest, one of the fiercest two-way players in the league.
 The Orlando Magic, winner of the Eastern Conference, acquired Vince Carter, a dynamic shooting guard, from the Nets.
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, who made the Eastern Conference finals, acquired Shaquille O'Neal, an almost certain Hall of Famer, from Phoenix.
 The Boston Celtics, who won the championship in 2008, signed Rasheed Wallace, who at 35 remains a superior defender and versatile scorer.
 The Dallas Mavericks, who made the finals in 2007, acquired Shawn Marion, a four-time All-Star and multidimensional forward, from Toronto.
 Having obtained Jefferson, the Spurs then signed Antonio McDyess, Keith Bogans and Theo Ratliff, giving them a fantastically deep bench.
 None of those teams gave up much. O'Neal, Carter and Jefferson were acquired for spare parts, from teams that were solely looking to cut payroll. Artest and Wallace signed below-market contracts.
 Team executives said they could not recall a summer quite like this, as every elite team added elite talent. ''I don't think it's good,'' an Eastern Conference executive said. ''The league has to look at it, because there's not parity.''
 The executive asked for anonymity because the N.B.A. and its players were engaged in labor negotiations. Teams are subject to heavy fines for speaking publicly on anything that affects the process.
 No one doubts the significance of the trend, the Spurs included. ''I think it's something that the powers that be in the league have noticed,'' said Gregg Popovich, the Spurs' coach and team president. 
 The most important statistic this season may not be shooting efficiency or rebounding rate but payroll size. Fourteen teams are on pace to exceed the luxury-tax threshold of $69.9 million. Eleven were playoff teams last season. Six of the eight highest payrolls belong to the Lakers, Mavericks, Spurs, Magic, Cavaliers and Celtics -- and all are at least $10 million over the threshold. The Utah Jazz and Knicks are the other teams in the bracket. Among the bottom 10 teams in payroll, only one -- the Portland Trail Blazers -- had a winning record last season.
 Stratification of the classes has long been a problem in Major League Baseball, but it's a relatively new concern for the N.B.A., whose entire system is set up to promote parity.
 The league has a salary cap and a luxury tax and dozens of other mechanisms to distribute talent and contain spending. The best teams draft low and rarely have cap room. In a normal year, the best teams fill in around the edges with low-cost free agents and hope their core unit holds up.
 But these are abnormal times. The recession has forced many teams, in markets large and small, to cut payroll. Several other franchises are hording cap space for the free agent class of 2010. The result is a market where saving has trumped spending.
 The Suns gave up O'Neal, a future Hall of Famer, for the cap-friendly contracts of Ben Wallace and Sasha Pavlovic, then waived both players. The Bucks swapped Jefferson for three aging role players and kept only one, 37-year-old Kurt Thomas. Milwaukee let two other starters, Ramon Sessions and Charlie Villanueva, leave as free agents.
 ''I'm aware of what you're seeing, and we see it,'' Commissioner David Stern said, while playing down the trend as temporary. ''There are movements season to season, and we have a suspicion that there will be a countercyclical movement to that in the coming season.''
 Nevertheless, Stern acknowledged the issue was certain to be discussed in collective bargaining negotiations, which are in the early stages.
 The Spurs are a fascinating, and revealing, case study. They are renowned as smart spenders, winning four titles since 1999 with a payroll that generally fell in the middle of the pack. They have exceeded the tax threshold three times, but by less than $1 million in each case. The Spurs built a dynasty by surrounding their stars with low-wage role players.
 But the model no longer seemed viable after the Spurs -- with injuries to Duncan and Ginobili -- lost in the first round last spring. Team officials faced the realization that, even healthy, they no longer had enough talent to contend.
 The Lakers have five legitimate stars: Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Andrew Bynum and Artest. The Celtics have five: Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and Wallace. The Cavaliers have two megastars, O'Neal and LeBron James, and an All-Star guard, Mo Williams. The Magic has Dwight Howard, Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson and Carter. The Mavericks have Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Josh Howard and Marion.
 The trend perhaps began two seasons ago, when the Celtics obtained Garnett and Allen and the Lakers obtained Gasol. All were acquired in financially driven transactions. ''All of a sudden, you couldn't compete with two or three significant players anymore,'' said R. C. Buford, the Spurs' general manager. ''You had to have a roster with at least four very significant players to even be competitive.''
 Duncan is 33, and the franchise is determined to maximize his remaining years as an elite player. So the conservative Spurs joined the arms race. 
 ''It's out of character for us,'' Duncan said. ''But what is in character is them wanting to put a team together that's going to have a chance to win.''
 So Jefferson became a Spur, Shaq joined LeBron, Vince joined Dwight, and the gap between the talent-rich and the talent-poor grew into a grand canyon, almost overnight.
 There are a few teams with great talent and more moderate payrolls: Portland, Atlanta and Denver. ''But when you talk championship or bust, there's only those five elite teams,'' the ESPN commentator Jalen Rose said in reference to the Lakers, the Spurs, the Cavaliers, the Celtics and the Magic.
 Is it a sign of things to come? A dangerous trend? Perhaps not. The Spurs, like the Magic and Cavaliers, are a small-market team. Popovich is the first to say that the new model is not sustainable.
 ''I don't know if it's a problem for the league,'' he said, ''but I think for a certain number of teams it's going to be a flash in the pan.''
 In the meantime, Jefferson will enjoy his little slice of heaven and go to sleep dreaming of championship rallies on the Riverwalk.

HEADLINE: Recession Drives Surge in Youth Runaways

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: MEDFORD, Ore. 

 BODY:
Dressed in soaked green pajamas, Betty Snyder, 14, huddled under a cold drizzle at the city park as several older boys decided what to do with her. 
 Betty said she had run away from home a week earlier after a violent argument with her mother. Shivering and sullen-faced, she vowed that she was not going to sleep by herself again behind the hedges downtown, where older homeless men and methamphetamine addicts might find her. 
 The boys were also runaways. But unlike them, Betty said, she had been reported missing to the police. That meant that if the boys let her stay overnight in their hidden tent encampment by the freeway, they risked being arrested for harboring a fugitive.
 ''We keep running into this,'' said one of the boys, Clinton Anchors, 18. Over the past year, he said, he and five other teenagers living together on the streets had taken under their wings no fewer than 20 children -- some as young as 12 -- and taught them how to avoid predators and the police, survive the cold and find food. 
 ''We always first try to send them home,'' said Clinton, who himself ran away from home at 12. ''But a lot of times they won't go, because things are really bad there. We basically become their new family.'' 
 Over the past two years, government officials and experts have seen an increasing number of children leave home for life on the streets, including many under 13. Foreclosures, layoffs, rising food and fuel prices and inadequate supplies of low-cost housing have stretched families to the extreme, and those pressures have trickled down to teenagers and preteens.
 Federal studies and experts in the field have estimated that at least 1.6 million juveniles run away or are thrown out of their homes annually. But most of those return home within a week, and the government does not conduct a comprehensive or current count. 
 The best measure of the problem may be the number of contacts with runaways that federally-financed outreach programs make, which rose to 761,000 in 2008 from 550,000 in 2002, when current methods of counting began. (The number fell in 2007, but rose sharply again last year, and the number of federal outreach programs has been fairly steady throughout the period.) 
 Too young to get a hotel room, sign a lease or in many cases hold a job, young runaways are increasingly surviving by selling drugs, panhandling or engaging in prostitution, according to the National Runaway Switchboard, the federally-financed national hot line created in 1974. Legitimate employment was hard to find in the summer of 2009; the Labor Department said fewer than 30 percent of teenagers had jobs. 
 In more than 50 interviews over 11 months, teenagers living on their own in eight states told of a harrowing existence that in many cases involved sleeping in abandoned buildings, couch-surfing among friends and relatives or camping on riverbanks and in parks after fleeing or being kicked out by families in financial crisis. 
 The runaways spend much of their time avoiding the authorities because they assume the officials are trying to send them home. But most often the police are not looking for them as missing-person cases at all, just responding to complaints about loitering or menacing. In fact, federal data indicate that usually no one is looking for the runaways, either because parents have not reported them missing or the police have mishandled the reports.
 In Adrian, Mich., near Detroit, a 16-year-old boy was secretly living alone in his mother's apartment, though all the utilities had been turned off after she was arrested and jailed for violating her parole by bouncing a check at a grocery store. 
 In Huntington, W.Va., Steven White, 15, said that after casing a 24-hour Wal-Mart to see what time each night the cleaning crew finished its rounds, he began sleeping in a store restroom.
 ''You're basically on the lam,'' said Steven, who said he had left home because of physical abuse that increased after his father lost his job this year. ''But you're a kid, so it's pretty hard to hide.''
 Between Legal and Illegal
 Survival on the streets of Medford, a city of 76,000 in southwest Oregon, requires runaways to walk a fine line between legal and illegal activity, as a few days with a group of them showed. Even as they sought help from social service organizations, they guarded their freedom jealously.
 Petulant and street savvy, they were children nonetheless. One girl said she used a butter knife and a library card to break into vacant houses. But after she began living in one of them, she ate dry cereal for dinner for weeks because she did not realize that she could use the microwave to boil water for Ramen noodles. Another girl was childlike enough to suck her thumb, but dangerous enough to carry a switchblade. 
 They camped in restricted areas, occasionally shoplifted and regularly smoked marijuana. But they stayed away from harder drugs or drug dealing, and the older teenagers fiercely protected the younger runaways from sexual or other physical threats.
 In waking hours, members of the group split their time among a park, a pool hall and a video-game arcade, sharing cigarettes. When in need, they sometimes barter: a sleeveless jacket for a blanket, peanut butter for extra lighter fluid to start campfires on soggy nights. 
 Betty Snyder, the newcomer in the park, said she had bitten her mother in a recent fight. She said she often refused to do household chores, which prompted heated arguments. 
 ''I'm just tired of it all, and I don't want to be in my house anymore,'' she said, explaining why she had run away. ''One month there is money, and the next month there is none. One day, she is taking it out on me and hitting me, and the next day she is ignoring me. It's more stable out here.''
 Members of the group said they sometimes made money by picking parking meters or sitting in front of parking lots, pretending to be the attendant after the real one leaves. When things get really desperate, they said, they climb into public fountains to fish out coins late at night. On cold nights, they hide in public libraries or schools after closing time to sleep.
 Many of the runaways said they had fled family conflicts or the strain of their parents' alcohol or drug abuse. Others said they left simply because they did not want to go to school or live by their parents' rules.
 ''I can survive fine out here,'' Betty said as she brandished a switchblade she pulled from her dirty sweatshirt pocket. At a nearby picnic table was part of the world she and the others were trying to avoid: a man with swastikas tattooed on his neck and an older homeless woman with rotted teeth, holding a pit bull named Diablo.
 But Betty and another 14-year-old, seeming not to notice, went off to play on a park swing.
 Around the country, outreach workers and city officials say they have been overwhelmed with requests for help from young people in desperate straits.
 In Berks County, Pa., the shortage of beds for runaways has led county officials to consider paying stipends to families willing to offer their couches. At drop-in centers across the country, social workers describe how runaways regularly line up when they know the food pantry is being restocked. 
 In Chicago, city transit workers will soon be trained to help the runaways and other young people they have been finding in increasing numbers, trying to escape the cold or heat by riding endlessly on buses and trains. 
 ''Several times a month we're seeing kids being left by parents who say they can't afford them anymore,'' said Mary Ferrell, director of the Maslow Project, a resource center for homeless children and families in Medford. With fewer jobs available, teenagers are less able to help their families financially. Relatives and family friends are less likely to take them in. 
 While federal officials say homelessness over all is expected to rise 10 percent to 20 percent this year, a federal survey of schools showed a 40 percent increase in the number of juveniles living on their own last year, more than double the number in 2003. 
 At the same time, however, many financially troubled states began sharply cutting social services last year. Though President Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package includes $1.5 billion to address the problem of homelessness, state officials and youth advocates say that almost all of that money will go toward homeless families, not unaccompanied youths.
 ''As a society, we can pay a dollar to deal with these kids when they first run away, or 20 times that in a matter of years when they become the adult homeless or incarcerated population,'' said Barbara Duffield, policy director for the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth.
 'You Traveling Alone?'
 Maureen Blaha, executive director of the National Runaway Switchboard, said that while most runaways, like those in Medford, opt to stay in their hometowns, some venture farther away and face greater dangers. The farther they get from home and the longer they stay out, the less money they have and the more likely they are to take risks with people they have just met, Ms. Blaha said.
 ''A lot of small-town kids figure they can go to Chicago, San Francisco or New York because they can disappear there,'' she said.
 Martin Jaycard, a Port Authority police officer in New York, sees himself as a last line of defense in preventing that from happening. 
 Dressed in scraggly blue jeans and an untucked open-collar shirt, Officer Jaycard, a seven-year police veteran, is part of the Port Authority's Youth Services Unit. His job is to catch runaways as they pass through the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the nation's busiest. 
 ''You're the last person these kids want to see,'' he said, estimating that his three-officer unit stops at least one runaway a day at the terminal.
 Pausing to look at a girl waiting for a bus to Salt Lake City, Officer Jaycard noticed a nervous look on her face and the overstuffed suitcases that hinted more at a life change than a brief stay.
 ''Hey, how's it going?'' he said to the girl, gently, as he pulled a badge hanging around his neck from under his shirt. ''You traveling alone?''
 ''Yes,'' she replied, without a glimmer of nervousness. ''I'm 18,'' she quickly added before being asked. 
 But the girl carried no identification. The only phone number she could produce for someone who could verify her age was disconnected. And after noticing that the last name she gave was different from the one on her bags, the officer took her upstairs to the police station. 
 When she arrived, she burst into tears. 
 ''Please, I'm begging you not to send me home,'' she pleaded as she sobbed into her hands. While listening, Officer Jaycard and the social worker on duty began contacting city officials to investigate her situation, and found her a place at a city shelter. ''You have no idea what my father will do to me for having tried to run away,'' she said, describing severe beatings at home and threats to kill her if she ever tried to leave.
 The girl turned out to be 14 years old, from Queens. Shaking her head in frustration, she added, ''I should have just waited outside the terminal and no one would have known I was missing.''
 In all likelihood, she was right.
 Invisible Names
 Lacking the training or the expertise to spot runaways, most police officers would not have stopped the girl waiting for the bus. Even if they had, her name probably would not have been listed in the federal database called the National Crime Information Center, or N.C.I.C., which among other things tracks missing people. 
 Federal statistics indicate that in more than three-quarters of runaway cases, parents or caretakers have not reported the child missing, often because they are angry about a fight or would simply prefer to see a problem child leave the house. Experts say some parents fear that involving the police will get them or their children into trouble or put their custody at risk. 
 And in 16 percent of cases, the local police failed to enter the information into the federal database, as required under federal law, according to a review of federal data by The New York Times. 
 Among the 61,452 names that were reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children from January 2004 to January 2009, there were about 9,625 instances involving children whose missing-persons reports were not entered into the N.C.I.C., according to the review by The Times. If the names are not in the national database, then only local police agencies know whom to look for.
 Police officials give various reasons for not entering the data. The software is old and cumbersome, they say, or they have limited resources and need to prioritize their time. In many cases, the police said, they do not take runaway reports as seriously as abductions, in part because runaways are often fleeing family problems. The police also say that entering every report into the federal database could make a city's situation appear to be more of a problem than it is.
 But in 267 of the cases around the nation for which the police did not enter a report into the database, the children remain missing. In 58, they were found dead.
 ''If no one knows they're gone, who is going to look for them?'' said Tray Williams, a spokesman for the Louisiana Office of Child Services, whose job it was to take care of 17-year-old Cleveland Randall. 
 On Feb. 6, Cleveland ran away from his foster care center in New Orleans and took a bus to Mississippi. His social workers reported him missing, but the New Orleans police failed to enter the report into the N.C.I.C. Ten days later, Cleveland was found shot to death in Avondale, La. 
 ''These kids might as well be invisible if they aren't in N.C.I.C.,'' said Ernie Allen, the director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
 Paradise by Interstate 5
 Invisibility, many of the runaways in Medford say, is just what they want. 
 By midnight, the group decided it was late enough for them to leave the pool hall and to move around the city discreetly. So they went their separate ways.
 Alex Molnar, 18, took the back alleys to a 24-hour laundry to sleep under the folding tables. If people were still using the machines, he planned on locking himself in the restroom, placing a sign on the front saying ''Out of Service.'' 
 On the other side of the city, Alex Hughes, 16, took side streets to a secret clearing along Interstate 5. 
 On colder nights, he and Clinton Anchors have built a fire in a long shallow trench, eventually covering it with dirt to create a heated mound where they could put their blankets. 
 Building a lean-to with a tarp and sticks, Clinton lifted his voice above the roar of the tractor-trailers barreling by just feet away. He said they called the spot ''paradise'' because the police rarely checked for them there. 
 ''Even if they do, Betty is not with us, so that's good,'' he added, explaining that she had found a friend willing to lend her couch for the night. ''One less thing to worry about.''

 Accounts
 The Quaker Oats Company, Chicago, a division of PepsiCo, consolidated the creative assignment for its North American food and snack brands at Juniper Park, Toronto, an affiliate of BBDO Worldwide and a unit of the Omnicom Group. Quaker spends more than $100 million each year to advertise those brands. Juniper Park, which has created campaigns for Quaker products like Rice-A-Roni, adds the creative duties for brands like Quaker Oats, Cap'n Crunch and Life cereals and Quaker Chewy granola bars. Those brands had been handled by another Omnicom agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, San Francisco, which also created an umbrella campaign for Quaker oat-based products carrying the theme ''Go humans go''; the consolidation ends the Quaker relationship with Goodby, Silverstein. Asked if the consolidation would also end the umbrella campaign, Hilary Crnkovich, a spokeswoman for Quaker, said the company would decline to comment ''on the future creative direction for Quaker except to say our 2010 efforts will further bring to life the expression of Quaker as a leadership health and wellness brand.'' In addition to its Quaker assignments, Juniper Park works for the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo, creating ads for Lay's potato chips and SunChips. 
 Yahoo, Sunnyvale, Calif., expanded its agency roster by shifting the duties for its creative account in the United States to Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. Spending was estimated at $50 million. Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, New York, part of WPP, which had handled the assignment, continues to create campaigns for Yahoo that run in international markets and remains the Yahoo agency of record. The decision came soon after Yahoo introduced a worldwide campaign by Ogilvy, which carries the theme ''It's you''; Yahoo executives said they were pleased with the campaign and the decision to hire Goodby, Silverstein was not meant to be a repudiation or reassessment of the work.
 Best Western International, Phoenix, chose Gotham, New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as North American agency of record. The assignment, with spending estimated at $45 million to $50 million, had been handled by ISM, Boston. 
 Sargento Foods, Plymouth, Wis., named Grey New York -- the flagship office of the Grey unit of the Grey Group, part of WPP -- as agency of record for its shredded, sliced and snack cheeses and other products. The assignment, with billings estimated at $18 million, had been handled by Jacobson Rost, Sheboygan, Wis.
 People
 Shelley Brown, director for strategic planning and a managing director at Zig, Toronto, part of MDC Partners, was promoted to president. She assumes the post from Andy Macaulay, who continues as chief executive and takes on the new post of chairman. Subtej Nijjar, director for digital planning, succeeds Ms. Brown as director for strategic planning.
 Mark Modesto, president at the Chicago office of Draft FCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, was promoted to a new post, president for North American operations. 
 Miscellany
 Sales of promotional products fell 10.9 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to the Advertising Specialty Institute, Trevose, Pa. It was the fifth quarter in a row for decreases, which began in the third quarter of 2008. However, the decline was less than that for the second quarter, 13.9 percent, and the first quarter, 18 percent.
 CBS, New York, part of the CBS Corporation, signed another advertiser for Super Bowl XLIV, to be broadcast on Feb. 7. HomeAway, Austin, Tex., a vacation rental service, will run a commercial during the game to be created by Publicis in the West, Seattle, part of the Publicis Worldwide unit of the Publicis Groupe. CBS has been having more success in selling spots during the game than some analysts had expected given the state of the economy; among other sponsors announced so far are the Anheuser-Busch unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bridgestone, CareerBuilder, Coca-Cola, GoDaddy, Hyundai Motor and PepsiCo.

PERSON: Richard T. Whitcomb 

HEADLINE: Richard T. Whitcomb Is Dead at 88; Revolutionized the Design of Jet Aircraft

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Richard T. Whitcomb, whose understanding of the way air rips around an airplane as it approaches the sound barrier revolutionized the way jets are shaped, allowing them to fly faster on less fuel, died Oct. 13 in Newport News, Va. He was 88 and lived in Hampton, Va.
 The cause was pneumonia, his nephew David Whitcomb said. 
 Testing his ideas in supersonic wind tunnels, Mr. Whitcomb came up with three design changes that solved problems that had confounded his fellow aviation engineers. One enabled combat jets that had been built to break the sound barrier, at about 740 miles an hour, depending on temperature and atmospheric pressure, to actually do so. 
 Mr. Whitcomb did his work while he was a researcher at the Langley Memorial Aerodynamic Laboratory in Hampton Roads, Va. 
 The laboratory, now a division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was run by a NASA predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, when Mr. Whitcomb started working there in 1943. He retired in 1980.
 ''Richard Whitcomb was arguably the most influential aeronautical engineer/researcher of the jet age,'' the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum said in a statement. 
 The museum's senior curator of aeronautics, Dr. Tom Crouch, said in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Whitcomb's ''intellectual fingerprints are to be found on virtually every major high-speed commercial and military aircraft flying today.''
 All three of Mr. Whitcomb's innovations succeeded in reducing the air drag that slams a jet -- much as snow piles up in front of a too-eager snowplow -- when it approaches the speed of sound. 
 His first breakthrough, made in 1951 but kept secret for military security reasons until 1955, is known by several nicknames: the ''Coke bottle,'' the ''Marilyn Monroe'' or the ''wasp waist'' design, because it calls for a sloping indent in the plane's fuselage where the wings are attached. More scientifically, it is known as the ''area rule.'' 
 Dr. Crouch explained that the ideal shape for an aircraft to surpass the speed of sound ''is something like a 50-caliber bullet.'' But the wings create drag, and the Air Force needed jets that could maneuver, even in dogfights, at the highest possible speeds. 
 ''When they first built the F-102 jet fighter, it was designed as a supersonic interceptor, but they couldn't get it through the speed of sound,'' Dr. Crouch said. ''Whitcomb came up with the area rule: If you pull in the fuselage, make it 'wasp waist' near the wings, you reduce the drag.''
 The new design increased the speed of supersonic warplanes by up to 25 percent without any increase in engine power. A plane capable of 800 miles per hour with the conventional straight-line fuselage jumped to 1,000 m.p.h. when its fuselage was indented.
 In the early 1970s, Mr. Whitcomb came up with another breakthrough. The supercritical wing, as it is called, was far less curved on top than the conventional wing -- indeed, it was almost flat -- and curved on the underside at the rear. It, too, greatly improved operating economies of high-speed planes by enabling them to fly as much as 100 miles per hour faster without any increase in engine power. 
 The supercritical wing is now part of the design of nearly every commercial airliner and has saved billions of dollars in fuel costs and flying time.
 Later in the 1970s, Mr. Whitcomb introduced winglets -- small, inclined panels that are attached to the tips of wings and reduce drag. They increase fuel efficiency by as much as 6 percent to 7 percent.
 ''It's intuitive,'' Mr. Whitcomb once said, according to the National Air and Space Museum statement. ''I didn't run a lot of tests to arrive at an idea, and I didn't run a lot of mathematical calculations. I'd just sit there and think about what the air was doing, based on flow studies in the wind tunnel.''
 His intuitions, he said, first came to him when he was a boy making model planes.
 Richard Travis Whitcomb was born in Evanston, Ill., on Feb. 21, 1921, one of three children of Frederick and Gladys Travis Whitcomb. His father, an engineer, had flown balloons in World War I. After the family moved to Worcester, Mass., Richard virtually took over the basement to build model planes. 
 ''He concentrated exclusively on airplanes that would fly, not merely mantel decorations,'' The New York Times wrote of Mr. Whitcomb in 1955. ''In the process, he developed a method for doubling the power ordinarily obtained from rubber bands used to turn the propellers.''
 Mr. Whitcomb graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1943 and was soon working at the Langley laboratory. He never married, and he spent many nights sleeping on a cot at the lab, his nephew David said. 
 ''More than once, the accounting department had to come down and yell at him for not cashing his paychecks,'' David Whitcomb said. ''He would use them for book marks.''
 He did accept awards, among them the Collier Trophy in 1955 for the most significant aeronautical advance of the year and the National Medal of Science in 1973.
 Besides David Whitcomb, Mr. Whitcomb's survivors include a sister, Marian Conley; a brother, Charles; and a step-brother, Kenneth. 
 ''There's been a continual drive in me ever since I was a teenager to find a better way to do everything,'' Mr. Whitcomb told The Washington Post in 1969. ''If a human mind can figure out a better way to do something, let's do it. I can't just sit around. I have to think.''
 He never learned to fly.

HEADLINE: Need Medical Care? Check Out the Menu

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Imagine a restaurant with no prices on the menu. Or, better yet, no menu at all. The name of the place is ''Food'' or ''Eat Here,'' which is the only clue about what is sold inside. The chef decides what to cook, and what to charge. 
 Do you sit? 
 For American hospital patients, that is often how it works. Only it is less rational. Prices can vary wildly for the same treatment at hospitals within walking distance of each other. Even in the same hospital, different patients pay different prices for the same care. 
 Tucked away on Page 251 of the Senate Finance Committee's 1,502-page health care bill is a remarkable provision that for the first time would require all hospitals to establish a menu, a list of ''standard charges for items and services.'' 
 At the core of the debate over how to fix the health system is a basic problem: Care is too expensive. And at the core of that problem is another: The people who buy medical treatment often have no idea what it actually costs, and often do not care, because it is covered by insurance. 
 The provision on Page 251 is intended to start addressing those problems. What is remarkable, though, is not that hospitals will have to publish their prices, but that researchers think it will do little good and might only highlight the inability of Congress to lower costs. 
 ''Very little focus has been on the cost of the actual medical care as opposed to the insurance,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a private group that tracks costs. 
 How much patients would pay is a focus of the argument in the House over two versions of a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers. 
 The ''robust'' public option favored by liberals, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, would generally tie payments for doctors, hospitals and other providers to Medicare -- setting them at roughly 105 percent of regular Medicare rates. 
 Ms. Pelosi so far has fallen short in her effort to win the votes needed for the robust public option. Instead, she may have to fall back on the alternate ''level playing field'' approach, which would require the public plan to negotiate rates with providers. 
 Experts like Mr. Ginsburg, and nonpartisan analysts like the Congressional Budget Office, say a public plan that negotiates rates will have limited ability to cut costs for consumers. Private insurers negotiate rates now, and prices still skyrocket. 
 ''This actually is a big difference,'' Mr. Ginsburg said of the two options in the House. ''I am very skeptical that much could be accomplished by negotiation.''
 Supporters of a level playing field option argue that Medicare rates are too low, especially in many rural states. They warn that hospitals will lose money, and that more doctors will elect not to accept Medicare, removing choices for patients. 
 Because of such views, the robust public option has been ruled out in the Senate.
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and an author of health care legislation, has said that he would never vote for a public plan tied to Medicare rates. ''It would devastate the hospitals in my state,'' Mr. Conrad has said. 
 Others disagree, and say the effort to protect doctors and hospitals in their own states and districts shows that even the strongest advocates for curtailing health costs nationally often lack the will to impose cuts at home. 
 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent agency that advises Congress on changes in payments and closely tracks the effect of rates on health care providers, has said that Medicare rates are generally set at the right levels. 
 ''A key question is whether Medicare payments are adequate to cover the costs of efficient providers,'' the agency wrote in a report in March. The commission's study of a number of well-performing, cost-efficient hospitals ''found that Medicare payments, on average, roughly equaled their Medicare costs.''
 Even a public plan using Medicare-based rates might not do much to lower overall health costs because it would be offered to relatively few people, mostly those who now do not have coverage. 
 Among the reasons that costs have risen steeply in recent years, health economists say, is that hospitals have joined forces and doctors have formed large practice groups, giving them added leverage to demand higher prices from private insurers.
 In addition, the insurers have faced pressure from consumers who rebelled against managed care and demanded more choices of hospitals and doctors. 
 Simply requiring hospitals to post a menu of services and prices seems unlikely to help drive down costs. California, for instance, has forced hospitals to publish their prices since 2005. Health care costs, however, have continued to rise in the state. 
 The lists of services tend to be indecipherable to consumers, and the prices typically bear little or no relation to what insurers end up paying or even what patients would pay on their own. 
 Also, showing customers a price list without giving them data on the quality of services seems unlikely to encourage value-shopping.
 Although data often shows that cheaper, more efficient health care providers can obtain better outcomes for patients, that concept seems to fly in the face of the all-American ethos of ''you get what you pay for.'' 
 ''People tend to assume that things with lower prices are not as good,'' Mr. Ginsburg said.

HEADLINE: The Economic Bomb That Didn't Drop

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Nearly every day this year, as for the past generation, Washington has rattled with the sound of partisan gunfire.
 Democrats snipe at Republicans for obstructing their plans on health care, energy and Wall Street regulation.
 Republicans criticize Democrats for big government, overspending and high unemployment.
 But Neel T. Kashkari, who served both sides as a top Treasury Department official, hears something different: the quiet of the economic bomb that did not drop. 
 It did not drop, in his view, because the leaders of America's rival political armies ceased firing long enough a year ago to pass the $700 billion bailout that prevented Wall Street from imploding. They included President George W. Bush and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the liberal Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and the conservative Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain. 
 ''As bad as it is today, it could have been so much worse,'' Mr. Kashkari said in an interview. ''If the financial system had collapsed,'' businesses on Wall Street and Main Street alike ''wouldn't have been able to access funds to pay their employees, who then wouldn't have money to pay their bills. It would have cascaded through our economy.''
 It was ''one of the worst times in our country's history,'' he said. ''But it was in many ways the best time, watching all these people come together to put out the fire.''
 Small Consolation
 That bipartisan achievement has become so clouded by public discontent that few politicians embrace it. With unemployment hovering around 10 percent, Americans find little consolation in the possibility that the rate might have reached twice that level, or higher.
 But Mr. Kashkari, a 36-year-old Republican, has a different vantage point from the seclusion of the mountain cabin in California where he has spent recent months after running the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, for the Treasury. He has chopped wood to decompress from the whirlwind; he decided against writing a book after former Vice President Dick Cheney advised that could complicate his chances of returning to government, which Mr. Kashkari hopes to do someday.
 A onetime engineer turned Goldman Sachs executive, Mr. Kashkari never had strong partisan instincts. Instead, following his boss Henry M. Paulson Jr. to Mr. Bush's Treasury, he took along Wall Street's disdain for the culture of Washington.
 As the crisis in an over-leveraged financial system crested last year, that skepticism led him to question the wisdom of seeking bailout money from Congress; he feared that lawmakers would say no and trigger a catastrophic loss of confidence. But lawmakers surprised him, as did the civil servants at Treasury and the Federal Reserve that he calls ''patriots'' for their frantic efforts to avert disaster.
 Mr. Kashkari himself become a target over Treasury's shifting TARP strategy; one Democratic House member wondered aloud at a hearing whether he was ''a chump.'' He acknowledges Treasury's failures in underestimating dangers to the economy and communicating about its policy response.
 But in the signs of turnaround that President Obama now points to, Mr. Kashkari sees evidence that those policies have worked. In Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary and former president of the New York Fed, central players that Mr. Kashkari and Mr. Paulson teamed up with remain in place.
 Notwithstanding partisan gibes, Mr. Kashkari said that a Republican administration would have followed the same course had Mr. McCain won the presidential election -- albeit with less populist rhetoric.
 ''The way a Democratic administration talks about certain issues is probably a little different,'' he said. ''But the substance of the actions, I think, are very consistent.''
 A Good Start
 Mr. Kashkari embraces the Obama administration's financial regulation proposal as a good first step. But he said policy makers needed more time to determine rules that could temper risk while preserving financial dynamism and innovation.
 With Wall Street firms on track to pay employees a record $140 billion this year, executive compensation has become a flashpoint. ''I completely understand the anger of the American people,'' Mr. Kashkari said.
 But he worries that too stringent a crackdown could make the economy less stable by driving financial activity and executives offshore. Washington's economic bureaucrats may be patriots, but Mr. Kashkari does not see his onetime Wall Street colleagues that way.
 ''No, they're not,'' he said. ''I don't expect every American to be a patriot. I do think Wall Street firms need to show more sensitivity. 
 ''Every single Wall Street firm, despite their protest today, every single one benefited from our actions,'' he said. ''And when they get up there and say, 'Well, we didn't need it,' that's bull.
 ''They did need it. And they're all happy with the actions that we took, and they need to show restraint today.''

 Coin Stash Turns
 Into Cash for Bills
 On a chilly night, Euclid Clarke and his wife, Essie, went to a TD Bank in Downtown Brooklyn and poured thousands of dollars of spare change into a coin-counting machine, to pay their mounting bills. 
 The coins, which they had been saving for a family vacation, had filled two bags. Ms. Clarke moved palmfuls into the tray and waited as the machine counted. It filled up, and a bank employee had to empty it. ''Going to Hawaii is our dream,'' Mr. Clarke said.
 The dream would have to wait. Mr. Clarke, an exterminator, has found that people are willing to skimp on the luxury of bug removal in the recession. ''We've cut back our rates,'' he said. ''People are doing it themselves.''
 Ms. Clarke tossed in the last of the coins, most of them tips from her husband's second job working at a deli.
 The coin-counting machines at the bank are always popular, said Gregory Mokliak, the greeter who manages the floor at TD Bank's busy Montague Street branch. But lately, Mr. Mokliak has noticed a lot more action at the Penny Arcade, as the bank's no-fee machines are called.
 The coins come in plastic bags, water jugs or cat food containers, and customers leave behind items like foreign currency, a guitar pick, even a bullet. 
 One customer dumped about $600 in the machine to pay the rent. Others tell Mr. Mokliak, who cheerfully empties the machines about 30 times a day, that without the coins, they could not pay the bills.
 It is unclear whether the recession has caused more New Yorkers to empty their piggy banks. While TD Bank saw a large increase in what it took from the machines from 2007 to 2008 --to $115 million from more than $101 million -- the coin machines, at 73 locations around the city, have taken in $87 million so far in 2009, about even with this time last year.
 Another company, Coinstar, has 600 machines in the New York City area and estimates that its residents have $687,791,933 in change sitting around. A spokeswoman, Sarah Jones, said the company had not been able to detect a correlation between economic downturns and increased use.
 Another customer at the Montague Street branch of TD Bank, Edwin Badillo, a technician, had not expected to make a recent trip to cash in his coins, which barely filled a few inches of a large water jug.
 Mr. Badillo did not get a promotion he had expected, overtime hours were becoming scarce and his company stopped contributing to his 401(k). When he broke his ankle and started taking home less pay, it was time to empty the jug.
 In line at the bank, the Clarkes, with their empty bags, waited for a teller to cash in their receipt: several hundred dollars less than they expected, but maybe enough. KAREEM FAHIM

HEADLINE: States Pressed Into New Role On Marijuana

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: GREELEY, Colo. 

 BODY:
Health and law enforcement officials around the nation are scrambling to figure out how to regulate medical marijuana now that the federal government has decided it will no longer prosecute legal users or providers.
 For years, since the first medical marijuana laws were passed in the mid-1990s, many local and state governments could be confident, if not complacent, knowing that marijuana would be kept in check because it remained illegal under federal law, and that hard-nosed federal prosecutors were not about to forget it. 
 But with the Justice Department's announcement last week that it would not prosecute people who use marijuana for medical purposes in states where it is legal, local and state officials say they will now have to take on the job themselves. 
 In New Hampshire, for instance, where some state legislators are considering a medical marijuana law, there is concern that the state health department -- already battered by budget cuts -- could be hard-pressed to administer the system. In California, where there has been an explosion of medical marijuana suppliers, the authorities in Los Angeles and other jurisdictions are considering a requirement that all medical dispensaries operate as nonprofit organizations. 
 ''The federal government says they're not going to control it, so the only other option we have is to control it ourselves,'' said Carrol Martin, a City Council member in this community north of Denver, where a ban on marijuana dispensaries was on the agenda at a Council meeting the day after the federal announcement.
 At least five states, including New York and New Jersey, are considering laws to allow medical marijuana through legislation or voter referendums, in addition to the 13 states where such laws already exist. Even while that is happening, scores of local governments in California, Colorado and other states have gone the other way and imposed bans or moratoriums on distribution even though state law allows it.
 Some health and legal experts say the Justice Department's decision will promote the spread of marijuana for medical uses because local and state officials often take leadership cues from federal policy. That, the experts said, could lead to more liberal rules in states that already have medical marijuana and to more voters and legislators in other states becoming comfortable with the idea of allowing it. For elected officials who have feared looking soft on crime by backing any sort of legalized marijuana use, the new policy might provide support to reframe the issue.
 ''The fact that the feds are backing off is going to allow changes that are going to make it more accessible,'' said Bill Morrisette, a state senator in Oregon and chairman of a committee that oversees the state's medical marijuana law. Mr. Morrisette said he expected a flurry of proposals in the Legislature, including a plan already floated to have the state grow the marijuana crop itself, perhaps on the grounds of the State Penitentiary in Salem.
 ''It would be very secure,'' he said.
 Here in Greeley, anxiety and enthusiasm were on display as the City Council considered a ban on dispensaries.
 Most of those who testified at the hearing, including several dispensary operators, opposed the ban and spoke of marijuana's therapeutic benefits and the taxes that dispensary owners were willing to pour into Greeley's budget, which has been battered by the recession.
 But on the seven-member Council, the question was control. Mr. Martin, for example, said that he hated to see the spread of marijuana, but that the barricades had fallen. Still, he said he opposed a local ban on dispensaries.
 ''If we have no regulations at all, then we can't control it, and our police officers have their hands tied,'' Mr. Martin said.
 Mayor Ed Clark, a former police officer, took the opposite tack in supporting the ban, which passed on a 6-to-1 vote.
 ''I think we do regulate them, by not allowing dispensaries,'' Mr. Clark said. 
 The backdrop to the debate here in Colorado is a sharp expansion in marijuana dispensaries and patients, fueled in part by the State Board of Health decision in July not to impose limits on the number of patients handled by each marijuana provider.
 The state attorney general, John W. Suthers, said the federal government's retreat, combined with the growth in demand, had created a legal vacuum.
 ''The federal Department of Justice is saying it will only go after you if you're in violation of state law,'' Mr. Suthers said. ''But in Colorado it's not clear what state law is.''
 In New Hampshire, by contrast, where the state legislature is scheduled to meet this week to consider overriding the governor's veto and passing a medical marijuana law, government downsizing has colored the debate.
 The state agency that would be responsible for licensing marijuana dispensaries has been battered by budget cuts, said Senator Sylvia B. Larsen, the president of the New Hampshire Senate and a Democrat. Concerns about the department, Ms. Larsen said, have made it harder to find two more votes in the Senate to reach a two-thirds majority that is needed to override a veto by Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat.
 An even odder situation is unfolding in Maine, which already allows medical marijuana and where residents will vote next month on a measure that would create a new system of distribution and licensing.
 The marijuana proposal, several political experts said, has been overshadowed by another fight on the ballot that would overturn a state law and ban same-sex marriage.
 The added wrinkle is that opponents of same-sex marriage, said Christian Potholm, a professor of government at Bowdoin College, have heavily recruited young, socially conservative voters, who by and large tend to not be concerned about medical marijuana expansion.
 ''The 18- to 25-year-old vote is going to be overrepresented because of the gay marriage situation, so overrepresented in favor of medical marijuana,'' Professor Potholm said.
 Some legal scholars said the federal government, by deciding not to enforce its own laws (possession and the sale of marijuana remain federal crimes), has introduced an unpredictable variable into the drug regulation system.
 ''The next step would be a particular state deciding to legalize marijuana entirely,'' said Peter J. Cohen, a doctor and a lawyer who teaches public health law at Georgetown University. If federal prosecutors kept their distance even then, Dr. Cohen said, legalized marijuana would become a de facto reality.
 Senator Morrisette in Oregon said he thought that exact situation -- a state moving toward legalization, perhaps California -- could play out much sooner now than might have been imagined even a few weeks ago. And the continuing recession would only help, he said, with advocates for legalization able to promise relief to an overburdened prison system and injection of tax revenues to the state budget.

HEADLINE: To Be Seen And Heard All Around The Town

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Surfer Blood, from West Palm Beach, Fla., was an emblematic band for the 29th annual CMJ Music Marathon, the five-day convention, showcase and stampede of bands that ended in the wee hours of Sunday morning. Determined to be heard by every potential dealmaker, tastemaker, blogger and music fan, Surfer Blood played about a dozen brief sets during the conference at clubs on the Lower East Side and in Brooklyn, and has another gig for good measure on Monday night in Brooklyn at Death by Audio. 
 Surfer Blood is self-starting and hardworking in the ways that fledgling bands have had to learn in order to survive. And its songs encompassed a broad stretch of CMJ's 2009 musical spectrum: Velvet Underground and punk riffs, reverberating textures, African-style guitar filigrees, grunge crescendos, power-pop choruses headed for anthems and, yes, some surf-rock twang. All those sounds have been encouraged by college radio, Internet radio and indie-music blogs, and Surfer Blood strings them all together, skillfully and likeably. (All that's missing is programmed dance beats and rapping.) The band's CMJ blitz guarantees added recognition as Surfer Blood stays on the road for the next month and beyond. 
 The lure of CMJ, for virtually all of the 1,300 bands that played showcases this year, is simply the chance to be seen and heard. This year's daytime program started with a bluntly titled panel discussion -- ''But How Will I Get Paid?'' -- that couldn't fully answer the question. Attention may be all a musician can hope for in an era when recording companies are disintegrating, competition clogs MySpace, and the kinds of businesses that pay upfront for music -- advertising and film and television licensing -- are interested in isolated songs, not musicians' careers. (At New York University, where panels were held, and in CMJ-mobbed places like Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side, musicians and managers were eagerly talking about those deals anyway.) 
 The competition clogs CMJ, too, so like Surfer Blood, many bands multiplied their chances to be seen, playing day parties and late-night shows that were unaffiliated with the conference but wouldn't take place without it. 
 CMJ rightly claims to have offered early glimpses of best-selling, paradigm-shifting bands, from R.E.M. to Arcade Fire. But this year's marathon didn't yield an obvious contender. (With so many bands, however, the odds are good that hindsight will eventually change that.) Visa problems prevented appearances by the Very Best, a collaboration between a singer from Malawi and a European electronic production team, and Speech Debelle, the rapper who won the Mercury Music Prize this year. With the economic downturn limiting travel budgets, bands from New York and environs were as prominent as out-of-towners, although there were still visitors from Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Britain, Denmark and Iceland, the home of Mum, whose songs evolved with charming unpredictability from plinking Minimalism to upbeat rock.
 Luckily, New York is still incubating magnificent, dramatically dynamic bands like Cymbals Eat Guitars -- whose stately songs erupt in outbursts of strumming and screaming -- and the Antlers, who envelop their ballads of wounded introspection in majestic swells of guitars and effects. Theophilus London, a promising rapper-singer who favors electro tracks, lives in New York. So does Sharon Van Etten, who sang stark, riveting songs about loneliness and yearning in a lustrous voice. 
 New York can also claim Hercules and Love Affair, the project of the disc jockey Andy Butler, who mustered a glittering stageful of singers (in silver lame) and dancers -- one of the marathon's few events with production values -- to perform blipping, percolating songs that took heartbreak to the digital disco. 
 College and Web radio, for all their delight in new and obscure music, are also havens of cultishness and a kind of musical conservatism, praising new bands that revive some cherished sound that the pop mainstream ignored. So a good part of CMJ looks backward or delves into niches. 
 That's not always bad. The scruffy, punky new wave of bands like Answering Machine, Pete and the Pirates, and Parlovr (a Montreal band pronounced like ''parlor'') was endearing; so was the straightforward but supercharged punk of Lovvers. These United States, a band from Washington, fully fit the definition of an alt-country band, complete with pedal-steel guitar, but it's a superb one, equally at home with quiet, morose tales and galloping punky-tonk adventures. 
 Fool's Gold, from Los Angeles, fused grooves and vocal styles from across Africa, one of the rare worldbeat bands that doesn't shallowly imitate its sources. There was also an African apparition: Janka Nabay from Sierra Leone, wearing a straw skirt and singing and dancing to recorded tracks of what he said was a 500-year-old tradition called bubu music. The tracks were modern, and the beat, fast and skeletal and driven by bell taps, was unstoppable, demanding wider dissemination. 
 Yet hearing all the revivalists and category-fillers at CMJ -- shoegazers, synth-poppers, heavy-metal bands -- can also make a listener wonder if, as Simon Balthazar of Fanfarlo sang, ''The great ideas are wearing thin.'' (Fanfarlo itself got many of its ideas from Arcade Fire and Beirut.)
 Two highly touted bands -- the XX from England and Cold Cave from Philadelphia -- are dedicated, and largely derivative, throwbacks to the late 1970s and early 1980s, when punk met synthesizers. The XX was decidedly understated, matching its austere, quietly morose songs, while Cold Cave deadpanned its way through glum songs with a dissonant wallop, singing, ''I've seen the future and it's no place for me.'' But the Montreal band Duchess Says, whose songs also rode big drumbeats and repetitive synthesizer riffs -- fat ones from a Moog -- was a lot more fun. Its singer, Annie-Claude, had herky-jerk stage moves that she carried into the audience, even climbing onto a fan or two. 
 Live shows, unlike recording studios, encourage musicians to let their music crest. The Temper Trap, from Australia, plunged into anthems of self-discovery with the martial drive of U2, vocals heading for falsetto and instrumental buildups that were clearly aiming for arenas. More pensive groups let the music surge from within, among them Choir of Young Believers, a brooding Danish rock band, and Nathaniel Rateliff and the Wheel, a band from Denver that looks folky -- with acoustic guitar and bass fiddle -- but sings about regrets and insecurities in choruses that turned rousing.
 Musicians' oldest livelihood, performing and touring, is still their most dependable one, and the CMJ gantlet -- playing half-hour sets to distracted audiences in low-fi clubs -- lets bookers, agents and potential tour mates see what YouTube still can't deliver. Stage presence makes a difference, even if the stage is the size of a wading pool and half the audience is checking e-mail. While CMJ had no guaranteed next big thing in 2009, and the current music business might not know how to nurture one if it did, there were enough worthwhile next small things to deserve their moment of hard-won attention.

HEADLINE: Asian Leaders Focus on Freer Trade

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

DATELINE: CHA-AM, Thailand 

 BODY:
After a year of uncertain economic prospects, Asia's leaders expressed cautious optimism at a weekend meeting here as they returned to the business of increasing trade within the region, lowering tariffs and discussing plans for a wider Asian free-trade zone.
 ''Recovery has taken hold in Asia,'' Kasit Piromya, the Thai foreign minister, said Saturday in a news conference summarizing the findings of a summit of the 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, as well as China, Japan and South Korea. 
 The gathering at this beachside town south of Bangkok also included meetings with leaders from Australia, India and New Zealand on Sunday. Leaders focused in large part on the nuts and bolts of expanding trade, especially one of the crucial impediments to regional commerce: the lack of good transportation in the less-developed parts of the region.
 The gathering appeared to serve as a coda to the economic crisis in Asia, during which many trade-dependent Asian economies suffered sharp contractions. Asia now appears to be bouncing back rapidly, especially when compared with the United States and Europe.
 ''There's greater self-confidence,'' said Rodolfo C. Severino, head of the Asean Studies Center and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. ''The financial systems have weathered the crisis quite well because their conservatism shielded them.''
 The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said a major concern raised by leaders Sunday was finding new avenues for economic growth that were not dependent on the markets of the United States and Europe. ''The old growth model where, simply put, we have still to rely on consumption in the West for goods and services produced here, we feel will no longer serve us,'' he said.
 A statement issued after the final meetings Sunday said the leaders were ''encouraged that the global economy had shown signs of recovery'' but urged governments to remain vigilant.
 Leaders discussed many other issues here, including climate change and the formation of a human rights commission in Southeast Asia. But there were also reminders of the tensions accompanying Asia's economic rise, especially jockeying by Japan and China for the top leadership role in the region.
 The Japanese and Chinese governments have competing proposals to finance infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia, and the two nations appeared to disagree at the meeting about the future of an East Asian free-trade zone. The Japanese delegation stressed the importance of the involvement of the United States, perhaps in part to appease concerns in Washington over possible shifts in Tokyo toward a more Asia-centered Japanese foreign policy.
 ''Japan places the U.S.-Japan alliance at the foundation of its diplomacy,'' Yukio Hatoyama, the Japanese prime minister, told the leaders at the summit meeting, according to a Japanese government spokesman.
 There are several proposals for a future East Asian free-trade zone -- the Japanese version is called the East Asian Community -- but all are vague, and leaders say they are a long way from reality.
 The proposals are often compared to a European Union-style single market, but analysts say a pan-Asian economic bloc would be unlikely to have open borders, free movement of labor and common security policies.
 China did not publicly offer its vision of an East Asian community, but a statement issued after a meeting of what is known as Asean plus three -- the leaders of Asean, China, Japan and South Korea -- said those 13 countries would form the ''main vehicle toward the long-term goal of building an East Asian Community.'' That would seem to exclude a role for the United States.
 Asean leaders said they ''commended'' and supported China's efforts to expand the use of its currency, the renminbi, instead of the dollar in some regional trade transactions. And the leaders said they ''welcomed'' China's initiatives to build roads in south-central Myanmar and western Cambodia and its financing of a bridge over the Mekong River between Laos and the Thai town of Chiang Khong.
 China told Asean leaders that they were eligible for a $15 billion Southeast Asian infrastructure loan program sponsored by the Chinese government.
 During the summit meeting, Mr. Abhisit was asked if Southeast Asian countries risked being caught between competing superpowers. ''I see it as Asean providing balance,'' he said.
 The leaders said they were ''well on track'' for the Asean free-trade area by January. The agreement, long in the making, eliminates tariffs for 87 percent of imports within Asean countries.
 Asean's 10 member countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Where Little-Town Blues Melt Away, So Can Dreams

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
''Ordinary Days,'' a new chamber musical that opened on Sunday night as part of the Roundabout Underground series at the company's Black Box Theater, captures with stinging clarity that uneasy moment in youth when doubts begin to cloud hopes for a future of unlimited possibility.
 ''What am I doing here?'' one of the quartet of anxious New Yorkers sings in this genial, quietly affecting show. The same question haunts all of them at one point or another, as the certainty of finding satisfaction seems to recede in the distance, like the last taxi in sight driving off with somebody luckier on a rainy night. 
 A modest musical produced with an apt intimacy and expertly sung by an appealing cast, ''Ordinary Days'' introduces a promising newcomer to our talent-hungry musical theater, the composer and lyricist Adam Gwon. Mr. Gwon writes crisp, fluid and often funny lyrics that reflect the racing minds of the four New Yorkers on a nervous search for their immediate futures.
 His music is lean on melody and less effective -- some stretches of the first half of this (nearly) sung-through 80-minute score seem interchangeable -- but the songs in the final scenes have a greater reach and variety. The music is nimbly played on the piano by Vadim Feichtner; the lack of complex orchestration might have contributed to the occasional sense that Mr. Gwon's score was going in circles. 
 In fact, so are the characters he's writing about. Warren (Jared Gertner) is an aspiring artist who works as a sort-of assistant to a more established painter. His current project involves handing out fliers of his boss's greatest hits on street corners, an activity guaranteed to increase anybody's feeling of invisibility. But Warren is hanging on to his sense that the city still holds the potential for discovery; his hobby is a kind of urban scavenging, the rescuing of discarded photographs and other mementos that he finds in the street. 
 One day Warren picks up a notebook belonging to Deb (Kate Wetherhead), an exile from the hinterlands working on her dissertation on Virginia Woolf. Deb couldn't stand the stifling suburbs or the dreary desk job she left behind, but she's beginning to doubt whether the big city is right for her either. She sings:
 Woody Allen heard Gershwin in the air
 When he thought, ''Manhattan.''
 Well, I'm not so impressed
 I hear, like, Philip Glass at best.
 In one of the show's most enjoyable sequences, Deb and Warren meet up at the Met so he can return her notebook. His bubbly enthusiasm at the romance of this introduction is doused with the cold water of her businesslike desire to get back to work.
 ''I sensed from your notebook your fiery nature,'' Warren says wryly. ''Your penmanship crackles with rage.'' Deb agrees to go for a coffee only after eyeing Warren's antic getup warily and asking a pointed question: ''You're gay, right?'' 
 Also at the Met that afternoon are Jason (Hunter Foster) and Claire (Lisa Brescia), a couple who are tentatively negotiating the tough terrain of new cohabitation. Both are contending with the unsettling sense that moving in together seems to be pushing them apart. The little things they don't do together loom too large, as when they are drawn to separate wings in the museum.
 Jason and Claire's inward tug of wars over whether each has made the right choice climaxes in a fight over a bottle of wine. ''They're serving monkfish, so, darling, the wine can't be red,'' Claire insists. The cabernet-favoring Jason declares a truce:
 Fine, I'll bring the red
 You bring the white
 That way I'll still get drunk
 You'll still be right.
 By the end of the evening the rift in the relationship has widened into a chasm. 
 With its focus on the trembling anxieties of newly minted adults trying to stay afloat, emotionally and economically, in the chilly seas of the big city, ''Ordinary Days'' feels a bit like ''Avenue Q'' minus the puppets and the snarky attitude. And the characters, while drawn with clarity, are not entirely distinctive. (It's time to put a moratorium on signaling neurosis by having a character order an elaborately demanding drink at Starbucks, for instance.) But there are nuanced touches too, as when Claire stands before a painting at the Met, transfixed by the idea that X-rays have revealed a different painting hidden underneath the one on view, which will prove to be a metaphor for her own fear of erasing the past. 
 Under the sensitive direction of Marc Bruni, the actors smartly pitch their performances to the intimacy of the theater, which seats just 62, allowing us to hear each word in Mr. Gwon's dense, conversational lyrics. Mr. Foster and Ms. Brescia, excellent singers with ample Broadway resumes, express the twisty emotional paths their characters take with affecting forthrightness. The baby-faced Mr. Gertner and the naturally acerbic Ms. Wetherhead nail the eccentricities of their more quirky characters with equal precision. 
 All four characters' lives intersect briefly, if momentously, at the end of the show. Warren's frustration with his going-nowhere career inspires a spontaneous act that has an unforeseen impact on the course of Claire and Jason's relationship. But the two couples never interact, a sad-sweet comment on the anonymity of life in the city, where it is possible to change other people's fates without actually getting to meet them.

HEADLINE: Bill to Increase Access to Contraception Is Dividing Filipinos

BYLINE: By CARLOS H. CONDE

DATELINE: MANILA 

 BODY:
Gina Judilla already had three children the first time she tried to terminate a pregnancy. ''I jumped down the stairs, hoping that would cause a miscarriage,'' she said. The fetus survived and is now an 8-year-old boy.
 Three years later, pregnant again, she drank an herbal concoction that was supposed to induce abortion. That, too, failed. 
 Three years ago, in another unsuccessful attempt to end a pregnancy, she took Cytotec, a drug to treat gastric ulcers that is widely known in the Philippines as an ''abortion pill.''
 What drove Ms. Judilla, a 37-year-old manicurist, to such extreme measures is a story of personal tribulation familiar to many Filipino women. She and her unemployed husband are very poor -- barely able to buy vitamins for their youngest child, let alone send more than two of their older children to school.
 ''When I had my third child, I swore to myself that I will never get pregnant again because I know we could not afford to have another one,'' Ms. Judilla said in a recent interview at her home in Pasig City, on the eastern outskirts of Manila.
 Abortion is illegal in the Philippines. Birth control and related health services have long been available to those who can afford to pay for them through the private medical system, but 70 percent of the population is too poor and depends on heavily subsidized care. In 1991, prime responsibility for delivering public health services shifted from the central government to the local authorities, who have broad discretion over which services are dispensed.
 Many communities responded by making birth control unavailable.
 More recently, however, family planning advocates have been making headway in their campaign to change that. Legislation before the Philippine Congress, called the Reproductive Health and Population Development Act, would require governments down to the local level to provide free or low-cost reproductive health services, including condoms, birth control pills, tubal ligations and vasectomies. It would also mandate sex education in all schools, public and private, from fifth grade through high school.
 Supporters of the bill cite urgent public health needs. A 2006 government survey, which interviewed 46,000 women, found that between 2000 and 2006, only half of Filipino women of reproductive age used birth control of any kind. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization based in the United States that researches reproductive health policy, 54 percent of the 3.4 million pregnancies in the Philippines in 2008 were unintended.
 Most of those unintended pregnancies -- 92 percent -- resulted from not using birth control, the institute said, and the rest from birth control that failed. Those unintended pregnancies, the institute says, contributed to an estimated half-million abortions that year, despite a ban on the procedure. Most of the abortions are done clandestinely and in unsanitary conditions. Many women resort to crude methods like those Ms. Judilla tried.
 The bill's main proponent in Congress, Representative Edcel C. Lagman, also says there is a need for a check on population growth in the interest of national welfare. The Philippine population is estimated at 98 million and is growing at more than 2 percent annually, one of the highest rates in Asia. ''Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty,'' Mr. Lagman wrote in an op-ed column in The Philippine Daily Inquirer recently.
 But attempts to make reproductive services more broadly available have met resistance, leading to the defeat of several bills in Congress over the past decade.
 The main opposition in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country has come from the church and affiliated lay organizations, which say the proposed law would legalize abortion. In churches across the country, signs have been posted that read: ''Yes to Life! No to RH Bill!''
 One organization, the Catholic Alumni United for Life, said in a position paper that the legislation would promote abortion by financing abortion-inducing drugs, and therefore ''violates explicit Catholic teaching.''
 The Rev. Melvin Castro of the Episcopal Commission on Family and Life, an arm of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, said the Catholic Church and the laity would fight the bill, if passed into law, up to the Supreme Court.
 ''The Constitution is very clear that the state should protect life from conception up to its natural end,'' Father Castro said.''Regardless of their religion, Filipinos are God-fearing and family-loving. This bill will change that culture.''
 Still, proponents of the bill are optimistic, noting that this is the first time such legislation has won the support of the House committee on health. Previous proposals never even made it into committee. They also cite public opinion surveys that show support for the bill and hope it can be passed before the current Congress adjourns in June.
 It seems certain that debate over the legislation will heat up with the approach of national elections in May.
 Already, the church has issued statements calling on Senator Benigno Aquino III, expected to be the opposition's presidential candidate, to oppose the bill. Mr. Aquino, the son of Corazon Aquino, the late president, who was extremely close to the church, has said he will not do this.
 President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is barred from running for another term, has been sending mixed signals about her position. In previous statements, however, she has said she will let her Catholic faith guide her.
 ''My faith has a very, very strong influence on me,'' she said last year.
 Other politicians, particularly those on the local level, have chosen to side with the church. In 2000, Jose Lito Atienza, who was mayor of Manila at the time, issued an executive order ending government-financed birth control in the capital. Condoms and other contraceptives were removed from government clinics and hospitals. Patients who asked for them were turned away.
 Mr. Atienza, who is now the environment secretary, defends his order as ''the right thing to do.''
 ''Contrary to what many are saying, that policy was meant to protect women, to protect their wombs from those who want to take away life,'' he said.
 Passage of the reproductive health bill would automatically nullify Mr. Atienza's order, said Clara Rita A. Padilla, executive director of EnGendeRights, a nonprofit group that supports the bill. ''The poor women of this country need this law to protect them,'' she said.

HEADLINE: France, Land of Epicures, Gets Taste for McDonald's

BYLINE: By NADIM AUDI

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
When McDonald's France announced a plan to open a restaurant in the commercial mall under the Louvre, the scene appeared to be set for a new French controversy. The New World was about to strike at the heart of France's most celebrated cultural symbol. The French would not take it lightly.
 While some in the international news media, especially in Britain, found this line entrancing, the French simply shrugged at the news. The announcement was ignored by the national newspapers, apart from a small article published by Le Parisien, a popular daily. 
 The reality is that the French have gotten used to their McDonald's, widely nicknamed ''McDo'' (pronounced mac-DOUGH). Statistics suggest, in fact, that they have grown fond of it. Since McDonald's France served its first Big Mac 30 years ago, it has opened 1,140 restaurants across the country.
 The French operation of McDonald's is the second most profitable after the one in the United States. French patrons are also the world's biggest spenders: an average visit here amounts to about $15, including tax, versus $4 in the United States.
 With the recession having driven customers away from more expensive restaurants, the company is estimating growth of 10 percent in France this year. Quick, a Belgian fast food chain with 346 restaurants in France, expects to grow by 3 percent in 2009, according to its chief executive, Jean-Paul Brayer.
 This trend marks a big change from the past decade. When Jose Bove, a French farmer and activist, decided to protest global capitalism and what he called ''Coca-Colonization'' in 1999, he dismantled a McDonald's in the south of France.
 Some Parisians have never even heard of the company's plan to open a restaurant in the Louvre, the basement of which already has a shopping mall and a small food court.
 ''This is news to me,'' said Laurent Mortin, 28, a bank employee who was in line to order lunch at a McDonald's near the Opera Garnier. ''But if they open a McDo in the Louvre, what's the big deal?''
 Part of McDonald's success in France can be explained by the company's efforts to adapt to local taste buds. ''The French eat McDonald's in a French way,'' said Caroline Deleuze, a spokeswoman for McDonald's France. ''They come less often but spend more because they want a proper meal.'' That is defined as a sit-down experience with two courses.
 Local menus offer sandwiches that aim to please local tastes. Le Royal Deluxe features a whole-grain mustard sauce on top of the standard beef patty, cheddar and vegetables, and it is now the second-largest selling burger in France, after the Big Mac. Le Big Tasty, a seasonal offering with a sauce that imitates the charred flavor of meat grilled on a barbecue, promises ''le gout de l'Amerique,'' or the taste of America.
 McDonald's France offers its version of the Caprese salad, called Little Mozza, and beer and espresso are also available. The company emphasizes the French origin of the beef and vegetables in its restaurants.
 Prices are also higher than in the United States. Items are more expensive, in part, because of the current exchange rate -- a Big Mac in Paris costs $4.95, tax included, compared with $4.12 in New York.
 Bernard Hasquenoph, the head of Louvre pour tous, or Louvre for everyone, an association for the defense of French museums, is one of the most vocal opponents of the McDonald's restaurant in the Louvre. He said he contested a symbol, not a particular country or company.
 ''I'm not going to chain myself to a McDo,'' he said. ''The Louvre claims it has nothing to do with the mall, but the museum granted it as a concession. For me, it is a symbol of what French museums are turning into.''
 Some people here struggle to understand the paradox of McDonald's success in a country that prides itself on viewing food as a prime element of culture. ''Gastronomy is a discourse, it is about collective belief,'' said Alain Drouard, a historian who is president of the International Commission for Research into European Food History, a group of scholars that researches the history of food and nutrition in Europe. 
 ''There is a gap between this discourse and what the French eat,'' he said.
 Mr. Drouard is untroubled by the McDonald's in the Louvre. ''We're in a process of industrialization,'' he said. ''The French have become eaters of convenience food.''
 McDonald's popularity, he said, is the result of declining standards in what the French consider traditional fast food. ''Bistros don't know how to make a good sandwich anymore,'' Mr. Drouard said. ''McDo is a legitimate competitor.''
 At the McDonald's near the Opera Garnier, tourists mingled with Parisian professionals. The lunchtime crowd seemed uninterested in the bright green macaroons on offer at the cafe counter.
 ''I come here once in a while,'' said Mr. Mortin, the bank employee. ''It's more of a real lunch than eating a sandwich in the street, and it doesn't take as much time as sitting in a restaurant.'' 
 Mr. Mortin was about to order his usual, a Big Mac with a side of four Chicken McNuggets. ''It doesn't mean I don't enjoy French cuisine,'' he said. ''It's not exclusive.''
 The success of McDonald's does not mean that the pleasures of simple French food have vanished completely. Ms. Deleuze, the McDonald's spokeswoman, said that the jambon beurre, a sandwich of butter and slices of ham on a crusty baguette, ''still outsells burgers 10 to 1.''

HEADLINE: Studios' Quest For Life After DVDs

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES; Brad Stone contributed reporting from San Francisco.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Movie studios, desperate to return their home entertainment divisions to growth, are scrambling to shape the post-DVD era.
 Until very recently, most Hollywood heavyweights were loath to speak too openly about the promise of digital entertainment -- the downloading and streaming of movies and television shows on computers, Internet-enabled televisions and mobile devices. Nobody wanted to anger retail partners like Wal-Mart or do anything that might slow the DVD gravy train.
 But business currents have shifted. While DVD and Blu-ray will remain a huge profit center for years to come, studio executives are finally confronting an uncomfortable reality: little silver discs -- for reasons of convenience, price and consumer burnout -- may never recover their sales power. To grow, studios need to figure out digital distribution.
 Disney announced last week that it had developed a system to track digital ownership, so people won't have to buy the same movie or television show multiple times for different devices. But that's just the latest, most likely not the last, approach. 
 ''I expect these guys to try many different ways to figure out an endgame to digital entertainment,'' said Doug Creutz, a media analyst at Cowen and Company. ''In the meantime, you will find a lot of false starts.''
 Everyone is trying to solve one problem: consumers, the industry believes, will be reluctant to open their wallets for digital movies and TV shows until they get more portability and can watch the same content on several devices. Studios want to make consumers collect digital entertainment the way they would DVDs or books. 
 In the third quarter, studios' home entertainment divisions generated about $4 billion, down 3.2 percent from a year ago, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, a trade consortium. But digital distribution contributed just $420 million, an increase of 18 percent.
 Standing in the way are technology hurdles -- how to let consumers play a video on various devices without letting them share it with 10,000 close friends on a pirate site -- and the reluctance of studios to cooperate too closely with rivals for reasons of antitrust scrutiny and sheer competitiveness.
 The Walt Disney Company in the coming weeks will introduce its new system for tracking digital ownership, which it calls Keychest. It would allow consumers to buy permanent access to digital entertainment -- a specific film, for instance -- that then could be watched on computers, cellphones and cable on-demand services. Analysts speculate that Apple will be a partner.
 A mother could start streaming ''Toy Story'' on a laptop for her kids, continue the film on an iPhone at a restaurant and finish it at home with a video-on-demand cable service.
 Details remain sketchy -- and it is still anyone's guess when consumers might see it -- but Keychest has two other promising features, Disney says. The system would work with various digital formats, so competing companies could maintain disparate business plans.
 And piracy, at least conceptually, would be less of a worry. The technology rests on cloud computing, in which huge troves of data are stored on remote servers so users have access from anywhere. Movies would be streamed from the cloud and never downloaded, making them harder to pirate.
 ''We have a better mousetrap and have a higher chance of getting companies to participate than do other schemes out there,'' said Bob Chapek, president of home entertainment at Walt Disney Studios.
 A consortium of movie studios (basically everyone but Disney) have joined with companies like Comcast and Intel to pursue a different strategy. Their initiative, called the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem, or DECE, involves coming up with a common set of standards and formats. 
 ''We can start to develop a digital service where it's better than free because it offers consumers more convenience and choice,'' said Mitch Singer, chief technology officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which is leading the DECE effort. ''We can reduce the cost of digital delivery, enabling more services to flourish,'' he said.
 Mr. Singer said it was unfair to position Keychest and DECE against each other. ''We are all going in the same direction,'' he said. ''We're trying to give consumers more choice and greater ease of use when it comes to buying digital entertainment.''
 Other ideas are floating out there, too. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, is promoting something called TV Everywhere, to offer consumers a vast array of television online and on devices -- provided they are paying cable-TV customers. Add in digital entertainment competition from companies like Apple, Amazon, Netflix and upstarts like Mspot, a mobile media provider that streams rented movies to smartphones. 
 As always, the pressure to be first is considerable. ''The last thing studios want is a third party coming up with a solution, because that party would take a big chunk of the revenue with them,'' said Mr. Creutz, the Cowan analyst. Indeed, movie executives blanch when they recall the way that Apple came to dictate pricing to the music business with its iTunes Store.
 The movement of video, whether it is movies or television shows, to the Internet and mobile devices is increasingly hanging over the share prices of media companies, analysts say. The worry is that the economics could be overturned, just as it has for newspapers and music.
 ''Investors are concerned about media companies' continued ability to monetize their films in the home video window,'' wrote Michael C. Morris, a UBS analyst, in a recent research note. ''DVD purchases are increasingly being replaced by new delivery methods.''
 Consumers have adopted digital video more readily than studios have. Ripped DVDs and illegal downloads are not only playable on computers, TVs and smartphones without the hiccups of streaming but also can be passed along to a friend, like the tapes and discs of yore. This works for viewers, but not for Hollywood, which earns no extra revenue and has no control.
 Studios have a spotty track record when it comes to lassoing new technology. A few years ago, when video on demand was just getting started, Disney and several partners weighed in with Moviebeam, a service through which films were sent wirelessly to homes via set-top boxes. It was widely considered a huge failure -- the connections were fickle and people wanted more control over the movies available -- and Disney ultimately left the business. 
 ''Studios are always interested in going direct, and then they see that it's really hard,'' said Reed Hastings, the founder and chief executive of Netflix.
 A variety of factors have influenced Hollywood's new aggression on the digital front. This year, Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers started cutting the amount of shelf space they devote to DVDs, and some other retail partners, like Circuit City, have gone out of business. So movie studios now worry less about angering them by pulling digital levers.
 Studios are also paying attention to predictions about an increased adoption of video-friendly electronics by consumers.
 ''With significant growth expected in the penetration of Internet-connected TVs and consoles in the fourth quarter of this year, demand for digital movie consumption suddenly looks very promising,'' said Thomas Lesinski, president of Paramount Digital Entertainment.
 But the slumping DVD business is by far the biggest motivator. Consumers have been buying fewer DVDs, partly because their family rooms are now cluttered with discs they rarely watch and partly because the recession drove them to lower-priced rental and digital options -- or to forgo home video entirely.
 In the first six months of 2009, revenue from disc sales declined 13.5 percent, to $5.4 billion, according to Mr. Morris's evaluation of Digital Entertainment Group data. A $200 million uptick in Blu-ray sales partly offset a $1 billion decline in DVD sales. Over all, home video revenue declined just 4 percent, helped by a spike in rental revenue.
 That bleak picture has studios now openly discussing what they have known privately for a long time: DVDs will continue to play a role, but it may be a supporting one to digital.
 ''DVD is going to remain very viable, but you've also got a strong base of interest in digital consumption,'' Mr. Chapek of Disney said. ''I see a peaceful coexistence.''
 Brad Stone contributed reporting from San Francisco.

HEADLINE: DEADLIEST BOMBS SINCE '07 SHATTER IRAQI COMPLEXES

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; Reporting was contributed by Anwar J. Ali, Duraid Adnan, Mohammed Hussein and Riyadh Mohammed.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Two synchronized suicide car bombings struck at the heart of the Iraqi government here on Sunday, severely damaging the Justice Ministry and provincial council complexes, leaving a scene of carnage that raised new questions about the government's ability to secure its most vital operations.
 The bombers apparently passed through multiple security checkpoints before detonating their vehicles within a minute of each other, leaving at least 132 dead and more than 520 wounded strewn across crowded downtown streets. Blast walls had been moved back off the road in front of both buildings in recent weeks. 
 It was the deadliest coordinated attack in Iraq since the summer of 2007 and happened just blocks from where car bombers killed at least 122 people at the Foreign and Finance Ministries in August, in the continuation of a focused attempt by insurgents to strike at the government's most critical functions. 
 For months, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who is seeking another term as Iraq prepares to hold national elections in January, has painstakingly tried to present Iraq as having turned a corner on the violence that threatened to tear the country apart in 2006 and 2007. 
 He has recently ordered blast walls removed from dozens of streets in the capital and has insisted that Iraqi forces are capable of securing the country as American troops prepare to withdraw entirely by the end of 2011.
 In large part, Mr. Maliki's popularity has rested on the belief that he has kept the country reasonably safe. 
 But the bombings at four high-profile, well-protected government buildings within a two-month span led some Iraqis to say Sunday that they were reconsidering their support for Mr. Maliki. 
 ''We don't want a government that does not provide us with security,'' said Saif Adil, 26, who has been unemployed since graduating from college two years ago. ''It was good for awhile, and now explosions happen less often, but they are having big effects -- large numbers of dead in important places.'' 
 Ali Hussein, 32, said the explosions had also caused him to question his support for the prime minister. ''Why should I vote for Maliki?'' he asked. ''He has done nothing except bring explosions and corruption.''
 On Sunday afternoon, President Obama spoke with Mr. Maliki by telephone to offer condolences, White House officials said. And in a statement, Mr. Obama condemned the attacks as hateful and destructive. ''The United States will stand with Iraq's people and government as a close friend and partner as Iraqis prepare for elections early next year, continue to take responsibility for their future and build greater peace and opportunity,'' he said.
 American Marines were seen walking around the debris-filled streets after the attack. One Marine said the Americans had been asked by the Iraqi government to aid in the investigation.
 Iraqi and American officials in Baghdad have repeatedly warned about a potential rise in violence as the Jan. 16 parliamentary elections approach, as political parties and their allies vie for advantage and insurgent groups redouble their efforts to destabilize the country.
 In a rare personal appearance at a bombing site, Prime Minister Maliki arrived at the provincial council building about an hour after the explosion, his face ashen as he surveyed the carnage.
 Around Mr. Maliki, paramedics carried the wounded to Red Crescent ambulances, workers wearing plastic gloves scooped body parts into plastic bags, and rescue teams pried open scorched cars in a desperate search for signs of life. 
 Surrounding streets had been blocked off and were under more than a foot of water because the blast had apparently also damaged a water main. Pools of water were red with blood. 
 Mr. Maliki did not venture far from his armored sport utility vehicle. He made no public comment before being driven away.
 Mr. Maliki later issued a statement calling the attacks ''cowardly'' and blamed elements of the Baath Party and the Sunni insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. He said the attack would not affect the elections.
 President Jalal Talabani said the attackers had sought to damage Iraq's fragile democracy.
 ''The perpetrators of this have revealed publicly that they are targeting the state and its basic pillars,'' Mr. Talabani said. ''They want to hinder the political process or to stop it and to sabotage what we have built during six years with great sacrifice.''
 The two government buildings, typically filled with officials as well as civilians seeking government help, are on Haifa Street in one of Baghdad's most congested sections. Nearby are other Iraqi government buildings, embassies, the heavily fortified Green Zone and bridges crossing the Tigris River.
 The explosion at the provincial council building collapsed a section of a 12-foot-high blast wall, crushing people underneath, witnesses said. 
 The Iraqi police said the first bomb struck the Justice Ministry building around 10:30 a.m. It blew out the building's large windows that overlook Haifa Street, sending flying glass and shrapnel into passers-by. A plume of black smoke that rose over the city could be seen for miles.
 ''I was eating in a restaurant near the Justice Ministry when a huge explosion took place,'' said Sa'ad Saleem, 28, an employee of Iraq's state-owned television channel, who had shrapnel wounds in his neck and chest. ''The entire scene was filled with bloody human flesh. Large pools of blood were everywhere, in addition to the remains of burned cars. It was horrible.''
 At the provincial council building, Sheik Hadi Salih, 60, had been attending a meeting on the second floor when he heard the sound of an explosion, followed by the collapse of the ceiling.
 ''We tried to find our way out down the stairs, and as we went we found many dead bodies,'' he said. ''I've seen 20 bodies and more than 60 injured.''
 Among the wounded were at least two American security contractors, a United States Embassy official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under diplomatic ground rules.

HEADLINE: Trying to Rein In 'Too Big to Fail' Institutions

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress and the Obama administration are about to take up one of the most fundamental issues stemming from the near collapse of the financial system last year -- how to deal with institutions that are so big that the government has no choice but to rescue them when they get in trouble.
 A senior administration official said on Sunday that after extensive consultations with Treasury Department officials, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would introduce legislation as early as this week. The measure would make it easier for the government to seize control of troubled financial institutions, throw out management, wipe out the shareholders and change the terms of existing loans held by the institution. 
 The official said the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was planning to endorse the changes in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. 
 The White House plan as outlined so far would already make it much more costly to be a large financial company whose failure would put the financial system and the economy at risk. It would force such institutions to hold more money in reserve and make it harder for them to borrow too heavily against their assets. 
 Setting up the equivalent of living wills for corporations, that plan would require that they come up with their own procedure to be disentangled in the event of a crisis, a plan that administration officials say ought to be made public in advance. 
 ''These changes will impose market discipline on the largest and most interconnected companies,'' said Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions. One of the biggest changes the plan would make, he said, is that instead of being controlled by creditors, the process is controlled by the government.
 Some regulators and economists in recent weeks have suggested that the administration's plan does not go far enough. They say that the government should consider breaking up the biggest banks and investment firms long before they fail, or at least impose strict limits on their trading activities -- steps that the administration continues to reject.
 Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said his committee would now take up more aggressive legislation on the topic, even as lawmakers and regulators continue working on other problems highlighted by the financial crisis, including overseeing executive pay, protecting consumers and regulating the trading of derivatives. 
 Illustrative of the mood of fear and anger over the huge taxpayer bailouts was Mr. Frank's recent observation that critics of the administration's health care proposal had misdirected their concerns -- Congress would not be adopting death panels for infirm people but for troubled companies.
 The administration and its Congressional allies are trying, in essence, to graft the process used to resolve the troubles of smaller commercial banks onto both large banking conglomerates and nonbanking financial institutions whose troubles could threaten to undermine the markets. 
 That resolution process gives the government far more sweeping authority over the institution and imposes major burdens on lenders to the companies that they would not ordinarily face when companies go into bankruptcy instead of facing a takeover by the government. 
 Deep-seated voter anger over the bailouts of companies like the American International Group, Citigroup and Bank of America has fed the fears of lawmakers that any other changes in the regulatory system must include the imposition of more onerous conditions on those financial institutions whose troubles could pose problems for the markets. 
 Some economists believe the mammoth size of some institutions is a threat to the financial system at large. Because these companies know the government could not allow them to fail, the argument goes, they are more inclined to take big risks. 
 Also, under the current regulatory structure, the government has limited power to step in quickly to resolve problems at nonbank financial institutions that operate like the failed investment banks Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and like the giant insurer A.I.G.
 As Wall Street has returned to business as usual, industry power has become even more concentrated among relatively few firms, thus intensifying the debate over how to minimize the risks to the system.
 Some experts, including Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have proposed drastic steps to force the nation's largest financial institutions to shed their riskier affiliates. 
 In a speech last week, Mr. King said policy makers should consider breaking up the largest banks and, in effect, restore the Depression-era barriers between investment and commercial banks.
 ''There are those who claim that such proposals are impractical. It is hard to see why,'' Mr. King said. ''What does seem impractical, however, are the current arrangements. Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail depositors and other creditors, and then suggested that such funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative activities, would be thought rather unworldly. But that is where we now are.''
 The prevailing view in Washington, however, is more restrained. Daniel K. Tarullo, an appointee of President Obama's, last week dismissed the idea of breaking up big banks as ''more a provocative idea than a proposal.'' 
 At a meeting Friday at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in response to a question by a former Bank of England deputy governor that he would prefer ''a more subtle approach without losing the economic benefit of multifunction, international firms.''
 Republican and Democratic lawmakers generally agree that the ''too big to fail'' policy of taxpayer bailouts for the giants of finance needs to be curtailed. But the fine print -- how to reduce the policy and moral hazards it has encouraged -- has provoked fears on Wall Street. 
 Even before Mr. Frank unveils his latest proposals, industry executives and lawyers say its approach could make it unnecessarily more expensive for them to do business during less turbulent times. 
 ''Of course you want to set up a system where an institution dreads the day it happens because management gets whacked, shareholders get whacked and the board gets whacked,'' said Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association. ''But you don't want to create a system that raises great uncertainty and changes what institutions, risk management executives and lawyers are used to.'' 
 T. Timothy Ryan, the president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said the market crisis exposed that ''there was a failure in the statutory framework for the resolution of large, interconnected firms and everyone knows that.'' But he added that many institutions on Wall Street were concerned that the administration's plan would remove many of the bankruptcy protections given to lenders of large institutions.

HEADLINE: Another Look at the Dinkins Administration, and This Time Not by Giuliani

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
Do you really want to go back to the bad old days of Mayor David N. Dinkins? 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, as he had done before, indelicately broached this rhetorical question while campaigning a week ago for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. If you elect the Democratic mayoral candidate, Mr. Giuliani, the former Republican mayor, warned a mostly Orthodox Jewish audience in Brooklyn, New York could well return to a time when a feckless liberal Democrat let services decay and crime and homelessness run rampant.
 This narrative, in which more than a few heard a racial undertone last week, has dominated the city's politics for 16 years. But as a critique, it is ripe for a revisionist second look. Taking office in 1990, just as a Wall Street and real estate collapse pitched the city into deep recession, Mayor Dinkins, the city's first African-American mayor, stumbled more than once. But he also registered more successes than most New Yorkers realize, and so he laid part of the foundation for today's New York. 
 ''Dinkins faced a very sharp economic downturn, and he was in the very difficult position of coming in with high expectations from many constituencies,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, a political science professor at the City University Graduate Center. ''Yet he expanded the police force and rebuilt neighborhoods; he deserves more credit than he gets for managing that time.'' 
 Mr. Dinkins's most lasting achievement might have been in the very area where he now fares worst in popular memory. He obtained the State Legislature's permission to dedicate a tax to hire thousands of police officers, and he fought to preserve a portion of that anticrime money to keep schools open into the evening, an award-winning initiative that kept tens of thousands of teenagers off the street. Later he hired Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, and in the mayor's final years in office, homicide began its now record-breaking decline. 
 His officials played a key role in negotiating the cleanup and revitalization of Times Square, persuading the Walt Disney Corporation to rehabilitate an old 42nd Street theater. 
 And as the tax receipts fell and the city budget bled red, the mayor continued a Koch-era program and poured billions of dollars into rehabilitating dilapidated housing. Tens of thousands of units of housing in northern Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn stood pockmarked and vacant in 1989; today that housing owes much of its handsomely restored face to work begun during the Dinkins era. Over all, Mr. Dinkins rebuilt more housing in a single term than Mr. Giuliani did in two terms.
 Mr. Dinkins also negotiated a stadium deal that still draws applause. His administration gave the United States Tennis Association a 99-year lease on city parkland; in exchange, the tennis association built a stadium and tennis complex in Flushing Meadows, Queens, and shares the courts with the public.
 The tennis deal, Mayor Bloomberg proclaimed several years ago, was ''the only good athletic sports stadium deal, not just in New York but in the country.''
 Such questions are not merely the stuff of historical debate, as historians and political scientists quibble over the grading and ranking of mayors. The social turmoil of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the perceived failures of the Dinkins administration, have cast a shadow over every Democratic mayoral candidate since 1993, in particular for a black candidate like Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.
 Mr. Dinkins took office only to face recession and the three horsemen of social decline: soaring AIDS infection rates, homelessness and a crack-fueled crime wave. Homicide annually claimed the lives of 2,000 New Yorkers, compared with about 500 today.
 Mr. Dinkins's response was sometimes faltering. He handed out union raises, and announced layoffs days later. He raised taxes and cut services. And he rarely insisted that his administration, glued together from various constituencies, speak with a single voice. (Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg insisted on managerial discipline, and reaped its benefits.) 
 Mr. Dinkins also hesitated to face down racial and ethnic antagonism. ''A lot of different voices in his administration were often competing rather than rowing together,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said. 
 But through it all, his administration made advances unmatched by succeeding administrations. He joined with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and poured money into assisted housing for the mentally ill homeless. 
 As a result, the city's shelter population fell to its lowest point in the last 20 years. The shelter population in 1991 stood at less than 20,000; today it stands near 38,000. 
 And through the years of recession, as the city lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, the mayor spoke of his successes and failures, often with brutal candor. His successors have pruned the statistical reports of some negative indicators and tend to place a relentless emphasis on the positive.
 The city, Mr. Giuliani argued the other day, ''could very easily be taken back to the way it was.'' Such a voyage might not be as grim as Mr. Giuliani suggests.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, sided with his party's liberals on Monday and announced that he would include a government-run insurance plan in health care legislation that he plans to take to the Senate floor within a few weeks. 
 His proposal came with an escape hatch: A state could refuse to participate in the public insurance plan by adopting a law to opt out. Even so, the announcement was a turning point in the debate over how much of a role government should play in an overhauled health care system, and it set the stage for a test of Democratic party unity. 
 With Republicans united for now in opposition to any bill including a public option, Mr. Reid needs support from all members of his caucus -- 58 Democrats and two independents -- to take up the legislation. Aides said Monday that he appeared to be short of that goal, lacking firm commitments from several members of the caucus. 
 Should Mr. Reid prevail, both houses of Congress would be poised to act on bills including a government-run plan to compete with private insurers in selling health coverage to consumers. The House is still weighing the details of its approach, but Democratic leaders have made clear they will include a government plan in their version of the bill. 
 Just weeks ago, the prospects for such an approach seemed remote, reflecting all-out opposition from conservatives to what they considered an excessive government role in the economy and a lack of enthusiasm from many moderate Democrats. But the idea has consistently drawn strong support in national polls, and it has backing from President Obama, though he has not insisted on it.
 ''The best way to move forward is to include a public option with the opt-out provision for states,'' said Mr. Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''I believe that a public option can achieve the goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system.''
 Mr. Reid's decision was acclaimed by liberal organizations like MoveOn, Families USA and Health Care for America Now, a coalition that includes labor unions and civil rights groups.
 But Mr. Reid lost the one Republican who had given Democratic efforts a tinge of bipartisanship, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. She has proposed a different approach, in which a government plan would become available only if states did not make progress in reducing insurance premiums and covering more of their residents.
 ''I am deeply disappointed with the majority leader's decision to include a public option as the focus of the legislation,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''I still believe that a fallback, safety-net plan, to be triggered and available immediately in states where insurance companies fail to offer plans that meet the standards of affordability, could have been the road toward achieving a broader bipartisan consensus in the Senate.''
 Mr. Reid and his aides provided few details of his proposal. They said the public plan would be national in scope and would be available on the first day that major provisions of the health care legislation take effect, in 2013.
 The government plan would negotiate payment rates with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. Some liberal Democrats, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, have said payments should be pegged to Medicare rates, which could save money for the government and for consumers.
 The debate over the public option has highlighted a divide among Democrats. The Senate health committee included a public plan in the bill it approved in July. The Senate Finance Committee rejected two versions of the public plan before approving its bill this month. 
 Those who voted against the public plan on the finance panel included three Democratic senators: Max Baucus of Montana, the committee chairman, and two centrists, Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. Mr. Baucus had said he was open to a public option but did not think it could get 60 votes in the Senate. 
 As an alternative to a government-run plan, Mr. Conrad has proposed insurance cooperatives: essentially nonprofit, member-run groups, offering coverage to individuals and small groups. Proponents say they could save money by negotiating discounts with health care providers; the Congressional Budget Office sees no significant savings.
 Mr. Reid said his plan would include co-ops, as well as the government plan. States that opt out of the public plan could not offer co-ops, an aide to Mr. Reid said.
 Liberals see the public option as essential to the success of the legislation, saying it would foster competition and thus help drive down premium costs. With his action on Monday, Mr. Reid showed liberals he was doing all he could to achieve their goal. If his effort falters, he could propose other variations of a public plan, like one with the trigger mechanism Ms. Snowe proposed. 
 Mr. Reid, who faces a stiff challenge in his re-election bid, said he knew Ms. Snowe ''does not like a public option of any kind,'' and he held out hope that she would ultimately support the bill. 
 Pressed on whether he had the needed votes, Mr. Reid said, ''I believe we clearly will have the support of my caucus to move to this bill and start legislating.'' 
 A Democrat on Capitol Hill who backs the public option said ''there is a lot of concern'' that Mr. Reid had made his decision without nailing down the votes to prevail on the Senate floor.
 The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said President Obama was pleased with Mr. Reid's decision. ''He supports the public option because it has the potential to play an essential role in holding insurance companies accountable through choice and competition,'' Mr. Gibbs said.
 Republicans and insurance companies assailed the decision. ''No matter what you call it or how you dress it up, the Democrats' proposal is government-run insurance,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.
 Liberal senators have urged Mr. Reid to include the public option in the bill he is putting together, working with versions approved by two Senate panels.
 At a town-hall-style meeting in Colorado in August, Mr. Obama complained that people on the left and the right had become ''fixated'' on the public plan, which he described as ''just one sliver'' of efforts to overhaul the health care system.
 For the moment, Senate Democratic leaders are taking an aggressive approach, defying Republicans and brushing aside the objections of moderate Democrats who are apprehensive about a public plan. ''All the national polls show a wide majority of Americans support the public option,'' Mr. Reid said.
 But Mr. Reid's decision will not be the last word. The Senate will probably spend weeks on the health care bill and could vote on dozens of amendments, including several to alter or eliminate his version of a public plan. At any stage, 60 votes could be required.

 TRIGGER OPTION: A mechanism that would require a public option to be set up in a state if private companies were not offering affordable insurance. Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, has proposed a trigger option when health insurance is not affordable to 95 percent of a state's residents. Before setting up a trigger option, Congress would have to wrestle with the definition of ''affordable.'' (pg.A20)

HEADLINE: Old Trick Threatens The Newest Weapons

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Despite a six-year effort to build trusted computer chips for military systems, the Pentagon now manufactures in secure facilities run by American companies only about 2 percent of the more than $3.5 billion of integrated circuits bought annually for use in military gear.
 That shortfall is viewed with concern by current and former United States military and intelligence agency executives who argue that the menace of so-called Trojan horses hidden in equipment circuitry is among the most severe threats the nation faces in the event of a war in which communications and weaponry rely on computer technology. 
 As advanced systems like aircraft, missiles and radars have become dependent on their computing capabilities, the specter of subversion causing weapons to fail in times of crisis, or secretly corrupting crucial data, has come to haunt military planners. The problem has grown more severe as most American semiconductor manufacturing plants have moved offshore.
 Only one-fifth of all computer chips are now made in the United States, and just one-quarter of the chips based on the most advanced technologies are built here, I.B.M. executives say. That has led the Pentagon and the National Security Agency to expand significantly the number of American plants authorized to manufacture chips for the Pentagon's Trusted Foundry program. 
 Despite the increases, semiconductor industry executives and Pentagon officials say, the United States lacks the ability to fulfill the capacity requirements needed to manufacture computer chips for classified systems.
 ''The department is aware that there are risks to using commercial technology in general and that there are greater risks to using globally sourced technology,'' said Robert Lentz, who before his retirement last month was in charge of the Trusted Foundry program as the deputy assistant defense secretary for cyber, identity and information assurance.
 Counterfeit computer hardware, largely manufactured in Asian factories, is viewed as a significant problem by private corporations and military planners. A recent White House review noted that there had been several ''unambiguous, deliberate subversions'' of computer hardware. 
 ''These are not hypothetical threats,'' the report's author, Melissa Hathaway, said in an e-mail message. ''We have witnessed countless intrusions that have allowed criminals to steal hundreds of millions of dollars and allowed nation-states and others to steal intellectual property and sensitive military information.''
 Ms. Hathaway declined to offer specifics.
 Cyberwarfare analysts argue that while most computer security efforts have until now been focused on software, tampering with hardware circuitry may ultimately be an equally dangerous threat. That is because modern computer chips routinely comprise hundreds of millions, or even billions, of transistors. The increasing complexity means that subtle modifications in manufacturing or in the design of chips will be virtually impossible to detect.
 ''Compromised hardware is, almost literally, a time bomb, because the corruption occurs well before the attack,'' Wesley K. Clark, a retired Army general, wrote in an article in Foreign Affairs magazine that warns of the risks the nation faces from insecure computer hardware. 
 ''Maliciously tampered integrated circuits cannot be patched,'' General Clark wrote. ''They are the ultimate sleeper cell.''
 Indeed, in cyberwarfare, the most ancient strategy is also the most modern. 
 Internet software programs known as Trojan horses have become a tool of choice for computer criminals who sneak malicious software into computers by putting it in seemingly innocuous programs. They then pilfer information and transform Internet-connected PCs into slave machines. With hardware, the strategy is an even more subtle form of sabotage, building a chip with a hidden flaw or a means for adversaries to make it crash when wanted. 
 Pentagon executives defend the manufacturing strategy, which is largely based on a 10-year contract with a secure I.B.M. chipmaking plant in Burlington, Vt., reported to be valued as high as $600 million, and a certification process that has been extended to 28 American chipmakers and related technology firms.
 ''The department has a comprehensive risk-management strategy that addresses a variety of risks in different ways,'' said Mitchell Komaroff, the director of a Pentagon program intended to develop a strategy to minimize national security risks in the face of the computer industry's globalization. 
 Mr. Komaroff pointed to advanced chip technologies that made it possible to buy standard hardware components that could be securely programmed after they were acquired. 
 But as military planners have come to view cyberspace as an impending battlefield, American intelligence agency experts said, all sides are arming themselves with the ability to create hardware Trojan horses and to hide them deep inside the circuitry of computer hardware and electronic devices to facilitate military attacks. 
 In the future, and possibly already hidden in existing weapons, clandestine additions to electronic circuitry could open secret back doors that would let the makers in when the users were depending on the technology to function. Hidden kill switches could be included to make it possible to disable computer-controlled military equipment from a distance. Such switches could be used by an adversary or as a safeguard if the technology fell into enemy hands. 
 A Trojan horse kill switch may already have been used. A 2007 Israeli Air Force attack on a suspected partly constructed Syrian nuclear reactor led to speculation about why the Syrian air defense system did not respond to the Israeli aircraft. Accounts of the event initially indicated that sophisticated jamming technology was used to blind the radars. Last December, however, a report in an American technical publication, IEEE Spectrum, cited a European industry source in raising the possibility that the Israelis might have used a built-in kill switch to shut down the radars. 
 Separately, an American semiconductor industry executive said in an interview that he had direct knowledge of the operation and that the technology for disabling the radars was supplied by Americans to the Israeli electronic intelligence agency, Unit 8200. 
 The disabling technology was given informally but with the knowledge of the American government, said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His claim could not be independently verified, and American military, intelligence and contractors with classified clearance declined to discuss the attack.
 The United States has used a variety of Trojan horses, according to various sources. 
 In 2004, Thomas C. Reed, an Air Force secretary in the Reagan administration, wrote that the United States had successfully inserted a software Trojan horse into computing equipment that the Soviet Union had bought from Canadian suppliers. Used to control a Trans-Siberian gas pipeline, the doctored software failed, leading to a spectacular explosion in 1982. 
 Crypto AG, a Swiss maker of cryptographic equipment, was the subject of intense international speculation during the 1980s when, after the Reagan administration took diplomatic actions in Iran and Libya, it was widely reported in the European press that the National Security Agency had access to a hardware back door in the company's encryption machines that made it possible to read electronic messages transmitted by many governments.
 According to a former federal prosecutor, who declined to be identified because of his involvement in the operation, during the early '80s the Justice Department, with the assistance of an American intelligence agency, also modified the hardware of a Digital Equipment Corporation computer to ensure that the machine -- being shipped through Canada to Russia -- would work erratically and could be disabled remotely.
 The American government began making a concerted effort to protect against hardware tampering in 2003, when Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz circulated a memorandum calling on the military to ensure the economic viability of domestic chipmakers. 
 In 2005, the Defense Science Advisory Board issued a report warning of the risks of foreign-made computer chips and calling on the Defense Department to create a policy intended to stem the erosion of American semiconductor manufacturing capacity.
 Former Pentagon officials said the United States had not yet adequately addressed the problem.
 ''The more we looked at this problem the more concerned we were,'' said Linton Wells II, formerly the principal deputy assistant defense secretary for networks and information integration. ''Frankly, we have no systematic process for addressing these problems.''

HEADLINE: What Could Have Been a Vacation Disaster Becomes a Lesson in Kindness

BYLINE: By STEVEN YANKIVER. 
By Steven Yankiver, as told to Joan Raymond. E-mail: joanraymond.nytimes.com

 BODY:
I WAS sitting in the Toronto Airport waiting for my flight back to New York. At that time, my business was focused on manufacturing point-of-purchase and traffic control signs. 
 I was bored. So I was just staring at the airport walls, which were covered with light-box advertising signs. I called my wife and asked her what she was doing. She told me she was in a doctor's waiting room. We laughed, since we were both just staring at the walls.
 Then an idea exploded in my head. I started thinking about how much more effective these wall signs would be if they were giving out a message. I guess I can thank boredom for giving me a great idea. Now, my company manufacturers wall-mounted digital screens with advertising and educational and entertainment programming. Their location? Physicians' offices. 
 Although I got that idea while in an airport, flying leaves a lot to be desired. That's because I fly coach. It can be uncomfortable, but it is economical. Fortunately, most of my trips are short hauls and I can indulge my passion for playing trivia games and chess, sometimes with my fellow coach passengers.
 But every time I'm in coach, I remember my first-class experience. 
 A few years ago, my wife, two sons and I were very excited about our long-anticipated holiday trip to the Galapagos Islands. 
 We arrived at Newark, and our plan was to take our flight to Ecuador. We thought everything was perfectly planned, and we were all smiles. In fact, we were almost giddy. My sons were looking forward to a week of eco-adventures, and my wife and I were thrilled that we were going to see a pristine paradise.
 We arrived extra early to make sure we wouldn't miss the flight, and we even had several hours built in to the schedule to make sure we would be able to meet the boat that would take us to the Galapagos once we landed.
 Like I said, we were all smiles until an airline agent told me that we weren't going anywhere. Apparently, the airline had overbooked the flight, and my family and I were out of luck.
 I'm a truly mild-mannered guy. But I went nearly insane. My eyes were popping out of my head, and I kept repeating, in an increasingly loud voice, something along the lines of how could the airline possibly overbook and deprive my family of their dream trip?
 I thought they were going to call security on me.
 But then a beautiful thing happened. An Ecuadorean man stepped forward and told me he was willing to give up his seat for us. Then an older woman stepped forward and said the same thing. And then an American businessman offered to give up his seat, too. 
 They were telling the agent they wanted my family to take our dream trip. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I know these people didn't want to give up their seats, but they were willing to do a good deed. 
 I thought I was going to cry. I didn't because all of a sudden the agent found us space on the flight, and no one had to give up their seats.
 We were seated in first class, and served Champagne and caviar. And our kids still talk about the wonderful chocolate chip cookies they ate on that flight.
 The trip was even better than we hoped. But I think something more important happened. 
 My kids saw that people want to help one another. But I have to say that they did want me to jump up and down again for the flight home. They thought we'd get seated in first class again.
 No such luck.
 Q. & A. 
 Q.How often do you fly?
 A. About 20 times a year.
 Q. What's your least favorite airport?
 A. Sao Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport in Brazil. Items were stolen from our suitcases, and airport employees were rude. 
 Q. Of all the places you've been, what's the best?
 A. Tel Aviv. It's a beautiful, energetic city, and every time I go there I feel like I'm being greeted by thousands of relatives.
 Q. What's your secret airport vice?
 A. I shut off my phone one hour before my flight takes off so I can play chess on my BlackBerry undisturbed.

HEADLINE: Patterns: Doctor Number Is Overstated, Study Finds

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Whether the nation faces a doctor shortage is a matter of debate. But a new study suggests there are already fewer doctors practicing than had been estimated, because of a lag in reporting retirements. 
 The new study, published in the Oct. 21 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, estimates that the United States has 788,000 active doctors -- 65,000 fewer than calculations have suggested. The doctor work force is also younger than previously estimated, with a greater proportion of doctors in their 20s and 30s and fewer who are 65 and older.
 By 2020, there will be 957,000 physicians, the new estimates show, rather than the 1.05 million previously projected. Only 9 percent will be 65 or older, or half as many as had been predicted. 
 The new analysis used census data to make projections.
 ''From 2005 to 2020, we project a 20 to 22 percent growth in the number of physicians,'' said the paper's lead author, Douglas O. Staiger, a Dartmouth economist. ''But because you start with a lower number, you end up with a lower number in the future -- with 9 percent fewer physicians by 2020.''
 Dr. Staiger said that did not necessarily mean there would be an acute shortage of doctors but that ''we need to get the baseline correct in order to make future forecasts.''

HEADLINE: A Call to Reduce Universities' Athletic Spending Strikes Some as Unrealistic

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
From stratospheric coaches' salaries to a growing divide between the haves and the have-nots of college sports, university presidents say they are very worried about the commercialization of intercollegiate athletics. Yet they feel powerless to do much about it, according to a survey of 95 presidents released Monday by the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, a watchdog group.
 The survey, which was limited to presidents of universities that are members of the Football Bowl Subdivision, is seen as a first step by the Knight Commission in addressing what many consider the most pressing issue facing college sports today: how to defuse the ''arms race'' in spending by the nation's top college sports programs and ensure that institutions with smaller budgets can continue to compete. 
''We see a situation where athletics expenditures are rising three or four times faster than expenditures in academic programs,'' said William E. Kirwan, a co-chairman of the commission and the chancellor of Maryland's university system. ''That's obviously not something that can continue. We are in an environment that certainly calls for -- and I would say almost demands -- change.''
 But several people who attended a meeting of the commission Monday said attaining real financial parity was likely to be time-consuming, contentious and nearly impossible. ''The concept of a level playing field is aspirational, but I'm not sure it's ever completely achievable,'' said Wally Renfro, a vice president and special adviser to the president of the N.C.A.A. ''So do I see there's going to be a change in that regard? I really don't.''
 Disparities between rich and poor athletic programs have been a concern almost since the inception of intercollegiate sports, but many say the gap has widened in recent years as large universities have chased after corporate sponsorships and television deals to finance new facilities and to lure celebrity coaches with multimillion dollar salaries. According to a Knight Commission analysis of N.C.A.A. data, the top-level programs in the 120-member F.B.S. generate revenues that are 14 times higher than the programs at the bottom level.
 ''I think the magnitude of the differences within Division I has really escalated in the past 10 years,'' said R. Gerald Turner, a co-chairman of the commission and president of Southern Methodist. The commission, a group that has pressured the N.C.A.A. to implement academic reform and shift control to university presidents, has identified financial reform as its next priority. ''This is really what it's all about: trying to get a consensus within the membership to come up with a more sustainable model.''
 The survey, which was conducted this year and included detailed follow-up interviews with 22 presidents, found some disconnects between the presidents' desire for change and the financial realities they face. A majority said they supported studying changes in spending across the F.B.S., but given a choice would rather just make more money.
 The recession has forced all levels of universities to reduce athletic spending -- the survey found that 60 percent of presidents said they had made cuts to athletics this year -- but Turner said wealthier ones had fared better. ''The economy, I think, has put a lot of stress on anyone in the lower two-thirds,'' he said.
 Few agreed on how to achieve reform. Presidents, according to the survey report, ''don't see themselves as the force for the changes needed, nor have they identified an alternative force they believe could be effective.'' 
 Turner said the presidents were wary of acting independently, without the backing of either their own trustees or other presidents. ''I think it's a sense of, I can't do this by myself,'' he said. ''It's going to take a broad-based sense of unanimity.''
 One challenge is the fact that millions of dollars in football revenue are overseen not by the N.C.A.A., but by the conferences and the universities that control the Bowl Championship Series, which crowns a champion in the F.B.S. Any solution would require the assent of the highest-earning conferences and universities, which are reluctant to part with their revenue. Other actions -- like limiting coaches' salaries -- could violate federal antitrust laws. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, likened the situation to asking wealthy universities to share their endowments. ''When I look at Harvard or Yale and their endowments, I do not see money moving to Haverford or Hofstra,'' he said. 
 Delany also warned of the risks involved in reducing spending. Doing so is likely to raise the ire of donors, university trustees and members of the public. ''It is a contact sport,'' Delany said. ''I've found it much easier to generate revenue than to cut costs. I'm being honest with you.''
 Nevertheless, a group representing athletic directors recommended a series of cost-cutting measures -- including reducing the size of travel squads as well as the number of regular-season games in some sports. ''We are prepared to move these forward,'' said Dutch Baughman, the executive director of the Division I-A Athletic Directors Association.
 Turner and Kirwan said they did not have a vision for what successful reform would look like, apart from the goal of bringing athletics into proportion with the rest of the university. Despite the obstacles, Kirwan said: ''I think there is a realism out there that we cannot solve this problem with more revenue. And I think everybody understands that.''

HEADLINE: For Delphi Pensioners, The Union Label Helps

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

DATELINE: WARREN, Ohio 

 BODY:
Bruce Gump and his neighbors feared for their retirement checks when the federal government took over the pension plans at Delphi, the big auto parts maker where they once worked. 
 But four months later, Mr. Gump finds himself in a far more perilous condition than his neighbors.
 On his street, he is the only Delphi worker whose pension benefits may be cut. His neighbors all belong to unions and have received a lifeline in an unprecedented deal related to the government-supervised bankruptcy of General Motors, the onetime parent of Delphi. (G.M. spun off the parts division as a separate company 10 years ago.) 
 Mr. Gump and some 21,000 other salaried workers and retirees are furious that their roughly 46,000 union co-workers at Delphi have had their benefits restored, apparently with government largesse, and they have not.
 ''They've been relatively well taken care of,'' he said. ''But I'm being thrown out with yesterday's trash.'' 
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures pension plans, caps the amount of benefits it will pay, using a formula based on age and the type of benefits an employee earned. But in a side arrangement, G.M. is agreeing to pay special supplements, called top-ups, so that Delphi's union retirees get everything they were promised. 
 The automaker is drawing the money from its own pension fund, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. In a sense, the G.M. pension fund is being weakened to help the Delphi union members. 
 Mr. Gump and others suspect the Treasury Department told G.M. to pay the supplements. The federal government is both the company's largest shareholder and the financier of its restructuring, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Obama administration officials confirmed that they brought the parties together to negotiate a resolution of Delphi's pension failure but said they did not dictate the outcome.
 The difference between the haves and have-nots at Delphi is not between the highly paid and lower-wage earners. As a senior engineer, Mr. Gump simply did not belong to a union. Neither did Delphi's thousands of other engineers, bookkeepers, clerks, quality controllers, purchasing agents and other white-collar employees. They may have earned more in some cases, but they did not have the chance to earn paid overtime as union members did in good years. Records show the average pay for a nonunion worker just shy of 50 years old, with 20 to 24 years' service, was about $96,000.
 ''Why did the hourly folks get what they needed and the salaried folks get nothing, if the bankruptcy process is supposed to be fair?'' asked Paul Beiter, who retired as finance manager of a Delphi plant in Rochester. ''The U.S. government is taking care of a select group of people and tossing the rest of us under the bus.''
 Mr. Beiter estimated that slightly fewer than half of Delphi's white-collar retirees would have their pensions cut, by 30 to 70 percent. One woman in his area who had earned a pension of $2,925 a month checked with the Guaranty Corporation and was told her retirement check would be pared to $390. But others will have smaller losses, and some will not lose at all.
 The wide-ranging losses occur because of the way Congress devised the pension insurance program. It gave the biggest protection to the elderly, so that in practice, people in their 50s take the biggest hits. 
 Congress also wanted to discourage companies from promising rich benefits, then sticking the pension agency with the bills. For that reason, the program does not cover high dollar amounts, pension sweeteners granted just before a bankruptcy, and certain early-retirement benefits. 
 At Delphi, both the union members and the white-collar workers earned valuable supplements if they retired early, and Delphi raised basic benefits for both groups while it was in Chapter 11. The government insurance will not cover any of those extras. But only the white-collar retirees will feel the pain, because G.M. has agreed to top up the union retirees anyway.
 ''A bunch of men in dark glasses in a smoke-filled room tossing dice to determine thousands of people's fates is what this feels like,'' said the woman, 50, who will get a $390 monthly check. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's limits depend on whether each person was qualified to retire on the date the plan failed; at 29 years and 11 months, she missed the cut-off for more favorable treatment by one month. Because she still works at Delphi, she asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation. 
 The idea that G.M. might back up Delphi's pensions emerged in 1999, during the spinoff. Companies that spin off subsidiaries are supposed to shift adequate pension assets to the new company, and the automaker did this for its white-collar workers. 
 But it did not have enough money to cover the benefits of the Delphi union workers, who are represented by the United Auto Workers, the United Steelworkers and the International Union of Electrical Workers. 
 The unions threatened to block the spinoff. To appease them, G.M. promised that if the pension fund for the hourly workers at Delphi ever collapsed, it would restore any benefits that the government refused to pay. 
 White-collar workers did not get such a promise. They said they did not expect to need one; their pensions were fully funded. 
 What they did not take into account was how quickly a pension surplus can evaporate. A big chunk of the money disappeared in the bear market that followed. An emergency financing rule eventually forced Delphi to pump more money into the pension fund -- but by then the company was in trouble. Delphi declared bankruptcy in 2005, to avoid having to spend precious cash on more pension contributions.
 Once in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, it could defer contributions. 
 Delphi spent four years in bankruptcy and contributed only a fraction of the amounts owed to its white-collar pension fund in that time. Meanwhile, the fund was paying out about $150 million a year. By the time the pension agency stepped in, the plan for salaried workers was $2.5 billion short. The union plan was $4.3 billion short.
 With the recession taking its toll, G.M. needed government financing to survive and wound up in a controlled bankruptcy, closing plants, shedding dealerships and trying to cut costs. Initially, it was going to pay supplements only to Delphi's retirees who belong to the U.A.W., because that was the only union representing its workers after the bankruptcy. But the steelworkers' and electrical workers' unions cried foul, and they got the top-ups from G.M. too. 
 The white-collar workers cried foul -- to no avail. 
 Administration officials said it would be wrong to think politics had any role in the outcome at Delphi. They said G.M. paid top-ups to the union retirees because it had promised to do so in 1999. The white-collar retirees got nothing because G.M. had not promised them anything.
 A spokesman for G.M., Tom Wilkinson, said he was sympathetic to the white-collar retirees' plight. But the fate of their pensions in bankruptcy ''isn't something that G.M. has any control over,'' he said. ''G.M. doesn't have the legal obligation, nor does it have the money to re-fund those pensions.''
 Of course, G.M. does not really have the money to pay the top-ups to Delphi's union retirees either. It is operating with $53 billion in assistance from the Treasury after failing to find financing anywhere else. 
 Officials of the pension agency said there was no precedent for the Delphi situation but declined to comment further. In another time, the agency might have argued that if G.M. had enough money to pay top-ups, the automaker should transfer that money to the government pension insurer to help cover its costs. The insurance is provided by premiums paid by companies, but that funding is proving inadequate in an age of industry-wide restructurings and giant failures.

HEADLINE: The Case for More Stimulus

 BODY:
The consensus among economists is that the recession is over, and, technically, the herd is probably right. Corporate profitability has been boosted by job cuts, pay cuts and a drive to restock depleted inventories. Immense federal stimulus has jolted the economy. 
 But what happens when those measures run their course? The economy is going to need more government support, or it is bound to be very weak for a very long time -- and vulnerable to a relapse into recession. Unemployment is expected to worsen well into next year, exceeding 10 percent. Foreclosures are expected to rise, which will push home values down further. Hundreds of small and midsize banks are likely to fail in coming years. State and local governments face budget shortfalls in 2010 that are as bad or worse than this year's. 
 Yet Washington is not providing a coherent plan for effective stimulus. The Senate has been hamstrung for nearly a month over the most basic relief-and-recovery boost: an extension of unemployment benefits. The Obama administration has called for an expensive crowd-pleaser of dubious effectiveness: sending every Social Security recipient an extra $250. 
 And Washington is mired in a warped political debate. Congressional Republicans say continued economic weakness is proof that February's stimulus package failed. Lawmakers in both parties fret that large budget deficits preclude more stimulus, lest the burden of debt outweigh the benefit of deficit spending. 
 Both arguments are wrong. If anything, ongoing economic problems are a sign that stimulus needs to be bolstered. Deficits are a serious issue, but the immediate need for stimulus trumps the longer-term need for deficit reduction. A self-reinforcing stretch of economic weakness would be far costlier than additional stimulus. 
 The Senate could take a step in the right direction by extending unemployment benefits without further delay. That is the single most effective way to boost consumption -- which, in turn, preserves jobs -- because it creates spending that would otherwise not occur. 
 Next, Congress and the administration should agree on ways to ease the dire financial condition of the states. Most important is continued aid for state Medicaid programs, which would ensure vital services, support jobs and free up money for other needs. Governors will begin to prepare their new budgets in early 2010, and those budgets will be in effect for a year, starting in July. So the states need to know soon what to expect from the federal government through mid-2011. As long as the states are suffering, any economic recovery efforts by the federal government are undermined. 
 Other measures being floated are less effective than unemployment benefits and aid to states. Many of the $250 checks to Social Security beneficiaries will not be spent quickly, because many recipients have no pressing need for the extra money. Proposals by some lawmakers to extend and expand the $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers are even less well targeted. Since it was enacted in February, only an estimated 15 percent of buyers who claimed the credit needed the money to make the purchase. It's not stimulus when you pay people to do something they would have done anyway. It's waste.
 To be highly effective as stimulus, cash aid must be targeted to needy populations. The housing market would be better served by a reinvigorated attempt to reduce foreclosures, including, at long last, reducing principal balances for the millions of people who owe more on their homes than they are worth.
 Without another round of effective stimulus, the worst recession in modern memory will likely become -- at best -- the weakest recovery in modern memory. Another boost to federal spending that is targeted and timely should not be too much for politicians to deliver.

HEADLINE: Shares Sink on Jitters and Dollar's Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A strengthening dollar and worries about an overheated market pounded stocks on Monday.
 Shares started the day higher but turned sharply lower at midmorning as interest rates rose and a rebound in the value of the dollar stalled a rally in commodities. Early gains in prices for oil and other basic materials had pushed up shares of energy and materials companies.
 The sharp swings in currency and commodity markets sent the Dow Jones industrial average whipsawing in a 200-point range, surrendering an early advance for a loss of 104 points. Stocks have fallen in four of the last five days. 
 Oil gave up early gains to slide $1.82, to $78.68 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That hurt the shares of major oil companies like ConocoPhillips. 
 Changes in the dollar's value against other currencies like the euro or Japanese yen frequently send commodity prices up or down. Since most commodities are priced in dollars, they become more attractive to non-American investors when the dollar is weak and more expensive when the dollar is strong.
 Analysts also said some investors were looking to pocket gains after a stock market run that has stretched nearly eight months and taken last week's share prices to their highest levels in a year.
 Technology shares fared somewhat better than other parts of the market after the Marvell Technology Group, which makes chips used in phone networks, raised its fiscal third-quarter revenue forecast. That helped the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index limit its losses.
 RadioShack's third-quarter sales topped expectations, giving hope to retailers.
 Richard Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson in New York, said the direction of the dollar as well as volatility continued to drive trading. ''You're seeing this sort of waltz between the dollar and volatility and stocks,'' he said.
 The Dow fell 104.22, or 1.1 percent, to 9,867.96.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.65, or 1.2 percent, to 1,066.94. The index, which is the basis for many mutual funds, is down 2.8 percent from its recent peak a week ago.
 The Nasdaq fell 12.62, or 0.6 percent, to 2,141.85.
 About three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.4 billion shares, compared with 1.3 billion on Friday.
 The Dow fell 0.2 percent last week, while the S.& P. 500 fell 0.7 percent.
 Bond prices slipped as the government prepared to auction more than $120 billion in debt this week. The dollar rose against most other major currencies, while gold fell.
 David Hefty, chief executive at Cornerstone Wealth Management, said the market's recent gains would give investors reason for caution. Last week, major indexes hit new highs for the year. ''Anytime you're flirting with the top, it's hard to push through,'' he said.
 Traders looked to another busy week of earnings reports. Investors will look for clues about a possible pickup in consumer spending when companies including Kellogg, Procter & Gamble and Visa report earnings.
 Marvell rose 41 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $14.99, while Radio- Shack rose $2.49, or 16 percent, to $18.15. ConocoPhillips fell $1.23, or 2.4 percent, to $50.74. 
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.18, or 1.2 percent, to 593.68.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 17/32, to 100 18/32. The yield rose to 3.55 percent, from 3.49 percent late on Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities:

PERSON: Paul Bloom 

HEADLINE: Paul Bloom, 70; Won Billions From Big Oil

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Paul L. Bloom, a lawyer in the Carter administration's Energy Department who pursued oil companies for overcharging and won billions of dollars in refunds for customers, the government and others, died Oct. 10 in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 70.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said. 
 James Schlesinger, as the first secretary of the new Department of Energy, appointed Mr. Bloom in 1977 to investigate oil companies' compliance with oil pricing regulations. President Richard M. Nixon had begun oil price controls as a temporary measure at the time of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, but enforcement of the regulations was lax.
 Mr. Bloom, as special counsel for compliance, ended up accusing 33 of the 35 largest oil producers and refiners of overcharges amounting to $11 billion. By 1987, the government had collected $6 billion in refunds as a result of Mr. Bloom's suits.
 But other than the pleasures of success, it was often a thankless job. Oil companies complained, with some justification, that the rules, and Mr. Bloom's interpretations, were maddeningly arcane. Economists said price controls, by definition, weakened market efficiency. Consumer groups criticized Mr. Bloom as being too willing to settle cases, often on terms favorable to the industry.
 Mr. Bloom, who had been a natural resources lawyer in New Mexico, responded bluntly. ''I had to make myself obnoxious or nothing would have ever been accomplished,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1980.
 The Carter administration began to address oil pricing by appointing a task force to study it. Mr. Bloom was a member. The task force found a lack of direction and inertia among the 350 lawyers and accountants monitoring oil prices. Some auditors assigned to individual refineries had moved television sets into their offices and spent the day watching soap operas, Mr. Bloom told The Times. One auditing team had been allowed to remain at Mobil in New York, even though the company's operations had moved to Houston, The National Journal reported. 
 The task force decided that one person should be given great authority to administer enforcement and clean up the muddle of the past. Mr. Bloom was given the job. He increased his staff of professionals to more than 600 while using several hundred auditors employed by private firms. Together they cast a wide net of subpoenas. 
 The National Journal said in 1980 that Mr. Bloom had played a high-stakes poker game with the oil companies, making strong accusations and brandishing the real but unspoken threat of criminal action. The companies complained that the government's rules were almost impossible to follow. One requirement forced companies to classify oil from the same general geographic area as either ''old'' oil, which was subject to price controls, or more recently discovered oil, which could be sold for the market price.
 Mr. Bloom angered critics of the oil companies by allowing the industry to keep some overcharges that could not be readily refunded and to put the money into domestic oil and gas exploration.
 Asked by The National Journal in 1980 if he was letting companies off the hook by allowing them to do what they would normally do on their own, he said, ''I don't think I have to apologize to anybody, if I can get them to spend that money here instead of Nigeria or the North Sea.''
 Paul Laurence Bloom was born in Norfolk, Va., on May 14, 1939. He graduated from the University of Chicago and the University of New Mexico School of Law. He then worked for New Mexico as a water and natural resources lawyer.
 When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, he ended oil price controls, but kept a smaller staff to finish Mr. Bloom's cases. Mr. Bloom stayed in Washington to practice law but remained active in New Mexico affairs by affiliating with a New Mexico law firm. He sometimes represented Indian tribes.
 Mr. Bloom is survived by his wife, Marjorie; his sons Adam and Judah; and his daughter, Ester Bloom.
 One of Mr. Bloom's last acts as the Carter administration was ending was to give four charities $1 million each from $4 million in unexpected refunds from a major oil company. The Reagan administration complained that he had given away taxpayers' money, but he maintained that he had given the money to those who could best reach poor people with heating needs.
 In the end, the charities distributed part of the money themselves and returned some to the government.

HEADLINE: Fund Plans to Invest in Companies With Women as Directors

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
A Swiss investment company plans to raise awareness about the shortage of women on corporate boards around the world and generate returns for its investors in the process.
 Naissance Capital, based in Zurich, will start the Women's Leadership Fund in January, which will invest in companies whose boards include women. It also plans to take minority stakes in companies without women on their boards and to use its ownership to encourage changes. 
 R. James Breiding, a co-founder of Naissance Capital and a former director of Rothschild Corporate Finance, said the fund was created after several studies showed a correlation between the number of female directors and a company's performance.
 ''We feel companies that select and recruit people on merit should do better,'' Mr. Breiding said. ''Having greater diversity and independence of opinions helps.''
 The fund's board includes Kim Campbell, the former prime minister of Canada; Cherie Blair, a lawyer and the wife of Tony Blair, the former British prime minister; and Jenny Shipley, the former prime minister of New Zealand. 
 Naissance has lined up $200 million from institutional investors and individuals to invest in 30 to 40 companies around the world, and plans to increase the size of the fund eventually to about $2 billion. The minimum investment for the fund is $100,000. Naissance, which was founded in 1999 and specializes in what it calls ''niche investment opportunities,'' is one of a handful of firms that have created funds over the last three years to invest in companies with female senior executives.
 Stargate Capital in Britain is in the process of raising a second venture capital fund, worth about $:10 million ($16 million) to help female entrepreneurs. Amazone Euro, a fund run in Geneva, has invested in companies with female board members.
 Two separate studies in 2007 by McKinsey and Catalyst, both business research firms, showed that the companies in Europe and the United States with the most women on their boards were more profitable than others. The studies did not point to specific causes for any such correlation.
 The banking crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers have ignited a debate about whether more women in senior roles would help improve corporate governance. 
 In Britain, the minister for women and equality, Harriet Harman, drew attention after she partly blamed the lack of women in senior roles in the financial industry for the crisis, saying if it had been ''Lehman Sisters'' rather than Lehman Brothers, the company might have survived.
 A review sponsored by the British government on an overhaul of corporate governance, to be published next month, could add to pressures on companies to promote equality of the sexes among their directors.
 Europe lags behind the United States in gender equality in boardrooms, according to the consulting firm 20-First. About 68 percent of companies in Europe have no women on their executive committees, compared with 11 percent in the United States. In Asia, the figure is 82 percent.

HEADLINE: Post-Bailout Blues as Europe Orders ING Group to Sell 2 Units

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and CHRIS V. NICHOLSON

 BODY:
A year ago, governments around the world scrambled to pull their biggest banks from the brink of collapse. Now, policy makers are wrestling with just how much to rein in the financial behemoths that contributed to the crisis.
 How large and interconnected banks should be, and whether they should ever be bailed out again by taxpayers, boils down to whether financial institutions should be allowed to become too big to fail. Regulators are already putting down some markers.
On Monday, the Dutch financial conglomerate ING Group became the first bank to be ordered broken up by regulators as the price for a taxpayer bailout of 10 billion euros ($14.9 billion). Under pressure from the European Commission, the bank announced plans to accelerate the sale of its insurance operations and its Internet banking business in the United States to refocus on its European customer base. ING nearly collapsed last fall under a mountain of troubled American mortgage assets. 
 Other European banks propped up by taxpayer money, like the Royal Bank of Scotland and Commerzbank of Germany, could soon face pressure to sell major businesses, too. 
 In the United States, regulators have been opposed to strict size limits on banks, and have so far focused on whether banks are too big to manage. Federal regulators ordered Citigroup, perhaps the most troubled large American bank, for example, to streamline its operations, but stopped short of splitting up the company. 
 This week, American lawmakers are expected to bring the global debate about whether banks are too big to manage -- or just too big -- to the top of the regulatory agenda. Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the House Financial Services Committee chairman, plans to introduce proposals to make it easier for regulators to take control of large, failing financial firms, and if necessary, split them up.
 Fear that new rules could make financial companies more stable, but potentially less lucrative to investors, sent bank stocks tumbling on Monday. The KBW index of bank stocks fell 4 percent. 
 Many analysts already see a drastic reshaping ahead in the finance industry, whether governments pressure banks to divest themselves of specific assets, or indirectly encourage downsizing with polices that require the banks to hold more capital.
 ''This is rippling across the world,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics. ''Large banks are being forced to break up and sell assets because they do not have enough capital.'' 
 Some prominent government officials say they do not believe the current efforts to reduce the size and activities of large banks with big trading businesses have gone far enough. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have questioned whether banks with retail deposits that are guaranteed by taxpayers should be allowed to use that money to place big trading bets. In a speech last week, Mr. King called the current arrangement ''rather unworldly.'' 
 The Obama administration's position is toned down. It would still let banks engage in lucrative trading activities, but hopes to curtail them by requiring them to hold more capital. Many of the too-big-to-fail banks, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have posted three consecutive quarters of big trading profits. 
 But ING's announcement may be a sign of where the global political winds are blowing. 
 ''You are starting to see forced disposals,'' said Meredith Whitney, a leading banking analyst who has been bearish on financial companies. ''You can't hold onto the Malibu Barbie house and go and get subsidies for your worst toys. If the government comes and helps you, you have to part with your best toys.''
 After being propped up by the Dutch government over the last year, ING has come under increasing pressure from European officials to streamline its operations. Dutch taxpayers injected capital and agreed to guarantee a large pool of troubled bonds backed by mortgages issued to American borrowers. ING is based in Amsterdam.
 European Commission officials cried foul, concerned that the terms of the guarantee had provided a generous subsidy to ING at the expense of its rivals. But analysts say that behind those remarks, there may been elements of financial nationalism. If European taxpayer money was now involved, why was ING bailing out its investments backed by real estate in the United States?
 ING officials, meanwhile, concluded that a business strategy with banking and insurance under the same roof was no longer viable. ''The costs of complexity now outweigh the advantages we once saw,'' said Jan H. M. Hommen, the chief executive of ING. By 2014, he added, ING would become a ''predominantly European bank'' with a lower international profile.
 As part of its deal with European Commission officials, ING agreed to accelerate the sale of its insurance operations and would repay half of the government bailout by raising about 7.5 billion euros ($11 billion) from selling new rights to purchase its stock. ING also agreed to shed ING Direct, its Internet banking unit in the United States, by 2013. It will also make additional payments to the Dutch government, tied to the insurance on the pool of troubled mortgage assets. And after years of aggressive growth, ING agreed to stop making acquisitions and ''not be a price leader'' until it repaid what it owed Dutch taxpayers. 
 The Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group, both partly nationalized by Britain, are coming under pressure to begin selling assets. In June, Europe's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said there was a strong ''likelihood of significant divestments'' for those two banks. 
 And in May, the European Commission approved Germany's injection of 10 billion euros into Commerzbank, on the condition that it shrink its balance sheet by 45 percent by curbing its investment banking activities and selling a real estate unit.

HEADLINE: Breaking Out the Santas and Snow Globes

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THEY'RE off! Although trick-or-treaters are still days away from ringing doorbells, the nation's retailers are already starting their mad dash toward the Christmas finish line.
 The efforts to stimulate holiday feelings ahead of schedule are, of course, a result of the dire economy, as retailers remain anxious about the parsimonious mood among shoppers. The National Retail Federation predicts that Christmas sales will decline 1 percent from Christmas 2008 -- not as bad as last year, when retail holiday revenue fell 3.4 percent from 2007, but still not in positive territory.
 So stores are already stocking shelves with Christmas gifts, dusting off the decorations and outlining marketing plans. And like last year, when the financial crisis brought forth a flood of retail campaigns with retro-traditional themes, ads for Christmas 2009 will be chockablock with Santas, reindeer, candy canes, family gatherings and snow globes. 
 The idea is that those verities resonate more in hard times among a worried public. For instance, the Macy's unit of Macy's Inc. will urge consumers to ''Believe'' with an emotional campaign that reprises elements from Christmas 2008 like donations to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and mailboxes in stores where letters to Santa can be deposited. 
 New aspects include sending the Macy's Santa on a tour of 25 cities in 25 days and an animated special on CBS, sponsored by Macy's, to be broadcast on Dec. 11, which the retailer is calling ''an honorary National Believe Day.''
 A rival of Macy's, the J. C. Penney Company, is preparing a campaign that carries a theme with a timeless tack: ''Joy of giving.'' The theme, returning from last year, will be front and center in advertising for the metropolitan New York market, tailored to promote the new Penney store at the Manhattan Mall in Midtown.
 The Gotham-centric Penney ads, scheduled to begin on Monday, will remind potential customers concerned about the economy that holiday shopping can be brought in on a budget.
 ''Merry Christmas to all, and to all a great price,'' one ad proclaims. ''Give like Santa, save like Scrooge,'' another says. ''Give N.Y.C. style at J.C.P. prices,'' a third ad asserts.
 Although ''we're still waiting to see'' how enthusiastically consumers will spend for Christmas, Mike Boylson, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Penney, said in an interview at the Manhattan store, ''we're going to fight for share of market.''
 For example, the Penney campaign for metropolitan New York will be ''very aggressive'' in media like outdoor advertising, he added. The focus on value is motivated by research that indicates shoppers intend to buy ''more practical gifts, more stocking stuffers, more things that are affordable,'' Mr. Boylson said, and by indications ''they're not going to go back to the way it was before'' the bubble burst in fall 2008.
 ''Even if you have money,'' he added, ''it's no longer cool to show off.''
 The Penney holiday ads -- created internally and by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe -- ''will have a very upbeat tone,'' Mr. Boylson said, to reflect that ''Christmas is even more important'' in times like these.
 Macy's will also take that approach, said Martine Reardon, executive vice president for marketing at Macy's, despite being unable to forecast ''what the mood is going to be like'' among shoppers.
 ''Believing in a very special time of year and a person who personifies the wishes people make,'' Ms. Reardon said, referring to Santa Claus, ''goes back to the DNA of our brand because our brand is embedded in tradition.''
 As it was last year, the ''Believe'' campaign will be centered on the letter written by Virginia O'Hanlon to The New York Sun in 1897 and the reply by an editor, Francis Pharcellus Church, that has become known by a line he wrote: ''Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.'' 
 The 2009 campaign is to begin on Nov. 6 with a section of the Macy's Web site and a television commercial featuring a contemporary version of Virginia getting a hand in mailing her letter to Santa from a Macy's spokeswoman, Queen Latifah. 
 Macy's will again donate a dollar to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for each Virginia-esque letter to Santa deposited in the mailboxes in its stores (up to $1 million). The donation last year totaled $1 million, Ms. Reardon said.
 The animated TV special, titled ''Yes, Virginia,'' is being produced by Macy's and its creative agency, JWT New York -- part of the JWT unit of WPP -- along with the Ebeling Group and MEC Entertainment, part of another WPP agency, Mediaedge:cia. 
 ''The country does need to believe again,'' said Matt MacDonald, a creative director at JWT New York who worked on the campaign with Wayne Best, an executive creative director. ''We need faith in ourselves.''
 ''We wanted to tell richer, deeper stories this year about what it means to believe in something,'' Mr. MacDonald said, ''something you can't prove'' -- another reference to Santa Claus.
 Speaking of whom, Ms. Reardon says the Santa tour is planned to begin on Nov. 28 in South Portland, Me., and conclude on Dec. 22 in Metairie, La. Stops will include Macy's stores in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.
 (Yes, Santa Claus, there is a Virginia. And he is to visit West Virginia, too.)
 ''We give him dinner'' after the Thanksgiving Day Parade, Ms. Reardon said of the Macy's Santa, ''and then he gets started.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Queen Latifah in a holiday commercial for Macy's, with a girl portraying Virginia, author of that famous letter to Santa. The ad campaign is to begin on Nov. 6 with a Web site and the TV spots.
 Shoppers are ''not going to go back to the way it was before,'' said Mike Boylson, the chief marketing officer at J. C. Penney.

HEADLINE: The Fatal Conceit

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Humans are overconfident creatures. Ninety-four percent of college professors believe they are above average teachers, and 90 percent of drivers believe they are above average behind the wheel. Researchers Paul J.H. Schoemaker and J. Edward Russo gave computer executives quizzes on their industry. Afterward, the executives estimated that they had gotten 5 percent of the answers wrong. In fact, they had gotten 80 percent of the answers wrong.
 Fortunately, for those who study the human comedy, the epicenter of overconfidence moves from year to year. Up until recently, people in the financial world bathed in the warm glow of their own self-approval. Hubris in that world always takes the same form: The geniuses there come to believe that they have mastered risk. The future is an algorithm and they've cracked the code. 
 Over the past year, the bonfire of overconfidence has shifted to Washington. Since the masters of finance have been exposed as idiots, the masters of government have concluded (somewhat illogically) that they must be really smart.
 Overconfidence in government also has a characteristic form: that of highly rational Olympians who attempt to stand above problems and solve them in a finely tuned and impartial manner. In moments of government overconfidence, officials come to see society not as a dynamic and complex organism, but as a machine, which can be rebuilt. In such moments, governance and engineering merge into one.
 Examples of this overconfidence abound. But let us pick just one: the effort to cap financial compensation.
 Back in the days of Wall Street overconfidence, the financial titans believed that they deserved to give each other G.D.P.-level pay packages, even though there is no evidence that such packages improve performance. Now in disgrace, Wall Street firms are rewriting their rules, but the Obama administration has decided it should take control of compensation reform. Nobody seriously believes high pay caused the financial meltdown; it was bubblicious groupthink. But cutting executive pay just polls so well. 
 Every great action can be done in a spirit of humility or in a spirit of overconfidence. Regulating pay in a spirit of humility would mean rebalancing the power between shareholders and executives, without getting government involved in micromanaging individual pay decisions.
 But this is not a moment of humility. Treasury officials are now making individual pay-package decisions across an array of different companies -- and they must have really big brains to understand the motivational psychology of all those different people. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has decided to police banks and veto pay deals that lead to excessive risk. Those experts must have absolutely gigantic brains if they can define excessive risk years before investments pay off. 
 The best and the brightest in government are now rewriting existing pay contracts and determining that certain firms will be compelled to pay much less than their competitors. They're not leveling the playing field, as a humble government would do. They're making it less level in complicated ways.
 Reality, of course, has a way of upending finely crafted plans. The effort to cap golden parachutes in 1989 perversely caused companies to increase their golden parachute packages right up to the legal limit. A 1993 law to cap C.E.O. pay led to greater use of stock options and encouraged riskier behavior.
 In advance of the current new pay restrictions, 12 out of the 25 highest-paid executives have already left A.I.G., and 11 out of 25 have left Bank of America. We'll never know how much future talent was dissuaded from working at these ailing firms.
 Citigroup used to have a really high-performing energy unit. But under the new salary regime, the bank wasn't permitted to pay the chief of that unit what he thought he was worth. Citigroup was forced to sell that profitable unit at bargain-basement prices to Occidental Petroleum.
 These rules probably won't even have a big effect on executive wealth. They'll just drive compensation into back channels and risk-taking into unseen parts of the market.
 Again, the issue is not whether government acts, but whether it acts with an awareness of the limits of its knowledge. Sometimes we seem to have a government with no sense of those limits, no sense that perhaps government officials don't know how to restructure General Motors, pick the most promising battery technology, re-engineer the health care system from the top, or fine-tune the complex system of executive pay.
 Furthermore, when extending federal authority, the Obama folks never seem to ask how Republicans will use this power when they regain the White House. The Democrats trust themselves to set private-sector salaries and use extralegal means to go after malefactors, but would they trust a future Dick Cheney?
 I hope they know what they're doing. Because when a future Cheney comes into office, I'm pretty sure he'll be coming after columnists' salaries first.

HEADLINE: Changing The World

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
One of the most cherished items in my possession is a postcard that was sent from Mississippi to the Upper West Side of Manhattan in June 1964. 
 ''Dear Mom and Dad,'' it says, ''I have arrived safely in Meridian, Mississippi. This is a wonderful town and the weather is fine. I wish you were here. The people in this city are wonderful and our reception was very good. All my love, Andy.''
 That was the last word sent to his family by Andrew Goodman, a 20-year-old college student who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, along with fellow civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and James Chaney, on his first full day in Mississippi -- June 21, the same date as the postmark on the card. The goal of the three young men had been to help register blacks to vote. 
 The postcard was given to me by Andrew's brother, David, who has become a good friend.
 Andrew and that postcard came to mind over the weekend as I was thinking about the sense of helplessness so many ordinary Americans have been feeling as the nation is confronted with one enormous, seemingly intractable problem after another. The helplessness is beginning to border on paralysis. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly a decade long, are going badly, and there is no endgame in sight.
 Monday morning's coffee was accompanied by stories about suicide bombings in the heart of Baghdad that killed at least 150 people and wounded more than 500 and helicopter crashes in Afghanistan that killed 14 Americans.
 Here at home, the terrible toll from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression continues, with no end to the joblessness in sight and no comprehensible plans for fashioning a healthy economy for the years ahead. The government's finances resemble a Ponzi scheme. If you want to see the epidemic that is really clobbering American families, look past the H1N1 virus to the home foreclosure crisis.
 The Times ran a Page A1 article on Monday that said layoffs, foreclosures and other problems associated with the recession had resulted in big increases in the number of runaway children, many of whom were living in dangerous conditions in the streets.
 Americans have tended to watch with a remarkable (I think frightening) degree of passivity as crises of all sorts have gripped the country and sent millions of lives into tailspins. Where people once might have deluged their elected representatives with complaints, joined unions, resisted mass firings, confronted their employers with serious demands, marched for social justice and created brand new civic organizations to fight for the things they believed in, the tendency now is to assume that there is little or nothing ordinary individuals can do about the conditions that plague them.
 This is so wrong. It is the kind of thinking that would have stopped the civil rights movement in its tracks, that would have kept women in the kitchen or the steno pool, that would have prevented labor unions from forcing open the doors that led to the creation of a vast middle class.
 This passivity and sense of helplessness most likely stems from the refusal of so many Americans over the past few decades to acknowledge any sense of personal responsibility for the policies and choices that have led the country into such a dismal state of affairs, and to turn their backs on any real obligation to help others who were struggling.
 Those chickens have come home to roost. Being an American has become a spectator sport. Most Americans watch the news the way you'd watch a ballgame, or a long-running television series, believing that they have no more control over important real-life events than a viewer would have over a coach's strategy or a script for ''Law & Order.''
 With that kind of attitude, Andrew Goodman would never have left the comfort of his family home in Manhattan. Rosa Parks would have gotten up and given her seat to a white person, and the Montgomery bus boycott would never have happened. Betty Friedan would never have written ''The Feminine Mystique.'' 
 The nation's political leaders and their corporate puppet masters have fouled this nation up to a fare-thee-well. We will not be pulled from the morass without a big effort from an active citizenry, and that means a citizenry fired with a sense of mission and the belief that their actions, in concert with others, can make a profound difference.
 It can start with just a few small steps. Mrs. Parks helped transform a nation by refusing to budge from her seat. Maybe you want to speak up publicly about an important issue, or host a house party, or perhaps arrange a meeting of soon-to-be dismissed employees, or parents at a troubled school.
 It's a risk, sure. But the need is great, and that's how you change the world.

HEADLINE: Following 'Paranormal,' What Price Scary Glory?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
While box office gurus speculate about the ultimate potential of Paramount's underground horror hit ''Paranormal Activity,'' Hollywood is puzzling over a trickier part of the equation: Based on its success, what is the next film from its director, Oren Peli, really worth?
 ''Paranormal,'' an ultra-low-budget thriller, picked up $22 million in ticket sales over the weekend, for a total of $62.5 million since it was released more than a month ago. Next weekend it is expected to do as well or better, thanks to a boost from Halloween. 
 Now representatives from the Creative Artists Agency and IM Global, an international sales company, are scrambling to sell United States rights to Mr. Peli's next movie, a relatively cheap science-fiction thriller called ''Area 51,'' before the week is out. 
 At least six companies, including several major studios, have expressed interest in the film, according to people associated with the deal for ''Area 51,'' who spoke on condition of anonymity because bidding is still open.
 But it has been easier to find those who are not buying than those who are. Paramount, for instance, is out.
 ''We are not in active discussions to buy 'Area 51,' '' said Katie Martin Kelly, a Paramount spokeswoman.
 Similarly, DreamWorks, whose executives brought ''Paranormal Activity'' to Paramount during their tenure there; Overture Films, which has a modest hit with ''Law Abiding Citizen''; and Lionsgate, which has made money on lower-budget movies like the ''Saw'' series, have not been active bidders for ''Area 51,'' according to people who are involved with the sale but spoke on condition of anonymity to minimize interference with bidding.
 Spokesmen for Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox either declined to comment or did not respond to queries.
 So far, excitement over a potentially hot property is being tempered by caution at seeing traditional industry economics quickly push the price, and perhaps lower the profit potential, of what on the surface appears to be another guerrilla-style property from Mr. Peli.
 Reached on the set of ''Area 51,'' which is shooting in Utah, Jason Blum, a producer of the movie, declined to comment. Stuart Ford, chief executive of IM Global, also declined to discuss ''Area 51.'' Missy Davy, a spokeswoman for Creative Artists, confirmed that her company was representing the film but did not elaborate. 
 In contrast to ''Paranormal Activity,'' which Mr. Blum in an earlier interview said had been made for roughly $10,000, ''Area 51'' cost a little less than $5 million, according to people who worked on it. Trying to capitalize on the heat around ''Paranormal,'' Mr. Ford's company, which was involved with the sale of that film and backed ''Area 51,'' has been looking for bids of $10 million or more for domestic rights to the new movie. (DreamWorks and Paramount paid only about $300,000 for ''Paranormal Activity.'')
 While the number is not large by major-studio standards -- in August Sony, after a bidding war, agreed to pay $60 million for rights to ''This Is It,'' the Michael Jackson concert film -- it puts risk back into the equation. One problem is that studios will not be able to push the new movie as a sleeper hit, the way Paramount did with ''Paranormal Activity,'' whose Web campaign required audiences to ''demand'' the film before it would be shown in theaters.
 ''In a world of grass-roots wildfires, Hollywood realized that this would not have the same force without the underlying buzz -- the confusion between reality and drama -- that the rough original film clearly delivered,'' said Peter Dekom, a longtime entertainment lawyer and co-author of ''Not on My Watch: Hollywood vs. the Future.''
 Mr. Ford and his allies have an extra incentive to land their deal for ''Area 51,'' about a visit to the famous focal point of U.F.O. conspiracy theories, this week: foreign rights to ''Area 51'' will be on sale at the American Film Market, scheduled to begin on Nov. 4 in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 For years sales have been soft in global film markets. A big Hollywood deal for ''Area 51,'' matched by the growing ticket sales for ''Paranormal Activity,'' would give hundreds of foreign buyers an added incentive.
 But, Mr. Dekom pointed out, the success of impromptu hits like ''The Blair Witch Project'' or ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' can be almost impossible to duplicate, because Hollywood itself gets in the way. 
 ''Paramount faces the same barriers as it approaches the sequel to a film that worked particularly well because it was not a Hollywood film,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama's Fund-Raising, In His Best Interest

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH 

 BODY:
It has been nearly a year since President Obama logged so many miles on the road, traveling from city to city and coast to coast. This time, he is not chasing votes. He is working the fund-raising circuit for Democratic candidates. 
 When Mr. Obama arrived here on Monday evening and stepped into a grand ballroom of the Fontainebleau Hotel for a pair of events, he made his 26th fund-raising stop since taking office nine months ago. The trip to Florida came after visits to San Francisco, Boston and New York City -- all within the last 11 days. 
 Yes, Mr. Obama is embroiled in a health care debate. He is also moving closer to saying whether he intends to send more troops to Afghanistan. But despite those tasks, other challenges weigh on the White House: protecting Democrats in Congress and fighting the curse of history, where the party in power traditionally loses seats in the midterm elections.
 The president urged his supporters to be resilient. 
 ''When we started off,'' he said, ''we didn't think, Boy, this was going to be a cakewalk, getting a guy named Barack Hussein Obama elected president.''
 For politicians, raising money is as commonplace as shaking hands and delivering speeches. But Mr. Obama has spent far less time on the fund-raising tour than many others -- and not just because he is fairly new to the national stage.
 In his own presidential race, particularly during the primary fight, money began flowing in through his campaign Web site, sharply reducing the number of audiences he had to appear before to ask for money. Yet in his new role as the leader of the Democratic Party, Mr. Obama's advisers have come to the conclusion that the benefits of raising money -- and keeping his Congressional majorities -- outweigh any negative optics of attending so many fund-raisers.
 ''We could have the president here twice a month and we'd have great events,'' said Kirk Wagar, a Miami lawyer who served as a finance chairman of Mr. Obama's campaign in Florida last year. ''People are very invested in him.'' 
 Mr. Wagar was among the 450 people who gathered Monday evening to see Mr. Obama in his first visit to Miami since taking office. The back-to-back events for the party's senatorial and Congressional campaign committees raised $1.5 million, aides said, and provided the president a chance to be energized by a friendly audience.
 ''Just because I'm skinny doesn't mean I'm not tough,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I don't rattle. I'm not going to shrink back because now is the time.''
 The appearance at the Fontainebleau Hotel, a freshly renovated beachside spot that once was a favorite of Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Dean Martin, drew far less notice than Mr. Obama's fund-raisers initially did. Back in March, when he raised money for the first time in office, the White House was peppered with questions about the propriety of such an event, given the country's unemployment rate and bleak economy.
 Now, it has just become part of Mr. Obama's routine, even though critics say it stands in contrast to his campaign pledge to change the ways of Washington. While he does not personally accept contributions from lobbyists or political action committees, the party's House and Senate committees do, so some of his rules have little practical effect.
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, defended the robust fund-raising schedule. He noted that even though George W. Bush had appeared at only six fund-raising events at this point in his presidency, the campaign finance rules have changed, and donors can no longer write unlimited checks to political parties. Now, donations are capped at $30,400, with individual candidates able to accept $2,400 per election cycle.
 Even with the president's help, the Democratic National Committee is nearly at parity with its Republican counterpart this year. But party officials say Democrats hold an edge in a majority of the competitive Congressional races. Still, only twice in the last 75 years has the president's party gained seats in both the House and Senate in a midterm election.
 ''The reason you're here tonight is you have more to do,'' Mr. Obama said, ticking through a list of accomplishments since taking office. ''Governing is even harder than campaigning.''

HEADLINE: Pressure From U.S. Strains Relations With Pakistan

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
The Obama administration is putting pressure on Pakistan to eliminate Taliban and Qaeda militants from the country's tribal areas, but the push is straining the delicate relations between the allies, Pakistani and Western officials say.
 The Pakistani military's recent heavy offensive in South Waziristan has pleased the Americans, but it left large parts of Pakistan under siege, as militants once sequestered in the country's tribal areas take their war to Pakistan's cities. Many Pakistanis blame the United States for the country's rising instability.
 When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in Pakistan this week, as she is scheduled to do, she will find a nuclear-armed state consumed by doubts about the value of the alliance with the United States and resentful of ever-rising American demands to do more, the officials said. 
 The United States is also struggling to address Pakistan's concerns over the conditions imposed on a new American aid package of $7.5 billion over five years that the Pakistani military denounced as designed to interfere in the country's internal affairs. 
 The Obama administration has endorsed the Pakistani Army's recent offensive in South Waziristan, suggesting it showed overdue resolve. But it has also raised concerns about the Pakistani Army's long-term objectives. How South Waziristan plays out may prove to be a bellwether for an alliance of increasingly divergent interests.
 The special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, said Friday that the Obama administration would be trying to find out whether the army was simply ''dispersing'' the militants or ''destroying'' them, as the United States would like.
 From the number of troops in South Waziristan, it was not clear that the army wanted to ''finish the task,'' said a Western military attache, who spoke on the condition of anonymity according to diplomatic protocol.
 The army would not take over South Waziristan as it had the Swat Valley, where the military is now an occupying force after conducting a campaign in the spring and summer that pushed the Taliban out, the officials said. 
 It remains to be seen how the campaign will play out in a region where the army has failed in the past, analysts said. The army has sent about 28,000 soldiers to South Waziristan to take on about 10,000 guerrillas, a relatively low ratio, according to military specialists.
 In all, of the roughly 28,000 soldiers, there are probably about 11,000 army infantrymen, said Javed Hussain, a retired Pakistani Army brigadier. Instead of a ratio of one to one, he said, the ratio should be at least five to one.
 The army appeared to have no plans to occupy South Waziristan, but rather to cut the militants ''to size,'' said Tariq Fatemi, who served briefly as Pakistan's ambassador to the United States in 1999. 
 With the uncertainty of American plans in Afghanistan, and the strong sentiment in Pakistan that India was ''up to no good'' in the restive province of Baluchistan and the tribal areas, Mr. Fatemi said, the army would not abandon the militant groups that it has relied on to fight as proxies in Afghanistan and in Kashmir against India.
 The goal in South Waziristan, Mr. Fatemi said, was to eliminate the leadership that had become ''too big of their boots'' with the attacks on Pakistan's cities. The army would like to find more pliant replacements as leaders, he said.
 The militants' war against the cities in the past three weeks had produced a wave of fear that shored up support for the army to fight back in South Waziristan, many Pakistanis said. 
 But the terror has also amplified complaints that the unpopular civilian government of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is seen as slavishly pro-American, is unable to cope with the onslaught.
 Mr. Zardari, whose relations with the Pakistani military appear increasingly strained, has not addressed the nation since the militants unfurled their attacks or since the army launched the offensive in South Waziristan. 
 Interior Minister Rehman Malik was pelted with stones last week when he visited the International Islamic University after two suicide bomb attacks on the campus killed six students, including women.
 After the attack at the university, the government ordered all schools and universities closed in Punjab, the most populous province, a move that affected Pakistani families like never before. 
 ''The impact is being felt in every home, before it was just the North-West Frontier Province,'' said Jahangir Tareen, a member of Parliament and a member of the cabinet under President Pervez Musharraf.
 When schools were ordered re-opened Monday, parents were still unhappy. 
 ''The mood is as bleak as I remember,'' said a well-to-do parent in Lahore who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. ''The government says the private schools must open, but security is up to the schools. Where is the government?''
 The range and different style of attacks in the urban areas, particularly in Islamabad, the capital, and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi, surprised Pakistani security officials, said a Western diplomat who is in frequent contact with them. 
 The Pakistani security services knew that sleeper cells had been put in place in both cities in the past six months, but their strength was unknown, the diplomat said. ''These were not your scared suicide bomber boys from the villages, these were well trained commandos,'' the diplomat said.
 The assassination of an army brigadier as he drove through Islamabad last week further unnerved people, demonstrating that the militants had a cadre of spotters or observers probably marshaled from the increasing number of students attending radical religious schools in the capital, the diplomat said.
 Whatever President Obama decides about troop levels in Afghanistan, Pakistan sees the United States and NATO headed for the exits, an outcome that encourages Pakistan to hang onto the militants that it has used as proxies, the Western diplomat said. 
 The fact that the United States had so far failed to persuade India to restart talks with Pakistan and that it was doing little to curb what Pakistan sees as the undue influence of India in Afghanistan was unsettling for Pakistan, Mr. Fatemi, the former ambassador, said. 
 On top of everything else, that feeling was driving a surge of anti-American sentiment, even among the elite, some Pakistanis said, increasing the challenges ahead. 
 ''There is a general perception in the educated class that Pakistan is paying a very heavy price for fighting alongside the United States,'' said Ashfaq Khan, a prominent economist and dean of the business school at the National University of Science and Technology in Islamabad.

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits 14-Month Low Against the Euro

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The dollar hit a fresh 14-month low against the euro on Monday as a regional Chinese central bank researcher argued for diversification of the country's reserves away from the greenback, while a strong economic report from South Korea ignited an equities rally and dulled the buck's safe-haven luster. 
 The euro touched a 14-month high of $1.5061 in overnight trading before falling to $1.5023 early Monday in New York. Late on Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.5002.
 Meanwhile, the dollar dipped to 91.89 Japanese yen from 92.10 yen, and the British pound rose to $1.6327, from $1.6311.
 South Korea's central bank said on Monday that the Asian country's economy grew 2.9 percent in the third quarter, up from 2.6 percent growth the previous three months. That is the fastest pace of growth for Asia's fourth-largest economy since the beginning of 2002 and underscored the region's recovery. Last week, China said its economic output rose 8.9 percent in the third quarter. Japan's economic activity increased at an annual pace of 2.3 percent in the second quarter.
 The news on South Korea's recovery sent markets higher and the dollar lower.
 The dollar dropped to 1,172.60 South Korean won early Monday, from 1,188.30 won late Friday.
 Investors have tended in the last year to buy the dollar as a safe haven when economic reports or corporate earnings are worse than markets had expected. Earnings that are surprisingly strong are driving the buck lower as investors are prompted to seek out higher returns than they can get from the low-yielding dollar.
 That low yield comes from the rock-bottom United States interest rate near zero that the Federal Reserve is maintaining to prompt lending and economic growth.
 Politicians and bank officials from big exporters, including China, that hold huge amounts of United States Treasuries as reserves have expressed unease with this situation as the value of their dollar holdings falters.
 On Monday, a regional People's Bank of China researcher said in a report in a newspaper published by the Chinese central bank that the country should increase the amount of currencies other than the dollar in its reserves.
 The bank sometimes publishes the opinions of officials or researchers as a way of gauging public reaction to different policy approaches. Simply publishing such a report doesn't mean that policy will happen, but several prominent officials this year have voiced concerns about the dollar, which has been dropping steadily since spring, and talked up alternatives to the dollar as the world's supreme reserve currency.
 China's reserves are the biggest in the world. The country is the biggest buyer of United States government debt and is believed to keep almost half of its reserves in United States Treasuries and in notes issued by government-affiliated agencies.
 But in a note to investors Monday morning, currency analysts from Brown Brothers Harriman said China had shown little sign of diversifying out of dollar reserves.
 In other early New York trading, the dollar edged up to 1.0576 Canadian dollars, from 1.0523 late Friday, but slipped to 1.0065 Swiss francs, from 1.0087 francs.

HEADLINE: Dodd Calls for Interim Freeze on Credit Card Fees and Rates

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, on Monday proposed freezing interest rates and fees on existing credit card balances until a new law took effect.
 Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said his bill was necessary because banks were raising rates ''to squeeze customers'' before the remaining provisions of law took effect in February. 
 The new credit card law, which was passed in May, seeks to stop banks from arbitrarily raising interest rates.
 Last week, the House Financial Services Committee passed legislation to move up the effective date for the credit card law, which will restrict interest rate increases and hidden fees, from Feb. 22 to Dec. 1. The measure is opposed by the banking industry, which says it will be difficult if not impossible to meet the expedited deadline.
 ''At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, jacked-up rates can quickly create crushing debt,'' Mr. Dodd said in a statement. ''People need to be responsible with their money, but they shouldn't be taken to the cleaners by outrageous fees.''
 Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the banking committee, said none of the industry's objections about expediting the provisions of the credit card law applied to a simple rate freeze.
 ''Everybody has been trying to figure out a way to move this up, so Dodd said, 'O.K., we are calling your bluff,' '' she said.
 In the last year, as the economy sputtered and credit card delinquencies increased, banks have slashed credit lines and raised interest rates and fees on many customers to offset the losses. The banking industry predicted that the credit card law would mean higher fees and fewer rewards, even for better customers.
 Scott Talbott, senior vice president for government affairs at the Financial Service Roundtable, said his organization, which represents large financial institutions, opposed the bill to freeze rates. He said the bill was based on the faulty premise that credit card interest rates were going up because of legislation.
 Instead, he said, interest rates were rising because of risks posed by the unsteady economy and by card holders themselves, who are defaulting on their payments or paying late more often.

HEADLINE: Toys 'R' Us Stores Will Feature FAO Schwarz Boutiques

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
This Christmas, FAO Schwarz, the storied Manhattan toy shop, is branching out.
 Toys ''R'' Us, which bought the FAO Schwarz brand in May, plans to announce on Tuesday that it will be opening FAO Schwarz boutiques inside nearly 600 Toys ''R'' Us stores, beginning on Sunday. 
 The company's Web site, FAO.com, is expected to begin selling toys on Tuesday, and the FAO Schwarz holiday catalog, first published in 1876, is scheduled to arrive in customers' mailboxes on Nov. 10. 
 ''This reinforces our authority position in the toy industry,'' Gerald L. Storch, chairman and chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, said on Monday. ''Through FAO, Toys 'R' Us is offering differentiated merchandise that is not offered anywhere else.''
 At a time when consumers are penny-pinching and giant discounters like Wal-Mart are offering expanded assortments of $10 toys, Toys ''R'' Us has been buying weaker rivals, positioning itself to be the go-to destination for exclusive toys at a wide range of prices -- be it $10 stocking stuffers or a $1,499.99 teddy bear modeled after the fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. (The bear is wearing an Italian wool jacket, black silk tie and jeans.) 
 This year, in addition to buying FAO Schwarz, Toys ''R'' Us also acquired eToys.com, babyuni- verse.com and the resource site ePregnancy.com. Toys ''R'' Us operated as a public company from 1978 until July 2005, when an investment group consisting of affiliates of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion.
 While there are only two FAO Schwarz stores in the nation -- in Manhattan and Las Vegas -- the brand has long been known for its hands-on displays and its classic and unique toys, some of which can seriously dent a wallet, even in a good economy. 
 The FAO shops opening in 585 Toys ''R'' Us stores, however, will sell some of those classic toys -- like the FAO Schwarz holiday ornament, collectible bear, Jack-in-the-Box and the brand's mascots, Patrick the Pup and Penelope the Pup -- at prices from $2.99 to $64.99. 
 ''This assortment makes FAO accessible to all of America,'' Mr. Storch said. ''I don't want anyone thinking the FAO merchandise at Toys ''R'' Us is superexpensive, because it's not.''
 Indeed, the most expensive item is a replica of what Toys ''R'' Us executives refer to as the FAO Schwarz ''Big piano.'' In the 1988 film ''Big,'' the actor Tom Hanks uses his feet to play ''Chopsticks'' and ''Heart and Soul'' on a giant keyboard in FAO Schwarz. The 70-inch-long keyboard to be sold in stores this holiday shopping season costs $64.99. 
 Among the popular hands-on displays at FAO Schwarz in New York is the Muppet Whatnot Workshop, which enables children (and plenty of young-hearted adults) to design their own Muppet puppets. A virtual version of the workshop will be included on FAO.com. 
 In the coming weeks, FAO.com will add other FAO Schwarz products like (Not So) Scary Monsters and Fancy Nancy Dolls. 
 As for the FAO Schwarz boutiques popping up in Toys ''R'' Us stores, there is not enough space for the kind of interactive displays that have become the hallmark of the freestanding stores. Still, Toys ''R'' Us shoppers familiar with the Manhattan store may be tickled to see replicas of the life-size toy soldier that stands guard on Fifth Avenue.

HEADLINE: Debit Card Use Helps Visa Post a Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Visa posted a quarterly profit on Tuesday, reversing a year-earlier loss, as cost reductions and growing debit card use made up for a decline in payment volume reflecting consumer spending cutbacks. 
 Visa said it earned $514 million, or 69 cents a share, on revenue of $1.87 billion. That compares with a loss of $356 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $1.71 billion a year earlier.
 Excluding one-time items, Visa earned 74 cents a share, topping the 72 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
 Visa, based in San Francisco, said payment volume slipped 2 percent, to $687 million. But the total number of cards carrying the Visa brand rose 5 percent worldwide, to 1.7 billion, and total processed transactions rose 9 percent, to 10.5 billion.
 The increased number of cards and the higher transaction volume reflect the growing use of debit cards over credit cards, as consumers continue to tighten their belts.
 Visa's operating expenses in the period, its fourth fiscal quarter, dropped by more than half, to $1.01 billion, from $2.15 billion a year earlier.
 The majority of the decline came from reduced litigation spending after the settlement of several major lawsuits. But even while Visa said Tuesday that it had renewed its sponsorship of the Olympic Games through 2020, it reported a 12 percent decline in advertising spending in the fourth quarter, to $283 million.
 The chief executive, Joseph W. Saunders, said Visa was beginning to see signs of stabilization that appeared to reflect early signs of economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Fears of a New Chill in Home Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Even as new figures show house prices have risen for three consecutive months, concerns are growing that the real estate market will be severely tested this winter.
 Artificially low interest rates and a government tax credit are luring buyers, but both those inducements are scheduled to end. Defaults and distress sales are rising in the middle and upper price ranges. And millions of people have lost so much equity that they are locked into their homes for years, a modern variation of the Victorian debtor's prison that is freezing a large swath of the market. 
 ''Plenty of pain yet to come,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. He is forecasting an imminent resumption of price declines. 
 This summer, housing seemed at last to be stabilizing. A flood of last-minute buyers trying to conclude a deal before the tax credit expires Nov. 30 helped push up the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index a seasonally adjusted 1 percent in August, it was announced on Tuesday. 
 That was the first time since early 2006 that the widely watched measure of 20 metropolitan areas put together three consecutive increases. 
 While underlining the importance of that long-awaited rise, Maureen Maitland, the S.& P. vice president for index services, warned, ''Everything is up for grabs this winter.''
 Consumers seem acutely aware of the strains ahead. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly in October, after reaching its high for the year in September, the board announced on Tuesday.
 The only hot sector of the real estate market has been foreclosures. Investors and first-time buyers have been competing for these, often creating bidding wars. But with the economy still weak, many analysts expect more foreclosures.
 Another factor likely to weigh on home sales in the coming months is a rise in interest rates. As the Federal Reserve ceases its buying of mortgage-backed securities, rates may well drift up to 6 percent, from 5 percent.
 Worries about the fragility of the housing market, fanned by the real estate industry, may prompt an extension of the tax credit. The controversial program has spurred as many as 400,000 buyers, including Brenda Colon, a nurse in Las Vegas.
 ''If you had told me in January that I would be buying a house, I would have laughed,'' said Ms. Colon, 48, who lives with her two daughters and granddaughter. ''But the tax credit was just the kicker to throw me over.''
 Yet despite the tax credit and other local and federal incentives for homebuyers in Las Vegas, prices there are continuing to fall, shedding 0.8 percent in August. The city's home prices have declined on average more than 55 percent from their peak, more than in any other metropolis. 
 Whenever the tax credit finally expires, Las Vegas and every other city will have to confront the inevitable question after all such stimulus packages: what will motivate the buyers of tomorrow?
 ''In my office, people were buying homes left and right because of that tax credit,'' said Kitty Berberick, who works for an insurance company in Las Vegas. ''That credit was a godsend.''
 Ms. Berberick, 62, could not strike a deal in time, and now has signed another lease for her apartment. If the credit is not extended, she said, she is likely to give up the search entirely until the market really crashes. 
 This, of course, is the sort of fatalistic attitude that relentlessly drove down prices last fall.
 ''Everyone keeps telling me, it's going to go down before it goes up,'' Ms. Berberick said. ''I hope it does, because then I can buy.''
 The recovery is both modest and tentative when measured against the preceding plunge. Prices have fallen nearly a third from their peak, and are down 11.4 percent over the last year.
 In most major cities, it is as if the housing boom never happened. Prices over all are back to where they were in the fall of 2003. Some cities have been pushed down even more: In Cleveland, prices are at 2001 levels; in Detroit they're at 1995.
 It is the magnitude of this decline that makes Karl E. Case, the Wellesley professor for whom the Case-Shiller index is partly named, an optimist.
 While acknowledging ''there are a lot of dangers out there,'' Mr. Case said ''housing is as affordable as it's been in 20 years. I don't see a very rapid recovery, but I think we've seen the bottom.''
 Sixteen of the 20 cities in the index rose in August, including San Francisco, up 2.6 percent, and Minneapolis, which rose 2.3 percent. Besides Las Vegas, three cities fell: Charlotte, Cleveland and Seattle. New York was up 0.3 percent.
 The Case-Shiller numbers on prices lag behind the National Association of Realtors' report on existing-home sales, which has been issued for September. Sales were up 9.4 percent from August, with the tax credit again getting much of the credit.
 Critics of the credit argue that the number of those who merely qualify for it -- and gladly take it -- greatly outnumber those it is precisely intended to assist: people who would not have bought a house otherwise. That means, they argue, that the government is essentially paying more than $40,000 for each purchase that would not have occurred without the credit.
 That is an expensive proposition, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center who has closely followed the issue. ''The bigger threat to the housing market is not the reduction in demand from the end of the credit, but the continuing wave of foreclosures we're likely to see over the next 18 months,'' he said.
 In California, there is strong evidence that foreclosures are beginning to migrate from the subprime inland areas to the more exclusive coastal region.
 According to MDA DataQuick, third-quarter notices of default in Santa Barbara were up 25 percent from 2008; in San Luis Obispo, they rose 46 percent; in Marin County, they were up 66 percent.
 Defaults in hard-hit Sacramento, by contrast, were up only 10 percent. In Merced County in the Central Valley, an epicenter of the bust, they actually fell.
 While defaults are only the first stage in foreclosure, Mr. Shapiro, the MFR economist, expects many formerly creditworthy homeowners to go under. He says he thinks the recent improvement in Case-Shiller numbers is an aberration rather than the beginning of a long-term improvement, with consequences for the larger economy. 
 ''Another leg down in home prices, even if much more limited than the initial move, would nonetheless weigh on consumer spending,'' Mr. Shapiro said, adding that he did not expect a second recession.

PERSON: Lawrence Halprin 

HEADLINE: Lawrence Halprin, Landscape Architect, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Lawrence Halprin, the tribal elder of American landscape architecture, who used the word choreography to describe his melding of modernism, nature and movement in hundreds of projects, including the memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, died on Sunday at his home in Kentfield, Calif. He was 93.
 The cause was complications from a fall, his wife, Anna Halprin said. 
As postwar America sprouted suburban malls, urban parks, corporate compounds and federal urban renewal projects, Mr. Halprin helped forge a new, sharper style of landscape architecture, often as dependent on concrete as on vegetation. Places he shaped include Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco; Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis; a sequence of urban spaces with dazzling fountains in Portland, Ore.; a park atop a freeway in Seattle; and large plazas in Los Angeles.
 ''He almost single-handedly reclaimed the city as the purview of the landscape architect,'' said Charles Birnbaum, founder and president of the Cultural Landscape Foundation. 
 He was also at home in nature, whose glories he emphasized rather than obscured. His Sea Ranch, a development for 1,500 houses on a 5,000-acre stretch of coast in Sonoma County, Calif., preserved natural contours, views and open spaces. He planted more than a half-million trees there.
 Other projects over his career of more than 60 years included a new town in Oahu; parts of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System; a 1.5-mile walkway overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem; a new pedestrian approach to Yosemite Falls; and Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio of San Francisco.
 The Roosevelt memorial was Mr. Halprin's favorite project, his wife said. Partly because he had loving memories of Roosevelt, and partly because of the sheer difficulty of the task. The memorial commission accepted Mr. Halprin's concept of four outdoor rooms and gardens animated by water, stone and sculpture in 1974. The project, somewhat reduced in size, was completed in 1997.
 Mr. Halprin used that span of time meticulously. He went to a quarry and personally picked some of the 4,000 stones in the walls. He made a drawing of each of the 4,000 so he could put each one exactly where he wanted it. ''It is modern in its vocabulary -- an abstraction based on the natural world, a pattern based on Halprin's observations of the way humans move about in a given space,'' Benjamin Forgey, The Washington Post's architecture critic, wrote in 1997.
 Mr. Halprin worked out thorny design issues in spirited workshops with artists on his memorial team. A major issue was whether to show President Roosevelt in a wheelchair, which Mr. Halprin decided against. Many disabled people and their allies protested.
 ''He didn't want people to see him in a wheelchair,'' Mr. Halprin said in an interview on National Public Radio in 1997. ''This isn't a memorial to disabledness.''
 For all his comfort with modern materials like concrete, Mr. Halprin often created timeless beauty. Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic, wrote in The New York Times in 1970 that a plaza he designed in Portland was ''one of the most important urban spaces since the Renaissance.''
 He claimed little interest in decoration or prettiness, but cared deeply how people would move through a created space. Partly inspired by his wife, the former Anna Schuman, a modern dancer and choreographer, he developed a method of landscape drawing he called ''motation,'' from motion and notation. He used it to describe phenomena like how many cars can move from one place to another on a freeway and at what speed.
 This thought process evolved into workshops in which Mr. Halprin gathered clients, designers, community spokesmen, artists, dancers and others to discover how spaces might generate different emotions. Actual design came next.
 ''All of Halprin's designs reflect this passion to give people as many options as possible to go this way or that, to reverse directions, to pause, to start over, to be alone, to meet others, and to experience as many different sights, smells and sounds as the site permits,'' Mr. Forgey wrote in The Smithsonian in 1988.
 Lawrence Halprin was born in Brooklyn on July 1, 1916. He graduated from Cornell and earned a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a second bachelor's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where his professors included Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. During World War II, he was wounded when a Kamikaze plane hit his destroyer.
 He met Ms. Schuman at the University of Wisconsin, and they married in 1940. In addition to her, he is survived by his daughters, Daria Halprin-Khalighi and Rana Halprin; and four grandchildren.
 A visit to Taliesin East, Frank Lloyd Wright's studio in Wisconsin, suggested by his future wife in 1939, sparked Mr. Halprin's initial interest in being a designer. Many years later, he designed a dance deck on their home overlooking the redwoods on Mount Tamalpais.
 It was in an odd, improvised shape, because Mr. Halprin knew his wife could not be contained by a rectangle.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines in U.S.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence about the United States economy fell unexpectedly in October as job prospects remained bleak, a private research group said Tuesday, fueling speculation that an already gloomy holiday shopping forecast could worsen. 
 The Consumer Confidence Index, released by the Conference Board, sank unexpectedly to 47.7 in October -- its second-lowest recording since May.
 Wall Street analysts predicted a reading of 53.1.
 A reading above 90 means the economy is on solid footing. Above 100 signals strong growth.
 The index has seesawed since reaching a record low of 25.3 in February and climbed to 53.4 in September.
 Shoppers have a grim outlook for the future, the Conference Board said, expecting a worsening business climate, fewer jobs and lower salaries. That is particularly bad news for retailers who depend on the holiday shopping season for a hefty share of their annual revenue.
 ''Consumers also remain quite pessimistic about their future earnings, a sentiment that will likely constrain spending during the holidays,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
 Economists expect holiday sales to be at best flat from a year ago, when sales experienced their biggest declines since at least 1967, when the Commerce Department started collecting the data.
 The Consumer Confidence Index survey, which was sent to 5,000 households, had a cutoff date of Oct. 21.

HEADLINE: Bargains Abound In Sublease Market

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
There is a fire sale these days on Park Avenue.
 Financial companies are trying to sublet space that they are no longer using in some of the most desirable office buildings in Midtown Manhattan, and the rents they are asking are heavily discounted compared with what landlords are seeking for similar space across the street -- or even in the same buildings.
 It started last fall, during the financial turmoil that was unleashed after Lehman Brothers collapsed. Many large financial companies dumped hundreds of thousands of square feet on the sublet market, with much of that space in prime Midtown locales near Grand Central Terminal, Rockefeller Center and the Plaza Hotel. Now, the sublet space that is still on the market is being offered at rents much lower than rents for space that can be leased directly from landlords in the same submarkets. 
 ''This is going to have an impact on the rest of the market'' for office space in New York, said Joseph Harbert, the chief operating officer of the New York metropolitan region for Cushman & Wakefield, a provider of commercial real estate services. ''If I am a tenant, and I can get sublet space on Park Avenue at a discount, why would I go elsewhere and pay more?''
 He said that the gap between the asking rents for direct space and sublet space in the most desirable Midtown office buildings -- what brokers generally refer to as Class A space -- was the largest he could remember.
 On average, the owners of Class A buildings in Midtown Manhattan are now asking $72.03 a square foot, compared with $55.68 for comparable sublet space, according to Cushman & Wakefield. So tenants willing to sublet can get a 22.7 percent discount in Midtown. 
 The discount was 12.6 percent a year ago. Last fall, landlords were asking $95.62 a square foot, on average, for Class A space in Midtown, while similar sublets went for $83.06.
 Mr. Harbert said that rents for both sublets and direct space had fallen more sharply in Midtown than in either Midtown South -- which roughly stretches from 34th Street down to Canal Street, and goes all the way down to Chambers Street in TriBeCa -- or in the downtown financial district. He attributed this to the ''meteoric rise'' of rents in Midtown during the second half of this decade.
 He added that rents for sublet space had fallen more rapidly than for direct space because corporations were willing to take a loss on office space that they no longer needed, ''whereas owners have a longer-term perspective,'' Mr. Harbert said. ''And they have a mortgage to pay.''
 Mr. Harbert said he thought that bargains in the sublet market were driving some deals, especially for large transactions. Among the 54 leases that were signed for 50,000 square feet or more in all of Manhattan in the first nine months this year -- a figure that includes both renewals and new deals -- more than 20 percent of the transactions have been subleases, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
 Robert L. Sammons, the managing director in charge of research in the New York office of Colliers ABR, another real estate services firm, said that aside from price, another appeal of sublet space was that it was often relatively cheap to move into. Much of the sublet space on the market today was built and furnished in recent years, during the economic boom. ''That's obviously important to a tenant who is looking to save as much money as possible,'' he said.
 Mr. Sammons said he thought that recent activity in the sublet market offered a glimmer of hope for the Midtown office market as a whole. Once large blocks of sublet space have been taken, leasing activity might pick up for space that it leased directly from landlords.
 Jay Stewart, an executive vice president at Grubb & Ellis, represented the subtenant in a deal for some 58,000 square feet at 237 Park Avenue, which is a 21-story 1.1-million-square-foot building between 45th and 46th Streets. His client, Stifel Nicolaus, signed a sublease for the entire eighth floor of this building to consolidate three offices scattered around Midtown Manhattan. 
 Stifel Nicolaus, a brokerage firm, had obtained some of these spaces by acquiring other financial firms. Two of the leases are expiring, but Mr. Stewart said that Stifel was offering the third space for sublet: a 10,000-square-foot section of 650 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street. This lease, which includes the entire 21st floor of the building, runs through the middle of 2018.
 ''We knew we were going to have to sublet that space, but it was more important to get all of their New York employees together in one office,'' Mr. Stewart said.
 JPMorgan Chase is Stifel's sublandlord at 237 Park Avenue. But this space was originally leased by Bear Stearns, the brokerage firm that JPMorgan Chase acquired in March 2008. Mr. Stewart said the strength of the sublandlord was a selling point for his client. ''We didn't go into the market looking for a sublease,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''But we don't have to worry about JPMorgan going under. So from that perspective, you can seriously consider a sublease.''
 At 31 West 52nd Street -- a 30-story 660,000-square-foot building between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, near Rockefeller Center -- one global law firm is subleasing space to another. Clifford Chance has sublet more than 82,000 square feet to Holland & Knight.
 Stuart Eisenkraft, an executive vice president at CB Richard Ellis, represented Clifford Chance in the sublet deal, which was signed in September. Mr. Eisenkraft said the space had been on the market for four to five months. He said that his client had built the space about five years ago and would sublet it to Holland & Knight fully furnished. 
 Mr. Eisenkraft said two other law firms also looked at the space that Clifford Chance was offering. Because it had been built and furnished by a law firm, Mr. Eisenkraft said, it should require very little time and money for another law firm to adapt the space to its own needs, and ''companies are averse to spending capital right now.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Ways to Feed a Hungry World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Experts Worry About Feeding the World as Its Population Grows'' (news article, Oct. 22):
 The international community's response to the global hunger crisis -- to promote increased food production through agricultural innovation -- is blind to the political realities that shape the global food security situation. Many countries around the world are able to produce much more food than is necessary to feed their populations, yet their citizens go hungry. 
 Among many reasons for this, two are particularly pertinent.
 First, subsidies of corn and other basic food products in the United States and other developed countries drive down their prices, thereby discouraging production and devastating many agriculture-based economies in the developing world.
 Second, the prevalence of foreign ownership of land in developing countries often means that land is used to produce food for export, rather than to feed the local population. Amid agricultural riches, the majority lives as peasants, unable to produce or buy their own food.
 This is a political problem that demands a political solution.
 Nicole Summers Evanston, Ill., Oct. 22, 2009
 The writer recently conducted independent malnutrition policy research in Nicaragua on a Fulbright grant.
 To the Editor:
 Your article cites a population projection that reflects an optimistic assumption about declining fertility. It says that agricultural experts are trying to increase food production to ''feed a population expected to grow to 9.1 billion in 40 years.'' This population projection assumes that fertility rates will decline in those countries facing food shortages. Yet today, fertility decline in many African countries has stalled and, in some cases, fertility rates have actually increased. 
 Ensuring access to contraception would reduce the demand for food, while meeting broader development goals and empowering women.
 But 200 million women around the world still need contraception but don't have access, while American funding for international family planning has declined by one third over the last 15 years.
 Karen Hardee Vice President for Research Population Action International Washington, Oct. 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 We agree that more agricultural investment is needed to help the billion people on the planet who are hungry. But solving hunger, particularly in Africa, is not an either-or scenario -- either focus on seed breeding, artificial fertilizers and genetically modified crops to feed the world or rely on organic farming practices. 
 There is overwhelming evidence that a combination of approaches is more effective in terms of productivity, income generation and resilience than any one approach, including using conventional practices paired with agro-ecological approaches.
 On heavily depleted soils across Africa, for instance, farmers often use some chemical fertilizer in the short term to take full advantage of composting, nitrogen-fixing crops and other agro-ecological approaches that boost yields over the long term.
 Yes, more investment is needed from the international donor community to reduce the number of hungry, but we also need to break out of old ways of thinking that haven't eliminated hunger in the past.

HEADLINE: New Meaning for Night Class at 2-Year Colleges

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Lisa W. Foderaro contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Winston Chin hustles on Tuesdays from his eight-hour shift as a lab technician to his writing class at Bunker Hill Community College, a requirement for the associate's degree he is seeking in hopes of a better job. 
 He is a typical part-time student, with one exception. His class runs from 11:45 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., the consequence of an unprecedented enrollment spike that has Bunker Hill scrambling to accommodate hundreds of newcomers. In the dead of night, he and his classmates dissect Walt Whitman poems and learn the finer points of essay writing, fueled by unlimited coffee, cookies and an instructor who does push-ups beforehand to stay lively. 
 Similar booms have forced many of the nation's 1,200 community colleges to add makeshift parking lots, rent extra space and keep thousands of students on waiting lists this fall. While Bunker Hill offers two midnight classes -- the other is Psychology 101 -- and Clackamas Community College in Oregon holds welding classes until 2 a.m., others have added classes as early as 6 a.m. to make room for the jobless and others whom the recession has nudged back to school. 
 The deluge also includes an unusually large number of recent high school graduates, diverted from more expensive four-year colleges by the economic downturn. 
 ''I liken myself to the old woman who lives in a shoe,'' said Mary L. Fifield, the president of Bunker Hill, where enrollment is up 16 percent over last fall. ''The seams are tearing, and people are just popping out all over.'' 
 Virtually every state is dealing with enrollment booms at community colleges, the American Association of Community Colleges says, with some in California reporting increases of 35 percent. The demand comes amid deep cuts to higher-education budgets, but also at a hopeful time for community colleges: President Obama recently announced a $12 billion plan to increase the number of community college graduates by five million by 2020. 
 ''It shines a spotlight on a sector of higher education that by and large has been viewed as the lowest rung on the ladder,'' Dr. Fifield said. ''Now we have the president of the United States talking about community colleges as an engine that will drive and sustain economic success in this country.'' 
 Most of the students in Mr. Chin's writing class, who range in age from 18 to 59, are employed but hoping a degree will lead to more stable, higher-paying jobs. Some start work as early as 4 a.m. or finish as late as 11 p.m., making the class time more appealing. They include a taxi dispatcher who dreams of going to medical school, a Dunkin' Donuts cashier who wants to be a homicide detective and a landscaper who wants to be a state trooper. 
 The group cracked jokes and gently mocked one another for mispronouncing the word ''blithe'' or not reading aloud passionately enough. When the instructor asked around 2 a.m., ''Who's ready to answer the question?'' one student wearily answered, ''Who's confused?'' 
 Mr. Chin, who took the midnight class because other writing classes were full, wants to become a surgical nurse. At 57, he has three small children and has not been a student since graduating from high school. 
 ''I probably would have taken something early in the morning if I'd had my pick of classes,'' he said. ''But this is working out. I never really need more than about four hours of sleep anyway.''
 Mr. Chin and his classmates get plenty of parking -- a rarity at community colleges these days. Holyoke Community College, in Holyoke, Mass., where enrollment is up 13 percent over last fall, turned its tennis courts into parking lots; it also sent postcards to all 7,500 students urging them to take public transportation to class.
 At Northern Virginia Community College, more than 20 classes start before 7 a.m. this fall; many other colleges have classes running as late as 11 p.m.
 But with state allocations down sharply this year because of the economy, many community colleges have not been able to keep up with the demand. At Miami Dade College, whose 170,000 students make it the nation's largest community college, about 30,000 could not get every class they wanted this fall; about 5,000 others were shut out completely.
 At De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif., about 8,000 students found themselves on wait lists last month, as did 7,500 students at Central Oregon Community College. And in New York City, where the six community colleges that are part of the City University of New York experienced a record 9 percent enrollment increase this fall, most closed enrollment early for the first time. 
 Because of budget cuts, Miami Dade College could not add a single new class this fall despite an influx of more than 33,000 new students. Instead, it has eliminated 1,200 class sections over the last two years, said Eduardo J. Padron, the college president. 
 ''It's an almost desperate situation,'' Dr. Padron said. ''My heart breaks for these students, because I know many are the ones who really need us the most.''
 Colleen Roach, Bunker Hill's spokeswoman, said higher student fees and an influx of federal stimulus money helped the college offer dozens more classes this fall. It is planning to add a third midnight course, Sociology 101, next spring, along with five business and science courses that will run to 11:45 p.m. 
 Dr. Fifield said putting dynamic instructors in charge of the late-night classes was crucial.
 ''Not everyone is going to be able to keep people awake until 2:45 in the morning,'' she said.
 Wick Sloane, who teaches the midnight writing class at Bunker Hill, tried to transport Mr. Chin and the other students from the windowless, concrete-walled classroom one recent night with an essay by Edward Abbey, the nature writer, about encountering a mountain lion in the New Mexican desert. When one student answered a question with a giant yawn around 2:15, Mr. Sloane asked, ''Can everyone make it about 15 more minutes?'' 
 For homework, he assigned an essay analyzing Calpurnia's rhetoric in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar,'' leading one student to ask whether Shakespeare used an alias. The room started buzzing with opinions.
 ''Do you want to stay and debate who Shakespeare was?'' Mr. Sloane asked.
 They did not, but not for lack of enthusiasm. ''He's got me engaged,'' Mr. Chin said, ''which is not easy at this time of night.''

HEADLINE: United States Steel And AK Steel Beat Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Steel makers reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, but their shares fell as they restated disappointing short-term views for the industry and the economy. 
 The United States Steel Corporation posted a smaller third-quarter loss than Wall Street had expected, and AK Steel reported a profit.
 United States Steel said it was still cautious about demand, especially for flat-rolled steel from automakers, and expected to report a fourth-quarter operating loss and idle two blast furnaces.
 AK Steel, which has been operating at less than 60 percent capacity, said that while it expected to post an operating profit in the fourth quarter, it expected a decline in average selling prices.
 ''Technically speaking, we may be out of the recession, but it certainly doesn't feel that way,'' James L. Wainscott, AK Steel's chief executive, told analysts.
 United States Steel's third-quarter net loss was $303 million, or $2.11 a share, in contrast to a year-earlier profit of $919 million, or $7.79 a share. Revenue fell to $2.82 billion, from $7.31 billion, the company said. Shares in United States Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, fell $3.17, or 8 percent, to $37.41 a share.
 AK Steel's third-quarter net earnings were $6.2 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with earnings of $188.3 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $1.04 billion, from $2.16 billion.
 Shares in AK Steel, which is based in West Chester, Ohio, fell $1.61, or 9 percent, to $17.18 a share.

HEADLINE: What the Last Meal Taught Him

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
THOMAS KELLER cooked his father's last meal.
 He had only recently come to know Ed Keller, a towering former Marine drill sergeant who left his family when Thomas Keller, the youngest of five boys, was just 5 years old.
 When they finally reunited decades later, father and son liked each other so much that in 2006 Ed Keller moved from Pennsylvania into a house next door to the French Laundry, the restaurant in Yountville, Calif., where his son had made his name as a chef.
 He quickly became a fixture around town, a real character who would show up at 8 a.m. every day to tell stories to his son's staff and customers at the nearby Bouchon Bakery. In the afternoons, he would drink wine in the French Laundry garden. Catch him in the right mood and he would even help you get into the reservation book.
 For a few great years, Mr. Keller finally knew what it meant to have a dad around. 
 ''Just to sit with your father and have a beer and smoke a cigar, that is really important,'' Mr. Keller said.
 On a soft spring evening in 2008, one of the world's great chefs set about making the old man's favorite dinner one last time: barbecued chicken. He used bottled sauce and served the chicken alongside mashed potatoes moistened with warm half-and-half and collard greens braised in butter and bacon fat.
 For dessert, Mr. Keller topped shortcake with the season's first strawberries tossed in a shot of Grand Marnier because his father liked a little alcohol in his dessert. They ate on the patio. Mr. Keller remembers a nice breeze. 
 The next night, his father died. He was 86. 
 A little more than a year earlier, the senior Keller had been on his way home after a day that, as best anyone can remember, included a visit to a casino, a golf lesson and dinner with a friend when his Mercedes slammed into another car. He broke his neck and became a quadriplegic. No one expected him to live more than a couple of months at the most, said his doctor, Brian Schmidt, a trauma surgeon.
 But Mr. Keller's son was determined. With help from his longtime companion, Laura Cunningham, they eventually got him home. Daily food deliveries from Thomas Keller's chefs, 24-hour nursing care and a war-tested tenacity kept him alive for just over a year.
 That year -- one of mind-boggling medical challenges, family squabbles and equal measures of gratitude and mourning -- punctuated a period of change for Mr. Keller. 
 The chef, who has built his professional life on a devotion to precision, analysis and control that borders on the obsessive, came to understand in new ways that life is messy, friends and colleagues say. 
 ''This was one of the first times during his successful professional life that there was no guarantee how things were going to go on any given day,'' Ms. Cunningham said. ''You just had to take each day for what it was.''
 Mr. Keller said he began to think more deeply about the importance of family and about his place beyond the stove. It has been, in many ways, the softening of a chef.
 ''You start thinking, 'What am I going to leave? What's my legacy going to be?' '' he said during an interview on a recent Sunday morning in the Armani-designed Wall Street building where he and Ms. Cunningham share an apartment when they are in New York.
 The night before he had cooked at Per Se, which is increasingly rare. It felt good, he said, but only underscored his shifting role from chef to executive of a multimillion dollar business. 
 While he remains a demanding boss -- an unfortunate young counter worker at New York's Bouchon Bakery recently received a personal lecture on the importance of wearing a belt -- Mr. Keller says he has become a more patient leader with a greater appreciation for collaboration.
 ''It is so important to have relationships,'' he said.
 After his father died, Mr. Keller and Ms. Cunningham became formally engaged. It was a move that produced a collective sigh of relief among friends who have watched them through ups and downs.
 ''When you've been with someone 16 or 17 years, and you're 53 years old, you think 'Jeez, I better get on this,' '' Mr. Keller said.
 Ms. Cunningham, once the director of operations for the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group, stepped away from it all in 2006 for reasons neither will speak about. Now she is getting back in the game, but this time on her own terms. She is designing a restaurant named for her beloved grandmother Vita Morrell, who died after Ed Keller's accident. 
 Vita will feature Sicilian and Southern Italian food and should open in Yountville late this spring. 
 Mr. Keller's empire is in transition, too. The chef de cuisine at the French Laundry, Corey Lee, left last summer and is opening a restaurant in San Francisco. Jonathan Benno, who has been the chef de cuisine at Per Se since it opened in 2004, is training his replacement, Eli Kaimeh, and will move on to become the executive chef of a new restaurant at Lincoln Center. 
 On Nov. 18, Mr. Keller opens Bouchon Beverly Hills, a restaurant that covers 17,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space and cost close to $12 million to build. 
 And then there is ''Ad Hoc at Home,'' a cookbook of the family-style meals served at his casual restaurant about a mile down the road from the French Laundry. It comes out next week. The book shows a surprisingly goofy side of Mr. Keller, and his new commitment to family.
 In the cookbook, Mr. Keller leads with his heart. He dedicates it to his brother Joseph and lays out in loving, exacting detail the recipes for the last meal he made his father. He reminds readers that life is better when you eat together with family and friends.
 ''Thomas has gone through quite an evolution,'' said Michael Ruhlman, the food writer who has been Mr. Keller's voice on paper in each of his cookbooks. 
 Taken as a series, they offer a way to frame that evolution. His first, ''The French Laundry Cookbook,'' published in 1999, was a pure expression of Mr. Keller's philosophy. Astonishing in its heft and detail, the book essentially waved off home cooks without the time or skill to execute his complex menus. 
 He thought he would never do another book, but he realized other chefs who worked with him might want a book, too.
 ''I woke up one day and thought maybe I was being selfish,'' he said. ''I started to rethink my position in life at that moment. It wasn't about me.''
 With the chef Jeffrey Cerciello, Mr. Keller and the team that created his first book produced ''Bouchon'' in 2004.
 Then came the 2008 book, ''Under Pressure,'' about sous-vide cooking, intended as a handbook for professional chefs. It marked Mr. Keller's role as a leader and teacher.
 ''Ad Hoc at Home'' is his loosest and most accessible. He imagined it as a way to celebrate the people who run the restaurant, especially David Cruz, the chef.
 It's a book of approachable dishes made really, really well. Apple butter simmered in a slow cooker. Fried chicken with a three-step dipping process. You will begin to peel vegetables over newspaper, understand salt and pepper in new ways and become a convert to the chef's beloved ''big-pot blanching'' method for vegetables.
 Still, there are moments when Keller can't help but be Keller. His chicken and dumplings require carrots cooked in honey and dumplings made with pate-a-choux spooned into quenelles. ''Once the dumplings have cooled,'' he instructs, ''trim any uneven edges with scissors.''
 Mr. Keller ate many of the dishes in the book with his father at Ad Hoc. Even after the accident they would go, despite the physical challenges of getting his father out of the house.
 Ms. Cunningham said she used to worry about how customers might feel watching the famous chef feed his father. 
 ''Here he was taking care of his father just like a baby,'' she said. ''For Thomas, it didn't make the slightest difference. Whatever he could do to make his dad comfortable he did.''
 Even in his wheelchair, Ed Keller lived as large as he did before the accident.
 That included showing up at the Bouchon Bastille Day celebration with his ventilator and a cigar; enjoying a visit with cheerleaders at a 49ers football game; or taking an unauthorized trip to the bank in his electric wheelchair, talking the teller into giving him $3,000 in $20 bills and then buying some forbidden chewing tobacco.
 Ed Keller, who was as talkative as his son is private, helped people in Yountville learn more about the personal side of Thomas Keller. And his staff members say he helped Thomas play around a little more.
 Mr. Keller has often credited his mother, Betty Keller, for much of his success. She got him into the restaurant business and gave him his sense of adventure, ambition and aesthetics.
 His contact with his father consisted mostly of awkward phone conversations at Christmas. 
 But after his mother died and Mr. Keller had achieved a level of success, he began to reach out to his father, who had since remarried and had more children.
 It turns out that genetics do matter. Thomas Keller discovered he was like his father in many ways, not the least of which was his height. The two shared a strong sense of economy, an appreciation of routine and the understanding of how powerful teamwork can be, Ms. Cunningham said.
 After the accident, Ms. Cunningham often spent more time with Thomas's father than he did, rubbing lotion into his skin, cutting his hair, holding his hand and reading him an endless parade of sports stories and poetry.
 The day he died, she said, it was clear he was having a difficult time. Thomas Keller kept his appointments as best he could, with his assistant and Ms. Cunningham letting him know how things were going.
 Mr. Keller made it to his father's bedside in the evening. Finally, at maybe 8 or 9 p.m. -- ''I can't quite recall, it was the shift change for his nurses'' -- Ed Keller died. 
 ''I had him with me for some really meaningful moments before the accident and I didn't have that as a child,'' Mr. Keller said. ''At the end of the day when we think about what we have, it's memories.''
 Memories are what Mr. Keller strives to create with all his food. And food memories are something he said he cherishes about his last years with his father. Especially that last meal.
 ''That was like fate,'' he said, ''like God stepping in.''
 Does the great chef believe in God? That maybe Ed is now in heaven?
 ''I hope his spirit is out there somewhere,'' he said.
 Dining, no doubt, on barbecued chicken and strawberry shortcake.

 Adapted from ''Ad Hoc at Home'' by Thomas Keller (Artisan, 2009)
 Time: 20 minutes, plus 2 hours' refrigeration
 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
 1 teaspoon Madras curry powder
 6 large (about 6 ounces each) or 12 small (about 3 ounces each) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
 Kosher salt
 Canola oil
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
 1 tablespoon minced shallot
 1/4 cup dry white wine
 1 cup chicken stock
 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped tarragon plus 1 tablespoon whole tarragon leaves
 Freshly ground black pepper.
 1. In a small bowl mix together paprika and curry powder, and sprinkle on both sides of chicken breasts; cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
 2. Place 2 breasts on large sheet of plastic wrap, cover with more plastic and pound with a mallet until they are about
 1/4-inch thick. Repeat with remaining breasts. (Chicken may be wrapped and refrigerated for up to 12 hours.)
 3. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Season chicken on both sides with salt. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add enough canola oil to film the bottom of pan. Working in batches, without crowding, place breasts smooth side down and let cook until golden brown, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Turn and cook for another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in oven.
 4. Wipe out skillet and return to medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter and shallot, and saute for 30 seconds, swirling pan to coat shallot with butter. Add wine, raise heat to medium-high, and cook until wine is reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add stock, bring to boil, and cook until reduced and slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.
 5. Stir in chopped tarragon, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, and any juices that have accumulated on baking sheet. Swirl to melt butter, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken on a warmed platter, pour sauce over it, and garnish with whole tarragon leaves.
 Yield: 6 servings.
 Recipe: Leek Bread Pudding Adapted from ''Ad Hoc at Home'' by Thomas Keller (Artisan, 2009) Time: 2 1/2 hours (1 hour for preparation and 1 1/2 hours for baking)
 Adapted from ''Ad Hoc at Home'' by Thomas Keller (Artisan, 2009)
 Time: 2 1/2 hours (1 hour for preparation and 1 1/2 hours for baking)
 2 cups 1/2-inch-thick slices leeks, white and light green parts only, cleaned and rinsed
 Kosher salt
 4 tablespoons (2 ounces) unsalted butter
 Freshly ground black pepper
 12 cups 1-inch-cubed crustless brioche or Pullman loaf
 1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
 3 large eggs
 3 cups whole milk
 3 cups heavy cream
 Freshly grated nutmeg
 1 cup shredded Comte or Emmenthaler cheese.
 1. Place a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, drain excess water from leeks, and add to pan. Season with salt, and saute until leeks begin to soften, about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in butter. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are very soft, about 30 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. While leeks are cooking, spread bread cubes on a baking sheet and bake until dry and pale gold, about 20 minutes, turning pan about halfway through. Transfer to a large bowl, leaving the oven on.
 3. Add leeks, chives and thyme to the bowl of bread; toss well. In another large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs, then whisk in milk, cream, a generous pinch of salt, pepper to taste and a pinch of nutmeg.
 4. Sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded cheese in bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Spread 1/2 of bread mixture in pan, and sprinkle with another 1/4 cup cheese. Spread remaining bread mixture in pan, and sprinkle with another 1/4 cup cheese. Pour in enough milk mixture to cover bread, and gently press on bread so milk soaks in. Let rest 15 minutes.
 5. Add remaining milk mixture, letting some bread cubes protrude. Sprinkle with salt and remaining cheese. Bake until pudding is set and top is brown and bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve hot.
 Yield: 12 servings as a side dish.

HEADLINE: Financing Cultural Change

BYLINE: By DAN LUZADDER

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala. 

 BODY:
When David Bronner, the chief executive of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, the pension fund for public employees in the state, first discussed making a major investment in this city, he had an ultimatum for local leaders: show that you're willing to rebuild the city's education system, and the money will flow.
 Mr. Bronner, 64, who has steered the fortunes of the retirement system for 36 years, already had what he thought was a good idea. He would help Mobile rebuild its deteriorated downtown and its self-image -- starting with the renovation of the Battle House hotel, which had once been the heart of the city's downtown.
But, first, he wanted a commitment from Mobilians that they were willing to invest in themselves by raising taxes to pay for better education. ''Without education, how can we attract business and industry?'' Mr. Bronner said. 
 A bond issue for public school reform was approved in 2003, and two years later it began to rain money in Mobile -- an investment by the retirement system of some $650 million so far. 
 Today, the Battle House hotel, which had been closed for more than three decades, has been restored to its antebellum elegance. Its rooms and suites are as well appointed as any luxury hotel in the region, and its spa has become a draw for tourists. 
 The hotel lobby connects to the 35-story RSA Battle House Tower, a sparkling 470,000-square-foot high-rise that is the first truly Class A office space in Mobile, offering tenants the highest-quality space and most advanced technology available in the city. At 745 feet, the tower is also the tallest building on the Gulf Coast east of Houston. 
 The Battle House Tower, which opened in 2007, is just one of a number of investments that Mr. Bronner has shepherded within Mobile.
 His agency also built a new cruise port for $16.1 million: the Alabama Cruise Terminal, a 302,000-square-foot docking area that has attracted cruise ships to the city, including some that used New Orleans as a port before Hurricane Katrina. It spent $97.3 million to buy and restore the 534,000-square-foot Grand Hotel across the water on the eastern arm of the Bay of Mobile, after it was damaged by the wind from Katrina. And the fund most recently spent $6.7 million to buy the 300,000-square-foot, 34-story former AmSouth Bank Building, built in 1965. It is under reconstruction for conversion into the city's second Class A office tower.
 Donald Epley, a professor of real estate and the director of the Mitchell College of Business Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, said the retirement system's investments here -- and its even larger investments upstate in Alabama's state capital, Montgomery -- reflected a bet not just on the individual projects but also on the state's economy. 
 ''If you are going to talk about office space, you have to talk about employment, because that is what drives office space,'' Mr. Epley said. ''So the story is one also of economic development success here.'' 
 The pension fund's initiatives have inspired small local banks and other lenders to back business development here, Mr. Epley said.
 While the fund's investments have unquestionably helped the city weather the recession a bit better than some metropolitan areas, there have certainly been casualties. A review compiled by the Center for Real Estate Studies in September showed vacancy rates of about 18 percent in the first and second quarter of this year, based on availability in 191 commercial properties of all classes. By contrast, the rate in the first quarter of 2008 was 12.7 percent. 
 Mr. Bronner's vision of investing in Alabama reflects an unusual approach for a state pension fund. Most, he said, are content to turn their money over to an investment manager, and most operate from a single goal of enhancing the value of the retirement funds by wise investments. 
 But Mr. Bronner has a reputation for taking a longer view, and has invested in real estate as a way to create cultural changes in the state. The approach has on occasion made him controversial, with critics suggesting that spending on economic development by building, owning and operating major hotels and office buildings isn't the purpose of a state pension fund.
 Mr. Bronner credits the fund's investment in hotels and resorts associated with the Robert Trent JonesGolf Trail in Alabama for creating a multibillion-dollar tourist economy in the state. The agency spent more than $23 million building 11 luxury golf courses designed by Robert Trent Jones, and hundreds of millions more to build hotels and residential developments that the agency owns and operates at the courses. That move is credited with helping to attract business, like the immense new ThyssenKrupp Steel USA plant being constructed on the banks of the Mobile River, 30 miles north of the port city. 
 The Retirement Systems of Alabama has a story of revival of its own. Badly underfunded in the 1970s, with only $500 million in the kitty, it was limping along in the shadows of the State Capitol building in Montgomery when some civic leaders recruited Mr. Bronner, then a young financial visionary from Minnesota, to become its chief executive. 
 At the time, state office workers were housed in dozens of places around Montgomery. One of his first steps, he said, was to devise a plan to consolidate the workers into several large office buildings -- largely built by the retirement system. 
 Mr. Bronner cites other deals that he is proud of, like investing in US Airways when it was in bankruptcy earlier this decade, and buying the 3.8-million-square-foot 55 Water Street, the largest building by floor area in New York City, according to Emporis.com, a Web site with an extensive database on buildings.
 From a $500 million start, he has guided the agency into a $28 billion financial juggernaut. Mr. Bronner is fond of dragging reporters to the balcony of the fund's well-appointed new office complex in Montgomery to gaze out at his symbolic signature -- the green-trimmed rooftops of all the buildings that the fund has helped to build.
 The fund's most recent annual report carries an aerial photograph of the city with all of the buildings it has financed taken out of the picture. ''It makes a point,'' Mr. Bronner said with a grin. ''This is what the city would look like without us.''
 The retirement system has had an even greater impact in Montgomery than in Mobile -- 2.5 million square feet of commercial and state office space -- where local commercial real estate developers like Jerry Keyser say investors are now eager to put money into new restaurants, offices and retailing in the city's downtown, including its new Alleyway project down the block from the retirement system's recently completed 395,000-square-foot Renaissance Hotel, which includes a 1,800-seat performing arts center and convention hall. 
 Back in Mobile, pedestrian traffic has returned to downtown day and night, said David Rasp, owner of Heroes, a longtime downtown watering hole, and of the new Royal Scam restaurant near the Battle House. New investors, he noted, are opening restaurants, pubs, boutiques and other ventures despite the current recession.
 The Battle House, built in 1852 on the headquarters site for Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, was a cultural icon for more than a century before it succumbed to age and neglect in the late 1970s. Now it has once again become the cultural heart of Mobile, a place for posh Mardi Gras parties.
 It has all been, Mr. Rasp said, a ''very, very good idea'' for Mobile.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Malaise Weighs on Shares

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks mostly fell on Tuesday as mixed reports on home prices and consumer confidence gave investors little incentive to step into the market.
 A decision by I.B.M. to double its stock repurchase plan propped up the Dow Jones industrial average, but the Nasdaq composite index slid after Baidu, the Chinese Internet search company, warned its revenue could take a hit as it switched its advertising system. Two stocks fell for every one that rose.
 Bond prices rose as demand was strong at a government debt auction, signaling that investors were still seeking safety. 
 Stocks rose at the start of trading after the release of an index showing that home prices in 20 major metropolitan markets increased for a third consecutive month in August. That report, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, gained 1 percent in August from July.
 The higher home prices were not enough, however, to offset worries that consumers might not be in a mood to spend this holiday season. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly to 47.7 in October, its second-lowest reading since May. Analysts predicted a figure of 53.1.
 Worries about consumers have been around for a while, but the confidence numbers took some of the sheen off corporate profit reports for the third quarter, which have been coming in ahead of expectations.
 ''When I look at the consumer, I think that is the next big test,'' said Dave Hinnenkamp, chief executive of KDV Wealth Management in Minneapolis. ''We've passed a big test on the earnings front.''
 The Dow rose 14.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 9,882.17. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.54 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,063.41, while Nasdaq fell 25.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,116.09.
 Bond prices rose after a Treasury Department auction of $44 billion in two-year notes drew robust demand. That pushed yields lower. The yield on the two-year note fell to 0.94 percent from 1.04 percent late Monday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 29/32, to 101 15/32, and the yield fell to 3.44 percent from 3.55 percent late Monday.
 Stocks have fallen for most of the past week on worries about the economy. The Dow dropped 104 points Monday after a similar slide Friday. It was the first consecutive triple-digit loss for the Dow since mid-June.
 The latest drops came as a strengthening dollar pushed commodity prices lower. The dollar mostly rose again Tuesday.
 Analysts say the coming days could be choppy as traders look for fuel to extend the market's climb. Frank Ingarra Jr., co-portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds in Stamford, Conn., said the market was about where it should be but could stall if more companies failed to show they would increase profits by bringing in more revenue and not just by slashing costs.
 ''We have a pretty good valuation here. To propel us to go forward we need to have good top-line growth and you're just not seeing it,'' he said.
 Investors are also looking to the government's first reading on economic output for the third quarter. The report on gross domestic product is due on Thursday and could signal an official end to the recession that many analysts have said is over.
 Crude oil rose 87 cents to settle at $79.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 I.B.M., one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow, rose after it added $5 billion to its stock repurchase fund. The total now stands at $9.2 billion. The stock advanced 54 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $120.65.
 Baidu's American Depositary shares slid $49.31, or 11.4 percent, to $383.66 after it its warning about revenue.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: A Drop In the Wrong Bucket

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you wanted to help the economy and you had $14 billion to bestow on any group of people, which group would you choose:
 a) Teenagers and young adults, who have an 18 percent unemployment rate.
 b) All the middle-age long-term jobless who, for various reasons, are not eligible for unemployment benefits.
 c) The taxpayers of the future (by using the $14 billion to pay down the deficit).
 d) The group that has survived the Great Recession probably better than any other, with stronger income growth, fewer job cuts and little loss of health insurance. 
 The Obama administration has chosen option d -- people in their 60s and beyond. 
 The president has proposed sending a $250 check to every Social Security recipient, which sounds pretty good at first. The checks would be part of his admirable efforts to stimulate the economy, and older Americans are clearly a sympathetic group. Next year, they are scheduled to receive no cost-of-living increase in their Social Security benefits.
 Yet that is largely because they received an artificially high 5.8 percent increase this year. For this reason and others, economists are generally recoiling at the proposal.
 President Obama's own economic advisers raised objections, as my colleague Jackie Calmeshas reported. Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution told me she thought the idea was crazy -- and then noted she was in her 70s. Rosanne Altshuler, co-director of the Tax Policy Center in Washington, says that the checks ''seem to be pure pandering to seniors.''
 Indeed, the politics are attractive. People over 65 vote in large numbers. Saying no to them is never easy.
 And therein lies a problem that's much larger than one misguided $14 billion proposal.
 With the economy gradually improving, members of Congress and White House officials are just starting to think more seriously about the budget deficit. Fifty-three senators voted down a narrow health care bill last week, with many citing its potential impact on the budget. On Monday, Christina Romer, the chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, gave a speech in which she said the deficit was ''simply not a problem that can be kicked down the road indefinitely.'' 
 Just about everybody agrees that solving the deficit depends on reducing the benefits that current law has promised to retirees, via Medicare and Social Security. That's not how people usually put it, of course. They tend to use the more soothing phrase ''entitlement reform.'' But entitlement reform is just another way of saying that we can't pay more in benefits than we collect in taxes. 
 ''If the long-term issue is entitlement reform,'' says Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan economist, ''the fact that the political system cannot say no to $250 checks to elderly people is a bad sign.''
 The first Social Security check was mailed in 1940 to Ida May Fuller, a retired legal secretary in Ludlow, Vt. It was for $22.54. Every month for the next 10 years, Ms. Fuller received a check for that same amount.
 The original Social Security legislation had not included an inflation adjustment, which meant benefits did not keep up with the cost of living. A decade later, Ms. Fuller's checks were worth about 40 percent less in real terms than when she started receiving them. 
 Congress finally increased benefits in 1950 and then continued to do so in fits and starts, sometimes faster than inflation, sometimes slower and usually in an election year. President Richard M. Nixon and a Democratic Congress brought some order to this process in 1972, by automatically tying benefits to the movement of an inflation index in the previous year. 
 The changes were part of the transformation, during the middle decades of the 20th century, in how this country treated the elderly. In the 1930s, they had little safety net and frequently struggled to meet their basic needs. Four decades later, they were the only group of Americans with guaranteed health care and a guaranteed income. All in all, it was certainly for the good. 
 But by the 1970s, you could start to see the early signs of excess. In their bill, Mr. Nixon and Congress included a little bonus: the increase in Social Security payments could never be less than 3 percent, no matter what inflation was. In the 1980s, Congress reduced the floor to zero -- meaning that benefits would be held constant if prices fell -- but the principle remained the same: heads, it's a tie; tails, Social Security recipients win. 
 This year, the coin finally came up tails.
 With oil prices plunging and other prices falling, last year's high inflation (which led to the 5.8 percent increase in Social Security payments) has turned into deflation. Overall prices have dropped 2.1 percent in the last year, according to the relevant price index. 
 Social Security payments, however, will remain as they were, which means that recipients are already set to receive an effective raise, even without Mr. Obama's $250 checks. No matter what happens with that proposal, 2010 will be the first year since at least the Nixon era that the buying power of an individual worker's Social Security goes up. 
 Compare that to what's happening with minimum-wage workers in Colorado. Their wage is also tied to inflation, but it has no floor. So it will fall slightly next year, to keep pace with prices.
 Now, I understand that there are arguments on the other side of the issue. Lawrence Summers, Mr. Obama's top economics aide, pointed out that the stimulus bill included one-time $250 payments for Social Security recipients, which were sent out this year, but tax cuts for workers both this year and next year. ''We're correcting an anomaly,'' he told me.
 Others will argue that the elderly simply need help. Some have been the victim of age discrimination. Too many still live in poverty. All of them are likely to see their Medicare premiums rise in 2010. This recession has spared no group.
 But older Americans really have survived the recession better than most. 
 Many of them started buying assets years if not decades ago, meaning they were not the main victims of the stock and housing bubbles. They had a cushion. In addition, relatively few of them work in manufacturing or construction, the hardest-hit industries. 
 Just consider: The real median income of over-65 households rose 3 percent from 2000 to 2008. For households headed by somebody age 25 to 44, it fell about 7 percent.
 Economic policy, like most everything else, is about making choices. Mr. Obama is choosing the elderly, rich and poor, to be more worthy of $14 billion in government checks than struggling workers or schoolchildren. Republicans have pandered in their own ways, choosing to oppose just about any cut in Medicare and, in effect, to stick your grandchildren with an enormous tax bill.
 In a way, I understand where the politicians are coming from. We voters may say that we are in favor of cutting the deficit, but usually mean it in only the theoretical sense. Who wants their own benefits cut? For that matter, who is even willing to have their Social Security checks hold steady? 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about President Obama's proposal to send $250 checks to all Social Security recipients, misstated provisions in a 1970s law and a 1980s law regarding Social Security benefits. A provision in the 1970s law stipulated that Social Security benefits would not decline even if the Consumer Price Index did; the bill did not fix the minimum increase in benefits at 3 percent each year. The 1980s law left that provision intact; it did not create the provision.

HEADLINE: He's Quick To Attack, Yet Vague On Mission

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ended the debate on Tuesday night sounding very much like the man he was eight years ago, efficient and smart, a guy with reasonable answers for nearly every question, and a knack for the sardonic counterpunch.
 Yet, as voters were reminded again, even if he serves another four years, this billionaire mayor could well exit the municipal stage without ever having made that gut connection with New Yorkers that for better or ill defines the best-known mayors. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has a powerful man's manner and a technocrat's way of talking, and he slipped his foe's punches with practiced ease. But the most obvious questions caused him to double-clutch, such as this one: How do you feel when you are told that you are out of touch with average New Yorkers?
 His face contracted in distaste. He makes no pretense of being a mayoral empath. 
 ''I don't think so, I don't get that sense when I ride the subway four or five times a week at minimum,'' he said. ''It's very easy to say I feel your pain. That's not what we need.''
 Mysteries attend to the city's most dominant politician, even after eight years in office. Admired but more rarely loved, he risked a voter revolt by going back on his vow not to seek a third term. He has risked annoying his friends and awakening the dead by bombarding the airwaves with tens of millions of dollars worth of campaign commercials. And in the debate, he attacked his opponent, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., with the fervor suggestive of a man locked in a sweaty electoral clinch. (Most recent polls suggest the mayor has a commanding lead.) 
 Taken together, his style hints at an insecurity not visible to the reportorial eye.
 Mr. Thompson raised his debating game on Tuesday, landing blows about the sagging economy, vast city subsidies for a luxury baseball stadium in the Bronx, and the fact that tens of thousands of middle class tenants are caught between disappearing jobs and too-high rents. The mayor, Mr. Thompson noted, had not joined the lawsuit filed by Manhattan tenants that successfully challenged widespread rent overcharges at Stuyvesant Town, a large housing complex.
 But the mayor hit back hard, sometimes accurately and sometimes not. He invited voters to judge his record on education against that of Mr. Thompson, and suggested that the comptroller had accepted too many large donations from companies seeking to profit from the city's vast public pensions. 
 Eight years ago, Mr. Bloomberg presented a more static debating target. Now he sidesteps tough questions with ease. Why stand and defend the performance of city schoolchildren on federal tests when he can note the performance of children on state test scores, which have risen every year? 
 Challenged to say what he would do with the vast budget gaps that loom in the next few years, Mr. Bloomberg turned to other subjects. (The city's financial plan shows a cumulative gap of $15 billion by 2013, according to the state comptroller.)
 Late in the debate, Mr. Thompson scored points off the mayor's tendency to use sacks of charitable donations to purchase what sounds a lot like silence from prominent politicians and nonprofit leaders who are no less well known. Then Mr. Bloomberg shuffled his feet and answered Mr. Thompson's aggressive move -- the comptroller gave the mayor a grade of D-minus over all -- with rope-a-dope graciousness. ''I think Bill has been a reasonably good comptroller,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, nodding slightly at his opponent. ''We've worked well on most issues.''
 It was an elegant move. But by night's end, what was missing was the urgency that motivated the mayor to embark on this most controversial of his election bids. Months ago, he suggested that the city's dire fiscal condition, the ledgers dipped in red ink, required his cool competence and financial legerdemain. But asked the question on Tuesday night -- what do you hope to accomplish in the next four years that you haven't done yet? -- Mr. Bloomberg turned prosaic.
 ''So,'' he said, hesitating just a second, ''I think it's more of the same, making sure that we continue the things, making sure that we expand the universe of people that benefit from those things.''
 It sounded an awful lot like a successful politician still rummaging about for a purpose.

HEADLINE: Administration Increases Urgency on Climate Change

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Arcadia, Fla., and David Stout from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration and some Senate Democrats expressed fresh urgency on Tuesday about the need to address climate change and refashion the nation's energy economy.
 But they faced determined opposition from Republicans, new concerns from some Democrats and reminders of the financial, technological and political hurdles in remaking the way the nation produces and consumes power.
 In a Senate hearing on a new climate change and energy bill and in coordinated appearances by President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the administration promoted measures to cap greenhouse gas emissions and support new means of fueling homes and vehicles with far less carbon dioxide intensity. Mr. Obama appeared at a solar energy installation in Florida and Mr. Biden at an auto plant in Delaware that will produce electric vehicles, talking about the potential of alternative energy to create jobs. 
 On Capitol Hill, five senior administration officials appeared before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to speak in support of a bill to address global warming and encourage development of nonpolluting energy sources. They said such measures were important not only to the environment but to the nation's economic competitiveness.
 ''When the starting gun sounded on the clean energy race, the United States stumbled,'' Energy Secretary Steven Chu told the Senate panel, saying that spending on green energy technology in China and several European nations was far outstripping that of the United States. ''But I remain confident that we can make up the ground.''
 He added, ''When we gear up our research and production of clean energy technologies, we can still surpass any other country.''
 The climate change measure, sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, aims to cap emissions of the gases linked to the warming of the planet by setting up a program under which industries can buy and sell emissions permits. 
 The measure also provides a variety of incentives for new energy technology, including billions of dollars in subsidies for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.
 Republicans on the committee dismissed the bill as an overly complex one that will harm the economy, kill jobs and favor some parts of the country over others. Democrats generally defended it as a market-based approach to a serious environmental problem that will create jobs by spurring energy innovation.
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is the second-ranking member of the environment committee and chairman of the Finance Committee, warned his fellow Democrats that the Kerry-Boxer bill went too far and could end up delaying any action on global warming for months or years.
 ''The legislation before us today is about our economy,'' Mr. Baucus told the committee. ''Montana, with our resource-based agriculture and tourism economies, cannot afford the unmitigated impacts of climate change. But we also cannot afford the unmitigated effects of climate change legislation.''
 He said the bill's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 2005 levels was too ambitious. He criticized the measure's failure to limit the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to impose additional regulations on carbon dioxide emissions beyond those in the bill.
 And he warned Senator Boxer against using her committee's 12-to-7 Democratic majority to pass a bill without some support from moderate Republicans and Democrats.
 ''We could build that consensus here in this committee,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''If we don't, we risk wasting another month, another year, another Congress without taking a step forward into our future.''
 Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, considered by some a potential Republican vote for climate change legislation, also said the committee was moving too quickly on a complex bill that few understand.
 ''Why are we trying to jam down this legislation now?'' asked Mr. Voinovich, who is retiring at the end of next year. ''Wouldn't it be smarter to take our time and do it right?''
 In Arcadia, Fla., Mr. Obama stood in the midst of the nation's largest solar power generation array to highlight $3.4 billion in stimulus spending for projects to modernize the electric grid through projects across the country.
 ''At this moment, there's something big happening in America, when it comes to creating a clean-energy economy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But getting there will take a few more days like this one, and more projects like this one.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Pounds His Opponent In Last Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
With the ferocity of a bulldog, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Tuesday night ripped into his Democratic opponent, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., in a final mayoral debate that touched on issues including education, taxes and whether Mr. Bloomberg had misused his fortune to advance his political ambitions. 
 While many expected Mr. Bloomberg, who leads by double digits in the polls, to play it safe and offer only vague answers, he showed an aggressiveness he seldom displays in public.
 Within minutes of the debate's start, Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly attacked Mr. Thompson's stewardship of the comptroller's office. When a panelist asked about Mr. Thompson's acceptance of more than $500,000 in campaign contributions from people who did business with the city, Mr. Bloomberg pounced and did something he is not particularly known for: he boiled down his argument to a few pungent words.
 ''Give the money back,'' he told Mr. Thompson. ''It just looks terrible, even if it's not.'' 
 The debate, at the studios of WABC-TV in Manhattan, was the second of two before Tuesday's election. And by all accounts, Mr. Thompson, who delivered a middling performance in the first debate, needed a knockout blow to shake up the campaign in its final days. He is being outspent 14 to 1, and his campaign has been plagued by missteps and missed opportunities.
 Throughout the hourlong debate, Mr. Bloomberg turned almost every question put to him into an attack on his rival. 
 When asked about job creation, for example, Mr. Bloomberg cited his own development policies, before accusing Mr. Thompson of creating only ''patronage jobs'' during his tenure as president of the Board of Education and jobs for placement agents at investment firms who obtained money from the city's pension funds.
 Mr. Thompson did not address the patronage accusation directly. Instead, he responded by defending his record on the Board of Education, citing an article in The New York Times last week in which educators generally praised him as a conciliator.
 Mr. Bloomberg jabbed back, delivering one of the few memorable phrases of the debate when he used a bit of Spanish to say that Mr. Thompson's ineffectiveness ultimately created the need for mayoral control of the schools.
 ''Everybody looked at the job that was done in the 1990s when you ran the Board of Education, and they said, 'No mas!'' Mr. Bloomberg said, prompting applause from the audience. 
 The two clashed over the city's economy, too. Mr. Bloomberg criticized Mr. Thompson's plans for new programs and economic initiatives as unrealistic and overly reliant on new taxes. 
 ''I can't keep straight who he wants to tax,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 Mr. Thompson, looking flabbergasted, noted that Mr. Bloomberg raised property taxes shortly after taking office in 2002.
 ''You squeezed middle-class New Yorkers out of New York,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''You continue to kill the middle class and working New Yorkers in this city.''
 Mr. Bloomberg fired back by noting that Mr. Thompson had, for the first seven years of the mayor's administration, constantly praised the city's fiscal policies as ''prudent.'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Now all of a sudden he's running for mayor and he wants to disavow that.'' 
 The debate offered viewers yearning for substance a robust discussion of municipal issues, in contrast with the previous face-off, which included questions on whether either candidate had ever had a professional manicure or pedicure.
 Again and again the debate returned to education, with Mr. Bloomberg telling voters that if they thought the schools were better under Mr. Thompson, they should vote for Mr. Thompson, and if the schools had improved during the mayor's tenure, they should give him a third term.
 ''He failed our future,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 Even on issues that might have been tripwires, Mr. Bloomberg demonstrated nimbleness. When asked how he would define the middle class, Mr. Bloomberg spoke fluidly about how being middle class was not measured by data but rather by taking the subway (as he does), walking the streets (as he does) and being able to pay the bills but not save much (O.K., never mind).
 Mr. Thompson essentially offered the same answer, but not as crisply. 
 But Mr. Thompson had his moments, too. He may have been at his best, and most ardent, when the candidates were asked about an article published Tuesday on The Times's Web site about Mr. Bloomberg's making, through his accountant, a $26,000 campaign contribution to Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark about a month after Mr. Booker endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.
 Mr. Bloomberg defended the contribution, saying he was proud to support mayors who shared his stances on gun control and education. 
 But Mr. Thompson said the contribution reflected a pattern in which Mr. Bloomberg used his money to woo supporters from mayors to community groups and muzzle potential critics.
 ''This is just a continuation of the worst kind of politics -- this pay-to-endorse politics that Mike Bloomberg is engaged in,'' Mr. Thompson said. He characterized such donations as being ''under the guise of 'Geez, I'm just doing good.' ''
 For the most part, the debate lacked the kinds of memorable phrases or flubs that could alter a race so late in the campaign. Mr. Thompson lapsed into bureaucratese at times, saying the city was suffering from an ''affordability gap.'' He was more vivid in citing Enron as a parallel to what he said was Mr. Bloomberg's tendency to ''cook the books'' or stretch the truth about his record on education, the economy and other issues.
 But Mr. Thompson did not take advantage of several opportunities. He did not play up the fact that President Obama had endorsed him recently, if tepidly. Instead, he said that he shared Mr. Obama's vision of a ''demand-driven economy.'' Indeed, viewers who were unaware of Mr. Obama's endorsement could have easily assumed that Mr. Bloomberg had gotten the president's backing, since Mr. Bloomberg mentioned that Mr. Obama had plucked Shaun Donovan, his former housing commissioner, as the nation's housing secretary.
 Only at the end did Mr. Thompson touch on what many people feel is one of his strong suits: his biography as the grandson of Caribbean immigrants and the son of a schoolteacher and a judge.
 Toward the end of the hour, Mr. Thompson's frustration with the mayor seemed to spill out. Each man was asked to grade the other's job performance. Mr. Thompson hesitated and then said, ''I think I'll be kind and give the mayor a D-minus.''
 Mr. Bloomberg, who had the advantage of answering last, declined to give Mr. Thompson a letter grade. Instead, he said, ''I think Bill has been a reasonably good comptroller,'' before noting that the job they were competing for was mayor, not comptroller.
 ''He's certainly the best comptroller that I've ever had to work with,'' he added with a mischievous smile, omitting the obvious: Mr. Thompson is the only comptroller Mr. Bloomberg has served with.

HEADLINE: Intentions Of Turkey Worry West

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: ISTANBUL 

 BODY:
With Turkey's prospects for joining the European Union growing more elusive and the country reaching out to predominantly Muslim countries with a vigor not seen in years, a longstanding question is vexing the United States and Europe: Is this large, secular Muslim country turning East instead of West?
 When President Obama visited Turkey in April -- a symbolic gesture that underlined Turkey's geostrategic importance -- he emphasized the country's role as a bridge between East and West, acknowledged its mediation in the Arab-Israeli conflict and threw his weight solidly behind Turkey becoming a European Union member. 
 Now, six months later, some in Washington and Brussels are questioning Turkey's dependability as an ally, and many Turks are asking whether they should reject the European Union before the bloc rejects them.
 Fears that Turkey is abandoning its bridge-building role were fanned this month when it canceled air force exercises with Israel, straining ties that frayed in January when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogancastigated Israel's president, Shimon Peres, over the war in Gaza, in front of world leaders at Davos, Switzerland. 
 Senior Turkish officials say Mr. Erdogan, who was mediating between Israel and Syria just weeks before the conflict in Gaza broke out, felt personally betrayed by Israel's aggression and what he regarded as the needless killing of innocent Muslims.
 At the same time, some Western diplomats say, Turkey has made what they consider alarming overtures toward Iran. 
 When the official result of Iran's disputed presidential election was announced in June, Turkey was one of the first countries to congratulate President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his re-election. On Tuesday, during a visit to Tehran, Mr. Erdogan said the West was applying a double standard in pressuring Iran over its nuclear program. ''Those who are chanting for global nuclear disarmament should first start in their own countries,'' he said.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has vociferously opposed European Union membership for Turkey, arguing that it is not geographically part of Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has expressed similar reservations. Many Turks have interpreted the rejection to mean that their country is not welcome because of its large Muslim population. 
 At a meeting in Istanbul last week about Turkey's relations with its neighbors, Representative Robert Wexler, chairman of the European subcommittee in Congress, said: ''You wonder why Turkey is curious about different avenues? Look at your own behavior and attitude, Europe.''
 Other analysts say that cultural and economic factors are also pushing Turkey in that direction. 
 Ersin Kalaycioglu, a political science professor at Sabanci University, noted that the global financial crisis had contracted European economies, prompting Turkey, a large exporter, to seek different markets. He and others also suggested that leaders of the governing Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., a socially conservative party with Muslim roots, felt more at home in Riyadh, Damascus and Baghdad than in Paris, London or Rome.
 Even a partial collapse of talks with the European Union would have far-reaching consequences. Turkey is an indispensable ally for the United States and Europe. Bordered by Iran, Iraq and Syria, Turkey is a powerful symbol of the compatibility of democracy, capitalism and Islam. Located between the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, it has vital strategic importance as a transit country for gas. It also has deep influence in Afghanistan and is a regional leader in the Caucasus.
 Yet the country's European Union negotiations are in a precarious state. Negotiations on a number of issues have been blocked because of its long dispute with Cyprus. For the first time in years, leading figures in the business establishment, which has always led the drive for European Union integration, are questioning the wisdom of continuing a negotiating process that appears to have no end. 
 ''We Turks are a proud nation and we don't want to go to a house where we were invited but where the host keeps slamming the door in our face,'' said Hasan Arat, an executive at a top Turkish real estate development firm.
 For all the country's wounded pride, Turkish officials and analysts insist that Turkey has no intention of abandoning the West. Rather than reorienting Turkish foreign policy toward the East, Egemen Bagis, Turkey's minister for European Union affairs, argued in an interview that the recent outreach to its neighbors -- including the opening of its border with Syria, the signing of a historic agreement with Armenia to establish normal diplomatic relations and the engagement of Iran -- was helping Turkey become a more effective interlocutor for its Western allies.
 ''Any bridge with one strong leg and one weak leg can't stand for long,'' Mr. Bagis said. 
 Ibrahim Kalin, chief foreign policy adviser to Mr. Erdogan, said Western critics of Turkey's new inclusive foreign policy were using a double standard. ''When the U.S. makes an overture to Russia, everyone applauds this as a new era in diplomacy,'' he said. ''But when Turkey tries to reach out to Iran, people ask if it is trying to change its axis.''
 Mr. Kalin said that the anti-Turkish talk emanating from key European capitals was making it harder to convince the Turkish people about the need for European Union membership. 
 Rather than worrying that Turkey is moving toward the East, said Cengiz Aktar, a leading expert here on the European Union, the West should fear a wounded Turkey turning to Russia. Already, Russia has been courting it as a distribution point for energy supplies, while Turkish investment in Russia is intensifying. 
 ''This government is perfectly capable of saying 'no thanks' to Europe and instead shifting toward Russia,'' Mr. Aktar said.

HEADLINE: Gas Company Won't Drill in Watershed

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Mireya Navarro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bowing to intense public pressure, the Chesapeake Energy Corporation says it will not drill for natural gas within the upstate New York watershed, an environmentally sensitive region that supplies unfiltered water to nine million people. 
 The reversal seems to signal a more conciliatory tone from the gas industry, which is facing mounting opposition in New York to its drilling practices. The decision also increases the pressure on state regulators to reverse their decision to allow drilling within the watershed.
 ''We are not going to develop those leases, and we are not taking any more leases, and I don't think anybody else in the industry would dare to acquire leases in the New York City watershed,'' Aubrey K. McClendon, the chief executive officer at Chesapeake Energy, said in an interview on Monday in Fort Worth. ''Why go through the brain damage of that, when we have so many other opportunities?'' 
 He spoke on the eve of the first scheduled hearing on proposed state rules governing the drilling, on Wednesday in Loch Sheldrake in Sullivan County.
 Chesapeake, one of the nation's biggest gas producers, is the largest leaseholder in the Marcellus Shale, a subterranean layer of shale rock that runs from New York to Tennessee. The shale is believed to hold substantial natural gas reserves. 
 But extracting gas from shale relies on a method called hydraulic fracturing that has stirred broad concerns. Water, laced with chemicals, is blasted down gas wells at high pressure to break the rock and allow gas to flow out more easily. The technology has vigorously expanded in recent years, allowing for enormous growth in the nation's natural gas reserves.
 But the concerns include the use of chemicals, the disposal of wastewater and the danger of leaks and spills into groundwater and deep aquifers. There also has been a string of explosions from Wyoming to Pennsylvania.
 Under energy legislation passed in 2005, the industry won an exemption from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. 
 Chesapeake acquired 5,000 acres in the watershed when it bought Columbia Natural Resources a few years ago, and it is currently the only leaseholder in the area. 
 Over all, Mr. McClendon said, the company's holdings in the watershed are ''a drop in the bucket'' compared with the Marcellus field's potential. He suggested that Chesapeake had more to lose by drilling there than by forgoing it, even though he contended such drilling would do no harm.
 ''How could any one well be so profitable that it would be worth damaging the New York City water system?'' he said.
 But Chesapeake and other companies are still expected to drill for gas in areas of the state outside the watershed. 
 State officials have been eager to embrace the drilling because of its potential economic benefits, especially in the current downturn. This month, the state's environmental agency said it would allow companies to drill throughout the state, imposing few specific limits on operations. 
 The proposed regulations, which were requested last year by Gov. David A. Paterson, do not ban drilling in the watershed, as many New York City officials and environmental advocates had urged, but would require buffer zones around reservoirs and aqueducts. 
 Gas industry representatives say the rules, if enacted, will be among the most restrictive in the country. Opponents say they would be inadequate to prevent contamination.
 The New York watershed is an area of about one million acres, representing 4 percent of the state's total surface. Thanks to gravity, water from the region's rivers and streams flows to six reservoirs in the Catskills, and then, through a series of aqueducts and tunnels, to the taps of New Yorkers. This system provides unfiltered drinking water for half the state's population, including 8.2 million people in New York City and about one million people in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties. 
 Some New York City politicians welcomed Chesapeake's decision and said they hoped it would have a broader impact. ''To proceed with drilling doesn't make any business sense and doesn't make environmental sense, and I think Chesapeake understands this, and I am happy they have come to that decision,'' said James F. Gennaro, chairman of the City Council's Committee on Environmental Protection. ''If only we could get the state government to come to the same realization. It is strangely ironic.''
 Chesapeake's announcement was also praised by environmental advocates. They said the company's position should encourage the state to reverse its decision and impose an outright drilling ban throughout the watershed. 
 ''When the industry says it will not drill in the watershed, it sends a strong message to state regulators that drilling there is inappropriate,'' said James L. Simpson, an attorney at Riverkeeper, an environmental group.
 Hydraulic fracturing pumps huge volumes of water laced with chemicals like benzene into the shale to break it and release the natural gas. The process has been linked to contamination of water wells and the death of livestock exposed to potassium chloride, one of the chemicals used.
 State environmental regulators have said they saw no ''realistic threat'' to water quality that would warrant a drilling ban in the two watersheds in the Catskills region. Their review noted that the city controlled a large amount of the land surrounding the reservoirs and could deny permission to drill in those areas.
 In addition to the forum on Wednesday, hearings on the state's proposed regulations are scheduled Nov. 10 in New York City, Nov. 12 in Broome County and Nov. 18 in Steuben County.
 Chesapeake said it had started to publicize the chemical components of the fluids it uses during drilling, down to the percentages for each chemical used since last year, acknowledging criticism that companies had not been transparent enough. ''The industry is moving quickly to complete disclosure,'' Mr. McClendon said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Afghan Strategy Of Protecting Population Hubs

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER, PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article is by Thom Shanker, Peter Baker and Helene Cooper.
 WASHINGTON -- President Obama's advisers are focusing on a strategy for Afghanistan aimed at protecting about 10 top population centers, administration officials said Tuesday, describing an approach that would stop short of an all-out assault on the Taliban while still seeking to nurture long-term stability. 
 Mr. Obama has yet to make a decision and has other options available to him, but as officials described it, the debate is no longer over whether to send more troops, but how many more will be needed. The question of how much of the country should fall under the direct protection of American and NATO forces will be central to deciding how many troops will be sent. 
 At the moment, the administration is looking at protecting Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz, Herat, Jalalabad and a few other village clusters, officials said. The first of any new troops sent to Afghanistan would be assigned to Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual capital, seen as a center of gravity in pushing back insurgent advances.
 But military planners are also pressing for enough troops to safeguard major agricultural areas, like the hotly contested Helmand River valley, as well as regional highways essential to the economy -- tasks that would require significantly more reinforcements beyond the 21,000 deployed by Mr. Obama this year.
 One administration official said Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan, had briefed Mr. Obama's advisers on how he would deploy any new troops under the approach being considered by the White House. The first two additional combat brigades would go south, including one to Kandahar, while a third would be sent to eastern Afghanistan and a fourth would be used flexibly across the nation, said the official, who like others insisted on anonymity to describe internal deliberations.
 Administration and military officials said the strategy would include other elements, like accelerated training of Afghan troops, expanded economic development and reconciliation with less radical members of the Taliban.
 But such a strategy would be open to complaints that American and allied forces were in effect giving insurgents free rein across large parts of the nation, allowing the Taliban to establish ministates with training camps that could be used by Al Qaeda.
 ''We are not talking about surrendering the rest of the country to the Taliban,'' a senior administration official said.
 Military officers said that they would maintain pressure on insurgents in remote regions by using surveillance drones and reports from people in the field to find pockets of Taliban fighters and to guide attacks, in particular by Special Operations forces. 
 But a range of officials made the case that many insurgents fighting Americans in distant locations are motivated not by jihadist ideology, but by local grievances, and are not much of a threat to the United States or to the government in Kabul.
 At the heart of this strategy is the conclusion that the United States cannot completely eradicate the insurgency in a nation where the Taliban is an indigenous force -- nor does it need to in order to protect American national security. Instead, the focus would be on preventing Al Qaeda from returning in force while containing and weakening the Taliban long enough to build Afghan security forces that would eventually take over the mission.
 In effect, the approach blends ideas advanced by General McChrystal and by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., seen as opposite poles in the internal debate. 
 General McChrystal has sought at least 40,000 more troops for a counterinsurgency strategy to protect Afghan civilians so they will support the central government. Mr. Biden has opposed a buildup, contending that a bigger military footprint could be counterproductive and that fighting Al Qaeda in Pakistan should be the top priority.
 A strategy of protecting major Afghan population centers would be ''McChrystal for the city, Biden for the country,'' as one administration official put it. Officials said Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was playing a crucial role, balancing the case made by commanders with the skepticism of some civilians on Mr. Obama's war council as the debate entered its final days.
 A senior military officer said the developing strategy adopted General McChrystal's central tenet. ''We are no longer thinking about just destroying the enemy in a conventional way,'' the officer said. ''We must remove the main pressure that civilians live under, which is the constant intimidation and corruption and direct threat from the insurgency.''
 The officer said General McChrystal wanted the most expansive definition of population centers to include fertile valleys, economic belts and major roadways, in particular the national ring road central for commerce, as well as four or five roadways linking Afghanistan eastward to Pakistan and westward to Iran.
 Officials said no exact statistics were available for the percentage of the Afghan population that would fall under a new population-centered policy.
 Elements of the strategy are already being carried out. Over the past month, General McChrystal has closed half a dozen isolated military outposts in towns like Wanat, where nine Americans were killed in a vicious firefight in July 2008. The decision to close these bases has allowed the general to shift nearly 1,000 troops to other missions.
 Historical analogies are imperfect, but the strategy being put in place can be viewed as a rejection of arguments that individual villages have a strategic importance -- a Vietnam-era mistake -- instead building on the lessons of the Iraq troop increase, when large population areas received the most reinforcements.
 Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been working closely with the administration on Afghanistan, signaled the current thinking in a speech on Monday: ''We don't have to control every hamlet and village, particularly when non-Pashtun sections of the country are already hostile to the Taliban.''
 One possible focus in the administration debate centers on Helmand, a lightly populated farming area and Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. For years, insurgents controlled much of the province, but Marines arrived in force this year to reinforce British troops. 
 Some administration officials ask whether it makes sense for 20 percent of the foreign forces to be protecting 3 percent of the country's population. But others point out that Helmand's fertile valley is important to Afghanistan's economy and that it has become a major source of opium used to finance the insurgency.
 Mr. Obama will meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, his seventh major session since beginning his review.

HEADLINE: Oval Man Cave

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 I felt a twinge of envy when I heard that my pal Tom Friedman had played golf with the president for five hours one September Sunday.
 Tom learned a lot about Barack Obama's positions on weighty issues and sporty ones. (This president doesn't cheat and he does expect bets to be paid off.) My natural impulse was to shrug it off. Men have always craved private realms -- the golf club, men's club, garage, workshop, shed; a place to get away from the chatter and clatter of women and kids. (In Obama's case, he may desire a testosterone break from his estrogen nest -- a wife, two daughters and a mother-in-law.)
 Gordon Thorburn, the British author of the book ''Men and Sheds,'' explained that the word shed derived from the Anglo-Saxon ''scead,'' or shade. It was, in a metaphorical sense, obscure, an ''intellectual pantry'' or ''spiritual home'' where a man could reflect and dawdle with tools and toys. 
 But I don't kid myself that the presidential playing fields are merely about play. After Tom's golf outing, Politico ran the headline: ''Friedman jumps to the front of the influence list.''
 Like other bosses, presidents surround themselves with people who make them comfortable. Poppy Bush liked racy humor, but was too gentlemanly to use it with women. So male advisers bonded with him by telling dirty jokes.
 Obama likes to play sports, watch sports and talk sports. (Even his favorite TV shows, ''Mad Men'' and ''Entourage,'' are set in male-dominated worlds.) So the Obama aides who can do that, like Robert Gibbs, have a deeper personal connection with the president than someone like Rahm Emanuel, the former ballet dancer who prefers yoga to golf. 
 Just as some men can't ingratiate themselves through sports, some women can. Condi Rice drew close to W. -- nudging away Dick Cheney -- by working out with him and talking football.
 As long as I've covered politics, there were always women running up against ''The Boys.'' In 1984, Geraldine Ferraro complained about the ''smart-ass white boys'' from Walter Mondale's campaign who tried to boss her around. As first lady, Hillary Clinton had to deal with Bill's coterie of cocky ''white boys.''
 It was a bit surprising that the same dynamic recurred with the first black president. But it is the very enormity of the change Obama represents that makes him cautious at times about more change.
 Because Obama regards himself as the change, he didn't immediately see the need to alter what his aide Anita Dunn calls the ''optics.''
 His race also gives him cover; it took quite a while for anyone to accuse Obama of being exclusionary.
 After stories about the frat-house atmosphere in the spheres of economics and national security, and snipes about an all-male basketball pickup game at the White House with cabinet secretaries and congressmen, the president took Melody Barnes, his chief domestic policy adviser, golfing on Sunday.
 ''I wanted women to still hold their heads up so I didn't want to shoot triple bogies every hole,'' said Barnes, who was hailed by the press for ''smashing the grass ceiling.''
 She told me she grew up golfing with her dad and shoots around 100. She and Obama were partners and beat White House trip director Marvin Nicholson and Obama's Chicago pal Eric Whitaker. 
 ''We laughed and gave each other a hard time and psyched each other out,'' she said. ''It was all on the line on the 18th hole and I made a clutch putt and now I'm $10 richer.''
 Naturally, some men -- and women -- caviled that Obama shouldn't have caved on his Man Cave.
 ''Will every game now have to have a certain number of Asians, atheists, vegetarians and public-option hard-liners?'' groused one of my girlfriends.
 Just as the hoops-playing president is getting knocked for being too traditionally male, the hula-hooping Michelle is getting knocked for being too traditionally female.
 ''She's mostly played it safe,'' Allison Samuels writes in Newsweek, ''dabbling in traditional East Wing issues -- much like the first ladies before her -- without yet gaining much traction on any particular front.''
 The First Couple is trying to let America digest the huge change that they signify. They know that Fox News is always ready to pounce with that ''radical'' label.
 Besides, if Obama starts using a quota system for recreation, it will give fuel to the Republican campaign to paint him as a hand-wringing, Mom-jeans-wearing girly-boy. Churlish Cheney charged the president with ''dithering'' on Afghanistan and nerdy potential 2012 rival Tim Pawlenty, the Terror from Minnesota, accused Obama of ''projecting potential weakness'' on national security.
 Since the president is finally willing to let women in on the games, I offered up my own challenge: Scrabble. I'm curious about what X and Z words the smarty-pants Y chief executive can come up with. 
 There might even be $10 in it for you, Mr. President.

HEADLINE: Bill Seeks To Shift Rescue Costs To Big Banks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration and the head of an important House committee unveiled legislation on Tuesday to give the government broad new powers to shift the cost of rescues of big, troubled financial institutions from taxpayers to other large companies. 
 The legislation, drafted jointly by Treasury officials and Representative Barney Frank, the head of the House Financial Services Committee, would create a special fund, paid by assessments on financial companies with more than $10 billion in assets, to bear the costs of big firms that fail. 
 A statement by the committee said that the legislation followed a ''polluter-pays model where the financial industry has to pay for its mistakes -- not taxpayers.'' Assessments on those companies would be made only after the collapse of a large institution, and the legislation gives the government authority to levy such payments over an extended period. 
 The legislation tries to respond to the enormous outcry over the serial taxpayer bailouts over the last 15 months of some of the nation's biggest financial companies, including Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the American International Group, Citigroup and Bank of America. 
 The measure, directed at institutions whose troubles might pose risks to the financial system, would create a powerful financial services oversight council, led by the Treasury secretary and composed of top regulators, to set policy and tougher regulations for the largest companies and mediate disputes between federal agencies. It would also give the Federal Reserve Board a lead role in directly supervising many of the largest financial conglomerates. 
 The legislation would impose new restraints on industrial loan companies -- financial institutions owned by commercial enterprises like retailers or manufacturers -- and, in the future, would not permit any more commercial companies to own banks. 
 The committee, striking a compromise with the administration, preserves the thousands of thrift charters that the White House proposed to eliminate, but it gives supervision of thrift holding companies to the Fed to prevent them from shopping for the least restrictive regulator. 
 The legislation would permit the government to impose tough new capital requirements on the largest companies as well as take them over, making their shares virtually worthless, and remove management when they fail. It would provide new authority for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which seizes weak commercial banks, to take over other large failing financial institutions like insurance companies or hedge funds.
 Under the proposal, future rescues of large institutions would be paid for by other big firms. The proposal says that any financial company with assets of more than $10 billion would have to contribute to the rescue of a failed firm. The legislation emerged after community banks lobbied to ensure that small institutions would not have to pay for future bailouts. 
 The legislation was made public after the House Financial Services Committee approved another major chapter of legislation aimed at overhauling the regulatory system.
 Continuing its focus on the regulatory issues raised by the financial crisis, the committee approved a measure that would require hedge funds, private equity funds and offshore pools of capital to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The committee also nearly completed its work on a provision to impose tighter regulations on credit rating agencies, which it is expected to approve on Wednesday. 
 At the committee's legislative drafting session on Tuesday, Representative Paul Kanjorski, the Pennsylvania Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, added the requirement of registration by offshore funds. Without that, he said, regulators could not get a broad picture of the marketplace.
 ''There is a common psychology to use the Cayman Islands to hide funds,'' Mr. Kanjorski said. ''The whole point of these bills is to get a large enough understanding of the total amount of capital that the systemic risk regulator should be aware of.''
 Mr. Kanjorski's legislation contained an exemption for venture funds, but they would have to provide more information to regulators in other ways.
 The legislation approved by the committee on Tuesday would also give the commission the authority to abolish the requirement that brokers force customers to take disputes to arbitration. And it would establish a fund to compensate whistle-blowers on Wall Street who report unlawful activity. 
 The legislation was prepared after the revelations of problems at the S.E.C., including its repeated failures over many years to detect the huge Ponzi scheme engineered by Bernard L. Madoff.
 The legislation that the committee is expected to approve on Wednesday would tighten restrictions on credit rating agencies and would explicitly give investors the ability to sue the companies if they violate federal securities law and ''knowingly or recklessly'' fail to review significant information as they prepare their ratings.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate banking committee, has said he intends to introduce legislation as early as November. He has been engaged in discussions on a draft of the legislation with Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee. The men have a close working relationship, though aides said that significant differences remain between them about important aspects of the legislation.
 The House Financial Services Committee has already approved legislation tightening regulation of derivatives and creating a consumer protection agency to monitor companies for misleading credit cards or mortgages.
