HEADLINE: Rise of a Trading Power, in 10 Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- As China heads into a weekend of speeches celebrating its 10 years as an official member of the global trade community, the rest of the world may want to contemplate the exported $49 microwave oven and the imported $85,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Sunday is the 10th anniversary of China's joining the World Trade Organization -- a membership that helped turn China into the world's biggest economy after the United States. Companies and consumers worldwide have benefited from China's emergence as a top trading partner. And yet, because of special breaks and loopholes for China when it joined the W.T.O., it still shields its domestic markets from foreign competition much more than any other big nation.
Consider that $49 microwave oven and $85,000 Jeep.
Microwave oven prices have plunged in the West over the past decade, largely because China has combined inexpensive labor, excellent infrastructure and heavy factory investment to produce the ovens and a wide range of other consumer goods for export, making creature comforts more affordable to customers around the world. 
Further, W.T.O. rules against protectionism have made it difficult for countries in the West to limit China's sixfold surge in exports during those 10 years, even as the Chinese flood of products has forced factory closings and layoffs elsewhere.
But price tags on imported cars at dealerships in Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities signal how China has continued to protect its home market under the special terms of the W.T.O. agreement it negotiated before joining the trade group.
In the United States, prices for a Detroit-made Jeep Grand Cherokee start at $27,490. But in China, after tariffs and other protective fees, it sells for $85,000 or more. (It's no surprise that Chrysler has sold fewer than 2,500 of them so far this year in China.)
Foreign trading partners often chafe at the way China uses the W.T.O. rules to its advantage.
The Chinese economy's ''spectacular rise would not have been possible without the open global trading system that China was able to benefit from during the past 10 years,'' said Karel de Gucht, the European Union's trade commissioner.
''At the same time,'' he said, ''China is having to increasingly recognize and respect not only the legal responsibilities it now faces as a member of a global rules-based body, but also the W.T.O. 'spirit' of promoting open markets and nondiscriminatory principles.''
Chinese officials have been effusive in the run-up to their W.T.O. anniversary. ''We believe that our 10-year arrangement has been successful -- the results of the past 10 years are welcome and a valuable inspiration,'' Yu Jianhua, China's assistant minister of commerce, said at a news conference last month in Beijing.
The roots of China's economic model trace to the singular terms under which the nation joined the World Trade Organization, which now has 153 members.
Based in Geneva, the group was established in 1995 as the successor to an international framework called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- GATT, as it was known -- that had been mapped out in the early years after World War II.
After negotiating for 15 years to be admitted to GATT and then to the W.T.O., China was finally let in after agreeing to accept the W.T.O.'s broad free trade rules. But as all new members do, Beijing also had to negotiate a lengthy document, known as an accession agreement. It spelled out thousands of details tailored to the specifics of the economy of China, which then was still very much a developing country.
The agreement required China to lower its tariffs to levels below those of many other developing countries. But compared with most industrialized countries, China was allowed to impose considerably higher tariffs -- tariffs China has retained even as its economy has subsequently grown to No. 2 in the world.
The clearest example of W.T.O. ascendance China-style may be in automobiles. Even though China's auto manufacturing industry and car market are now both the world's largest, China continues to shelter them behind the highest trade barriers of any large industrial economy.
It retains a prohibitive tariff of 25 percent on imported cars, for example, which helps explain why imports represent only 4 percent of the light vehicles sold in China.
Japan, by comparison, no longer has any tariffs on imported cars, while South Korea has an 8 percent tariff and the European Union a 10 percent tariff. The United States, meantime, has a tariff of only 2.5 percent for imported cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles.
But the 25 percent tariff is only one reason a Grand Cherokee costs three times as much in Chongqing as in Chicago. In the name of energy conservation, China also assesses a sales tax of up to 40 percent of the vehicle's price based on its engine size. Small, fuel-sipping Chinese cars pay the lowest rate, as little as 1 percent, while gas-guzzlers from the United States and Europe pay the highest rate.
China also collects a 17 percent value-added tax on almost everything sold in the country, whether imported or domestically produced. But like many European nations, China uses a W.T.O. provision that allows the tax to be fully refunded to China's export producers, who often pass along the saving to foreign buyers.
What's more, China limits foreign manufacturers to no more than 50 percent ownership of car assembly plants in China. That special rule, which China managed to negotiate for its W.T.O. accession agreement when its auto industry seemed tiny and vulnerable, has forced multinationals to set up numerous joint ventures in China and to transfer a wide range of technology to those Chinese partners.
China's W.T.O. agreement did open many service sectors of the Chinese economy, like transportation, banking and retailing, to foreign competition.
FedEx, for example, has expanded rapidly in China and now has 9,000 employees in the country. The company also relies heavily on American-made Boeing 777-Fs, with mostly American pilots, to ferry an ever-rising tide of Chinese goods to the FedEx hub in Memphis.
And Wal-Mart has been able to open 353 retail stores in China, despite the hostility of many small, local retailers.
China's W.T.O. agreement had some big omissions, including the thorny question of whether to let foreign companies bid on Chinese government projects -- an issue that remains unresolved.
China got many of its breaks because the W.T.O. and its members, including the United States, were eager to accept it into the international trade group to encourage Beijing's embrace of capitalism and to make it a more fully vested participant in the global community.
But trade officials say that they never expected all the terms of China's accession agreement to last as long as they have.
Instead, China and other trading nations had expected to reduce trade barriers further in the Doha Round of global trade talks. But the talks dragged on and then effectively collapsed in 2008 -- despite periodic efforts to revive it, including a meeting of ministers next week in Geneva.
While China is acutely aware of other countries' concerns about its tariffs, it is leery of lowering them unilaterally without concessions from other countries, said He Weiwen, a council member of the China Society for W.T.O. Studies in Beijing.
For the West, the open question is whether China's high tariffs and other market protections will be allowed to remain in place indefinitely. Just as worrisome: a few provisions in the agreement that were meant to blunt the competitive impact of Chinese exports on Western industries are starting to expire.
The most notable of these is China's current designation under its W.T.O. agreement as a ''nonmarket economy.'' The label makes it fairly easy for overseas industries to accuse Chinese companies of dumping goods into their markets at prices below cost, and to seek steep tariffs on their shipments.
That is just the sort of accusation, in fact, that American solar panel manufacturers have leveled at China in a trade case pending at the Commerce Department in Washington -- a case the American industry is widely expected to win.
But under the W.T.O. agreement, China will automatically be relabeled a market economy in 2016. That status will make it harder for companies in other countries to win antidumping decisions against China -- and will probably clear the way for Chinese businesses to further increase their global market share.
Ideally, that could mean a lot more products like $49 microwaves on Western shelves -- even if means a Grand Cherokee from Detroit may never be affordable in China.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Owners and Players Make Labor Agreement Official

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Officially calling an end to a costly and contentious five-month-long lockout, Commissioner David Stern said Thursday that the 30 N.B.A. owners had ratified a new collective bargaining agreement that was approved simultaneously by the players.
The deal, which was agreed on in principle several weeks ago, includes a 12 percent reduction in player salaries, a limit to the length of player contracts and a host of other changes designed to shrink the gap between the strongest and weakest teams. 
To that end, the owners also approved a new revenue-sharing formula that will roughly quadruple the amount of money paid by the teams that exceed the salary cap to the financially weakest teams.
''It will help us move toward a better business model, a more competitive league, and better alignment between compensation and performance,'' Stern said after 25 of the league's 30 owners approved the deal. ''It's a fair agreement, we believe, that had many compromises from both sides. While it's not perfect, the deal addresses significant issues on both sides in a very productive way, we believe.''
More than 85 percent of the more than 200 players who voted agreed to ratify the agreement, according to the National Basketball Players Association. However, less than half the number of eligible players voted.
Still, the votes pave the way for teams to begin signing free agents. Already, there have been reports that the league's financially strongest teams, including the Knicks, the Lakers and the Heat, are jockeying to sign the best free agents on the market, suggesting that the league's goal of achieving more parity among teams is a work in progress.
Adam Silver, the league's deputy commissioner, acknowledged that teams would continue to seek the best players. But he said that the new revenue-sharing formula and other elements of the collective bargaining agreement are being phased in over several years, so it will take time to gauge how and whether teams change the way they act.
''I think in terms of behavior of teams with this new harsher, more progressive tax, behavior is often difficult to predict,'' Silver said. ''We've been wrong many times before in predicting owner behavior. There might be a psychological barrier to surpassing certain tax levels in this deal in addition to economic disincentives. But we'll see.''
The new revenue-sharing agreement, which will take full effect in the 2013-14 season, calls for a transfer of $196 million from the richest teams to the teams that generate the least revenue. Stern, who called the negotiations over revenue sharing ''tortuous,'' said he expected six to nine teams to contribute to the revenue-sharing pool. Under the new formula, the Los Angeles Lakers will pay the highest amount, as much as $50 million a year, followed by the Knicks at $30 million, according to a person who has seen the plan. About half a dozen teams would receive about $16 million each.
The agreement also calls for shorter contract lengths for free-agent signings and a rule that allows a team to waive one of its player contracts and have that salary removed from team salary-cap calculation.
Taken together, Stern said the changes reflected ''a joint determination to restructure the league so that the dollars would be available for our teams to be more competitive'' and ''that teams could rebuild.''
Under the new agreement, the minimum age for new players will remain at 19. But the league and the union will form a committee once the season begins to study the issue further. There have been calls for raising the minimum age for rookies.
Silver also said that testing for human growth hormone will not begin this season, and there is no specific timeline in mind. The league and the union are waiting for a panel of independent scientists and experts to approve a valid and reliable test for H.G.H. before proceeding with mandatory testing.
After years of negotiations and an estimated $400 million in revenue lost during the lockout, it was not surprising that Stern and Silver were happy to be talking about games again.
''I think most importantly we're back to basketball,'' Silver said.

HEADLINE: The Gingrich Tragedy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility.
As he said in 2007, ''It's not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.'' 
Look at American history, Gingrich continued, ''The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.''
This was not one of Gingrich's passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, ''Window of Opportunity,'' is a broadside against what he calls the ''laissez-faire'' conservatism -- the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, ''The opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.''
Over the years, this approach has led Gingrich to support cap-and-trade energy legislation to combat global warming. It has led him to endorse universal health care coverage. It has led him to support humane immigration reform. He enthusiastically backed Jack Kemp's efforts to fight poverty, the precursors to compassionate conservatism.
Though his ideas stray, his most common theme is that government should intervene in crucial ways to create a dynamic, decentralized, low-tax society.
So why am I not more excited by the Gingrich surge?
In the first place, Gingrich loves government more than I do. He has no Hayekian modesty to restrain his faith in statist endeavor. For example, he has called for ''a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the Moon's resources.'' He has suggested that ''a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways.''
I'm for national greatness conservatism, but this is a little too great.
Furthermore, he has an unconservative faith in his own innocence. The crossroads where government meets enterprise can be an exciting crossroads. It can also be a corrupt crossroads. It requires moral rectitude to separate public service from private gain. Gingrich was perfectly content to belly up to the Freddie Mac trough and then invent a Hamiltonian rational to justify his own greed.
Then there is his rhetorical style. He seems to have understood that a moderate Republican like himself can win so long as he adopts a bombastic style when taking on the liberal elites. Most people just want somebody who can articulate their hatreds, and Gingrich is demagogically happy to play the role.
Most important, there is temperament and character. As Yuval Levin noted in a post for National Review, the two Republican front-runners, Gingrich and Mitt Romney are both ''very wonky Rockefeller Republicans who moved to the right over time as their party moved right.''
But they have very different temperaments. Romney, Levin observes, has an executive temperament -- organization, discipline, calm and restraint. Gingrich has a revolutionary temperament -- intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response.
I'd make a slightly similar point more rudely. In the two main Republican contenders, we have one man, Romney, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1950s, and another, Gingrich, who seems to have walked straight out of the 1960s. He has every negative character trait that conservatives associate with '60s excess: narcissism, self-righteousness, self-indulgence and intemperance. He just has those traits in Republican form.
As nearly everyone who has ever worked with him knows, he would severely damage conservatism and the Republican Party if nominated. He would severely damage the Hamilton-Theodore Roosevelt strain in American life.
It's really too bad. We could have had a great debate about the progressive-conservative tradition. President Obama is now embracing Roosevelt. Gingrich has tried to modernize this tendency.
But how you believe something is as important as what you believe. It doesn't matter if a person shares your overall philosophy. If that person doesn't have the right temperament and character, stay away.

HEADLINE: Deep Roots Of Fraud At Olympus

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Blame it on James A. Baker III. The ''Plaza Accord'' that halted the appreciation of the United States dollar in 1985 was largely his doing, as Ronald Reagan's Treasury secretary. It set in motion a series of events that led to a huge fraud at the Olympus Corporation, the Japanese maker of cameras and medical imaging equipment, that lasted more than two decades.
It turns out that it was an effort to make the company's books accurate -- at least in terms of its balance sheet -- that led to the suspicious transactions noticed by Michael C. Woodford, at the time the newly appointed president and chief executive. He thought they showed theft from the company by its chairman, and he confronted him.
It now appears the chairman reacted with righteous indignation. He had not stolen; he had only tried to clean up a mess without damaging the reputation of generations of Olympus executives. 
From his point of view, I infer from a new report by an investigating committee, there had been no need to tell Mr. Woodford about what had happened because the fraud was finally behind the company when Mr. Woodford took the job.
The report, released by Olympus this week, shows that two changes in accounting rules, one caused by the Enron scandal, eventually led to the collapse of the scheme.
It shows that KPMG AZSA, the Japanese affiliate of the international accounting group, failed to notice what was going on for years but balked at the somewhat clumsy transactions intended to finally, if misleadingly, put the losses on Olympus's books. Ernst & Young Sjin Nihon, a Japanese affiliate of that network, was brought in and did sign off.
The scandal also highlights the need for mark-to-market accounting. Until accounting rule makers finally started to require it for some financial instruments in 1997 -- seven years after the fraud began -- covering up the losses was easy. A decade later, efforts to force companies to stop hiding things in off-balance-sheet entities led to the transactions that ended up exposing the fraud. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 also played a role.
To understand this scandal fully, remember what life was like for a Japanese company before the Plaza Accord. The dollar had been rising at a good clip and by the end of 1984 was worth more than 250 yen. That was heavenly for Japanese exporters, who could reap large profits exporting to the United States, and it led to a gaping Japanese trade surplus with the United States.
The Plaza Accord was reached by what was then the Group of Five -- Japan, the United States, West Germany, France and Britain -- at the Plaza Hotel in New York. They agreed on concerted action to bring down the value of the dollar, and to the surprise of many it worked. By the end of the year, the rate was down to 200 yen, and by the end of 1987 it was only 121 yen. It was no longer as much fun to be a Japanese exporter.
But the Japanese bubble was still expanding. In the final four years of the decade, stock prices tripled. In 1985, Olympus -- not alone among Japanese companies -- introduced zaiteku, or speculative investment, as a major business strategy.
The strategy worked until the Japanese bubble burst in 1990. That year, the company chose to hide losses of nearly 100 billion yen, or about $730 million at the exchange rate at the time. The report does not detail exactly how those losses came, only saying that they involved financial instruments.
How could such a loss be hidden? At the time, accounting rules in Japan, as well as in other countries, allowed investments to be carried at cost. Theoretically, there should eventually have been a write-down, but there never was.
There seems to have been some hope that with additional risky investments, the losses could somehow be made up. They were not. Over time, the company tried securities speculation and private equity, investing in what it thought were promising start-up companies. None of it worked. Eventually, the losses evidently grew to more than $1 billion.
Olympus seems to have been content to sit on the losses until 1997, when accounting rules changed and some investments had to be marked to market. To do so would reveal the entire sordid tale.
So a plan was developed to ''sell'' the losing investments, at original cost, to shell companies set up by Olympus for that purpose. The sales were financed with loans from banks, which received cash from Olympus to secure the loans. Under lenient accounting rules, those shell companies would not have to be consolidated with Olympus, so the losses could remain hidden.
The plan was to get out of the losses eventually, either by more investments or through overpriced acquisitions, with the extra cost of the acquisitions going to the off-balance-sheet subsidiaries to make them whole. That was done through a variety of means, one of which was retaining the phony companies as high-priced investment advisers. That ''cost'' would be put on the company's balance sheet as good will, and eventually written off. When that was done, the balance sheet would show an accurate value for Olympus.
From 1999 to 2003, Olympus managed to get out of some losses, or at least to convert them to good will. No one outside the company was the wiser. KPMG, the auditor, did not notice, the report says, in part because some of the information it received was false.
Perhaps the company could have gradually accomplished the goal, had it not been for Enron.
But in 2001, Enron went broke. One of the ways it had concocted phony profits was to ''sell'' assets to off-balance-sheet entities it controlled, and to book profits on those sales.
Accounting rule makers do not move rapidly, so it took years to do anything about that in the United States, and even longer in Japan. But in 2007, the Japanese rules were changed. Those shell companies would have to be consolidated. Olympus had until March 31, 2008, the end of its fiscal year, to clean up its books. Some deals were quickly closed in March.
One complicated transaction in 2008 fell apart almost immediately. A company that had accepted some securities from Olympus in September, with the promise they would be exchanged for cash in two years, suddenly demanded immediate payment. That company, the report states, ''seemed to be in need of cash due to the impact of Lehman,'' which failed in mid-September.
That transaction could not be completed immediately, however, because KPMG was reluctant to sign off on the accounting. It went through only after Ernst & Young became the auditors.
All this might have gone unnoticed but for a Japanese magazine, which reported in July that the company had overpaid spectacularly for the acquisitions that Olympus made to avoid the Enron-related accounting deadline. Olympus denied the allegations.
Mr. Woodford, a British citizen who had run the company's European operations, became president in April and chief executive in September. He was told to not worry about such history when the magazine article appeared. But he did. With the assistance of PricewaterhouseCoopers, he unraveled the transactions but not their purpose, and concluded that company money was being stolen. He confronted the chairman and was fired. He forced an investigation, which resulted in this week's report.
The investigating committee reported that it had been assisted by two affiliates of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. That makes all members of the Big Four involved in some way.
The committee says the top officers of Olympus knew what was going on throughout and that new presidents always accepted the decisions made by their predecessors. It does not say why Mr. Woodford evidently was not told, but it seems reasonable to think that it was some combination of not trusting a foreigner who had not worked in Japan and a belief that, with the balance sheet now reflecting reality, there was no need to involve him.
Now Olympus is experiencing a mass departure of tainted executives and directors. It is not clear whether a new board will bring Mr. Woodford back.
More than 20 years after the scandal began, the valuation of financial assets for which there is no ready market remains a subject of controversy. This week, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates audit firms in the United States, issued an ''audit practice alert'' that made clear it was concerned that American auditors were now -- like Japanese auditors in the past -- too willing to believe whatever management said.
''Auditors are reminded,'' the board said, ''that audit evidence consists of both information that supports and corroborates management's assertions and information that contradicts such assertions, including assertions regarding fair values, estimates and related disclosures.''
There is a certain symmetry here. The Olympus scandal might never have been uncovered if reforms had not been forced by the Enron debacle. The accounting oversight board owes its very existence to outrage over Enron, which led Congress to establish the agency in 2002.

HEADLINE: Republicans Unveil Plan for Payroll Tax

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Pivoting to challenge President Obama and Senate Democrats, House Republicans said Thursday that they would forge ahead with a payroll tax holiday bill that includes an oil pipeline opposed by the president and that looks to changes in social programs to pay for the tax cut and added unemployment benefits.
In a sharp answer to several failed bills produced by Senate Democrats that would cut an employee's share of the payroll tax and impose a new surcharge on income over $1 million, the House Republican bill would pay for the extension through a mix of changes to entitlement programs and a pay freeze for federal workers. 
The House is expected to vote next week on the Republican bill, which includes a provision to speed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast -- a project the White House has sought to delay.
It would also include a measure passed this year in the House that would roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules limiting toxic air pollutants from commercial and industrial boilers, and ban the agency from proposing a new standard in the near future. While both ideas enjoy some support from Democrats, they would have a hard time gaining broad support in the Senate.
Republicans see the added elements as a way of both attracting party support for a tax break that many Republicans oppose, and forcing Democrats to accept provisions they do not like.
But Mr. Obama has threatened to veto any payroll tax measure that would ease approval of the pipeline, and he reiterated that position in an impromptu news conference on Thursday morning.
''Rather than trying to figure out what can they extract politically from me in order to get this thing done, what they need to do is be focused on what's good for the economy, what's good for jobs and what's good for the American people,'' said Mr. Obama, who added that he would not leave for a planned vacation in Hawaii until the legislative fight was resolved.
The Senate on Thursday rejected two competing bills to prevent an increase in the payroll tax. Fifty senators voted to take up the Democrats' latest bill -- far short of the 60 needed -- and 48 senators voted no. Republicans had even less support for their proposal, as 22 senators voted to take it up and 76 voted no.
More than half of the Republicans voted against the bill drafted by their own leaders. The results were similar to votes on similar legislation last week.
By Thursday afternoon, as members of both chambers raced for the airport to spend their last weekend home before a final stretch of year-end legislative maneuvering, it was difficult to see how the impasse would be resolved. A bill that could please enough conservative Republicans in the House and the Senate would probably repel Senate Democrats, and the expiration of the payroll tax break, while helping to reduce the deficit, could prove a political headache for both parties.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has supported a modified version of the surtax on high earners to finance extension of the payroll tax cut, said she found it difficult to puzzle out how a bill could appeal to enough members to pass. But, she said, that outcome is ''absolutely necessary.''
''It's going to be pointless if the House sends over bills that the Senate cannot or will not pass,'' Ms. Collins said, adding that she assumed leaders in both chambers were negotiating behind the scenes.
Otherwise, she added, ''I think we'll be here Christmas Eve.''
The House Republican plan, among other things, would increase premiums for affluent Medicare beneficiaries, end food stamps and unemployment insurance benefits for millionaires, sell some federal assets, freeze the pay of federal employees, including members of Congress, and reduce the number of federal workers by about 10 percent through attrition.
In addition, House Republicans said their bill would gradually reduce the maximum duration of jobless benefits, to 59 weeks from the 99 weeks now available in some states. If Congress does nothing, benefits for the long-term unemployed will begin to expire early next year, and two million people could lose benefits by mid-February.
House Republicans said their bill would protect doctors from a 27 percent cut in their Medicare fees scheduled to occur on Jan. 1. The measure would solve this problem for two years, giving doctors a 1 percent increase in their fees rather than a deep cut. To help offset the cost, lawmakers said, the bill would take some money provided in the new health care law for preventive and public health services.
The package was met with enthusiasm from House Republicans who last week gave Speaker John A. Boehner an earful about attempts to continue the cut in Social Security payroll taxes for another year.
''It's a solid plan,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''I like the unemployment reforms quite a bit.''
Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leader of conservative Republicans in the House, also welcomed the proposals. ''The fact that the president doesn't like it makes me like it even more,'' Mr. Jordan said. But Senate Democrats were not impressed.
''They have turned this into a Christmas tree,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, ''because their rank and file are fundamentally opposed to a tax cut for the middle class.''

HEADLINE: Mayor and Congressman Clash on Police at Protests

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg criticized a prominent New York City congressman on Thursday for asking the Justice Department to investigate reports of police misconduct at the Occupy Wall Street protests in Lower Manhattan. 
Responding to questions from reporters, Mr. Bloomberg ridiculed the call this week by the congressman, Jerrold Nadler, for the investigation. ''If he would spend more time getting us homeland security money, maybe he'd make the streets safer,'' the mayor said.
''If he could get us more federal moneys,'' the mayor added, ''maybe we could make our schools better and we wouldn't have some of the things that people are protesting against.''
Mr. Bloomberg's comments, which he made during an appearance in Brooklyn, drew a swift and acerbic response from Representative Nadler, who was described as having been taken aback by the strikingly personal tone of the mayor's attack.
''It is precisely my job, as the ranking member on the House Judiciary's Constitution Subcommittee, to ensure that the constitutional rights of all Americans are respected,'' Mr. Nadler said. ''And it is precisely the job of the U.S. Department of Justice to ensure that alleged violations of those rights are investigated, and that federal civil rights laws are vigorously enforced.''
''It is the mayor's job, I might point out, to ensure that the Police Department, under his command, obeys the laws and respects the rights of all New Yorkers,'' added Mr. Nadler, a Democrat whose liberal district in Manhattan and Brooklyn includes Zuccotti Park, the site of the protests.
Mr. Nadler also mockingly noted that in the past, the mayor praised his work in Congress on behalf of the city. ''Perhaps the mayor should review his own past comments lauding my success in securing needed federal funds for our city -- from the $20 billion post-9/11 monies to the Zadroga Act to critical transportation funding -- before spewing nonsense and so wildly contradicting himself,'' he said.
The back-and-forth exchange between the mayor and the representative reflects how bitterly divided the public is over the Occupy Wall Street protests and how to respond to them.
Congress enacted the Zadroga Act last year at the urging of New York political leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Nadler, to cover the cost of medical care for rescue workers and others who became sick from toxic fumes, dust and smoke after the attack on the World Trade Center.
On Tuesday, Mr. Nadler sent a letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. asking him to investigate whether the police in New York and other cities had deprived protesters of rights protected by the Constitution or by law, and to determine ''what can be done to prevent future similar actions.'' In his letter, Mr. Nadler listed numerous accusations that had been leveled at the police, including the use of excessive force on protesters, illegal surveillance of individuals ''engaged in constitutionally protected activities'' and preventing journalists from covering the protests.
Last month, the police evicted the Occupy Wall Street protesters who had set up a camp in Zuccotti Park, near Wall Street. The eviction came after frustrated mayors around the country cracked down on similar encampments in other cities by people protesting economic inequality.

HEADLINE: Race to the Bottom

 BODY:
Campaign ads are often deceitful, offensive or infuriating, cynically exploiting religion or families and distorting an opponent's record. The latest ones from the Republican primary, however, are so brazen and the politicians so unapologetic that it is only bound to get worse. 
A new ad from Gov. Rick Perry, to use the latest example, will test anyone who thinks they can no longer be affronted by a political hustle. It begins with Mr. Perry telling the camera that he's not ashamed to admit he's a Christian. Are there Christian candidates who are ashamed of it? None come to mind. Perhaps, like some of his supporters, he's trying to remind evangelical voters that he is not a Mormon, unlike two other Republican candidates. Or perhaps he's referring to President Obama who does not parade his religious beliefs on a signboard.
Then his answer becomes clear: Raising a fist, he promises to fight ''liberal attacks on our religious heritage.'' And what are those supposed attacks? Letting gays serve openly in the military, and prohibiting children from openly celebrating Christmas. The first was one of Mr. Obama's most significant civil rights accomplishments; the second is a right-wing fantasy that has nothing to do with the president or anyone else. Both are part of what he calls ''Obama's war on religion,'' an outrageous lie.
Then there's Mitt Romney, who released an ad this week that trumpets his fidelity to his wife and his family (an implicit contrast to Newt Gingrich), ending with a little routine he never tires of using: ''I will never apologize for the United States of America.'' That's meant to suggest that Mr. Obama does when, in fact, he never has.
The suggestion is an attempt to fan invidious claims that Mr. Obama is not really part of mainstream American culture. Mr. Romney amplified that divisive charge on Wednesday at the Republican Jewish Coalition forum, saying of the president: ''I don't think he understands America.'' It's not quite Newt Gingrich's saying Mr. Obama has a ''Kenyan'' worldview, but it's close.
Last month, Mr. Romney approved an ad that quoted Mr. Obama in 2008, saying he would lose if he talked about the economy. Except the ad snipped off part of the quote, in which Mr. Obama was actually quoting an adviser to his opponent, John McCain.
As cheap a trick as that was, it was made even worse when a Romney adviser told The Times that it was perfectly fine. ''It's ludicrous for them to say that an ad is taking something out of context,'' the adviser said. ''All ads do that. They are manipulative pieces of persuasive art.''
There is a difference between manipulating and lying. Voters should be suspicious of any candidate who doesn't see or respect that difference.

HEADLINE: Perry's Anti-Gay Rights Focus Is Divisive Even to Staff

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
OKATIE, S.C. -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas' hard turn the past two days on gay issues, in which he has suggested that gay rights are inconsistent with both American and Christian values, has generated enormous criticism from lesbian and gay organizations and some religious groups, and has even helped split Mr. Perry's top campaign aides over a new ad.
In that campaign ad, released on Wednesday, Mr. Perry says ''you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday'' to know it is wrong that gay men and lesbians openly serve in the military at a time when there is no organized prayer in public schools. 
Internally, a top Perry campaign adviser, Tony Fabrizio, was critical of the ad. A Perry aide did not deny division inside the campaign over the commercial -- a split first reported by The Huffington Post -- but chalked it up to the ''occasionally salty'' and robust interchanges between advisers.
The ad came a day after Mr. Perry stood out in attacking as ''silly'' a new Obama administration initiative using diplomatic efforts and foreign aid to promote gay rights around the world and beat back efforts in other nations to criminalize homosexual conduct and persecute gays. This policy, Mr. Perry contended, was an ''example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country.''
Perry aides said neither the criticism of Mr. Obama nor the new ad were intended to be anti-gay, nor were they coordinated; they said that the ad had been in the works for weeks and that they had no advance notice of the administration's new policy.
Either way, Mr. Perry, who once was atop polls of the Republican presidential field, is running out of time to find a means to connect with the sort of social conservatives who have long been an important part of his base in Texas. Some social conservatives have abandoned Mr. Perry over his support for granting lower-cost in-state college tuition to some children of illegal immigrants. Iowa's first in-the-nation Republican caucuses, which social conservatives dominate, are Jan. 3.
Mr. Perry's decision to seize on gay issues appears to be an effort tap into the sentiment that led Iowa voters to remove three Supreme Court justices one year ago after they voted to legalize same-sex marriage. But this year, economic issues -- which had initially dominated the focus of Mr. Perry's campaign -- remain the overwhelming concern for voters.
In Iowa, where Mr. Perry is expected to campaign nearly nonstop for the three weeks before the caucuses, economic issues are weighing heavier on the minds of likely Republican caucusgoers than social issues like abortion or same-sex marriage, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll of these voters. A majority of evangelical voters also shared that view.
And another finding stood out: Nearly three out of five respondents said that they support legal recognition in one form or another for same-sex couples. The poll found that 22 percent said same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, while 36 percent said they supported civil unions. Only 38 percent said they supported no legal recognition for same-sex couples, though a majority of evangelical Christians responded that way.
Nor is it clear whether Mr. Perry's attacks on the Obama administration's repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military will help him. One poll of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans found about three out of four were comfortable around gay service members, and the nation's two most senior military officials during the debate over repeal -- who had both served under President George W. Bush -- backed the change in policy.
But even if most voters do not have a problem with the issues Mr. Perry is focusing on, his approach might still succeed. Analysts say even a narrow issue -- but one that gives some voters a reason to turn out for him -- might improve his single-digit standing in most polls.
''This might be his best shot -- he needs something, right?'' said J. Ann Selzer, an Iowa pollster.

HEADLINE: Obama Backs Limit on Sale to Teenagers of Morning-After Pill

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, noting that he was the father of two daughters, threw his wholehearted support on Thursday behind a decision by his health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, not to allow emergency contraceptives to be sold over the counter to young teenagers.
''The reason Kathleen made this decision is that she could not be confident that a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old going to a drugstore should be able -- alongside bubble gum or batteries -- be able to buy a medication that potentially, if not used properly, could have an adverse effect,'' Mr. Obama said to reporters at the White House. 
''And I think most parents would probably feel the same way,'' the president added.
Mr. Obama insisted that he was not involved in the decision, on a contraceptive pill known as Plan B One-Step. The decision by Ms. Sebelius, announced on Wednesday, was an extremely rare case of an administration official's publicly overruling the Food and Drug Administration, which had concluded after extensive research that the medication was safe to be sold to teenagers 16 and younger without a prescription.
The bluntly personal nature of the president's response suggested that the White House is well aware of the political sensitivities, going into an election year, of allowing broader distribution of the contraceptive, whatever the Food and Drug Administration's scientific arguments in favor of it.
Mr. Obama's comments came in a combative appearance that followed the Senate's rejection of his nominee to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray. The decision, the president said, ''makes absolutely no sense,'' leaving millions of Americans without adequate protection in their dealings with financial institutions, including payday lenders and debt collectors.
But Mr. Obama also used the occasion to address a range of issues, rejecting charges by Republican presidential candidates that he practices a foreign policy of appeasement, particularly in the Middle East.
''Ask Osama bin Laden and the 22 out of top 30 Al Qaeda leaders who have been taken off the field whether I engage in appeasement -- or whoever's left out there, ask them about that,'' the president said.
Later, Mr. Obama argued that his administration had ''systematically imposed the toughest sanctions ever in Iran.'' He said the pressure campaign had left Iran isolated and unified world opinion against its leaders.
He also delivered some of his most urgent language yet on the European debt crisis.
As European leaders struggle to fashion a response to the deepening debt crisis, Mr. Obama suggested that time was running short, saying, ''I am obviously very concerned about what's happening in Europe.''
''I think they now recognize the urgency of doing something serious and bold,'' the president said of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders. ''The question is whether they can muster the political will to get it done.''
''Europe is wealthy enough that there's no reason they can't solve this problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's not as if we're talking about some impoverished country that doesn't have any resources and is, you know, being buffeted by the world markets and they need, you know, to come hat in hand to get help.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama spoke with Mrs. Merkel by phone. He said she had made some progress in pushing other European nations toward a ''fiscal compact'' that would prevent a repeat of the fiscal profligacy that had gotten Greece and other countries into trouble, and set off the broader crisis of confidence. But Europe's first priority, Mr. Obama said, was to settle financial markets.
''We're going to do everything we can to push them in a good direction on this,'' he said, ''because it has a huge impact on what happens here in the United States.''

HEADLINE: Senate Stops Consumer Nominee

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday blocked President Obama's nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as filibustering Republicans who oppose the powers of the new agency successfully challenged one of the administration's main responses to the financial crisis.
The nominee, Richard Cordray, was rejected after Democrats failed to achieve the 60 votes they needed to move his nomination forward. The vote was 53 yes, 45 no. 
President Obama left open the option of a recess appointment, although Republicans have thwarted that tactic recently by staying in rump sessions.
''We are not giving up on this,'' he said. ''We are going to keep on going at it. We are not going to allow politics as usual on Capitol Hill to stand in the way of American consumers' being protected.''
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said his party had made clear for months that it would not approve a leader for the watchdog consumer agency until the law that established it was amended.
Until three changes are made, he said, ''We won't support a nominee for this bureau -- regardless of who the president is.''
One of those changes would put a board in charge of overseeing the bureau instead of the director, abolishing the post. Others would subject the agency to the Congressional appropriations process, giving lawmakers more sway over its policies, and would give other financial regulatory agencies a check on its rules.
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat, said that the opponents' ''first loyalty is to Wall Street banks.''
The agency can accomplish part of its mission, the protection of consumers from unscrupulous lending practices, without having a director in place. But some of its new powers are vested by law in the director, so it could not expand into realms like the regulation of payday lenders and other nonbank financial businesses.
The power struggle between the financial sector and its check-cashing, card-carrying customers has developed into one of the fault lines along which the political parties are playing out their own rivalries as the election year arrives.
Previous opposition from Republicans led to the withdrawal of Elizabeth Warren from consideration for the post. She is a Harvard law professor who was the driving force behind the agency's creation and is now a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in Massachusetts.
Opposite her, in ideological terms, are those in Congress who say the real problem is not so much the need to regulate the financial world as to rein in the Washington regulators.
''This is not about the nominee, who appears to be a decent person and may very well be qualified,'' said Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, according to the Associated Press. ''It's about a process that is running out of control.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, called it ''the first time in Senate history a party blocked a qualified nominee solely because it disagrees with the existence of an agency that was created by law, through a bipartisan vote.''
Democrats have accused the Republicans of reneging on the painstakingly wrought compromises that brought the consumer board into existence as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.
Mr. Cordray, a five-time Jeopardy champion, is a former attorney general of Ohio noted for his aggressive investigations of mortgage foreclosure practices. Currently in charge of enforcement at the consumer agency, he was nominated in July to lead it.
In his confirmation hearings in September, he told a Senate committee that he would make it a priority ''to streamline and cut back'' a mountain of burdensome regulations that discourage banks from lending to consumers. But that stance, intended to reassure Republicans on the committee, did not mollify them. At a time when Congressional Republicans have been opposing most of the administration's approaches to regulations, the economy and presidential appointments, Mr. Cordray's prospects were never better than bleak.
President Obama, in a speech in Kansas this week on economic policy that was laden with populist overtones, singled out Thursday's Senate vote for attention and said he would veto any legislation undoing consumer protections in the world of finance.
''Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors? Of course not,'' he said.
''Financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for their interests,'' he said. ''Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them. I intend to make sure they do, and I will veto any effort to delay, defund or dismantle the new rules we put in place.''
Online Correction: December 8, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the Senate's vote on Richard Cordray's nomination was 55 yes, 45 no. The vote was 53-45.

HEADLINE: Social Insurance and Individual Freedom

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The United States might learn a good deal from Germany's approach to health care insurance, which provides both a broad net and significant individual choice, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The continuing debate over the Affordable Care Act and the commentary on this blog have convinced me that nothing can ever unite Americans on their vision of an ideal health system. 
We need different health insurance systems for different Americans. I mean by this not Americans who differ by age or ability to pay but Americans with different notions of a just society. 
This is where Germany's approach to a health insurance system can serve as an inspiration.

Germany's population of close to 82 million is served by two distinct health insurance systems:
1. The Statutory Health Insurance System, founded in 1883 by Otto von Bismarck and constantly amended over the ensuing century. 
2. A private commercial health insurance system. 
Germany's statutory health insurance system is the oldest in the world and has served as a model for many other countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In Germany the system consists of 154 (as of July 2011) autonomous, private, nonprofit sickness funds among which individuals can choose freely, which means that the funds compete with one another. 
Unlike Americans, who often are limited to networks of providers, Germans have complete freedom of choice of provider under the statutory system.
The sickness funds now provide very comprehensive health insurance to more than 85 percent of the population. They are overseen by boards composed of employers and unions. Their management, however, is strictly regulated by the law, as amended. 
Germany's private insurance system is composed of 46 health companies that are operated on commercial principles, albeit under federal regulations, and provide comprehensive coverage to another 11 percent of the population, including all civil servants, although individuals and families in the statutory system often purchase supplementary coverage (for superior amenities or items not covered by the statutory system). 
In 2009, these companies accounted for less than 10 percent of total national health spending in Germany, which amounted to $4,200 per capita in purchasing power parity, slightly more than half of American spending of $7,900, even though Germany's population is much older on average than ours.
The remainder of Germany's population (police officers, the military and others) have their own coverage. 
Financing the Statutory System

The statutory system is financed on the principle of social solidarity, that is, strictly on the basis of ability to pay. The sketch below illustrates this flow of funds: 
Employees covered by the statutory system must pay a nationally uniform contribution to the sickness fund of their choice of 8.2 percent of their gross wages (and pensioners 8.2 percent of their pensions), while employers (or pension funds) must contribute 7.3 percent, for a total contribution of 15.5 percent of gross wages up to a maximum gross wage (or pension) of 44,550 euros, about $59,700. Earnings above that threshold are not subject to this levy.
Unemployed people pay premiums in proportion to their unemployment compensation, unless they are long-term unemployed, in which case the federal government pays the sickness fund a fixed per-capita payment. 
The total contribution paid to a sickness fund covers the employee (or pensioner) and any nonworking dependents, except children, for whom insurance coverage is tax-financed by the federal government.
To equalize actuarial risk among the competing sickness funds, Germany operates a national risk-equalization fund (the Gesundheitsfond). The premium contribution rates paid by employees and employers to a sickness fund are immediately transferred to this central fund. 
If the employee (or pensioner) then chooses sickness fund A, the central fund pays the chosen sickness fund a capitation that is risk-adjusted for that employee (or pensioner) and the nonworking dependents. The risk-adjustment formula used for that purpose includes age, gender and about 80 indicators of morbidity.

Financing Commercial Insurers
Private insurers draw their financing from per-capita premiums that reflect a person's age, gender and health status at the time of enrollment but thereafter can be raised only as a function of age, not changing health status. Separate per-capita premiums are levied on dependents in a family. 
Recent federal legislation has forced private insurers to levy on younger people higher premiums than their actuarial risk can justify to build up an old-age reserve, thus preventing premiums from climbing too rapidly with age. 
Recently the private system has come under a number of new regulations. For more detail on these, readers are referred to the links provided above.

Closing the Door to Statutory Insurance
By law, every German must have coverage for a prescribed benefit package. German employees and pensioners earning less than 49,500 euros ($66,350) per year (in 2011) are compulsorily insured under the statutory system. 
Employees and pensioners above that threshold are free to opt out of the statutory system and purchase private, commercial coverage, but if they do, they cannot ever return to the statutory system unless they are paupers. The intent is to minimize gaming of the insurance system by individuals.
It is this feature that intrigues me, as it has my colleague Paul Starr, in his proposed alternative to an individual mandate to be insured.
What if Americans at, say, age 26 (beyond which they can no longer be included on their parents' insurance policy) or even as late as age 30 were offered the choice of:
1. joining the community-rated health insurance offered through the insurance exchanges called for in the Affordable Care Act;
2. remaining in a private insurance system that is free to charge in any year "actuarially fair" premiums, that is, premiums that reflect the applicant's projected health status and spending for that year and is free to refuse issuing a policy altogether;
3. simply self-insuring, by remaining uninsured?
For want of better terms, we might call the exchange system the "social insurance track" (because it leans heavily toward social insurance) and the second and third options the "rugged individualist tracks," because they cater to Americans with individualist preferences.
For people choosing the rugged individualist tracks, Professor Starr proposes to shut the door to the social insurance track for only five years. 
I believe his stricture is too weak and propose instead to follow the German example by shutting the door permanently to social insurance to any individual who chose one of the two rugged individualist tracks, unless such individuals were truly pauperized. A return then would have to be allowed, because, for better or for worse, our civic sentiments preclude letting anyone - even a myopic rugged individualist - die for want of critically needed health care.
Admittedly, this approach would confront young Americans with a serious life-cycle choice. But life-cycle choices are made all the time, and choices do have consequences that people in their mid-20s should be mature enough to think about. Adults must realize that individual freedom has its price.
The American health insurance system now is structured as a paradise for clever adolescents, inviting gaming of many sorts that makes sensible health policy almost impossible. It is time to move away from such a system.

HEADLINE: Answers From Vivian Toy: The Apartment Critic

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Vivian S. Toy, a real estate reporter for The Times, answers your questions about buying, selling and related concerns. 

 BODY:
Vivian S. Toy, a real estate reporter for The Times, answers some questions readers submitted about buying, selling and renting in the city.
Q.
I'm moving to N.Y.C. in seven months for my new job, and I'll be searching for a rental. I'm feeling overwhelmed by the market, and I'm not entirely sure if I'll be able to find an apartment that meets my expectations. Question: Do I have a shot in hell at finding a great 1 bd. or studio ap't, of at least 450 sq. ft., with a washer and dryer in the bldg., central air and heat, in a post-war bldg., on the West Side of Manhattan (preferably between Midtown and Harlem) for $1,300 month without a broker? - Future NYC Renter
A.
I'm afraid I would have to agree with the other readers who responded to your question. The rental market in Manhattan is very strong right now, which is good for landlords, but not so good for renters looking for a deal. In early 2010, landlords were offering free months' rent and paying brokers' fees, but that did not last long. A quick search of Manhattan listings shows very little on the West Side in your price range. There are a few more listings if you head into Harlem or Washington Heights. A recent "Getting Started" column addressed this issue.
Q.
I would like to try to sell my apartment without a broker. However, if I don't manage to do it within four months, I would turn it over to a broker. Do you think it is better to go to a broker from the get-go instead of having the property listed first as F.S.B.O. and then switching to a broker if it doesn't move fast enough? Thanks! -Spring
A.
Speaking strictly as a homeowner, I think it is a bold and brave move to try to sell your own home. But I admire people who try. I imagine it would be very time consuming and a lot of work. Also, even though I know what all the cons are in my house, it would still be awfully hard to hear the criticism of potential buyers. I try to feature a "for sale by owner" listing periodically on the On the Market page, and I have seen some sell quickly, while others have lingered for months. As for any apartment, it probably all depends on where you are and how much competition you have.
I have seen listings that have gone from an owner to a broker, and as far as I can tell, the switch has not had that much impact on an eventual sale. The important thing is to listen to what "the market" is telling you. If open houses are not drawing many visitors, whether held by an owner or a broker, maybe it is priced too high. Good luck!
Q.
Our family lives in a small apartment with a lot of clutter, but we also don't have a lot of money. This is the first apartment we've owned. When we aim to sell our apartment, do we need to move out into a hotel for the duration? What if that is many months? How do we afford that? I just can't imagine anyone buying our apartment with the amount of stuff we've had to pack into it to live here, although we're comfortable. Where do people typically live while their homes are on the market -ichoosenottosay
A.
Trust me, I know about clutter. I also know that if my husband and I ever tried to sell our house, we would have to rent a super-size storage unit to make the house presentable for open houses. I have not priced storage units, but my guess is they would be much cheaper than a hotel room. Teri Karush Rogers wrote a great article back in 2007 about what it is like to live in a home you cannot call your own because it is on the market. 
Q.
I would be curious to learn about all the H.P.D.-built co-ops and apartments which have construction issues. How do you find out if the developer is being sued or if there was past construction issues. How is a buyer to know that the building has had various problems from the get-go? -New Yorker
A.
The Web site for the city's Department of Buildings is a good place to start when researching any building. The site's Buildings Information System shows all complaints, code violations and building permits connected to a building. For buildings that aren't brand new, reviewing co-op and condo board meeting minutes is also a good way to find out if current residents have had any problems with the construction. 
Q.
Not a question, just a comment. I would just like to tell you how much I enjoy On the Market. I look forward to flipping the slides when I get home on Friday afternoon. It is a glimpse of the current real estate market in Manhattan. For outsiders, it probably looks like some sort of alternate universe (500 sq feet for $700K??) but even to a New Yorker, it's a wonderful glimpse into my local neighborhoods, other boroughs, and some fantasy properties.[#x2028][#x2028]Perhaps you could try On the Market: For Rent for all of us renters in the city to see what we could be renting.[#x2028][#x2028]Ok so one question: What is the strangest "only in New York City" apartment you've come across?? -LK
A.
Thanks for your comment. On the Market is intended to be just as you described it, a snapshot of the current market. One of my goals is also to pick listings that readers would be interested in seeing, ones that have an unusual or outstanding feature.
I have considered doing a For Rent page, but there are several reasons why it would be difficult to do. First, rentals often move very quickly, making it difficult to ensure that an apartment we have photographed early in the week will still be available when it runs in the Sunday paper. Second, the vast majority of rental listings are vacant and would not have that much visual appeal on a page.
And finally, for the annals of "only in New York City," I once saw a one-bedroom apartment where the bedroom was so narrow that you could raise your arms and touch the opposite walls.

HEADLINE: The True Meaning of the Season: Holiday Movies We'd Actually Watch

BYLINE: NEIL GENZLINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Forget the holiday fare that's actually on TV this weekend. Here are five Christmas movies we want to see. 

 BODY:
So many Christmas-theme movies on television, so little time. The next few days bring "Christmas Comes Home to Canaan," "Christmas Magic," "Dear Santa" and assorted others, some new, some recycled. You know the ingredients: a single parent, a plucky child or two, a hardship of some kind, a serendipitous meeting that leads to love. Perhaps a little angelic intervention.
Yet with all these movies, you may find there are still some stories you'd like to see told that have not appeared on anyone's schedule. Here are five Christmas movies somebody ought to make:
A TANTRUM FOR THE HOLIDAYS A well-known TV star on an airplane forces the pilot to abort his takeoff and prompts a nationwide military alert because he won't stop playing games on his cellphone. While cooling off in the airport's Naughty Room, he meets a pretty single mother whose bright but emotionally fragile son can't get past Level 49 of Angry Birds. Awaiting arraignment, they learn that the true meaning of Christmas has nothing to do with whether you have upgraded to the iPhone 4S.Alec Baldwin stars in this heartwarming holiday tale, filmed entirely at Newark Liberty International Airport.
NAKED CAME THE SANTA A talentless, troubled starlet uses the time between prison sentences to pose naked for a has-been girlie magazine. While doing the shoot, she meets a down-on-his-luck photographer's assistant, a single dad who just a few months earlier was riding high as the show runner for a TV series based on the magazine but was demoted when that show proved to be the most embarrassing offering of the fall season.
While waiting for someone to leak the nudie pictures to the tabloids, they realize that the true meaning of Christmas has little to do with getting your picture taken while wearing nothing but an elf's hat.Lindsay Lohan stars in this inspiring story of degradation and wasted opportunities.
THE 78-POUND TURKEY A glum polygamist who by unfortunate coincidence is both newly widowed and newly divorced realizes that with all those major life events, there is no way he's going to be able to do his income taxes by himself this year.
The pretty young accountant he hires to help him was conceived through a sperm donation and has just learned that she has 73 half brothers and half sisters. Together they realize that they don't have nearly enough place settings to accommodate everyone for holiday dinner, but an angel temping at Pier 1 helps them out. Kody Brown of "Sister Wives" stars in this feel-good story of rampant overpopulation.
THE CHRISTMAS CANDIDATE: COMFORT AND JOY A former presidential candidate, who dropped out of the race after the number of women accusing him of improper behavior reached three figures, takes a job as a department store Santa to pay the bills.
The first elf he makes a pass at, a single mother whose three children are sitting right there, decides to teach him a whimsical lesson and sends each of her kids up to Santa's lap to ask for hush money. Together they discover that while no one likes any of the current candidates, everyone would vote for Santa, and he re-enters the race and wins in a landslide. The real-life Republican candidates all have cameos in this delightful tale of political opportunism.
THE CHRISTMAS CANDIDATE 2: AWAY IN A WAGER A presidential candidate stopping by a soup kitchen for a photo op makes a $10,000 bet with an unemployed single mother of four that his latest bathroom renovation cost more than her whole house. After she dumps an entire pot of clam chowder over his expensively styled hair, he becomes known as Candidate Chowderhead, and his poll numbers drop into negative territory, baffling statisticians.
But the video of the incident goes viral, and the candidate and the woman become hosts of "Should He Eat It or Wear It?," a wildly popular cooking show on the Food Network featuring viewer voting. Again, the real-life Republican candidates all have cameos in this endearing tale of the baked and the half-baked, and learn that the real meaning of Christmas involves making sure that three experienced campaign advisers vet every spontaneous remark you make before you make it.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Looks at Harbinger's Dealings With Goldman

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Philip A. Falcone, the founder of Harbinger Capital Partners, received a Wells Notice from the S.E.C., which usually means the commission is planning enforcement proceedings. 

 BODY:
8:04 a.m. | Updated 
Harbinger Capital Partners, the hedge fund founded by Philip A. Falcone, could face civil action stemming from a federal investigation into whether the firm gave preferential treatment to Goldman Sachs, and other potential misdeeds.
Mr. Falcone received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, according to a regulatory filing by Harbinger. The agency typically takes such action when it is planning enforcement proceedings against a firm or individual. The notices were also sent to Omar Asali, Harbinger's president, and Robin Roger, the firm's general counsel.
The inquiry into Harbinger comes amid increased scrutiny for the industry. In recent years, the S.E.C. and other federal authorities have pursued a broad range of cases against hedge funds, taking aim at insider trading and other violations.
The S.E.C has been investigating whether Harbinger agreed in 2009 to allow Goldman to withdraw up to $50 million from the firm, while not striking similar deals with other clients, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to talk publicly. At the time, Harbinger had limited investors from redeeming their assets because of the market turmoil during the financial crisis. Before joining Harbinger, Mr. Asali was co-head of Goldman's hedge fund strategy group, helping to steer client investments to outside managers, including Harbinger.
The government is also looking at the disclosure surrounding a $113 million personal loan that Harbinger made to Mr. Falcone in 2009, as well as possible market manipulation involving debt securities the firm traded from 2006 to 2008, according to the people.
In its filing, Harbinger said the notices focused on possible "violations of the federal securities laws' antifraud provisions in connection with matters previously disclosed and an additional matter regarding the circumstances and disclosure related to agreements with certain fund investors." Harbinger said that it was "disappointed" about the notices, and that it would "vigorously defend against" any formal charges, according to the filing.
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.
With Harbinger already suffering from a wave of redemptions, the firm is taking new steps to limit withdrawals. Starting Dec. 30, Harbinger will bar investors from withdrawing money from four of its funds. Two of its portfolios, the Global Opportunities Breakaway Fund and China Dragon Fund, will still allow redemptions, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.
Mr. Falcone, who founded Harbinger in 2001, made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the housing crisis. With his new fortune, he and his wife, Lisa Maria Falcone, quickly became prominent figures on the New York social scene. In 2008, Mr. Falcone bought a $49 million home once owned by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. A year later, the couple announced a $10 million gift to the High Line park in Manhattan, a former elevated train track converted into a public space.
Harbinger, which held more than $26 billion in assets at its peak, has been struggling of late. The firm now manages $5.66 billion.
LightSquared, a wireless broadband company that is Harbinger's primary investment, has become an albatross for Mr. Falcone.
He started the company in 2010 and planned to create a mobile network with frequencies that were originally used for satellite phones.
Those plans ran into trouble when some studies showed that the proposed network could interfere with global-positioning devices.
In January, the Federal Communications Commission gave LightSquared's plan tentative approval despite lingering questions about the possible interference.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, has taken aim at the LightSquared venture and the F.C.C.'s oversight of the plan. In September, a group of lawmakers drafted a letter that questioned certain elements of Mr. Falcone's plan.
Mr. Falcone has also faced criticism for telling investors this year that redemptions from some of Harbinger's funds would be paid in shares of LightSquared stock, rather than cash.
"While this does not mean the S.E.C. definitely will take action against Mr. Falcone and his hedge fund, it does show that the S.E.C. staff believes there is sufficient evidence to consider recommending an enforcement action," Mr. Grassley said of the Wells Notices in a statement Friday. "Now the F.C.C. is faced with the real possibility that it made a multibillion-dollar grant of valuable spectrum to someone who could be charged with violating securities laws."
An article on Saturday about the possibility of a civil action by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners misstated the middle name of the wife of the fund's founder, Philip A. Falcone. Mr. Falcone's wife, who with her husband became prominent on New York's social scene, is Lisa Maria Falcone, not Lisa Marie.

HEADLINE: Updates on the European Debt Crisis Talks

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN and VICTORIA SHANNON


HIGHLIGHT: The Lede is following developments in negotiations over the debt crisis in Europe, where leaders of most -- but not all -- of the countries signed a treaty on Friday requiring stricter budgetary discipline. 

 BODY:
4:32 P.M. | Markets End the Day Higher
Traders who voted on the European agreement with their wallets were no more sure at the end of trading than they were at the beginning. The major Wall Street indexes closed up, in a range of 1.5 percent to 2 percent higher, which almost constitutes an average day of trading in these up-and-down times.
Changes in bond yields were also modest at day's end, with 10-year U.S. Treasuries up 0.09 percentage points to 2.061.
With a slightly longer horizon - this week - stocks also ended comfortably, rising about 1 percent. And for the year, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 5 percent since January.
Of course, Wall Street gets to vote every day how it feels. Next week, among the European developments it can react to are Greek negotiations for the country's next bailout payment (Monday) and an Italian bond auction (Wednesday).
3:34 P.M. | A View on the Next Round of European Political Wrangling
Clemens Fuest, a professor at Oxford University who has advised the German Finance Ministry, tells our colleagues at The International Herald Tribune that there is still political maneuvering to unfold.
Germany and the other northern European countries know that eventually there will be some kind of financial solution, such as bond guarantees or jointly issued euro bonds, he said.
But they are determined to extract as many concessions as possible before agreeing to such measures.
"Markets are looking for some kind of clear signal," Mr. Fuest said. "Germany and other northern countries are trying to avoid giving that signal because this is a point of no return. Pressure for stronger governance will be gone once the north agrees to anything like euro bonds."
The additional financial support agreed to in Brussels, including aid funneled through the I.M.F., at best buys time for Europe to create a system that satisfies German demands for budgetary discipline, Mr. Fuest said. He estimated the additional support will provide relief "for perhaps half a year or a year. That is probably the most optimistic scenario."
Eventually the European Central Bank will have to relent and become lender of last resort to governments, despite the protestations of its president, Mario Draghi, Mr. Fuest said.
"I think they will buy bonds if everything goes wrong," Mr. Fuest said. "They will just do it."
3:25 P.M. | A Reward for Envisioning a Euro Zone Breakup
Europe's leaders may think they are moving to closer unity in the euro zone with their new pact, but there are many who are convinced that some form of a breakup is inevitable and that the preparations for such an outcome should begin now.
To that end, the chief executive of the British retailer Next, Simon Wolfson (or Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise as he is known in Britain), has put a challenge to economists by offering 250,000 pounds - the second largest money pot for economists outside of the Nobel Prize - for the best analysis of what might happen if a country or countries were to leave the euro zone.
While a recognized euro skeptic, Mr. Wolfson and the contest organizers are looking to reel in contributions from economists not just in ever-doubting Britain but among countries in the euro zone itself. From the 20 submissions already sent in, one has come from Greece and one each from Italy and Germany.
The deadline is January 31, 2012.
"It's time to get people to focus on this issue," said Derek Scott, a former economic adviser to Tony Blair who will lead the panel of judges. "And the longer you delay it the more difficult it will become."
3:12 P.M. | Video: The Times's Graham Bowley on the Euro Deal
1:22 P.M. | Analysts' Reactions
Despite early rallies by stocks in Europe and the United States on Friday, some analysts saw the overnight deal hatched in Brussels as opening the door to a potentially larger European political and fiscal crisis in the future.
"Oh what a tangled web the #EU has weaved," read a post on the Twitter account of Pimco, the giant bond investor, and attributed to Bill Gross, its founder. "Never ending story."
An analysis by Reuters warned that the agreement will likely fail to shake off concerns of a breakup of the eurozone down the road. The Reuters financial blogger Felix Salmon expressed even stronger dismay at the deal in a post entitled "Europe's disastrous summit", calling the solution "half-baked" and warning that "it is now, officially, too late to save the Eurozone: the collapse of the entire edifice is now not a matter of if but rather of when."
Over at the Financial Times, Neil Hume, an editor, observed that deal seemed to indicate a willingness to threaten the Europe's political union in order to save the common currency. 
Others saw a triumph for German fiscal policy in the European agreement.
"The UK veto must not obscure the economic message of the summit," Gavyn Davies of the Financial Times said on Twitter. "The German approach to policy will now be writ large." 
In an accompanying blog post, he writes, "My initial take on the deal is that it will be sufficient to dampen the acute phase of the crisis, but that the absence of a clear long-term strategy for growth means that there could still be a long period of chronic problems ahead."
1:14 P.M. | Will European Banks Avoid Paying for Their Bad Bets?
In a post on The Times's Economix blog, Floyd Norris observes that a recurring lesson of the 2008 financial crisis, now being mirrored in Europe, is that there may not be the political will to force banks that made bad bets to pay for them:
I suspect the reality is that the recent experience has traumatized Europe enough that it will be a very long time before anyone suggests that banks should suffer for foolish lending to a member of the European Union.
12:45 P.M. | Markets Offer Tepid Endorsement of European Agreement
Given the volatility on Wall Street over the past few months, when 2, 3 and even 4 percent gains and losses have struck with relative frequency, a 1 percent gain in stock indexes doesn't seem like much of a rally.
So call today's reaction - the Dow Jones industrial average is up 1.3 percent at lunchtime - a tepid endorsement of the euro zone agreement.
But many have argued the real-world reactions to the euro crisis take place in the bond market. It is, after all, a "sovereign debt" crisis.
So? Well, today's pulse is equally hard to distinguish in the bond market.
As Friday dawned on the Continent, first prices went down and yields went up on the bonds of countries considered most at risk, Italy and Spain. A few hours later, they went the other way. In both cases, the movements were not especially dramatic, compared with fluctuations of the past week.
Our economics expert and columnist, Floyd Norris, says there is now a "small leveling out" of European bond yields unfolding, with Spanish and Italian yields falling and German and British yields gaining. (Action in the U.S. Treasury market is almost certainly not a reaction to Europe, he says.)
Even so, he adds about the European activity, "These are not significant moves. The agreement is not being treated as if this changes anything very much."
12:00 P.M. | In Interview, Cameron Defends Decision on Treaty
Prime Minister David Cameron in an interview with Sky News on Friday strongly defended his decision to opt out of a fiscal and financial treaty with European Union members, saying it was in Britain's national interest to do so. 
"You've never seen Britain say 'no' to a European treaty before," he acknowledged, but said, "There was a treaty on the table, it didn't adequately protect Britain's interests. Instead of going along with it, I said no to it. I thought that's my job."
He rejected the notion that he made the decision unilaterally without consulting the British public. "The whole point is we're not going ahead with the treaty," he said.
Other European countries are now going to be negotiating a treaty that passes power in many of their cases from nation-states to Brussels."
He added: "That's a big change for them; it's not going to be a change for us. There isn't going to be a treaty. We're not changing our relationship with the European Union."
11:36 A.M. | Amid Crisis, Croatia Moves Closer to E.U. Membership
Lost in the sturm und drang of the European debt negotiations, Croatia on Friday quietly signed the accession treaty that puts it on track to join the European Union, pending a ratification process, in July 2013.
After its two-day meeting in Brussels, the European Council sought to highlight the procedural advance as "an important moment for European integration."
Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, also highlighted the future accession of Croatia in his official remarks on Friday:
As you know, this morning we signed the accession treaty with Croatia. This is a very important moment which shows the positive pull of the European Union, the transformational power also of the European Union and our continued and reinforced commitment to the enlargement process. We have also set out the next stages for Montenegro and Serbia on their path towards the Union, building on the considerable progress they have made over the last year.
Or, as the European Commission exclaimed in a post on Facebook, with a link to a Croatia-positive video: "Dobrodosli Croatia!" - in a word, welcome.
11:29 A.M. | Council President Celebrates Europe's 'Achievement'
Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, in a video excerpt from his news conference on Friday, lamented that not all the European Union members had signed on to the proposed treaty.
"It is unfortunate that we missed the chance to have a full-fledged treaty change," he said, but added that it was still a positive step for the countries that share the euro. "It is already an achievement, I found, that not only the 17 of eurozone - because it is for helping to safeguard the financial security of the eurozone that we are all doing all this - but it is quite an achievement that almost 10 other countries wanted to cooperate with us."
He added: "There is also a very clear political message to the outside world. that even if without all the legal instruments of enforcement that via an intergovernmental treaty that we will be as binding as possible."
In a press release issued on Friday, he called referred to the "fiscal compact" reached in the early hours of the morning and made oblique reference to the reason for why it would be an " intergovernmental treaty" rather than one reached among the entire European Union. 
"Except for one, all are considering participating," he said in the statement.
10:42 A.M. | Merkel Offers Sober Thoughts on British Decision
In her news conference, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany offered a sober assessment of Mr. Cameron's decision to keep his country out of the "fiscal pact," which is aimed at stabilizing the single currency and is supported by most other member states.
"What is important for me now - and thus I'm not unhappy about the outcome of our Council - I believe we've got what we wanted to get to get for the euro," Mrs. Merkel told a news conference on Friday afternoon in Brussels. 
But "as a European of the 27, I would have been happy if Great Britain would have said 'yes,'" she said.
Mrs. Merkel explained that Britain could not be brought into the agreement negotiated on Friday morning despite the efforts by Mr. Cameron to win concessions to protect the City of London as a global financial center.
"Great Britain said that if treaty changes were to occur then they also wanted certain treaty changes in return, and that kind of conditionality was something we could not support and accept," said Mrs. Merkel.
Britain was the "one country that has expressed a clear sense of distancing itself," said Mrs. Merkel. But she rejected suggestions that Britain had undermined plans to put the management of the euro, and Europe's finances, on a sustainable path.
"I have talked to David Cameron and it's become quite clear that Britain relies as much as we do on a stable euro because it does have an effect on Europe as a whole," said Mrs. Merkel.
10:31 A.M. | Markets Show Early Approval of Agreement in Europe
Wall Street traders voted their opinion of the European agreement by buying stocks, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 1 percent in the first hour of trading. 
The S.&P. 500 index, which is a better measure of broad market sentiment, added a bit more, 1.2 percent. European markets continued their gradual gains, with one measure of the euro zone stocks, the Euro Stoxx 50, up more than 2 percent.
10:30 A.M. | Goldman Sachs Raises Ratings for European Banks
Ratings agencies may still be lowering the boom on European banks, as my colleague Liz Alderman reported, but Goldman Sachs is taking a contrarian view. The Wall Street bank said Friday that it is no longer recommending that investors sell their holdings in European lenders, raising its grade to "neutral" from "underweight," citing support from the global monetary authorities.
Goldman began recommending on Nov. 30 that investors reduce their holdings of European banks because the combination of a worsening economic picture and a need to improve capital, as well as the need to dispose of assets overseas, which was in effect going to make the banks "more domestic."
In spite of those facts, Goldman analysts said Friday in a research note, new funding arrangements agreed to by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other central banks "should significantly help the banks offset the pressures of the economic downturn in our view" and is already helping to ease funding pressure.
"In a further positive surprise, the ECB is also now offering banks 3-year liquidity on an expanded collateral pool (which now includes loans) and a lower reserve ratio." Goldman said its analysts believe "the scope and structure of this facility directly addresses the banks' key funding concerns."
While official support for the banks "help to reduce the risk premium to some degree," the analysts noted, the fundamentals, in a nutshell, still stink, so "on balance, we feel a neutral in the sector is appropriate."
Hardly a ringing endorsement, perhaps, but still a soothing balm to institutions that have seen little but bad press of late.
10:22 A.M. | In Britain, Talk of a Greater Gulf With Europe
On the other side of the English Channel, the British news media similarly saw Mr. Cameron's refusal to submit Britain to a proposed treaty as a major development in its relations to the European Union:
The Economist: "The EU's tectonic plates have slipped momentously along same the fault line that has always divided it-the English Channel."
Gavin Hewitt, the BBC's Europe editor: "There is now a two-speed Europe. ... Never has the UK been more isolated in Europe."
Nicholas Watt, The Guardian's chief political correspondent: "... one of the most significant developments in Britain's 38-year membership of the EU."
Ian Traynor, The Guardian's Europe editor: "[T]he summit in Brussels might go down as a watershed event, the beginning of the end for Britain in Europe."
Tom Burgis, on the Financial Times's live blog: "The English Channel just got a lot wider."
Graeme Wilson, The Sun's deputy political editor: "The EU suffered its worst split in history this morning as David Cameron told the EU to get lost."
As our colleague Sarah Lyall points out in summarizing British political reaction to Mr. Cameron's decision, "given the virulent anti-European mood in his Conservative Party back home, it seems that there was little else he could have done." 
10:12 A.M. | Too Late for Print, European Papers React Online
In Europe, the view from local media online this morning was all over the map, so to speak. Focusing on the road not taken by Britain, the Guardian headlined the main article on the British edition of its Web site: "UK isolation grows as others reconsider treaty." 
It's an isolation hard to ignore no matter where. In Italy, the daily Corriere Della Sera bannered the news on its Web site, above, declared, "New Europe: Budget treaty for 26; only Great Britain stays out." The paper later moved to a more locally focused take with a quote from the country's new technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti, highlighting how Europe had "Appreciated Italy's Efforts".
 included a quote from its chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the main headline: "Merkel explains her euro success: The crisis is a chance for the new beginning."
El Pais in Spain deepened the rift, at least rhetorically, saying, "Europe advances and leaves the United Kingdom the only isolated country."
And then there's the French exception: as of the early afternoon in France, Le Monde's main headline online was a story about Dominique Strauss-Kahn, leaving the European crisis to its fourth-ranked article, an editorial entitled "Great Britain more insular than ever." 
The right-leaning French daily Le Figaro concurred: "Only Great Britain Snubs the European Accord."
9:26 A.M. | Stocks in Europe Rise; Historic Enemies Draw Closer
As markets opened in the United States, we're watching stocks rebound in Europe even after the ratings agency Moody's downgraded its ratings for three large French banks, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole. 
Elsewhere, our colleague Nicholas Kulish reports that efforts to stem the slowly unfolding crisis have brought historic enemies, Germany and Poland, closer together. He writes:
In the midst of discord, the former foes find themselves closer than ever, perhaps paving the way to a new axis of Paris, Berlin and Warsaw that could eventually form the core of a more deeply integrated Europe. 
9:15 A.M. | British Leaders React to Treaty Refusal by Cameron
The BBC has collected reaction from British politicians to Prime Minister David Cameron's refusal to sign on to the treaty deal agreed upon by the majority of European Union countries. Here is a selection:
 "What they've committed themselves to is to giving up more national control over their budgets, and us standing apart from that is not being isolated from them - it is a very sensible thing to stand apart from that."
 "As a lifelong pro-European, I will continue to argue within government and with our European partners that where changes now occur, it is essential that the integrity of our open European single market is kept intact and that we work together on the long-term problems of competitiveness within the EU on which millions of people's jobs depend."
 "David Cameron has played a blinder and he's done the only thing that it was really open for him to do... I understand the argument in favor of these measures because everybody's desperate to save the euro, but they would just mean a quite unacceptable loss of national sovereignty."
9:06 A.M. | Wall Street Set to Open Higher
Wall Street was poised to open slightly higher on Friday in the wake of the accord reached at the summit in Brussels, with Dow and Standard & Poor's futures pointing to a bounce at the opening. 
The dollar weakened on its index compared with a basket of currencies.
If sustained throughout the day, any gains would be a welcome end to the week and could well push the Dow and the S.&P. into positive territory. They were down marginally for the five-day period as of Thursday's close, when the broader market as measured by the S.&P. finished more than 2 percent lower. The financial sector has been hit particularly hard.
9:04 A.M. | Britain's Banking Industry Under 'Constant Attack'
Prime Minister David Cameron, who did not agree to sign the treaty negotiated on Friday, said as early as October that London's financial center was coming under pressure from the European Union. 
Some lawmakers were concerned that Brussels would pass laws or financial regulations that would move lucrative financial services from London to Frankfurt or Paris. "London is the center of financial services in Europe," Mr. Cameron said in October. "It's under constant attack through Brussels directives. It's an area of concern. It's a key national interest that we need to defend."
9:00 A.M. | Live Video and Audio of Leaders' Remarks
The European Union is streaming live video and audio of the news conferences being given by individual leaders of Europe, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
8:52 A.M. | An Earlier Moment of British Standoffishness
Alan Cowell, our veteran foreign correspondent and Britain watcher, is not at all surprised by Britain's standoffishness. As he writes in today's Letter From Europe in the International Herald Tribune, "History and geography have combined to divide Britain and Continental Europe far more profoundly" than just the width of the English Channel.
He reminds us that Charles de Gaulle opposed Britain's entry into the European Union in 1963. In addition, Mr. Cowell writes of an exchange between Winston Churchill and the French leader:
Shortly before the D-Day landings of 1944, Mr. Churchill told the French general Charles de Gaulle that every time Britain had to "decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea that we shall choose."
"Every time I have to decide between you and Roosevelt," he said, referring to the wartime U.S. president, "I shall always choose Roosevelt."

HEADLINE: Podcast: Too Big to Fail, Global Growth, Robert Frank and a Madoff Update

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
In the recent financial crisis, the federal government spent billions of dollars bailing out institutions that were deemed too big to fail.
In the new Weekend Business podcast, Gretchen Morgenson says that despite the passage of the Dodd-Frank law, some financial institutions have grown even bigger. As she writes in Sunday Business, though, there is still some interest in Congress in changing that, despite lobbying from banks.
European leaders reached an agreement aimed at averting a possible breakup of the euro zone, as I discuss in the news update portion of the podcast. But neither Europe nor the United States is likely to be the fastest-growing region in the world in the decades ahead, in the view of Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, whom I interview in my column in Sunday Business. He says Brazil, Russia, India and China - plus Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and South Korea - are likely to be global growth engines in the decades ahead. 
In another part of the podcast, Diana Henriques provides an update on the case of Bernard Madoff, who ran the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, and who has continued to correspond with her from his prison cell.
Also on the podcast, Robert Frank of Cornell University says the economy depends on better government, not less government, and cites a personal experience at his local Department of Motor Vehicles office as an example of the benefits that more efficiency can bring. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Gretchen Morgenson on scaling back banks (27:03); news headlines (21:03); Diana Henriques on the Madoff case (17:49); Robert Frank (8:20); the week ahead (1:48).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Countries Not to Stifle Online Voices

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Her speech comes as democracies, including India, have moved to limit free speech on the Internet. 

 BODY:
United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton urged countries and businesses to fight increasing efforts to restrict access to the Internet, Steven Lee Myers and Heather Timmons write in the New York Times Friday. 
"When ideas are blocked, information deleted, conversations stifled and people constrained in their choices, the Internet is diminished for all of us," Mrs. Clinton said. She added: "There isn't an economic Internet and a social Internet and a political Internet. There's just the Internet." Read more

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Corzine Defends His Actions at MF Global | Jon S. Corzine, who came to Washington in 2001 as a Democratic senator from New Jersey, made a humbling return on Thursday, defending his tenure as MF Global's top executive and sounding a note of contrition about the brokerage firm's startling collapse.
Mr. Corzine told the House Agriculture Committee that he was "stunned" when he learned late on Oct. 30 that about $1 billion of customer money could not be located, a discovery that thwarted a sale of the firm and led to its filing for bankruptcy. Regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are now hunting for the money and examining potential wrongdoing at the firm.
Thursday's testimony was his first public comments since the bankruptcy and came after the committee voted last week to subpoena him. The former senator insisted that he always tried to "do the right thing."

HIGHLIGHT: The new Cosmopolitan Latina, how companies use and misuse Twitter, a sex scandal at the Yeshiva University newspaper, Scott Rudin plays Oscar close to his vest and Stephen Colbert steps into Donald Trump's shoes. 

 BODY:
Tanzina Vega writes about Hearst's introduction of Cosmopolitan Latina, which will begin publishing in May. The planned new magazine -- with one issue in the spring and one in the fall, and, at first, a print run of 545,000 copies -- is a recognition of the growing economic power of Latino women, who number nearly 25 million in the United States, she writes. Latino women account for one in every four subscribers of Cosmopolitan, and the Cosmopolitan Web site will have separate tab for Latino-focused content. The new magazine will be competing with Latina magazine, which just celebrated its 15th anniversary.
The Wall Street Journal looked at how various companies use Twitter to interact with customers. The ability to reach a younger audience and build up a brand is valuable, but it comes with the potential to tarnish that brand, Elizabeth Holmes writes. The article offers three models, Southwest Airlines with a staff of 10 that have access to the account; Whole Foods, which has one person with the keys to the account, which has 2.1 million followers; and Best Buy, which has a number of Twitter accounts and has 3,000 employees who can answer Tweets sent to Best Buy's help desk.
One Oscar contender is playing hard to get -- hard to see, even -- Brooks Barnes writes. "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close" from the director Stephen Daldry and the megaproducer Scott Rudin has been viewed by only a few entertainment reporters and industry executives. The buzz has been excellent, Mr. Barnes reports. So, "why the fan dance?"
Is it just because the film wasn't finished until last week? That's the explanation Warner Brothers gave to two influential awards groups, the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review; both of those organizations have early voting deadlines and had to do without "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close."
Or is this also Mr. Rudin biding his time on the campaign trail? Last year he was burned when "The Social Network," his primary Oscar bet, peaked too early, and the late-arriving "King's Speech" snatched best picture. This time around, some veteran awards strategists say, Mr. Rudin is playing a game of wait, wait, wait - pounce.
The Wall Street Journal describes the turmoil at Yeshiva University, the Orthodox Jewish college in Manhattan, over the student newspaper's decision to publish a student's anonymous essay in which she "excitedly describes a hotel room tryst and her subsequent regret over having sex." The student council withdrew financing for the newspaper, The Beacon, and Friday morning the paper's Web site had the following note up: "In light of recent developments, YU and The Beacon have agreed to separate." Also, in a letter dated Friday, one of the editors in chief resigned, disappointed that the controversy may have helped portray Yeshiva University in a "negative light."
In publishing news, the author Newt Gingrich is leading in the polls for the Republican presidential nomination, Trip Gabriel writes. While Mr. Gingrich's principal rival, Mitt Romney, was campaigning hard against him, Mr. Gingrich's only scheduled public event on Friday is at a bookstore in Washington. "On Saturday, he flies to Des Moines for a Republican debate but plans to squeeze in an afternoon book-signing," Mr. Gabriel writes. The book he is selling and signing at $25 a copy is "A Nation Like No Other," which was published in June. It is Mr. Gingrich's 16th nonfiction title and has sold 15,000 hardcover copies, according to Nielsen BookScan. His wife, Callista Gingrich, is also an author and sells an illustrated children's book, "Sweet Land of Liberty," about Ellis the Elephant, at campaign events.

        
Thursday was a bad day for the planned debate to be moderated by Donald Trump. Both Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Representative Michele Bachmann decided to skip the debate, which is scheduled for Dec. 27 in Iowa, The Caucus blog reported. Counting the other candidates that have already passed, it appears that the debate, which has been much discussed and lampooned, will feature only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum
        
Those announcements could be good news for a rival debate announced by Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert: The South Carolina Serious Class Republican debate, which he said was "set in stone" for sometime in January, ideally on Animal Planet.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
Redistrictinghas pitted several incumbent House members against each other next year for redrawn districts, Jennifer Steinhauer writes. In California's San Fernando Valley, the matchup between the veteran Democrats Brad Sherman and Howard L. Berman is expected to draw in independent political groups with deep pockets, she adds.
The book tour that Newt Gingrich has woven into his presidential campaign is raising questions about his morals and his motives for seeking the White House, Trip Gabriel writes. 
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is spending the next three weeks in Iowa campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, has sidelined his economic message and seized on gay and lesbian issues to boost his appeal among likely caucus-goers, a move that has puzzled supporters and spectators alike, Richard A. Oppel Jr. writes.
President Obama, who took office pledging to put science ahead of politics, averted a skirmish with conservatives in the nation's culture wars on Thursday by endorsing his health secretary's decision to block over-the-counter sales of an after-sex contraceptive pill to females younger than 17 years old. Jackie Calmes and Gardiner Harris report that some Democrats suggested that the administration, by avoiding a divisive debate over teenagers' sexuality, had preserved maneuvering room as it confronts a separate challenge from the nation's Catholic bishops, who seek a broad exemption for Catholic hospitals from the 2010 health-care law's requirements for contraceptive coverage.
House Republicans outlined a plan on Thursday to tie an extension of the payroll tax cut to the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, setting up a showdown with President Obama and Democrats, Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear write.
Senate Republicans made good Thursday on a promise to block Richard Cordray's nomination to become the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, leaving a leadership vacancy at the agency as it seeks to carry out a mandate that Republicans want changed, John H. Cushman Jr. writes.
Around the Web:
The Washington Post looks at how Representative Ron Paul of Texas is building support for his White House bid by targeting young voters.
Mitt Romney predicted on Thursday that his closest rival, Mr. Gingrich, would derail Republicans' efforts to recapture the White House from Mr. Obama, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected Friday include international trade data for October at 8:30 a.m.
At 9, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will discuss security in the face of budget cuts at an Atlantic Council forum.

HEADLINE: Pay for Our Mistakes? Not Us

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Europe wants banks to believe that loans to shaky European governments are no longer risky, and that the private sector will never again have to take losses, as happened with Greece. The promise is not really ironclad, but it probably will hold at least through the next few years. 

 BODY:
It is nice to have the power to never have to pay for your errors. To get that kind of clout, you have to have a credible threat to make the rest of the world miserable if you are inconvenienced.
Financial markets have that power, as we learned in 2008. The decision to allow Lehman Brothers to fail stunned Wall Street, and a credit crisis took down the world economy. In the aftermath, lenders to other banks, even those that failed, were not forced to suffer losses.
The decision to allow Lehman to fail seems to have had at least some ideological component. It isn't capitalism if you can't fail. But practicality prevailed thereafter.
This year, the decision to force private lenders to take 50 percent haircuts on loans to Greece was promptly followed by plunging prices on Spanish and Italian bonds. It was Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who led the charge for making the banks pay, for similar reasons to the ones heard when Lehman went down. Now Europe is contemplating huge capital shortfalls for its banks, and Ms. Merkel has backed down.

Bloomberg reports:
"As regards private-sector involvement, we have made a major change in our doctrine: from now on we will strictly adhere to the I.M.F. principles and doctrines," EU President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters at a briefing. "Or, to put it more bluntly, our first approach to P.S.I., which had a very negative effect on debt markets, is now officially over." 
The I.M.F. -- the International Monetary Fund -- tells me that those policies and doctrines provide for no automatic losses for the private sector, but do not rule them out either. Instead, there is to be a case-by-case analysis. William Murray, the I.M.F. spokesman, says this 2010 program for Jamaica is the most recent one, other than Greece, where private lenders did take haircuts.
So you could say that there really is no promise to spare the banks. But I suspect the reality is that the recent experience has traumatized Europe enough that it will be a very long time before anyone suggests that banks should suffer for foolish lending to a member of the European Union.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Calls Palestinians an 'Invented' People

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich raised the possibility he might break with the two-state framework for the Middle East peace process, calling Palestinians an "invented" people and the current stalled peace process "delusional." 

 BODY:
Does Newt Gingrich believe in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Democratic and Republican administrations have adopted that framework, but Mr. Gingrich raised the possibility he might break with it, calling Palestinians an "invented" people and the current stalled peace process "delusional."
His comments were made this week in an interview with the Jewish Channel, a cable service. 
Discussing the origin of the State of Israel in the 1940s, Mr. Gingrich said, according to a transcript: "Remember there was no Palestine as a state. It was part of the Ottoman Empire. And I think that we've had an invented Palestinian people, who are in fact Arabs, and were historically part of the Arab community. And they had a chance to go many places."
Denying that Palestinians are a people or nation is an argument sometimes used by the far right in Israel, but it is not the mainstream view.
"What he's saying is far to the right of the democratically elected Likud leadership of the State of Israel, not to mention established U.S. policy for decades," said David Harris, chief executive of the National Jewish Democratic Council, an American Jewish group. "This is as clear a demonstration as one needs that he's not ready for prime time."
Mr. Gingrich was applauded this week by a coalition of Jewish Republicans for criticizing the Obama administration's policies in the Middle East as bending too far in favor of Palestinians. 
In the interview, Mr. Gingrich said the administration's efforts to deal evenhandedly with Israel and the Palestinians are actually "favoring the terrorists."
"I see a much more tougher-minded and much more honest approach to the Middle East in a Gingrich administration," he said.
He also described Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, as denying Israel's right to exist and seeking -- along with Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist group -- to destroy Israel. 
"You have Abbas who says in the United Nations, 'We do not necessarily concede Israel's right to exist,'" Mr. Gingrich said. "You've had four P.L.A. ambassadors around the world say flatly, 'Israel does not have a right to exist.'"
"So you have to start with this question 'Who are you making peace with?'" he added. 
Mr. Abbas, who unsuccessfully sought to have a Palestinian state admitted as a member of the United Nations in September, said in his speech at the time that he favored peace talks. In a statement read on his behalf last month at the United Nations, he said, "We do not want and we do not seek to delegitimize Israel by applying for membership in the United Nations, but to delegitimize its settlement activities and the seizure of our occupied lands."

HEADLINE: Just Getting On With It

BYLINE: CATHY HORYN


HIGHLIGHT: From Notting Hill, the Duchess's $100 dress looks like the right response to England's woes. 

 BODY:
FOR the last few days I've been in London on assignment, staying at the Portobello Hotel, where - my friend Tim Blanks tells me - he used to visit Nico in the '70s. "It may have been the first boutique hotel in London," he said, recalling that the front-desk man in the Nico era wore a cropped Vivienne Westwood top with feather trim.
To me, the Portobello, in Notting Hill, is actually the un-boutique hotel. It doesn't charge for Wi-Fi, and you can get porridge any time you want it. Somebody in the management thought to add a small carton of milk to the familiar bottles in the mini bar (with a cereal bowl in the cupboard). In other words, the hotel gives you exactly what you need, and doesn't try to be stylish or hip. It just is.
This is the first time I've stayed for a length of time in Notting Hill. I made one dash early in the week to the West End to meet Hussein Chalayan for lunch at J. Sheekey, which was packed, as many restaurants in this end of town are.
This morning I'm going to the National Gallery to see the Leonardo da Vinci show. But otherwise I've stayed around Notting Hill, and one tends to notice things: the variety of small retail businesses that cater to the neighborhood (and people who come to the Portobello Market), the many organic and fair-trade food purveyors, the amount of Christmas stuff (greens, cards, toys) that is generally nicer and less expensive than what you find in New York.
At the end of the day, when I'm walking back to the hotel, taking a different route to discover something new, I'm actually finding things I want to buy. And I can't remember when I last had that desire in Paris or on one of London's big commercial streets.
Anyway, I'm not sure what to think. The London newspapers are filled with reports about the eurozone crisis, British unemployment and inflation, and firsthand accounts of the recent riots. One article expressed the concern that England was following the United States and becoming a nation of haves and have-nots.
In The Guardian, a 20-year-old law student described feeling happy when he joined the looting during the riots and set fire to a sports car in a showroom. He said he felt untouchable. I don't know what kind of lawyer the man will make, but you can understand why the riots remain on people's minds.
"Fashion has always pursued the rich," Mr. Chalayan said over lunch. (More from our conversation later.) Fashion has also pursued ideas and innovation, with a dose of reality. I have to admit Karl Lagerfeld's Indian banquet show for Chanel last week left me cold, as did his comment to Lisa Armstrong in The Daily Telegraph: "People have always responded to difficulty by dressing up in jewels."
Really? I prefer the Duchess of Cambridge's more contemporary response. For a benefit concert the other night, she wore a $100 dress from Zara. She just got on with it.
By the way, check out Kurt Anderson's excellent piece in Vanity Fairabout why there has been a lack of innovation for the last 20 years in the arts and style.

HEADLINE: Who Counts as 'Rich'?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A person needs to earn at least $150,000 to be considered "rich," according to the median response of Americans in a new Gallup survey. That's not quite President Obama's definition. 

 BODY:
We've written plenty of times about how little Americans know about the distribution of income in the United States, and how many richpeople don't realize they're rich, at least relative to the rest of the country.
Now Gallup has surveyed Americans to ask what they believe the cutoff for being "rich" should be. The median response was that a person would need to make at least $150,000 to be considered rich. Here's a breakdown of the responses:
 
According to the Tax Policy Center's calculations on income distribution, a household earning cash income of $150,000 would fall somewhere between the 89th and 90th percentiles. In other words, the typical American believes anyone in about the top tenth of the income distribution counts as "rich."
President Obama and others, on the other hand, have set the cutoff around $250,000 when discussing "raising taxes on the rich." Households earning cash income of $250,000 are somewhere between the 96th and 97th percentiles.
As you might expect, answers to Gallup's survey question on the threshold for being "rich" varied tremendously by demographics and geography. For example, men cited a higher bar than women did -- $150,000 versus $100,000, respectively:
 
Note that respondents with children under 18 said they would require $200,000 before considering themselves rich, whereas the childless were satisfied with a $100,000 benchmark. (That reminds me of this xkcd cartoon.)
As you might expect, those who live in urban areas -- like New York City, where the cost of living is very high -- or in suburbs had higher standards for being "rich" than did Americans who live in towns or rural settings.
Readers, I'm curious: What's your definition for who counts as "rich"?

HEADLINE: Romney Taps Brake on Gingrich Attacks

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: After a week of hard-hitting criticism of his surging rival, Mitt Romney scaled back his assault, contrasting himself with Newt Gingrich but not criticizing him directly. 

 BODY:
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa - Wrapping up a week of varied and hard-hitting attacks on Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney on Friday stepped back his assault at a town-hall-style meeting here, contrasting himself with Mr. Gingrich but never forcefully criticizing him.
At a brief news conference after Mr. Romney's event at an animal nutrient plant here, reporters asked if he, like some other Republicans, had concerns about Mr. Gingrich's character or his qualifications to be president, but Mr. Romney refused to take the bait.
After saying that Mr. Gingrich, like all of his 2012 rivals, was "qualified" and "would do a better job as president than the current president," Mr. Romney said only that he and Mr. Gingrich disagreed over some issues.
"You may recall that Rick Perry and I were going back and forth on immigration and Social Security," he said. "Speaker Gingrich and I have a very different view, for instance, in regard to Paul Ryan's plan and the need to fundamentally transform Medicare version 2.0, if you will."
And as for that conference call Thursday morning, where two Romney surrogates - former Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire and former Senator Jim Talent of Missouri - attacked Mr. Gingrich as erratic and self-aggrandizing?
"You know I can't write a script for Governor Sununu or anybody else," Mr. Romney said. "I can tell you that people who worked with Speaker Gingrich have their own views and will express those views."
What about the "super PAC" run by supporters of Mr. Romney, which just released an ad warning that Mr. Gingrich comes laden with heavy political baggage?
"I don't have any comment on anything that PACs are going to do or say," Mr. Romney said. "I just happen to think that this election is going to ultimately come down to a question about the direction of the country, and who is going to be able to lead the country at a critical time."
He added: "I hope in that final analysis, I get chosen. If I'm not, I'll be disappointed, but not heartbroken." 
In his town-hall-style meeting, which lasted just under an hour, Mr. Romney had ample opportunity to draw subtle distinctions between himself and Mr. Gingrich, who is now leading in many polls. Setting Mr. Romney up for a comparison that his campaign likes to make, a 26-year-old voter from Wisconsin asked him about his views on Paul Ryan's Medicare plan.
"One of the candidates in the race has criticized him for that, then he said he did not criticize him for it, and then he apologized for doing what he said he didn't do," said the voter, referring to Mr. Gingrich before asking Mr. Romney if he would get behind the Ryan Plan.
"When his plan came out, I applauded it, as a very important step," Mr. Romney said. "I said my plan would be a little different, or it would be different in some respects, but that we were on the same page. This is a place where Speaker Gingrich and I disagree. He called this 'right-wing social engineering.' I believe it's a very important step. To protect Medicare and to protect Social Security, we're going to have to make changes like the ones Paul Ryan proposed."
Immigration is another area where Mr. Romney has sought to differentiate himself from Mr. Gingrich, who in a recent debate offered what he called a "humane" position on immigration - and what some others have sought to portray as amnesty.
"My view is the people who have come here illegally should not be treated with favoritism in becoming permanent residents or citizens of the United States relative to those who have waited patiently in line in their own countries," Mr. Romney said, in response to a voter question on the issue. "For those who have come here illegally, they might have a transition time to allow them to set their affairs in order, and then go back home and get in line with everybody else."
Mr. Romney also sought to keep the focus on President Obama.
"And by the way, I find it extraordinary that we have a president that has very big agenda about transforming America, but it does not include any plan for making our economy strong," he said. "I just don't understand how you can have a president in office for three years, with 26 million people out of work or stopped looking for work, or in part-time work, underemployed, and you have a president that all he wants to do is talk about a payroll tax Band-Aid."
Clarifying that he personally was not "looking to raise the taxes," Mr. Romney added, "But that Band-Aid is not going to fix America."

HEADLINE: Perry and Romney Seek Iowa Paper's Endorsement

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Before The Des Moines Register editorial board, Rick Perry misstated the number of justices on the Supreme Court, and Mitt Romney hammered away at Newt Gingrich. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney and Rick Perry both appeared before The Des Moines Register editorial board on Friday, hoping for an endorsement by the influential newspaper in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
For Mr. Perry, an endorsement could help him realize the promise that his campaign once held in the state. Recent polls have shown him lagging badly behind Mr. Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.
Mr. Perry's performance during the editorial board meeting -- which was broadcast live over the Internet -- may not have helped him.
At one point, Mr. Perry could not name Justice Sonia Sotomayor, referring to her as "Montemayor." Then, a few minutes later, he misstated the number of justices on the Supreme Court.
"For Washington to tell a local school district that you cannot have a prayer and a time of prayer in that school is, I think, offensive to most Americans," Mr. Perry said. "I trust the people of the states to make those decisions. I trust those independent school districts to make those decisions better than eight unelected, and frankly, unaccountable judges."
There have been nine members on the Supreme Court since the middle of the 19th century.
Mr. Romney used his appearance before the editorial board to continue contrasting his record with Mr. Gingrich's.
He said Mr. Gingrich had spent his life "in Washington," adding that "there's nothing wrong with that -- it's just different."
Mr. Romney pointed out differences with Mr. Gingrich over immigration policy, child labor law, economic policy, climate change and others. And he also pointed out some of the more wacky ideas that Mr. Gingrich had floated over the years.
He said that Mr. Gingrich had once suggested a permanent colony on the moon and building mirrors in space that could illuminate the nation's highways.
"I think we've got some other priorities," Mr. Romney said.
The Register is the state's largest newspaper, but it does not have a perfect track record when it comes to picking the winner of the Iowa caucuses. In 2008, the paper endorsed Senator John McCain of Arizona for the Republican nomination and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as the Democratic nominee. Both lost in Iowa and Ms. Clinton ended up losing the nomination.
The paper usually reveals its endorsements a few weeks before the voting, which will take place on Jan. 3.

HEADLINE: Europe's Latest Try

 BODY:
We're losing count of how many European Union summit meetings have ended with ''historic'' agreements to contain the euro-zone debt crisis only to see them fall apart as markets judged they were inadequate or irrelevant to the problem of making good on old debts and generating enough growth to pay off future obligations. 
We are not optimistic that Friday morning's agreement on a ''new fiscal compact'' for the euro-zone will now break that cycle.
The agreement -- all 17 members that use the euro have agreed to sign it -- is built around Germany's demand for legal commitments to maintain fiscal and financial discipline. In the long-term, more discipline and coordination and more financial transparency are good things. But a pact that binds all members to more austerity in a time of recession is exactly what Europe does not need right now. The agreement will also increase the money available for future bailouts. But the amounts are still far too small to persuade investors that Europe is prepared to back up much larger economies like Italy and Spain. And it still leaves the euro zone without a lender of last resort, like America's Federal Reserve, to defend vulnerable countries and banks from market panic.
The pact will prove worth the effort only if it persuades the European Central Bank to assume that role. Statements earlier this week by the bank's president, Mario Draghi, are not encouraging.
Germany wanted all 27 European Union members to join the fiscal pact. But Britain, Europe's third-largest economy after Germany and France and ever ambivalent about the union, refused to go along. Britain has stayed with the pound, so its refusal will not make much practical difference on fiscal policy. But it could isolate Britain and weaken the European Union as a whole.
Europe has learned the hard way that sustainable monetary union requires better coordination of national fiscal policies. Greece wrecked its finances by overspending, undertaxing and falsely reporting its budget numbers. But major leaders, especially Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, still refuse to acknowledge that coordination isn't enough.
Without crisis-management mechanisms like fiscal transfers from richer to poorer members and a central bank willing to be a lender of last resort, financial crises can leap borders and doom the whole euro zone to recession.
Other euro-zone members currently under market attack, like Italy and Spain, have manageable deficits. Austerity will only make their problems worse. They suffer mainly from high borrowing costs, weakened banks and faltering growth. Their immediate problem is the high interest rates produced by Europe's mismanagement of the Greek crisis. If the European Central Bank bought enough bonds to drive their interest costs to precrisis levels, their deficits would quickly start to evaporate.
If Germany were willing to do its own part by buying more from its weaker neighbors -- and stopped insisting that austerity is a one-size-fits-all-conditions answer -- all of Europe, as well as the United States, would have better chances of restoring robust growth. That would really be a ''historic'' solution to the euro-zone crisis.

HEADLINE: Cuomo, Praised for Tax Deal, Takes Victory Lap to City

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Hours after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo won overwhelming approval of a package to overhaul the state's income tax, an undertaking he had first informed the public about only three days earlier, his lieutenant governor, Robert J. Duffy, described Mr. Cuomo's achievements as ''nothing short of a miracle.''
''The governor is leading this state to a Super Bowl championship,'' Mr. Duffy told business leaders at a state theater in Albany, as Mr. Cuomo looked on from his seat on the stage. 
On Friday, the Senate Democratic leader, John L. Sampson, called the governor's success persuading a divided legislature to swiftly adopt sweeping tax legislation ''an amazing thing.'' The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, declared, ''We have the most effective governor in America today.'' Not to be outdone, State Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Brooklyn Democrat, described Mr. Cuomo in an interview as ''the most popular governor in the world.''
Even a journalist, Maria Bartiromo of CNBC, was impressed, commenting Thursday, via Twitter, that ''he is so smart'' after she was the M.C. at an economic development event for the governor.
Government watchdog groups were livid over Mr. Cuomo's stealthy maneuverings in winning enactment of the tax package, which creates a new tax bracket for the state's highest-income residents while reducing rates for millions of middle-income families. Some Republicans claimed he tried to win their votes by threatening them with political retribution if they did not support him. But as Mr. Cuomo took a victory lap on Friday, promoting aspects of the legislation outside Binghamton and in Brooklyn, he was greeted with overwhelming applause.
And, as he hit the road, his fans hit the airwaves: the Committee to Save New York, a group of business leaders that has spent millions of dollars on advertising this year in support of the governor's agenda, began running a television advertisement that says despite Washington gridlock, ''the governor and Legislature are getting things done,'' and concludes with a photo of Mr. Cuomo, with shirt sleeves rolled up, shaking someone's hand.
''It's black, it's white, it's Democrats, it's Republicans -- even those who at various points disagree with the governor, I think there continues to be a high level of opinion about the work that he's done,'' said Assemblyman Karim Camara, the chairman of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus.
Mr. Cuomo, who has often seemed to lavish more attention on upstate than on New York City, held a ceremonial bill signing in Brooklyn to celebrate one part of the tax overhaul -- a package of tax credits and new financing for job training programs that the governor and lawmakers said would help combat chronic joblessness among young people in poor, urban areas.
But the appearance also gave Mr. Cuomo an opportunity to drive home his administration's new favorite message since the tax overhaul: that while Washington is paralyzed by political gridlock, Albany is functioning effectively.
''Everybody's blaming everybody, and they're pointing fingers, and nothing is happening,'' Mr. Cuomo said of Washington. He described New York as ''a shining example of the opposite,'' adding: ''What if you don't blame each other? What if you don't argue amongst each other? What if you don't play politics with each other? What if you work together? What if you stop shouting and you start listening and you find out how to cooperate and how to reach compromise?
''That's what this New York State Legislature did,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''New York made a beautiful statement. It said, 'We're not waiting for Washington, and we're not waiting for them to finish fighting in the Congress. We're going to step up and we're going to lead.' ''
Mr. Cuomo's appearance at Medgar Evers College, a campus of the City University of New York, was notable in part because his relationships with lawmakers from minority neighborhoods had been questioned at times this year as some legislators worried that the governor was paying insufficient attention to urban issues like joblessness, affordable housing and gun violence.
Mr. Cuomo was heckled when he spoke at an annual gathering of minority lawmakers last winter, but on Friday the only interruption occurred when Mr. Cuomo was taking questions, and a woman shouted from behind the gaggle of reporters.
''You got my vote when you start running again,'' she yelled. ''We love you!''
The governor looked back at the reporters and asked: ''Why don't you guys ever say that?''

HEADLINE: Getting a Grip on Taxes Before the Storm Hits

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THIS has been a year of financial uncertainty, both here and abroad. But one thing is sure for next year: taxes will definitely be on politicians' agendas and voters' minds.
This year, tax advisers agree, was benign in terms of changes to the Internal Revenue Code. But that comes after two tumultuous years. In 2009, tax preparers waited nervously for action on the expiring estate tax that never came. Then, in late 2010 came a jumble of unexpected tax actions: from reinstating the estate tax for this year and next, with a higher exemption level than most tax advisers expected, to extending the Bush-era tax cuts for two more years.
So how to handle these last few weeks of the tax year? As is true every year, taxpayers should run a checklist for everything from selling securities that have lost money to taking advantage of annual gift allowances.
But even then, seemingly straightforward deductions are not always so. The $500 energy tax credit, for example, limits the amount you can deduct for new windows to 10 percent of the value up to $200. In other words, you had to spend $2,000 on windows to get the full window credit. 
And charitable deductions can be more broadly defined to include costs incurred while volunteering, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, a tax preparation company. ''You can't deduct the value of your time, but you can deduct your out-of-pocket expenses,'' he said.
But beyond the usual recommendations, the tax advisers I spoke to stressed that you should use this year to get your affairs in order for what promises to be an uncertain two years of tax policy.
''For high-net-worth individuals, chances are the next year or so is going to be a challenging time,'' said Chris Johnson, head of United States wealth advisory at Barclays Wealth. ''There is going to be a lot of attention focused on ways to extract additional tax dollars.''
If Congress does not act to extend a series of smaller tax deductions, next year could be costly for middle-income taxpayers as well. Here are some of the more pressing issues to consider.
WHAT MAY EXPIRE AFTER 2011 Every year Congress passes a series of so-called patches, renewing some 70 tax breaks for another year or two. In the past, this has been a formality, much as raising the debt ceiling used to be. This year, it remains to be seen what Congress will do.
Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a publisher of research and software for tax lawyers and accountants, noted that when these patches expired in 2009 and were re-enacted retroactively at the end of 2010, the delay wreaked havoc with tax planning.
The deductions vary. Teachers, for example, can deduct $250 toward classroom expenses.
Other patches affect broader swaths of the population. One allows residents to choose between deducting state income and sales tax against their federal tax. This is a favorite of people in states like Florida and Texas that have no state income tax.
In high-tax states, the big worry is what happens to the alternative minimum tax, a parallel system of taxation that cancels out many deductions. The A.M.T. was originally meant to keep wealthy people from paying too little in taxes. Because it was not indexed for inflation, however, Congress has had to approve periodic fixes to keep it from affecting many more people than intended.
Without a fix next year, Stephen A. Baxley, director of tax and financial planning at Bessemer Trust, said, the A.M.T. would ''hit an additional 20 million people, and most of them are middle-income taxpayers.'' It normally claims around four million taxpayers.
Two of the big triggers for the A.M.T. are high state taxes on property and income, which hit residents of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California disproportionately, said Alfred Peguero, partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers's private company services practice.
For older people, there is again a chance that the provision allowing them to directly donate the required minimum withdrawal from their retirement account to charity may be delayed or not renewed. Currently, people over 70 1/2 can donate up to $100,000 to charity. If this patch were to disappear, the federal income tax on the withdrawal and the charitable deduction would cancel each other out. But some states do not allow charitable deductions above a certain income, or at all.
''Higher taxpayers have their itemized deductions reduced in New York,'' Mr. Baxley said. ''In Connecticut and New Jersey, you don't get any benefit from itemized deductions.''
WHAT CHANGES IN 2012 There are several provisions that will take effect or lapse regardless of Congressional action.
One set to start in 2012 is a requirement that brokers report the purchase price on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds to the Internal Revenue Service for capital gains purposes. (They began doing this for stocks this year.)
The default method of reporting is called ''first in, first out,'' which could result in higher capital gains taxes if those first shares were much cheaper than more recent ones. Taxpayers have the option of electing other reporting methods, like ''last in, first out,'' which benefits people who bought shares over many years, presuming those shares have appreciated.
There are also two significant tax breaks set to end. One is a loophole that allows people whose marginal tax bracket is under 15 percent to pay no capital gains tax when selling securities held for more than a year.
''It's been around for three years now but people aren't aware of it, generally because when their income is that low they don't have the ability to buy things that appreciate,'' said Glenn Frank, director of investment tax strategy at Lexington Wealth Management.
But he said that parents could give $26,000 of appreciated stock as a gift to, for example, a child who has moved home after college and has a low-paying job. (The 15 percent bracket ends at $34,500 for a single person but stretches to $69,000 for a married couple filing jointly.) No taxes would be owed as long as the gains in the securities did not push the recipient's income out of the 15 percent bracket.
The other break is a provision in the 2010 Tax Relief Act that allowed 100 percent of an investment made in a private company to be free of capital gains taxes. This provision is a boon to venture capitalists who can reap millions in gains tax-free. Mr. Luscombe said he suspected the exemption would revert to 50 percent of the gain.
WHAT HAPPENS IN 2013 In many ways, 2011 may be the calm before the storm. If Congress and President Obama continue to disagree, then the Bush tax cuts automatically expire in 2013, raising taxes on income, capital gains and dividends and lowering the exemptions for estate and gift taxes. Add to this the prospect of an additional 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on investment income. Then again, the two sides could do something completely unexpected.
The uncertainty means that tax planners are going to have a harder time giving their usual advice -- gauging whether it is better to accelerate income and delay deductions or vice versa. Generally, advisers like to have some certainty for two or three years before making a recommendation.
Mr. Peguero said that he would advise business owners ''to sell appreciated assets in 2012 and wait until 2013 to make a capital investment where the deduction may mean more.''
He added, ''That's presuming taxes stay the same.''
The uncertainty also means that advisers are spending time urging their clients to remain calm. ''I think people can do themselves a great disservice by trying to time the markets and the legislation,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''You're opening yourself up to a lot of risk.''
This is where the savviest tax minds cannot compete with politicians bent on getting re-elected.

HEADLINE: While Germany Prospers, Unemployment Strangles Others

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
DURING the first nine years of the euro's existence, it seemed to be a great success for what are now called the peripheral countries of the euro zone. Able to borrow at low rates -- in some cases for the first time -- and benefiting from a buoyant global economy, many countries boomed. 
But over the last five years, those countries have suffered more than others. Nowhere are the changing fortunes within the euro zone more apparent than in the unemployment statistics.
The accompanying charts show unemployment trends since the end of 2006, near the peak of growth and a year before the United States fell into a recession that spread around the world after the credit crisis worsened in late 2008.
For Germany and, to a lesser extent, the countries that some have speculated could join it in a new common currency if the euro zone collapses, recent years have been a time of relative prosperity. At the end of 2006, the unemployment rate in Germany was 9.6 percent and nearly four million people were out of work. Now the rate is down to 5.5 percent and just 2.3 million people are classified as out of work.
Both of those figures are the lowest since 1991, the year Germany was unified.
Germany has benefited from many factors. It held down its labor costs during the boom, strengthening its competitive position relative to other members of the euro zone. The fact that those countries were in the euro zone helped to depress the currency's value relative to other currencies, which made German exporters even more competitive.
In recent months, the euro crisis has led some depositors to move their euros to German banks out of fear that other countries might leave the zone and convert to a less valuable currency. That has helped to lower borrowing costs for German companies while raising them for foreign competitors, if they can borrow at all.
The northern countries shown in the chart -- Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands -- also have a collective unemployment rate of 5.5 percent, with Finland the highest at 7.8 percent and Austria, Luxembourg and the Netherlands all under 5 percent. As a group, they have about the same number of unemployed workers as they did in 2006.
France, the second-largest country in the euro zone, has not done as well. It now has 14 percent more unemployed workers than it did at the end of 2006, and its unemployment rate has risen to 9.8 percent from 8.9 percent.
It is the other countries where the most pain has been felt. The number of people out of work has doubled in those 10 countries as a group, while the combined unemployment rate jumped to 15.2 percent in October from 7.4 percent in 2006, according to figures released by Eurostat, the European statistical agency.
The rise in the number of unemployed workers is largest in Ireland and Spain, where it has approximately tripled. Italy and Portugal have done better, with the number of people out of work growing by less than 50 percent.
Put another way, at the end of 2006, 32 percent of the unemployed workers in the euro zone were Germans. Now the figure for Germans is 14 percent. The peripheral countries' share went to 61 percent from 39 percent.

HEADLINE: Commuting Puzzle: Why Driving Is Rewarded Over Taking the Bus

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
This is the story of a tax break that can be worth four figures each year per household. And it's not just any four-figure break.
No, this is a giveaway that until 2009 had been worth more to those who drive to work in places like Manhattan or San Francisco and pay $400 a month to park their cars than to those who take mass transit. And starting Jan. 1, the car people may take home the bigger prize yet again.
This backward state of affairs, where a solo driver in a Lexus trumps the hordes of people standing on the city bus and riding the suburban commuter train, is in part an accident of history. But plenty of blame also lies with indifferent employers, ignorant or lazy consumers and legislators who'd just as soon see city slickers and urban workers get the short end of the stick.
Welcome to the world of the pretax commuter benefit. 
At its most basic level, this is how the benefit tends to work nowadays, after about 25 years of evolution: Your employer, if it offers this option at all, will let you take money out of your paycheck, before it takes out money for income and other taxes, to pay for your commute. You can generally spend that money on mass transit, to park your car at or near where you work (or at the train or bus station), or for your share in a van pool.
The haggling over the years has been around just how much you can set aside. This year, it was $230 a month for both mass transit and parking.
Until early 2009, however, workers who parked got to set aside roughly twice as much as people who took public transportation. And now, due to our representatives' fear of making anything permanent or convenient in the tax code, the parity of the last couple of years is scheduled to evaporate on Dec. 31. After that, unless legislators manage to patch the rules once more, parkers will get to set aside $240 a month in 2012, while mass transit riders will be allowed just $125.
Given that the point of the tax break was to encourage the use of public transportation, it's worth a quick look to see how we arrived here.
In the early 1980s, federal tax rules allowed employers to pay unlimited amounts for employees' parking at or near work without that benefit counting as taxable income. In a perhaps related development, public officials around the same time became worried about traffic on New York City's bridges and tunnels.
The subsequent campaign to encourage greater use of public transportation led to a series of developments. First came the ability to subsidize employees taking public transportation without the money being taxable.
The initial amount was just $15 a month, which went a lot further on the train back then. That led to the development of TransitChek, a voucher that employers could hand out and employees could use to purchase subway, bus or commuter train tickets.
Given the continued disparity between subsidies for drivers and straphangers, various parties continued to push to eliminate the gap. In 1992, federal legislators agreed to raise the cap on the employer-provided, tax-free public transportation subsidy to $60 a month while capping what drivers could get at $155.
(Only later, in 1998, did the rules change again to allow employers to make employees set aside money from their paychecks; debit cards soon emerged for storing that money and paying for transit expenses.)
All of this poses the obvious question: Why didn't legislators and tax officials eliminate the disparity entirely? Or stop subsidizing driver-polluters altogether?
''It was a pure political decision,'' said Larry Filler, a transit official back then who led the development of TransitChek and has spent decades in the thick of these issues.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the late New York senator, led the charge on the changes. The senator's concern, according to Mr. Filler, was that eliminating the parking tax break might cause some workers to find jobs closer to their suburban homes, thus putting city employers in his and his Capitol Hill colleagues' states or districts at a disadvantage.
At an economic moment like the one we're in today, the idea that people would switch jobs because of the loss of a parking garage tax subsidy seems rather quaint. But whatever the soundness of the logic, rules at the time required legislators and policy makers to pay for all new tax breaks in full. So in an effort to appease subsidy-happy drivers, lawmakers figured out what the average monthly parking rates were and tested the resulting $155 figure. What they found was that capping the monthly benefit at that level would bring in enough new taxes from the formerly untaxed parking subsidy to pay for a $60 public transportation benefit.
Flash forward to today, and about three million people are enrolled in pretax commuting plans of some sort, according to TransitCenter, the nonprofit group that runs TransitChek, and its partners in a coalition working to keep the transit benefit where it currently is. In a 2010 study it did of employers in the New York, Chicago and San Francisco metropolitan areas, which are ones likely to be in need of such benefits, it found that roughly two-thirds of all employees had access to some sort of commuter tax benefit.
That said, just a fifth or so of small companies in the survey offer it to their workers. If your employer doesn't have it, ask for it. (A local ordinance in San Francisco forces employers with 20 or more employees to offer the benefit, and New York State legislators have come close to passing something similar in recent years.)
Offering the benefit is not particularly burdensome. In fact, it's possible for employers to save enough on their share of your payroll taxes to pay the fees to the companies that administer the plans, though they'll still need to devote staff time to keeping track of it all.
At companies that do offer the plans, just a third of employees participate. While some of them may well walk to work, large numbers of others don't realize they have the benefit or don't bother to sign up.
Here's what you're losing if you don't, according to Melissa Labant, technical manager at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, who ran the numbers for me. A single New York City resident with $75,000 in taxable income who buys a $104 all-you-can-ride MetroCard each month saves $533 in taxes each year by setting aside money on a pretax basis. That pays, in effect, for five months of commuting.
More affluent couples can save even more. Take a New York State-dwelling, New York City-working duo with $250,000 in taxable income. Now assume they both put aside $240 each month, and one of them also socks away $30 to pay for parking at the suburban train station.
Under those assumptions, the couple achieves a whopping $2,515 in tax savings. If they can put aside only $125 each month in the transit account, however, the household savings fall to $1,381.
That $1,134 difference is what is at stake in Washington this month, since the current $230 cap for both parking and transit will become a $240 cap for parking and a $125 one for transit on Jan. 1 without any Congressional action.
Executives at TransitCenter are, quite cleverly, calling this a tax increase for mass transit riders. Meanwhile, plenty of elected representatives in rural states or districts probably find the idea of any subsidy to be absurd.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, puts the chance of a fix of some sort at 50-50 and calls the lack of parity ''sort of insulting.''
What's standing in the way of parity continuing for another year? ''Mass transit riders are concentrated in only a few states,'' he said. ''At best, senators don't pay it much attention or, at worst, they try to take it away and use the money elsewhere.'' Continued parity in 2012 would cost about $158 million, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation
Ending the annualcircus around this would require permanent parity, and to pay for it, the cap might need to be around $200. That ought to be something everyone can live with, and there are already efforts under way to make that happen.
Meanwhile, poor Mr. Filler, who helped usher in the age of pretax commuting benefits, can't benefit from them anymore. He's now a consultant, and pretax transportation benefits (and health care flexible spending accounts, and dependent care accounts and many other benefits) aren't available for independent workers.
Real parity, if we ever achieve it in this area, wouldn't just equalize benefits between mass transit users and people who drive. Defined broadly, it ought to extend to workers like him, too.

HEADLINE: Longer Standardized Tests Are Planned, Displeasing Some School Leaders

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Students across New York State will sit longer for high-stakes standardized tests in language arts and math this April compared with past years, education officials indicated Friday, drawing criticism from school leaders and parents who believe that lengthier tests are a move in the wrong direction.
A week after David Abrams, the state's longtime testing director, was forced to resign after he sent an unauthorized memorandum about lengthening testing to school districts, officials declined to specify how much time they planned to add. Mr. Abrams's memo said the tests would grow to more than four hours -- over several days -- for reading, from about two-and-a-half hours now, and to three hours or more for math, from an average of two hours now. 
Top officials disavowed the memo and said the increases would not be so drastic. They said Friday that they would send the new times and other details to districts next week.
The annual tests, given to students in grades 3 through 8, will factor into teacher evaluations for the first time this year. Extending test times, state officials said, would enable them to field-test new questions that would not count toward a student's score but could be used to develop future tests.
Currently, new questions are tested in practice exams given in selected districts. That has raised the concern that students, knowing the tests do not count, do not try very hard, resulting in misleading data. Such inaccurate feedback, these officials say, has contributed to the state's score inflation in recent years.
The Board of Regents discussed including sample multiple-choice questions in the actual tests at a meeting in December 2010, and the State Education Department issued a memo in March notifying districts that the change would take effect next spring.
But some school administrators and parents say it was not clear from the memo that a result would be longer tests.
Critics assert that more time spent on testing cuts into time for classroom instruction. They also say that lengthier tests penalize younger children who cannot concentrate for long periods, giving an inaccurate assessment of their abilities.
''I think the last thing we want is a test of stamina,'' said Richard Organisciak, superintendent of the 11,000-student New Rochelle district in Westchester County. ''The thought of a third grader sitting there for three hours -- it boggles my mind that he would stay as focused or perform as well on a high-stakes test.''
The stakes are particularly high in New York City, where a top score can help a student gain admission to some of the city's most coveted middle schools.
Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers, the union representing 218,000 public school teachers, said the state should be trying to decrease testing time, not increase it.
''If it becomes a burden on the student and teacher and it takes away from instructional time, then we've missed the point altogether,'' he said. ''We've moved away from an instrument that measures and improves student growth, and gotten wound up in the concept of how much data we can collect.''
Nationwide, most states already blend field questions into actual exams taken by students because doing so provides more reliable data about questions, said Brian Gong, executive director of the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment, a nonprofit group that provides support to state education departments. ''That's a very common practice; the SAT also does it,'' he said. ''It's the best way to get real data.''
New York's tests are shorter than those given in some other states: third graders take a 150-minute test in language arts, and a 100-minute test in math, compared with 150-minute to 270-minute tests in other states, with sample questions typically accounting for 10 to 20 minutes, Mr. Gong said. ''There are many people asking tests to do more things,'' he added, ''which technically requires the test to be longer.''
Kathleen M. Cashin, a Fordham University education professor who joined New York's Regents in March, said there should have been more discussion in the state about increasing test times.
''I think we have too much testing now,'' she said. ''I mean, is the purpose of education just to identify weaknesses through accountability measures? Or is the purpose to expand the child's learning with knowledge and vocabulary, and give them the opportunity to discuss and think at a higher level?''
Lisa Siegman, principal of Public School 3 in Greenwich Village, said she would like to see evidence that increasing the length of state tests would help schools like hers to better educate their students. ''They're trying to measure something,'' she said, ''but I'm not quite sure it connects to what we do.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Rises and Trade Deficit Falls

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
An index of consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in six months in early December and the United States trade deficit narrowed in October in the latest signs that the nation's economic health was slowly improving. 
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary December reading on consumer confidence climbed Friday for a fourth consecutive month, to 67.7 from 64.1 in November.
''U.S. consumers appear to be ending the year in a better mood,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London.
Improved confidence could lead Americans to spend more readily, which would add to the recent momentum from strong retail sales and factory output.
The narrowing in the trade deficit showed that more goods and services bought by businesses and consumers had been produced within the country.
Employment has also made gains in recent months, although some economists expect that the pace of improvement will be too slow for consumers to increase spending for long.
''Although the recent increase may provide that little bit of support to spending in the malls in the coming weeks, it won't lead to a long and lasting acceleration in consumption growth,'' Mr. Dales said.
Economic growth in the United States appears to be accelerating, even as the global economy slows. The euro zone, for example, is widely believed to be slipping into recession as it struggles to contain a sovereign debt crisis.
That crisis, as well as the possibility that the United States will not renew extended unemployment benefits and a payroll tax cut next year, are dark clouds looming over the economy.
With signs of accelerating growth coming up against big risks to the outlook, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold monetary policy steady at a meeting on Tuesday.
Despite the improvement, the consumer sentiment gauge remains well below its historical average, underscoring the fragility of household budgets as many struggle with a weak jobs market.
''There's still a long way to go before consumer confidence that would be compatible with strong consumer spending,'' said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that the United States trade deficit narrowed in October to its lowest point in 10 months.
The economy expanded at a 2 percent annual rate during the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase said the trade report meant growth during the fourth quarter could exceed its 3 percent forecast.
The trade gap was $43.5 billion, in line with a consensus estimate from analysts before the report.
While a shrinking trade gap bodes well for fourth-quarter economic output, exports and imports both declined, a sign of some softening in domestic and overseas demand.

HEADLINE: The How of an Internment, but Not All the Whys

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
POWELL, Wyo. -- In a region of inspiring landscapes, this certainly isn't one of them. If you stand near where the barracks once were, not far from the Heart Mountain Interpretive Learning Center that opened last summer, this barren expanse, with its craggily eccentric mountain in the distance, could almost seem cruelly mocking.
Imagine you are James Osamu Ito, son of a Japanese immigrant, possessor of a degree in soil science from the University of California, Davis, and owner of a 29-acre farm in California. In 1942 you are told by the United States military that you must abandon your land, your machinery and your home, and board a train, emerging here in the wintry cold. You are assigned to a drafty, tar-papered barracks where you must live out the war that your nation is waging against the land of your ancestors.
Could any place be more different from the verdant California farmland? Could anything be more dispiriting than the rows of wooden shacks where families are crammed in? And could anything be more unsettling than the guard towers or the barbed wire winding round 740 acres? 
By 1943, 10,000 people were living here in the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, about a third of them first-generation Japanese immigrants known as Issei (who were not American citizens), and the rest Nisei, second-generation Japanese-Americans. For a while, Heart Mountain was Wyoming's third-largest city. And along with nine other ''internment camps'' -- all in isolated regions where there could be no fear of transfer of information or contraband -- this was where people of Japanese heritage were sent in 1942 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, by Executive Order 9066. The concern was that they might constitute a fifth column that would subvert the American war effort.
It was a relocation of more than 110,000 people, most of them American citizens. There was no selective screening. Even now, after an official apology to the victims by the United States government, after the payment of $1.65 billion in reparations and after the writing of enough histories and memoirs to fill a bookcase, the episode remains shocking and bewildering. How did it happen and why?
Until now, one of the internment camps, Manzanar in California, has had the most public attention; it is run by the National Park Service and includes an exhibition. But a museum at Heart Mountain (awkwardly dubbed an ''interpretive learning center'') is welcome. The sparseness of the landscape and its relative isolation from competing attractions -- it is a half-hour from Cody and 60 miles from Yellowstone National Park -- focus your attention.
It took 15 years of fund-raising by the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, and the acquisition of 50 acres (together with 74 owned by the federal government) before this 11,000-square-foot center could be constructed. Its two joined buildings are meant to recall the camp's barracks; there is also a reconstructed guard tower.
Only one building from the camp remains, a brick structure once part of its hospital; not even an original barrack can be seen here, though one is installed at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. So the impact must come from the exhibition itself, which is designed by Split Rock Studios of Minnesota. It is meant to honor those whose lives were so overturned, explain how the internment happened, give some sense of camp life and suggest lessons for the future.
The museum is not uniformly successful in these ambitions, but its impact is still considerable. Wrenched out of ordinary life, stripped of many constitutional rights and placed in an unforgiving environment, Heart Mountain's inhabitants created an alternative universe. Land was farmed, shoes repaired, a newspaper printed and sports teams formed. Remarkably, residents also enlisted in, or were drafted into, the armed forces. Some residents were even imprisoned after resisting the draft, a case examined in a book by the legal scholar Eric L. Muller, a program committee director at the museum.
Primarily, this is a museum shaped by survivors' recollections. In oral histories they recount being forced from their homes, tell of having to eat apart from their parents in the mess hall, or describe the humiliation of unpartitioned toilets. (The museum's restrooms hint at the experience with mirrored stalls.) Japanese culture, we learn, taught forbearance and discipline. And pride is justly taken. In this museum, history is told in the first person. It is about ''us''; its actors are ''we.'' This is a communal narrative about shared injustices and triumphs.
But this is also one of the museum's weaknesses. ''We'' and ''us'' also create limits. The experience becomes central. How, though, is it to be interpreted? What is its context?
One problem is that the internment camp doesn't easily fit into familiar categories. Heart Mountain certainly looked like a prison. Yet we also read of its newspaper editors working in Cody and of other jobs held outside the camp. How common was such employment?
Internment actually had fairly large loopholes. In the 10 internment camps, more than 4,000 students left to attend college. In addition, if a family found a place to live in another part of the country outside the West Coast or other militarily important areas, they were free to move; 30,000 did. At least one company, in New Jersey, even recruited employees here. These peculiar mixtures of liberties and restrictions give the internment a surreal cast.
A Congressional commission that examined the camps in the 1980s endorsed the explanation, now standard, that they were a result of wartime hysteria and racism. For example, at the exhibition we learn of Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1925 assertion that the mixing of American and ''Asiatic blood'' would have ''unfortunate results.'' There was also envy of the Japanese-American economic success.
But wartime internment was more the rule than the exception. During World War I many European countries incarcerated citizens of opposing nations; the United States, too, imprisoned ''enemy aliens,'' including Germans who were not citizens.
During World War II Japanese-Canadians were put in camps. In Britain, even Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany were interned as enemy aliens on the Isle of Man. What made the situation of the Japanese in the United States more complicated is that while the Issei, forbidden to become naturalized, were classified as enemy aliens whose internment was legal, their American children, the Nisei, were citizens. But surely the other examples of wartime internment would help us understand why Executive Order 9066 was widely supported.
It would help, too, to have a clearer understanding of the prewar Japanese-American population, which is now portrayed as homogenously assimilationist. But we know that 1930s Japan was a racist, militant society, convinced of the emperor's divinity, and that a considerable number of Nisei were sent there to study.
''Loyalty to the emperor,'' we learn at the Japanese American National Museum, was a cherished value for the Issei. Even the use of terms like Issei and Nisei shows careful attention to Japanese connections. In addition, American military and F.B.I. reports describe a number of Japanese-American organizations on the West Coast that were financially and ideologically devoted to the mother country and its policies.
All of this would have amplified suspicions. In addition, the government had decoded dispatches from Japanese agents referring to their plans and successes. On May 9, 1941, one from Los Angeles read: ''We have already established contacts with absolutely reliable Japanese in the San Pedro and San Diego area.''
Two days later, a dispatch from Seattle said, ''We are securing intelligences concerning the concentration of warships within the Bremerton Naval Yard''; Japanese residents were relocated from that area in 1942.
Moreover, the Japanese were known for similar espionage elsewhere, including the Philippines. A treasonous example of assistance from residents of Japanese descent also occurred just after Pearl Harbor, in which a couple on a remote Hawaiian island tried to help a downed Japanese pilot escape. The threat was palpable: a Japanese submarine had sunk American ships and shelled a California oil field.
I am not suggesting that such factors justified the relocations. Almost all of the internees were surely innocent, and most deserved the rights of citizens. The policy was racially tinged and hysterical in its sweep. But at the very least, the context demonstrates that the relocation was a response -- an extreme one -- to a problem. There was a geographical rationale, not simply a racial one. This context also helps explain the peculiar ambiguities in the camps' regulatory mixture of anxiety, ruthlessness and flexibility.
It should also affect contemporary conclusions. ''Could an injustice like Heart Mountain happen again?'' the museum asks. ''It's all too easy in times of crisis and war to look for an 'outsider' scapegoat.'' It then suggests that this is why Japanese-American groups spoke out on behalf of American Muslims after 9/11. But such linkages surely deserve more scrutiny.
What is beyond question is that whatever the context, nothing can lessen the policy's tragic consequences -- the violation of principle, the loss of property, the inability of internees to pick up their old lives, the suicides, the hatreds, the lost possibilities -- and they are all powerfully commemorated here.

HEADLINE: An A.T.V. With Extra Room, And Maybe More Risks, Too

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
They started out decades ago as handy vehicles for farmers and builders to haul things like lumber and fertilizer.
But now, with as many as six seats, roll bars, seat belts and cushy bucket seats, so-called side-by-sides have become the luxury sedan of off-roading. They are so popular with families and baby boomers that they are on pace to soon outsell their smaller and better-known cousins -- all-terrain vehicles.
''Whenever I'm not working, we are on it,'' said Chris Liconti, who used to ride A.T.V.'s but now prefers a side-by-side, in part because his wife and 2-year-old son can come along. ''There's no more family feud, 'Oh, Dad is going out riding.' ''
Side-by-sides, which cost about $7,000 to $17,000, are invigorating a power sporting equipment industry that has been clobbered by years of economic malaise and safety concerns. While A.T.V.'s remain far more plentiful, their sales have dropped by two-thirds since they peaked in 2004; side-by-side sales are growing roughly 15 percent this year, industry analysts estimate. 
But with success has come scrutiny -- and a probable showdown between safety officials and recreational enthusiasts. While side-by-sides appear to be far less prone to accidents than A.T.V.'s, federal officials are pushing toward mandatory regulations to make them safer. Side-by-sides have been linked to an estimated 160 deaths and nearly twice as many injuries since 2003; A.T.V.'s, by comparison, are associated with 800 deaths and 130,000 injuries a year. An estimated 530,000 side-by-sides and 10.2 million A.T.V.'s were in operation by the late 2000s.
Unlike typical A.T.V.'s, which have handlebars and an open saddle, side-by-sides -- the seats are beside one another -- have a steering wheel and a roll bar. They reach speeds upward of 60 miles per hour, and in some states, no driver's license is required. ''As a utility vehicle where people are using them on the farms, they are perfectly appropriate,'' said Donald L. Mays, senior director of product safety at Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. But without rigorous stability tests, he said, ''The concern that I have is these things can flip over, particularly when they are used on uneven terrain.''
Industry officials maintain that the vast majority of the accidents are caused by human error. And they worry that the government will require them to make side-by-sides so wide and so low to the ground to decrease the chance of rollovers that they will no longer be able to go on trails.
''Their mandatory standard is unrealistic from an off-road vehicle standpoint,'' said Steve Nessl, marketing manager for the A.T.V. and side-by-side group at the Yamaha Motor Corporation.
The regulatory debate comes as manufacturers rush out new models to meet the robust demand. Polaris Industries, which markets a fleet of side-by-sides including a two-seat, 88-horsepower model, posted record profits in its most recent quarterly earnings. Its shares are up 53 percent since the first of the year.
''I went from selling roughly two to four side-by-side vehicles in a year to now I sell four a month,'' said John Resciniti, the owner of the Motorcycle Mall in Belleville, N.J., which began selling Polaris side-by-sides a year ago. ''It's insane.''
Dave Crocker, senior partner at Power Products Marketing, which tracks the industry, said sales of side-by-sides fell with other recreational vehicles in 2009, but rebounded in 2010 even as the rest of the industry's products -- like A.T.V.'s, snowmobiles and dirt bikes -- continue to lag.
This year, he said he expected roughly 240,000 side-by-sides to be sold in the United States; a decade ago, about 100,000 side-by-sides sold each year. Recreational users account for roughly a quarter of sales, he said, with the remainder bought by hunters, farmers, fire departments and for other utility uses.
By comparison, 330,000 A.T.V.'s were sold in 2010, and sales have declined from 10 to 30 percent in recent years, according to the Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association. Some analysts, including Mr. Crocker, believe that side-by-side sales have already surpassed A.T.V. sales
Some version of side-by-sides has been around since the 1980s, but the early models were relatively slow-moving utility vehicles. In the late 1990s, however, more people began using the vehicles for recreation, a trend that was accelerated when Polaris pushed past the 25 mile-per-hour speed limit in 1998 with its Ranger model.
But the real propellant was the introduction, in 2003, of the Yamaha Rhino, the first side-by-side designed for recreation. In its peak year, 2007, Yamaha sold 44,000 Rhinos, Mr. Crocker said. Other manufacturers, including Polaris, soon followed with their own recreational models.
''It enabled people to buy these things and go on these incredible trails, and your son or your wife or your girlfriend can sit next to you,'' he said.
But the Rhino became the subject of hundreds of lawsuits and a 2009 recall to address safety concerns, primarily rollovers that have led to injuries and some deaths. Among the victims was 10-year-old Ellie Sand of Ohio, who was killed when a Rhino she was riding in flipped in 2007.
''They are very narrow, they are top-heavy, and unfortunately they give the visual perception that they are safer because you see a steering wheel, you see a roll bar, you see a seat belt,'' said her father, John Sand. ''The concept is a nice concept. I just think they need to do things to make them safer.''
Yamaha officials maintain that there is no defect. ''We see nothing wrong with the Rhino and have defended it aggressively,'' Mr. Nessl, of Yamaha, said. He noted that his company had won all 10 lawsuits that had gone to trial; Yamaha officials declined to say how many other lawsuits filed against them had been settled.
Even so, Inez Tenenbaum, the chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said her agency had rejected drafts of voluntary standards proposed by the industry as too weak. ''We have to make sure there is stability and standards that prevent rollovers,'' she said. She said the commission was moving toward adopting mandatory standards and would continue to do so unless the industry embraced far tougher voluntary standards.
On a recent afternoon in Cochecton, N.Y., near a bend in the Delaware River, Mr. Liconti, a burly disc jockey from Staten Island, put his Polaris Razor through the paces, driving over rocks and logs with ease, climbing hills and plunging through deep pools of mud with his friend Joe Tinari riding shotgun.
''I drive this thing very, very aggressive,'' he said. ''You know your limits. I have not rolled this thing, and I have not felt like it's going to roll.''
He has tricked out his Razor with overhead lights, a steel roll bar and custom doors to provide extra protection. Besides being able to take along his wife and son, strapped into a car seat, Mr. Liconti said he did not get as beat up as he did on his A.T.V.
''I don't feel like I went through the war on Sunday,'' he said. ''You get to have the same amount of fun, and you are not as tired.''

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Could Face Penalty From S.E.C.

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE; Azam Ahmed contributed reporting.

 BODY:
8:04 a.m. Updated
Harbinger Capital Partners, the hedge fund founded by Philip A. Falcone, could face civil action stemming from a federal investigation into whether the firm gave preferential treatment to Goldman Sachs, and other potential misdeeds.
Mr. Falcone received a Wells Notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, according to a regulatory filing by Harbinger. The agency typically takes such action when it is planning enforcement proceedings against a firm or individual. The notices were also sent to Omar Asali, Harbinger's president, and Robin Roger, the firm's general counsel. 
The inquiry into Harbinger comes amid increased scrutiny for the industry. In recent years, the S.E.C. and other federal authorities have pursued a broad range of cases against hedge funds, taking aim at insider trading and other violations.
The S.E.C has been investigating whether Harbinger agreed in 2009 to allow Goldman to withdraw up to $50 million from the firm, while not striking similar deals with other clients, according to people with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to talk publicly. At the time, Harbinger had limited investors from redeeming their assets because of the market turmoil during the financial crisis. Before joining Harbinger, Mr. Asali was co-head of Goldman's hedge fund strategy group, helping to steer client investments to outside managers, including Harbinger.
The government is also looking at the disclosure surrounding a $113 million personal loan that Harbinger made to Mr. Falcone in 2009, as well as possible market manipulation involving debt securities the firm traded from 2006 to 2008, according to the people.
In its filing, Harbinger said the notices focused on possible ''violations of the federal securities laws' antifraud provisions in connection with matters previously disclosed and an additional matter regarding the circumstances and disclosure related to agreements with certain fund investors.'' Harbinger said that it was ''disappointed'' about the notices, and that it would ''vigorously defend against'' any formal charges, according to the filing.
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.
With Harbinger already suffering from a wave of redemptions, the firm is taking new steps to limit withdrawals. Starting Dec. 30, Harbinger will bar investors from withdrawing money from four of its funds. Two of its portfolios, the Global Opportunities Breakaway Fund and China Dragon Fund, will still allow redemptions, according to one of the people familiar with the investigation.
Mr. Falcone, who founded Harbinger in 2001, made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the housing crisis. With his new fortune, he and his wife, Lisa Maria Falcone, quickly became prominent figures on the New York social scene. In 2008, Mr. Falcone bought a $49 million home once owned by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse magazine. A year later, the couple announced a $10 million gift to the High Line park in Manhattan, a former elevated train track converted into a public space.
Harbinger, which held more than $26 billion in assets at its peak, has been struggling of late. The firm now manages $5.66 billion.
LightSquared, a wireless broadband company that is Harbinger's primary investment, has become an albatross for Mr. Falcone.
He started the company in 2010 and planned to create a mobile network with frequencies that were originally used for satellite phones.
Those plans ran into trouble when some studies showed that the proposed network could interfere with global-positioning devices.
In January, the Federal Communications Commission gave LightSquared's plan tentative approval despite lingering questions about the possible interference.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, has taken aim at the LightSquared venture and the F.C.C.'s oversight of the plan. In September, a group of lawmakers drafted a letter that questioned certain elements of Mr. Falcone's plan.
Mr. Falcone has also faced criticism for telling investors this year that redemptions from some of Harbinger's funds would be paid in shares of LightSquared stock, rather than cash.
''While this does not mean the S.E.C. definitely will take action against Mr. Falcone and his hedge fund, it does show that the S.E.C. staff believes there is sufficient evidence to consider recommending an enforcement action,'' Mr. Grassley said of the Wells Notices in a statement Friday. ''Now the F.C.C. is faced with the real possibility that it made a multibillion-dollar grant of valuable spectrum to someone who could be charged with violating securities laws.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Communications Firms Agree to Buy Maple Leafs and Raptors

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JEFF Z. KLEIN; Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.

 BODY:
Rogers Communications and Bell Canada, two giant communications firms, said Friday that they would pay more than $1.3 billion Canadian, or about $1.2 billion American, for a controlling stake in Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, Canada's largest sports conglomerate. The assets of the conglomerate include the Toronto Maple Leafs of the N.H.L., the Raptors of the N.B.A. and the Air Canada Centre.
Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, is one of the largest sports businesses in the world, rivaling MSG in New York and AEG in Los Angeles. Forbes recently reported that the Maple Leafs were worth $521 million, easily the most valuable team in the N.H.L. The deal is one of the largest sports-related acquisitions in North American history. 
Rogers and Bell Canada, bitter rivals in the telecommunications and media industries, will each own 37.5 percent of M.L.S.E.
Larry Tanenbaum, the M.L.S.E. chairman, will raise his stake to 25 percent from 20 percent. M.L.S.E. will remain an independent company, and Rogers and Bell Canada will be able to provide broadcasts of Maple Leafs games and other games to their phone, television and Internet subscribers.
''I think our investment in the Maple Leafs is a perfect marriage of content and technology,'' said Nadir Mohamed, chief executive of Rogers, which also owns the Toronto Blue Jays. ''This is icing on the cake. This is access to iconic content.''
Mohamed said the Blue Jays would not be merged into M.L.S.E. George Cope, the chief executive of Bell Canada, said his company would continue to maintain its minority stake in the Montreal Canadiens.
The deal comes about two weeks after Ontario Teachers said it had ended an eight-month auction and was no longer seeking buyers. Several newspapers reported at the time that the deal had fallen apart partly because Rogers and Bell Canada could not agree on how to divide M.L.S.E., particularly its valuable television rights.
Other reports noted that Ontario Teachers, which held an auction for M.L.S.E. after it received several unsolicited bids, was willing to sell only if its target price was met. When Rogers and Bell Canada agreed to value M.L.S.E. at $2.1 billion Canadian, or about $1.7 billion American for an 80 percent stake, Ontario Teachers agreed to sell.
While the companies hope to complete the sale by next summer, the agreement is not a sure thing. Reports of a sale have surfaced at least twice, and there are regulatory hurdles to clear and league approvals to seek. After years of approving many large mergers, Canadian regulators are more aggressively scrutinizing proposed deals.
Bell Canada and Rogers are Canada's equivalent of AT&T and Verizon: they own the two biggest wireless carriers and the two largest Internet service providers. Rogers dominates the cable television business in Ontario, while Bell has a satellite television service and has recently been selling television service over a fiber optic network. Bell is Canada's largest private broadcaster. Both companies own sports channels.
Rogers's ownership of the Blue Jays and their stadium could cause concern with regulators fearful of the company's control of too many teams and arenas. (M.L.S.E. also owns Toronto F.C. of Major League Soccer and its stadium.) If regulators ask Rogers to sell the Blue Jays and their stadium, it could significantly slow the completion of the deal for M.L.S.E. The federal Competition Bureau in Ottawa said Friday that it would review the proposed acquisition.
The chief executives of the companies said they were confident regulators would approve the deal because it ensures that they would continue to compete. They noted the companies worked together during the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
Roger Ware, an economics professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, who specializes in competition issues, said the Competition Bureau was likely to look at the impact of the transaction on the live-sports-event market in Toronto. If the deal is approved, Rogers will own or control almost every major professional sports team based in the city. But Ware said the two companies could try to convince regulators that live sports are not a distinct market, because they compete against other forms of entertainment.
M.L.S.E. is a sprawling sports group, but the crown jewel is the Maple Leafs. The team had revenue of $193 million last year and operating income of $81.8 million, according to Forbes. The Maple Leafs have won 11 Stanley Cups, but none since 1967, the longest current drought in the N.H.L. They have missed the playoffs the last six seasons. Still, because they play in a hockey-mad area that is also the fifth-largest market in North America, they play to capacity crowds and have a long waiting list for season tickets. This season the club is second in the Northeast Division, having won 15 of 28 games.
M.L.S.E.'s other sports properties also have spotty records. The Raptors are less profitable than the Leafs and have made the playoffs only five times since their founding in 1995.
Toronto F.C. has played to capacity crowds at BMO Field since joining M.L.S. in 2006, but has yet to make the league's playoffs. The Leafs' minor league affiliate, the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League, are also part of the deal. They have played to small crowds at Ricoh Coliseum since they were founded in 2005.
Rogers owns the Rogers Centre, formerly called the SkyDome, where the Blue Jays and the Argonauts of the Canadian Football League play. Rogers has owned the Blue Jays since 2000; the team has not made the playoffs since winning the World Series in 1992 and 1993.
Rogers is also in the fourth year of a five-year deal to have the Buffalo Bills play a total of eight preseason and regular-season N.F.L. games at the Rogers Centre.

HEADLINE: With Lobbying Blitz, Profit-Making Colleges Diluted New Rules

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU; Barclay Walsh contributed research for this article.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Last year, the Obama administration vowed to stop for-profit colleges from luring students with false promises. In an opening volley that shook the $30 billion industry, officials proposed new restrictions to cut off the huge flow of federal aid to unfit programs.
But after a ferocious response that administration officials called one of the most intense they had seen, the Education Department produced a much-weakened final plan that almost certainly will have far less impact as it goes into effect next year.
The story of how the for-profit colleges survived the threat of a major federal crackdown offers a case study in Washington power brokering. Rattled by the administration's tough talk, the colleges spent more than $16 million on an all-star list of prominent figures, particularly Democrats with close ties to the White House, to plot strategy, mend their battered image and plead their case.
Anita Dunn, a close friend of President Obama and his former White House communications director, worked with Kaplan University, one of the embattled school networks. Jamie Rubin, a major fund-raising bundler for the president's re-election campaign, met with administration officials about ATI, a college network based in Dallas, in which Mr. Rubin's private-equity firm has a stake. 
A who's who of Democratic lobbyists -- including Richard A. Gephardt, the former House majority leader; John Breaux, the former Louisiana senator; and Tony Podesta, whose brother, John, ran Mr. Obama's transition team -- were hired to buttonhole officials.
And politically well-connected investors, including Donald E. Graham, chief executive of the Washington Post Company, which owns Kaplan, and John Sperling, founder of the University of Phoenix and a longtime friend of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, made impassioned appeals.
In all, industry advocates met more than two dozen times with White House and Education Department officials, including senior officials like Education Secretary Arne Duncan, records show, even as Mr. Obama has vowed to reduce the ''outsize'' influence of lobbyists and special interests in Washington.
The result was a plan, completed in June, that imposes new regulations on for-profit schools to ensure they adequately train their students for work, but does so on a much less ambitious scale than the administration first intended, relaxing the initial standards for determining which schools would be stripped of federal financing.
''The haranguing had zero effect,'' said Cass R. Sunstein, the White House official who oversees rule making. Rather, he and other administration officials said they listened to what they viewed as reasonable arguments and decided to narrow the scope of the original plan.
But Robert Shireman, a former Education Department official who helped shape that original plan, said the intense politics surrounding the issue played a part in ''watering down'' the final result.
''From early on, the industry was going to friends inside and out of the administration and saying, 'They're out to get us,' and creating the impression that these regulations were unfair or irrational,'' said Mr. Shireman, who left the department before the plan was finished.
''They decided to raise holy hell,'' he said in an interview.
Many colleges saw the federal government's attacks as ''Armageddon for the industry,'' said Avy Stein, a partner at a private equity fund that owns a network of schools called Education Corporation of America.
The industry was on the defensive after a series of federal investigations portrayed it as rife with abuse. They found that recruiters would lure students -- often members of minorities, veterans, the homeless and low-income people -- with promises of quick degrees and post-graduation jobs but often leave them poorly prepared and burdened with staggering federal loans.
In response to the rising concerns, 18 months ago the Obama administration proposed its tough restrictions linking tens of billions of dollars in federal student aid to formulas measuring students' debt levels and income after graduation. Colleges whose students were not earning enough money to start paying back their loans would be in danger of losing federal aid altogether.
The proposal was aimed at ensuring that the for-profit schools were providing ''gainful employment'' in a wide range of vocational fields they taught, like medical testing, massage therapy, business management and cosmetology. The joke in Washington, however, was that the industry effort to defeat the plan mainly ensured ''gainful employment'' for the capital's Democratic lobbyists and political consultants.
In a coordinated approach that also included Capitol Hill protests, petition drives, newspaper ads and more, industry advocates stressed that jobs that would be lost if the institutions were put out of business. They questioned why nonprofit schools were untouched. And they accused the administration of highlighting some abuses to stigmatize an industry that educates second-chance students shunned by traditional academia.
''It was a demonization of our sector,'' said Penny Lee, who leads an industry coalition and has extensive ties to Democratic politics as a former senior aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.
The industry's mobilization helped produce a record 90,000 public comments to the Education Department -- overwhelmingly negative -- on the proposed changes.
The battle got so testy that Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who has led Congressional hearings into the colleges, got into a heated exchange with Mr. Stein, the Education Corporation investor.
The senator said that during a hallway conversation after lunch in the Senate dining room, Mr. Stein promised to ''make life rough for me'' if Mr. Harkin kept up his attacks.
''I took it as a threat -- it was one of the most blatant comments ever made to me in my years in the Senate,'' Mr. Harkin said.
Mr. Stein, a frequent Democratic donor who had bought the lunch with the senator at a charity auction, would not discuss the details of the conversation. But he said Mr. Harkin's account was ''totally incorrect,'' adding: ''Under no circumstances would I would ever threaten a U.S. senator.''
Officials at the White House and the Education Department described the industry's aggressive efforts as unusual even by Washington standards. Mr. Sunstein, the White House official, characterized the intensity as ''extreme.''
That response reflected the enormous financial stakes for an industry that has become big business in the last decade, with online schools and traditional campuses offering degrees to about three million students. Schools receive as much as 90 percent of their revenues from federal aid.
Once small, local operations, many of the colleges are now multistate networks owned by Wall Street firms looking for big profits. Consumer groups sought tougher restrictions, but found themselves outmatched. Pauline Abernathy, vice president with the nonprofit Institute for College Access and Success and an industry critic, said: ''We always knew that we couldn't compete with the colleges in terms of money or lobbyists, but we thought we had the facts on our side.''
The colleges pushed back at critics, finding errors, for instance, in conclusions from a Government Accountability Office investigation last year, forcing the office to revise some of its statements about industry practices.
Schools also questioned the motives of a key witness at Mr. Harkin's hearings, the noted hedge-fund trader Steve Eisman, who blasted the colleges' sky-high profit margins and likened them to subprime mortgage lenders. After Mr. Eisman acknowledged he held financial positions in the industry, the colleges charged that he stood to make millions by battering their reputations and short-selling their stocks.
Ms. Dunn, the former White House aide hired by Kaplan, played a key role in helping shape the colleges' message.
In an interview, she said she worked to refute media reports casting the abuse problems as industrywide and to show they were limited to ''a few bad actors.''
While some people in the industry pushed to see the regulations killed altogether, she said that most executives realized that there were going to be regulations they had to live with'' and aimed to blunt the impact. While Ms. Dunn visited the White House about 80 times since leaving the administration, she said she was careful to avoid talking to former colleagues about the issue because she is not a lobbyist and such contact would violate the ethics policies put in place by Mr. Obama regarding lobbying by former advisers.
Tony Podesta, who met last May with White House officials and sent lobbyists at his firm to other meetings, faced no such restrictions. ''The administration realized they had overdone it,'' he said, ''and, wisely in my view, they took a second look.''
In the end, Mr. Duncan and his department, after working for months with White House budget, economic and domestic policy officials, decided that the initial criteria for determining how effectively schools prepared students for jobs simply went too far.
The original framework ''would have unnecessarily eliminated many, many good schools along with the bad,'' said Justin Hamilton, an Education Department spokesman.
The final standards leave a maximum of 5 percent of schools facing financial sanctions at the start; the original plan would have meant penalties against an estimated 16 percent.
The rules also pushed back the penalties to 2015 from 2012, while requiring schools to disclose more data about loans, defaults and job placement.
Donald Heller, a Penn State education professor who studied the plan, said the industry did largely what it set out to do.
''This was the beachhead the colleges were going to defend, and they were somewhat successful in that they got the regulations weakened,'' he said. ''The Department of Education really bent to the lobbying push.''

HEADLINE: House Republicans' Bill Sets Up Pipeline Battle

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans moved Friday toward a showdown with President Obama over the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which they included in their bill to extend tax relief for 160 million American workers through 2012.
Republicans said the pipeline would create jobs and had support from dozens of Democrats in Congress. And they welcomed the opportunity to split two Democratic constituencies: labor union members who stand to benefit from work on the pipeline and environmentalists, who oppose the project.
The House Republican bill, scheduled for a vote next week on the House floor, would deal with three urgent issues: extending a payroll tax cut scheduled to expire next month; continuing jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed; and averting a 27 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors that would otherwise occur on Jan. 1. 
The bill, unveiled Friday, would also block certain air pollution rules and eliminate more than $20 billion of spending planned under Mr. Obama's new health care law.
In November, the Obama administration deferred a decision on the Keystone project until after the 2012 election, citing a need to examine alternative routes that would avoid the Sand Hills region of Nebraska. This week Mr. Obama came close to threatening a veto of legislation that combines the payroll tax cut with ''extraneous issues'' like the pipeline.
Republicans in both houses of Congress are pushing for immediate approval of the pipeline, which would run from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. They say it would enhance America's energy security and create jobs for tens of thousands of people.
The House Republican bill directs the president, acting through the secretary of state, to grant a permit for the pipeline within 60 days. But it gives the president an escape hatch: He does not have to grant the permit if he finds that the Keystone pipeline ''would not serve the national interest.''
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, warned Friday, ''If the House sends us their bill with Keystone in it, they are just wasting valuable time because it will not pass the Senate.''
In July, the House passed a bill directing the president to decide on the pipeline by Nov. 1. The bill was approved by a vote of 279 to 147, with 47 Democrats supporting it.
The sponsor of that bill, Representative Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, said Friday that he was ''pretty ecstatic'' to see the pipeline provision in the bill put together this week by Speaker John A. Boehner.
But Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, called on House Republicans to drop the pipeline provision of their bill. The government, she said, needs more time to study the effects of the project on public health and safety.
In a letter to Congressional leaders, more than 30 environmental groups complained that Republicans were trying to force approval of the pipeline ''with almost no review of how it would affect water supplies and other public resources.'' The League of Conservation Voters said, ''We strongly applaud President Obama for standing up to Big Oil's allies in Congress who are leading a back-door attempt to advance the pipeline.''
Amaya Tune, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the labor federation had not taken a position on the pipeline legislation. But some of its affiliates -- including the building and construction trades department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Laborers' International Union of North America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- strongly support the pipeline.
In a recent advertisement, they said: ''America's trade unionists are the safest, best-trained and most environmentally responsible workers in the world. They can do the job right, and that's why we back the Keystone XL pipeline 100 percent.''
At a public hearing last week, David Barnett, a spokesman for the plumbers and pipefitters union, told Congress that the pipeline could ''generate a tremendous number of well-paying jobs'' for construction workers, who have experienced extraordinarily high levels of unemployment in the past few years.
The House Republican bill would keep the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax at its current level, 4.2 percent of wages, through 2012. It would increase Medicare payment rates for doctors by 1 percent a year in 2012 and 2013. And it would reduce the maximum duration of unemployment insurance benefits to 59 weeks, from the current 99.
A memorandum circulated by Mr. Boehner's office described 59 weeks of benefits as similar to the amount provided in past recessions and economic downturns, and said, ''American taxpayers cannot subsidize benefits for an unprecedented, unending period of time.''
But Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the proposal on unemployment insurance was ''worse than expected'' and would do the most harm to people in states with prolonged high levels of unemployment.

HEADLINE: Seeking An Endorsement: Perry Stumbles On Number of Justices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Mitt Romney and Rick Perry both appeared before The Des Moines Register editorial board on Friday, hoping for an endorsement by the influential newspaper in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses. 
For Mr. Perry, an endorsement could help him realize the promise that his campaign once held in the state. Recent polls have shown him lagging badly behind Mr. Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.
Mr. Perry's performance during the editorial board meeting -- which was broadcast live over the Internet -- may not have helped him.
At one point, Mr. Perry could not name Justice Sonia Sotomayor, referring to her as ''Montemayor.'' Then, a few minutes later, he misstated the number of justices on the Supreme Court.
''For Washington to tell a local school district that you cannot have a prayer and a time of prayer in that school is, I think, offensive to most Americans,'' Mr. Perry said. ''I trust the people of the states to make those decisions. I trust those independent school districts to make those decisions better than eight unelected, and frankly, unaccountable judges.''
There have been nine members on the Supreme Court since the middle of the 19th century.
Mr. Romney used his appearance before the editorial board to continue contrasting his record with Mr. Gingrich's.
He said Mr. Gingrich had spent his life ''in Washington,'' adding that ''there's nothing wrong with that -- it's just different.''
Mr. Romney pointed out differences with Mr. Gingrich over immigration policy, child labor law, economic policy, climate change and others. And he also pointed out some of the more wacky ideas that Mr. Gingrich had floated over the years.
He said that Mr. Gingrich had once suggested a permanent colony on the moon and building mirrors in space that could illuminate the nation's highways.
''I think we've got some other priorities,'' Mr. Romney said.
The Register is the state's largest newspaper, but it does not have a perfect track record when it comes to picking the winner of the Iowa caucuses. In 2008, the paper endorsed Senator John McCain of Arizona for the Republican nomination and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as the Democratic nominee. Both lost in Iowa and Ms. Clinton ended up losing the nomination.
The paper usually reveals its endorsements a few weeks before the voting, which will take place on Jan. 3.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Reality and Re-election Sharpen Obama's Zigzags

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama thrilled liberals on Tuesday when, blending Theodore Roosevelt with Occupy Wall Street, he renewed his commitment to temper untrammeled, ''you're on your own'' capitalism.
The very next day, he alarmed some of the same liberals when his administration overruled the Food and Drug Administration to block over-the-counter sale of emergency contraceptives to young teenagers.
It is not the first time Mr. Obama has sent such divergent signals in the tumultuous third year of his presidency. Last month, he sided with environmental activists in delaying a decision on whether to permit construction of the Keystone XL pipeline that would carry oil down to the Gulf of Mexico from Canada.
That was after the president, in September, angered the same constituency by deferring new Environmental Protection Agency smog regulations until 2013. In talks on a deficit-reduction ''grand bargain'' over the summer, he entertained raising the retirement age and curbing Social Security benefits -- then shelved that, and blasted Republicans for refusing to accept higher taxes on affluent Americans. 
In part, these decisions reflect every president's obligation to take up some fights but not others, to gratify core supporters most of the time but selectively challenge them in the name of reaching a wider audience. President George W. Bush roiled his base on education, Medicare and bailouts while doggedly advancing conservative goals on taxes and national security.
Yet with Mr. Obama the dissonant chords have sometimes been amplified by the scale of possibilities he has embodied. From his national debut at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, he held out the promise of unifying ''blue America'' and ''red America'' even while embracing mainstream Democratic liberalism.
Now, a shrinking set of political options has thrown his attempts to balance ideology and pragmatic compromise into sharper relief as he girds for a daunting 2012 re-election campaign.
First to go, in 2009, was the aspiration for transformation in Washington itself. The partisan divide over economic stimulus, health care and financial regulation made clear Mr. Obama's accomplishments would come almost solely from the Democratic majorities in Congress.
In 2010, midterm elections cost him that lever. Afterward, he adapted by striking a tax-cut compromise with the Republican leaders who suddenly shared power with him.
But the White House effort to build on that breakthrough to forge a long-term budget deal with House Speaker John A. Boehner crashed amid resistance from the Republican rank and file to Mr. Obama's conception of fairness and balance. That led to Mr. Obama's speech this week in Kansas calling the struggles of middle-class Americans ''the defining issue of our time'' -- and casting Republicans on the side of the economy's ''winners.''
Mr. Obama's situation bears some resemblance to that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal sought to end the Great Depression. Yet this speech invoked Theodore Roosevelt's effort to tame boom-time excesses of business and the wealthy for an ''economic system in which man shall be guaranteed the opportunity to show the best that there is in him.''
Conservative adversaries see his new formulation -- which bluntly called supply-side economics a failure -- as a weakened president's shift toward partisanship and populism that vilifies the rich in the wake of Occupy Wall Street protests.
Mr. Obama's advisers insist only the reference points have changed. In 2004, he slammed the ''politics of cynicism'' in the name of lifting the middle class; three years later, the presidential candidate Obama promised a Wall Street audience an administration that ''believes in your success'' while creating ''a framework in which all can succeed''; on Monday he called such an approach ''about the nation's welfare,'' not ''class warfare.''
''You can draw a straight line from the 2004 convention speech, to the 2007 speech at Nasdaq, to the Kansas speech,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's top political adviser.
Nor, he added, had the president's call for ''balanced'' deficit reduction changed now that he is making it in campaign-style jibes at Republicans rather than private negotiations.
That shift of venue ''was tactical, it wasn't philosophical,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The case hasn't changed. The case is the same.''
Aligning himself with the first President Roosevelt's progressive Republicanism underscores Mr. Obama's case that today's Republicans have shifted toward Gilded Age laissez-faire policies. And declaring today's iteration of progressivism a fight against a generation-long trend of income inequality allows him to point beyond the economic record of his own presidency.
''The long arc of the middle-class squeeze,'' noted the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''extends the time frame'' for voters' evaluation. Ms. Goodwin, who is working on a book about Theodore Roosevelt, discussed the parallels with Mr. Obama at a private dinner the White House arranged with historians earlier this year.
Mr. Obama's focus on middle class travails tracks the themes of every recent Democratic campaign. In 1992, two decades into the stagnation of middle-class incomes, Bill Clinton's nomination acceptance speech condemned Republican ''forces of greed'' that had ''raised taxes on the people driving pickup trucks and lowered taxes on the people riding in limousines.'' Now that stagnation is four decades old.
The new presumed Republican presidential front-runner, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, recently praised Mr. Clinton's negotiating skills even while he excoriated Mr. Obama as a radical. William Galston, a Democrat who has often criticized administration strategy, sees instead ''a pragmatic flexibility'' born of indifference to some crucial details and a desire to limit political problems.
''I might even see him as less ideological than Clinton,'' said Mr. Galston, a former domestic policy director in the Clinton White House. ''His focus was on a unifying national narrative rather than left, right or center.''
Mr. Obama's imperative to reduce political problems has grown as his path to re-election has narrowed.
The decision on emergency contraceptives, whatever its substantive merits, blunted a potential Republican opportunity to strike on social issues.
Delaying smog regulations averted economic and political fallout in crucial states like North Carolina. Delaying the approval of the pipeline to Texas from Canada quelled an uprising by environmentalists.
If that pattern of decision defies easy categorization, that hardly distinguishes Mr. Obama from his predecessors.
''Remember what they said about Franklin Roosevelt -- 'a chameleon on plaid'?'' recalled Robert Dallek, another of the historians Mr. Obama consulted over dinner. ''That's what any president has to be to succeed.''

HEADLINE: Perry Survived Even as His Big Plan for Texas Failed

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG; Emily Ramshaw contributed reporting from Austin, and Jim Rutenberg from New York.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- In the bachelor-style apartment of his legislative years, where Rick Perry liked ''to kick back and watch football with a cold one,'' the future Texas governor forged a lasting bond with a hard-charging roommate who preferred smoking a pipe, studying flip charts and strategizing.
Over time, that friend, Ric Williamson, an oilman known as Nitro, would become ''the intellectual guru of Team Perry,'' as one colleague put it, and steward of the governor's boldest initiative and biggest failure, the $175 billion Trans-Texas Corridor.
Unveiled by Mr. Perry in early 2002, the public-private transit project was intended as a centerpiece of his governorship, ''a plan as big as Texas and as ambitious as our people,'' he said, to create 4,000 miles of road, rail and utility corridors each as wide as four football fields. 
But neither Mr. Perry nor Mr. Williamson anticipated just how politically toxic the mammoth toll road plan would become or envisioned tractors advancing on the Capitol with signs like ''Rick & Ric, Our Land is Not Your Land.''
When Mr. Williamson died suddenly in late 2007, their venture all but died with him. Shortly before announcing his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination this summer, Mr. Perry quietly signed a bill erasing all mention of the Trans-Texas Corridor from Texas statute.
''He had to bury his own baby,'' said Paul Burka, senior executive editor of The Texas Monthly.
For many here, the epic battle over the corridor epitomizes how Mr. Perry operates -- from his self-image as a business visionary and his hands-off management style to his interdependent relationship with an insular cadre of old friends and what critics call the pay-to-play culture of his administration.
It also shows his ability to weather controversy. Whether by political calculation or deference, Mr. Perry's designation of Mr. Williamson as the point man for this project helped him avoid repercussions at the polls. ''He's a Teflon governor, I guess,'' said Dick Kallerman, a Texas environmentalist.
By the end, opposition to the project had united environmentalists and ranchers, big cities and small towns, Democrats and even Mr. Perry's own Republican Party.
For conservatives, the plan, which would have required vast land seizures, represented a political misfire akin to his executive order mandating the HPV vaccine for girls. They saw both as government overreach -- trampling parental rights with the vaccine and property rights with the corridor.
''Perry speaks about getting government out of our lives but that's not what he has practiced,'' said Ken Emanuelson, a Tea Party organizer in Dallas. ''We usually say it as a metaphor that the state of Texas is for sale, but with respect to the Trans-Texas Corridor the ground was literally for sale.''
Transportation industry executives say Texas was singularly aggressive in pursuit of private financing of public projects. At meetings where firms were courted, state officials draped a big banner, ''Texas: Open for Business,'' and some were urged to support the governor with more than just business proposals.
''You'd get hit up by the state at the same time as they were trying to bid out public assets,'' said a consultant who represents a European company and spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his client.
The consultant said Mr. Perry's representatives solicited a $100,000 contribution to a group called Texans for Safe Reliable Transportation, saying, ''It will be good for the governor and good for you.''
''My client was aghast,'' he said.
Ray Sullivan, a campaign spokesman for Mr. Perry who was involved with the corridor advocacy group, said, ''I don't believe those conversations ever took place.''
Mr. Sullivan acknowledged that the group, headed by a former senior adviser to Governor Perry named Bill Noble, courted ''those interested in infrastructure development.'' But, he said, ''Neither myself nor anyone who made those pitches were involved in procurement.''
The transportation group, established to promote ''market-based transportation solutions,'' reported $345,590 in membership dues in 2006, its first year. Mr. Noble said that members paid $2,500 to $25,000, and that Cintra, the Spanish firm that won the initial corridor contract, was ''at a higher level of membership but not our largest contributor.''
''The characterization that there was some sort of quid pro quo or pay-to-play is not accurate,'' he said.
A Grand Vision
When Mr. Perry inherited the governorship from President-elect George W. Bush in late 2000, many considered him an accidental governor. Some believed that the Trans-Texas Corridor was born of his desire to lay claim to an issue, as his predecessor had done with education.
Even before becoming governor, Mr. Perry had discussed the state's aging roads as a hindrance to economic development with Mr. Williamson and State Representative Mike Krusee. They debated how to finance new highways without raising the gas tax.
''Williamson lived in the world of ideas and he wasn't happy unless dreaming up new ones,'' said Mr. Krusee, now a lobbyist. ''Perry wasn't like that. But Perry was a better implementer. So Williamson became like the intellectual guru of Team Perry.''
In 2001, Mr. Perry appointed Mr. Williamson to the Transportation Commission, later naming him chairman. The two friends were also financially entwined. Mr. Perry owned, and still owns, a working interest in Mr. Williamson's MKS Natural Gas Company (which his widow, Mary Ann, also a governor's appointee as Lottery Commission chairwoman, now runs).
The following year, Mr. Perry introduced the outsize corridor idea during his first run for governor; it presaged his predilection as a presidential candidate for tossing out radical proposals, like making Congress part-time.
Few Texans took the Trans-Texas Corridor seriously. But Mr. Williamson, and the Transportation Department, ran with it, developing a detailed plan to get private companies to finance and build a spider web of transportation corridors in exchange for long-term operating leases and future toll revenues.
In 2003, after Republicans gained control of the Texas House for the first time since Reconstruction, Mr. Krusee became chairman of the Transportation Committee and set about designing the complex legislation.
Mr. Williamson suggested an omnibus transportation bill to avoid having each of the many statutory changes required ''die the death of a thousand cuts,'' said John Langmore, a lawyer hired to draft the bill.
''Every move was his,'' Mr. Langmore said. ''Perry just turned Ric Williamson loose and gave the nod.''
The 2003 legislative session during which Mr. Krusee introduced the corridor blueprint was tumultuous because of a Republican-drawn Congressional redistricting plan that prompted scores of Democratic legislators to decamp temporarily to Oklahoma.
Eventually, the bill passed -- unanimously. But it was 350 pages long, few legislators had read it thoroughly, and many said later they felt deceived by its scope.
''We were bamboozled,'' said State Representative Garnet F. Coleman, a Democrat. ''Members always support transportation. What they didn't realize was that this was a total redo of the system and mostly about privatization. It was a money-making operation for Perry's friends in perpetuity.''
Roadblocks
In mid-2002, in their farmhouse in Fayette County, Linda and David Stall, small-town Republicans, were probably among the first Texans to read the original corridor plan, ''Crossroads of the Americas.''
Among other things, what truly horrified them was the realization that the corridors were going to rip through the heart of rural Texas and require 146 acres of right of way for every mile of road -- or 584,000 acres total.
''I flipped,'' Mrs. Stall said. ''I looked out my window and saw people going about their lives who had no idea what Rick Perry had in store for them.''
She and her husband created a Web site, Corridor Watch. They bird-dogged public hearings and visited Chambers of Commerce and Lions and Rotary Clubs, putting 200,000 miles on their truck.
One of their most effective propaganda tools came from the state Transportation Department -- an illustration of a quarter-mile-wide corridor with 10 highway lanes adjacent to six rail lines and dedicated utility zones.
''That rendering freaked everybody out,'' Mr. Krusee said.
Mr. Langmore said, ''All of us were like, 'What on earth are they doing showing that?' Can you imagine a farmer sitting on his ranch thinking of a 1,200-foot-wide corridor hacked through the middle of it?''
Scott Ging sat on his century-old family ranch in Williamson County and thought about just that. He imagined the corridor splitting his land, with no crossings ''and for no good reason.''
''Traffic is not that bad in Texas; if we have to wait 10 or 15 seconds to get on the highway, that's a traffic jam,'' Mr. Ging said. ''The idea that they would take our land and give it to somebody else to make a profit on it -- I don't know how Perry thought that would ever fly.''
While anti-toll road groups sprang up and environmentalists forged alliances of convenience with landowners, the governor and his advisers consistently misread and underestimated the opposition.
Mr. Kallerman, of the Sierra Club, said that Mr. Williamson had summoned environmentalists to convince them that the project, with its trains, was environmentally friendly.
''We just kind of sat there stunned,'' Mr. Kallerman said. ''I mean, it was going to eat up huge amounts of the best growing land in Texas, go right through habitats and over aquifers, encourage more rubber-tire travel, foster urban sprawl and make our air quality even worse. We shook our heads and said, 'This is total madness.' ''
By June 2004, Mr. Perry's own Republican Party had called for the repeal of the Trans-Texas Corridor. In early December that year, the Texas Farm Bureau, his longtime ally, voted to oppose it at its convention while Mr. Perry, anticipating a different outcome, waited in the wings to speak.
A Project Is Stopped
Still, Mr. Perry was ebullient in mid-December when Texas accepted a proposal from a consortium led by the Spanish firm Cintra to start work on the project. He proclaimed it ''one of the most significant days in the history of transportation'' and said future generations would appreciate ''what a visionary group of people were leading this state.''
Then Time magazine ran an article under the headline: ''The Next Wave in Superhighways or A Big Fat Texas Boondoggle?''
And local newspapers soon revealed that Mr. Perry's legislative director, Dan Shelley, had worked for Cintra until three months before the firm was selected. (Mr. Shelley, as a lobbyist, also worked for the company after leaving the governor's office.)
Mr. Williamson said at the time that Cintra got no special preference. Clearly, though, the universe was a close-knit one.
Rossanna Salazar, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry as agriculture commissioner, became Cintra's spokeswoman in Texas; Mr. Langmore, a Democrat who drafted the corridor legislation, helped Cintra prepare its bid proposal.
The contract gave $3.5 million to Cintra and a local partner, Zachry Construction Company, to create a master development plan. They would also get first negotiating rights on up to $400 million in toll road work once the master plan was approved.
In 2005, the Texas Legislature, which meets every two years, reconvened and members tried but failed to scale back the project. It was, however, the beginning of the unraveling.
The next year, when Mr. Perry found himself in essentially a four-way battle for re-election, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, the Republican comptroller who ran against him as an independent (and as ''one tough grandma''), repeatedly railed against ''the largest land grab in Texas history.'' It had an impact; Mr. Perry won but with only 39 percent of the vote.
During the 2007 legislative session, rallies brought protesting farmers to the Capitol and raucous environmental impact hearings drew hundreds. The filmmaker William H. Molina tracked the opposition for his documentary ''Truth Be Tolled,'' and Johnny Tex and the Texicans recorded the rollicking ''Trans-Texas Corridor Blues,'' crooning about ''the greedy politicians'' who want to ''line their pockets.''
Mr. Perry, like other politicians in Texas and elsewhere, has long received campaign contributions from transportation-related businesses. Cintra, as a foreign firm, cannot make direct contributions; Zachry donated $125,000 from 2003 to 2008 when bids were sought on corridor projects, according to Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group.
Other contractors involved in the consortium contributed, too, and Mr. Perry netted $354,450 all told, the group said.
In the State Capitol, legislators began pushing back, voting overwhelmingly for a moratorium on public-private toll road projects.
Excoriating the Legislature, Mr. Perry vetoed the moratorium, and a weaker version was then passed, exempting projects already under way. Those included a 41-mile stretch of State Highway 130 southeast of Austin that Cintra and Zachry had won the right to build and collect tolls on for 50 years (a continuing $1.35 billion project large in its own right but dwarfed by Mr. Perry's original plan).
But the deep unpopularity of the project had become clear to all.
''The Trans-Texas Corridor became almost like a Rorschach test for statewide politics,'' said Chris Steinbach, chief of staff for Representative Lois W. Kolkhorst, a Republican and a leading opponent. ''People saw in it what they wanted -- property rights violations, cronyism. Opponents of Nafta viewed it as an artery into the interior of Mexico. There was also a nationalist view about a foreign company being allowed to control our land.''
On Dec. 30, 2007, Mr. Williamson, having already suffered two heart attacks,, suffered a fatal one at 55. Mr. Perry had relied on him to wage the battle, not only because he trusted him but because Mr. Williamson guarded the governor against political splatter.
''Now, nobody else was going to go out and spread the gospel and face the hostility, so it kind of ended,'' Mr. Burka said.
In 2009, the Transportation Department director acknowledged that the project once declared unstoppable had been stopped. Texas formally notified the federal highway department, and on that day, Mr. Perry tersely offered his own remarks on his grand plan's demise during a visit to Brownsville.
''If anybody has any new ways to build roads, any ways to fund them, we'd love to hear them,'' he said, with a tight laugh. ''I think we know there is not an asphalt fairy that will come in the middle of the night and'' -- he paused, signaling Poof! -- ''roads will appear.''

HEADLINE: German Vision Prevails As European Leaders Agree on Fiscal Treaty

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and STEPHEN CASTLE; Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Mark Landler and Annie Lowrey from Washington, Rachel Donadio from Rome, and James Kanter from Brussels.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Europe's worst financial crisis in generations is forging a new European Union, pushing Britain to the sidelines and creating a more integrated, fiscally disciplined core of nations under the auspices of a resurgent Germany.
Exactly 20 years to the day after European leaders signed the treaty that led to the creation of the European Union and the euro currency, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany persuaded every current member of the union except Britain to endorse a new agreement calling for tighter regional oversight of government spending. The accord, approved at a summit meeting in Brussels early on Friday, would allow the European Court of Justice to strike down a member's laws if they violate fiscal discipline.
''It's interesting to note that 20 years later we have realized -- we have succeeded -- in creating a more stable foundation for that economic and monetary union,'' Mrs. Merkel said, adding, ''and in so doing we've advanced political union and have attended to weaknesses that were included in the system.'' 
The agreement was a clear victory for Mrs. Merkel, and it prompted a sharp rally in stock markets in Europe and the United States. But it is viewed as unlikely to calm fears that Europe is unwilling to muster the financial firepower to defend the sovereign debts of big member states, including Italy and Spain, that have little or no economic growth and have big debt bills coming due soon.
At the meeting, member governments agreed to raise up to $270 billion that could be used by the International Monetary Fund to aid indebted European governments, and they moved up the date that a European rescue fund would come into operation. But the sums involved fell well short of what many investors and some Obama administration officials have argued are needed to ensure the survival of the euro. Administration officials on Friday welcomed the long-term overhaul of the euro zone's rules, but argued that stronger measures were needed in the short run.
Germany has argued that the solution to the euro crisis is not a series of short-term bailouts but a long-term overhaul of the rules that govern European integration. Germany is using market turmoil as a cudgel to force more spendthrift European countries to adjust to their straitened circumstances by reducing spending and ushering in a period of austerity. But critics say such steps risk a deep recession.
The European Union emerged in its current form in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a French-German idea to bind the region in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse. It is now being reinvented by a united Germany that has grown disillusioned by what it considers as debt-happy neighbors and is no longer reticent about wielding its economic and political clout.
The big loser in Brussels was Britain, which had endorsed the 1991 Maastricht Treaty on European integration but opted out of the new euro common currency to preserve its economic and monetary independence.
Prime Minister David Cameron, a Conservative and self-acknowledged ''euroskeptic,'' was isolated in his refusal to allow the German prescription of ''more Europe'' -- to give teeth to fiscal pledges underpinning the euro.
Mr. Cameron was perceived as having made a poor gamble in opposing the push by Mrs. Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, embittering relations and possibly damaging his standing at home. Though some other countries, including Denmark and Hungary, initially shared Britain's skepticism of the German-led agreement, only Britain ultimately rejected it.
The new disciplinary rules may help ensure that there will not be another euro crisis, but they may not be sufficient to fix the current crisis -- to assuage market unease that Europe and the European Central Bank are not doing enough now to stand behind vulnerable nations.
While some progress was made here in increasing the size of the bailout funds to help the most heavily indebted states, it is still considered inadequate. That is largely because Germany refuses to sanction the use of the European Central Bank as a lender of last resort for the countries in the euro zone.
The leaders sent an important signal to the bond markets by scrapping a pledge to make private investors absorb losses in any future bailout for a euro nation. But they made only limited progress in increasing the financial backstop to vulnerable and core nations like Italy and Spain, which are paying unsustainable interest rates on their bonds.
What worries many is the size of the euro zone debts that must be refinanced early next year. Euro zone governments have to repay more than 1.1 trillion euros, nearly $1.5 trillion, of long- and short-term debt in 2012, with about 519 billion euros, or $695 billion, of Italian, French and German debt maturing in the first half alone, according to Bloomberg News.
But the new Italian prime minister, the economist Mario Monti, was more upbeat. He pointed to an increase in the firewall and in economic responsibility and said that the idea of collective bonds was not dead, despite continuing German and French opposition.
''Euro bonds, for which a tomb without flowers was being prepared, are not named'' but will be raised again in March, he said. ''There is more money, there is more discipline, it could be that this isn't enough, but it doesn't seem to be a failed summit.''
Mrs. Merkel said the crisis had provided important new lessons for how to restructure Europe. ''We will use the crisis as a chance for a new beginning.''
In Brussels, much of the attention was on Mr. Cameron's failure to get what he wanted or to stop other leaders from getting what they wanted.
Britain threatened to veto Germany's proposal for a full treaty applying to all 27 members of the European Union. That pushed Germany and France to create an intergovernmental agreement that accelerates the move toward European consolidation, but will leave Britain out.
British hopes to lead an alliance of the 10 union members that do not use the euro were dashed. Mr. Cameron failed to bring along allies among the Nordic or ex-Communist nations whose membership in the bloc Britain had championed and who are usually regarded as more Atlanticist and favorable to free markets.
European officials argued that Mr. Cameron had in effect fallen into a French trap, making demands that most of his colleagues felt were unrelated to the euro zone crisis at issue. France has long desired an inner European core based on the countries that use the euro and excluding the free-market British.
''It's a turning point,'' said one senior European official. ''Britain kept thinking that enlargement of the E.U. would make it come its way but it has turned out to weaken us.''
The official spoke with some sadness. ''By being so isolated and raising these issues, but failing to deliver, Cameron is in a worse position than if he hadn't flagged them in the first place. It will strengthen the hand of British euroskeptics who will be emboldened to demand a renegotiation of British membership terms and a referendum.''
Mr. Cameron requested concessions meant to secure the position of Britain's financial services sector from the impact of European legislation and to ensure that the City of London would not lose out in rules that give an advantage to euro zone financial centers. But others, led by Mr. Sarkozy, said they would not be held hostage to the services that many blame for the crisis.
Mr. Sarkozy also said he was tired of British criticism of the handling of the crisis. ''I am sick of hearing every day David criticizing us,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, according to one official briefed on the discussions. On Friday, as the summit meeting was breaking up, Mr. Sarkozy snubbed Mr. Cameron, brushing past his outstretched hand.
British officials played down the significance of the meeting, saying that the outcome ensured that the government would have not have to seek a politically contentious ratification of a treaty at home. But one official acknowledged that the government would now have to assess the outcome and draw up a strategy.

HEADLINE: Labor Board Drops Case Against Boeing After Union Reaches Accord

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The National Labor Relations Board announced on Friday that it was dropping its politically charged case against Boeing, in which it had accused the company of violating federal labor law by opening a new aircraft production plant in South Carolina instead of Washington State.
The labor board's acting general counsel, Lafe Solomon, said he had decided to end the case after the union that represents 31,000 Boeing workers in Washington urged the board to withdraw it. That union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, had originally asked the board to file the case, but changed its mind after striking a deal with Boeing last week to raise wages and expand jet production in Washington. 
The political conflagration ignited by the case will not be extinguished so easily.
After Mr. Solomon brought the case in April, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates called it a prime example of regulatory overreach by the Obama administration, arguing that federal officials should not be telling companies where they can or cannot build factories. Congress held hearings and demanded thousands of pages of documents. The case also enraged South Carolina officials, who saw it as an insult to one of their greatest economic development achievements.
On Friday, many of those critics said that although they were happy to see the case dropped, they would press forward with attempts to hobble the board, which oversees efforts by private sector employees to unionize and bargain collectively and seeks to ensure that neither unions nor employers violate the laws governing such activities. The board's five members and top staff officials are appointed by the president.
Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and champion of the Boeing plant in his state, said, ''I'm pleased to hear the frivolous complaint that has put a cloud over their operations has been lifted.''
But Mr. Graham said he would continue to place an indefinite hold on any of President Obama's nominations to the National Labor Relations Board, a stance he adopted after the board filed its case against Boeing. The board has only three members now and will drop to two in January, so the blocking of new nominees would leave it with too few members to issue rulings in future cases.
In the Boeing case, Mr. Solomon asserted that Boeing's decision to build its $750 million Dreamliner factory in South Carolina constituted illegal retaliation against the machinists' members in Washington for having exercised their federally protected right to strike. He cited public statements by Boeing officials about the machinists' militancy in Washington State as one piece of evidence in the case, although Boeing officials said that lower costs were their major reason for choosing South Carolina.
After months of sharp rhetoric, Boeing and the machinists announced a surprise agreement on a new contract last week. Last week, Local 751 of the machinists' union announced that 74 percent of its Boeing workers in Washington State had voted to ratify a four-year contract extension that included substantial raises, unusual job security provisions and Boeing's commitment to expand aircraft production in the Puget Sound area.
The union then asked the labor board to withdraw the case.
Mr. Solomon said he was delighted that Boeing and the union had settled their dispute. ''The case was always about the loss of future jobs in the Seattle area,'' he said. ''This agreement has resolved that issue. There is job security in the Washington area.''
He said the board's goal was always to promote the resolution of disputes through collective bargaining, adding that filing the Boeing case had helped lead to such a settlement.
''This is the outcome we always preferred, and that is typical for our agency,'' Mr. Solomon said in a telephone news conference.
Boeing applauded the board's withdrawal of the case.
''We have maintained from the outset that the complaint was without merit and that the best course of action would be for it to be dropped,'' said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman. ''Boeing is grateful for the overwhelming support we received from across the country to vigorously contest this complaint and support the legitimate rights of businesses to make business decisions.''
In the case, the labor board had asked a judge to order Boeing to move its three-plane-a-month South Carolina production line to Washington State.
Mr. Solomon said critics had misconstrued the board's intentions. ''This case was never about the union or the N.L.R.B. telling Boeing where it could put its plants,'' he said. ''This was a question for us of retaliation, and that remains the law.''
He said that if the labor board were ever faced with a similar situation, ''we might well issue a complaint.''
Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the board's decision to drop the case, but added, ''More needs to be done to prevent this outrageous overreach in the future.''
He added that employers remained concerned about other board actions, like a pending rule to speed up unionization elections.
Charles Craver, a labor law professor at George Washington University, predicted that business groups and Republican lawmakers would ''continue to be full speed ahead with their attacks on the N.L.R.B. I think the Republicans will continue to block anyone Obama names for the board.''
The labor board will drop to two members from the current three when the term of a Democratic recess appointee, Craig Becker, expires later this month. The Supreme Court ruled last year that when the five-member board dwindled to fewer than three members, it could no longer rule on any cases.
Underlining Republicans' continuing dismay with the board, Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota and chairman of the House Education and the Work Force Committee, vigorously urged the Senate on Friday to approve a bill already passed in the House that would bar the labor board from ever again filing a case against a company over where it located a plant. He called the Boeing case ''a shameless campaign to bully an American employer.''

HEADLINE: BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe: A Swept-Back Response to Audi A7 and Mercedes-Benz CLS

BYLINE: NICK KURCZEWSKI


HIGHLIGHT: Not to be left behind in the luxury four-door-coupe craze, BMW introduced its own take in a Web reveal Saturday. 

 BODY:
With the introduction of the 6 Series Gran Coupe, BMW joins a growing list of companies, mostly German, offering swept-back sedans with coupelike silhouettes. Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Volkswagen got there before the 2013 sedan, which is scheduled to go on sale in the United States next summer. The Gran Coupe joins the recently updated 6 Series convertible and coupe models, both of which went on sale earlier this year.
By adding an extra set of doors, BMW is intent on luring style-conscious customers who desire the space and utility of a sedan. Compared with the standard coupe's dimensions, the overall length and wheelbase have each been stretched about four inches. The extra wheelbase should increase rear-seat comfort and legroom. Cargo space in the trunk is unchanged, at 16.2 cubic feet.
Like the rest of the 6 Series range, the Gran Coupe is based on the same platform as the brand's flagship 7 Series sedan. Yet the Gran Coupe is more than two inches shorter and, more significantly for high-speed stability, four inches lower than the 7 Series.
The current 6 Series has managed to smooth over many of the bumps and ridges of the controversially styled first generation, a trend upheld by the new sedan. A massive hood still dominates, though the Gran Coupe's roofline tapers more gracefully toward the trunk lip. Sharp character lines along the flanks add some visual tension.
BMW will initially offer the Gran Coupe as three separate models. The automaker's TwinPower turbo 6-cylinder engine appears under the hood of the standard 640i Gran Coupe. Despite the name, the 3-liter in-line 6-cylinder unit packs but one turbocharger. It's still good for 315 horsepower between 5,800-6,000 r.p.m. and 330 pound-feet of torque available between 1,300-4,500 r.p.m. BMW estimates the 640i is capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in 5.4 seconds.
Moving up the performance ladder, the TwinPower turbo V-8 is standard in the 650i and the all-wheel-drive 650i xDrive Gran Coupe, which are scheduled to be rolled out shortly after the 640i. Compared to the current 6 Series coupe and convertible, BMW engineers have managed to coax an extra 45 horsepower and 30 pound-feet of torque from the twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8. With 445 horsepower and 480 pound-feet of torque, the 650i Gran Coupe should move to 60 m.p.h. in 4.6 seconds, according to BMW, versus 4.8 seconds for the coupe. There was no mention of an M version of the sedan, but as history shows, the omission may be addressed later in the year.
An 8-speed automatic is the only transmission offered with either engine, though wheel-mounted paddle shifters make a dutiful appearance. In a nod to fuel economy, the Gran Coupe comes standard with an Eco Pro mode among its five selectable drive modes, which remaps the throttle response and shift points to eke out a 20-percent improvement in overall fuel economy, BMW claims.
Official economy ratings from the Environmental Protection Agency, along with the sedan's official pricing, will be announced closer to its sale date. For reference, the current 640i coupe achieves an economy rating of 21 m.p.g. in city and 31 m.p.g. in highway driving, and starts at $74,475.
The 6 Series Gran Coupe will have its debut next March during the Geneva auto show.

HEADLINE: Young Voices Reverberate at Indeterminate Climate Talks

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Young people press delegates as the latest round of climate talks grinds to an end. 

 BODY:
"You've been negotiating all my life."
That was a core line in a remarkable speech delivered on behalf of youth in the final stretch of two weeks of contentious, largely indeterminate climate treaty talks in Durban, South Africa. The talks went into overtime Saturday night (Durban time), with the leadership desperate to salvage at least a "Durban outcome," akin to the "road map" produced in Bali in 2007. 
The best way to track the finale and afterthoughts is by following the #COP17 or #UNFCCC tags on Twitter.
[3:06 p.m. | Insert |John Broder of The Times has written a very useful news analysis stepping back to survey where the process is likely to head in coming years. See the bottom of this post for an excerpt and link.]
The youth statement was delivered by Anjali Appadurai, a member of the class of 2013 at the tiny College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. Representing Earth in Brackets, a group from the college (with a great name, given the bracketed nature of debated documents), Appadurai was chosen from hundreds of youth delegates at the talks to give voice to their views. Here's the rest: 
On Thursday, another student, Abigail Borah of Middlebury College, briefly disrupted a session to press the United States delegation to take bolder steps. Her statement reverberated at a news conference in a question posed to Todd Stern, the lead Obama administration official in the talks, prompting Stern to clarify what was, and was not, possible. This is what counts as progress in the two-decadelong slow slog toward finding a common (but differentiated) worldwide path toward limiting emissions of greenhouse gases and limiting vulnerability to the impacts of human-driven climate change. She sent me a more formal final thought, which I've posted here.
Once again, it's worth considering whether this process is worth sustaining. I believe -- just barely -- that it is, despite the profound problems I see with the terms of the core treaty on climate and current efforts to update it.
The talks may seen "incremental forever" -- a phrase I first heard in connection with climate from the retired climate scientist Jerry Mahlman).
I think it's important to recognize that this process is indeed incremental, perhaps not forever, but certainly through this century. While there is eagerness for breakthroughs and great ambitious leaps -- either diplomatic or scientific -- accelerating the decarbonization of humanity's energy menu even as human numbers and resource appetites crest is implicitly a task of generations.
This is a journey to be undertaken, not a problem to be solved. The path is impeded by "super wicked" tangles of conflicting interests -- between those whose wealth and power was gained burning fossil fuels in the last century and those just getting started on that path now; those in places vulnerable to climate's hard knocks and those insulated from them, between a generation living in a fossil-fueled comfort zone (mine) and one seeing growing odds of future costs and losses locked in by current energy norms (today's youth).
The seemingly endless global climate caravan, which will decamp and head to Qatar a year from now, provides a record of the slow progress resulting from that tangle of pushing and pulling driven by hidden agendas and legitimate gripes, grudging concessions and determined blockades. (Read Michael Levi on an example from Qatar that illustrates problems with the treaty process.)
Some voices are quiet and hidden, like those of lobbyists for fossil fuels, wind turbines, nuclear power and other special interests always huddled in back corners in the meetings. Some are impassioned and public, like those of the students who gave voice to youth.
Pushing for an ideal world is fine, as long as those engaged with that push seek radical solutions -- in the deepest sense of the Latin root of that word, which is about getting to the "root" of things.
One reality is that current trajectories for human population and resource appetites, when gauged against the current suite of energy choices, do not add up to prosperous societies in a predictable climate later in this century. Another is that nearly all growth in emissions is coming in countries where the real-time imperative of economic growth will long dominate the long-term concern about greenhouse-driven climate change.
The United States can do far more than it is to made a difference even in light of those realities, so I'm glad the students were applying pressure. 
Overall, though, I see little prospect that the 20th-century pollution-style approach to greenhouse gases that is deeply embedded in the foundation agreements underlying the climate talks will produce meaningful breakthroughs.
In 2008, as I've mentioned before and before, I asked the Bush administration's climate treaty team if the world would have been better off signing a Framework Convention on [Energy] Technology Change back in 1992 instead of one on climate change. They offered an answer in the telephone news briefing linked in the preceding sentence. My answer is still yes.
3:06 p.m. | Addendum ]
Here's an excerpt from John Broder's news analysis: 
Effectively addressing climate change will require over the coming decades a fundamental remaking of energy production, transportation and agriculture around the world - the sinews of modern life. It is simply too big a job for the men and women who have gathered for these talks under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1992 treaty that began this grinding process.
"There is a fundamental disconnect in having environment ministers negotiating geopolitics and macroeconomics," said Nick Robins, an energy and climate change analyst at HSBC, the London-based global bank. Mr. Robins noted that the 20-year-old framework convention and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that amended it enshrined a two-tiered system in which so-called developed and developing countries are treated differently. China still is classified as a developing country and is thus exempt from any emissions limits, but it has a vastly larger economy than it had in 1992 and recently surpassed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
"They are working from a 20th-century agreement," Mr. Robins said. "We're now in another century." Read the rest.

11:34 P.M. | Wrapping It Up
The debate is over now. The candidates will meet one more time - next Thursday - before the voters actually make their preferences clear on Jan. 3.
We will be back for another live blog from Iowa next week. In the meantime, stay with The Caucus for up-to-the-minute coverage of the political campaign. And be sure to catch the latest in-depth coverage of the Republican candidates and President Obama at the New York Times Web site.
And don't forget to download the new Election 2012 iPhone app, which smartly combines our coverage with the best from political news sites, Twitter and blogs from around the Web.

11:17 P.M. | Fact Check: Newt Inc. Not Exactly 'Mom and Pop' Shop
Mr. Gingrich, who sometimes identifies himself while campaigning as a "small businessman," sought to enhance that image by describing his company, Gingrich Productions, as a mom-and-pop operation. The company, which produces and promotes books and films that Mr. Gingrich makes with his wife, Callista, may not be quite so small. 
Mr. Gingrich's personal financial disclosure form reported that the couple have $500,000 to $1 million in assets in Gingrich Productions. Their continuing efforts to sell and sign books and DVDs while stumping have drawn attention.
And the media production company is just one arm of the interlocking companies that Mr. Gingrich has built in the 13 years since he left the House, which collectively are known as Newt Inc.
The New York Times recently reported that two other of those enterprises, the Center for Health Transformation and a consulting company, the Gingrich Group, have enriched Mr. Gingrich. Together they earned $55 million over the past 10 years.
- 
11:03 P.M. | D.N.C. Attacks Romney Bet
What will everyone remember from the debate tonight?
Even before it was over, the Democratic National Committee sought to make sure that voters don't forget Mitt Romney's spontaneous offer to bet Rick Perry $10,000 on a dispute about what Mr. Romney had written in his book.
"Here's What the Average American Family Can Buy with $10,000," the D.N.C. said in an e-mail to reporters.
The e-mail noted that $10,000 is more than four months' pay for most people in America, where the median income was $26,197 in 2010.
For Mr. Romney, the moment reinforces the problem he has had connecting with average people. (Mr. Romney is a multimillionaire whose net worth is estimated at $200 million.)
The moment recalled another this year, when Mr. Romney went looking in his wallet for a $1 bill for a boy who had donated a dollar folded into origami. The candidate at first only found a $100 bill and then dug deeper to find a $5 bill.
The particulars of the dispute with Mr. Perry tonight may not matter as much as the fact that he was so quick to bet such a large amount.
The D.N.C., at least, will be trying to make sure that's what everyone remembers.
- 
11:00 P.M. | Voter's View: No Deciding Moments 
"As a whole, I liked it because although there were time limits, it didn't seem constrained. Some of the debates have bells, a buzzer, electro-shock therapy, whatever they need to do to get you to stop. I like it when it's more of a free-flowing discussion."
"I don't think anybody had any big crash-and-burn moments," he said. "I don't think anybody landed any big knock-out punches. I think each candidate did what they had to do. I don't think it moved a thing. I don't think it changed a thing."
So, the big question for Mr. Hunter is: Are you any closer to making up your mind?
He laughs. "Maybe a little."
"If I had a gun to my head, Gingrich is who I'd probably go for."
- 
10:51 P.M. | Santorum Remembers the GOPAC Tapes
Santorum just came back to those GOPAC tapes made by Mr. Gingrich to inspire Republican candidates. "He laid out a vision for conservative governance that I adopted and ran with," Mr. Santorum said of Mr. Gingrich's tapes. "I stuck by the conservative principles that Newt outlined in the late '80s." While praising Mr. Gingrich, he also opened a question about whether Mr. Gingrich continued to abide by those principles.
- 
10:47 P.M. | Fact Check: Hamas and Fatah Redux
In defending his controversial remarks about the Palestinians, Mr. Gingrich amplified the reason he believes there is little daylight between the Palestinian Authority, which holds power in the West Bank with the support of the Fatah movement, and Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist group. The Palestinian Authority has formally affirmed that Israel has a right to exist. But Mr. Gingrich said, "The Palestinian Authority's ambassador to India last month said there is no difference between Fatah and Hamas; we both agree Israel has no right to exist.''
Mr. Gingrich was referring to remarks by Adli Sadeq. According to a pro-Israel Web site, Palestinian Media Watch, Mr. Sadeq recently wrote that Israelis "have a common mistake, or misconception by which they fool themselves, assuming that Fatah accepts them and recognizes the right of their state to exist, and that it is Hamas alone that loathes them and does not recognize the right of this state to exist. They ignore the fact that this state, based on a fabricated [Zionist] enterprise, never had any shred of a right to exist..."
- 
10:44 P.M. | Gingrich's Childhood 
Interesting that after Mrs. Bachmann mentioned that her mother was a single mother, Mr. Gingrich talked about living above a gas station but omitted the struggles of his own mother. She was 16 years old in 1942 when she married his father, who was 19, and they split up after three days. She gave birth to her son nine months later. The teenage mother could not support herself, so she and her baby Newt moved in with her mother.
- 
10:37 P.M. | Voter's View: Gingrich Making Best Impression 
So far, Mr. Hunter is most impressed with Mr. Gingrich.
"I'm not one of these hard-liners who says he will never vote for Mitt Romney, but if my choice had to be immediate, it would be for Newt. He's deep and he's substantive and few on that stage can actually hit that level."
Mr. Hunter chuckled at the idea of the candidates having to make personal financial sacrifices because of the recession, the topic of one question. But he thought Rick Santorum's answer was the best, as it stressed the importance of stable, two-parent families in helping to keep children out of dire financial situations. Mr. Santorum said that having a mom and a dad is the greatest luxury, and Mr. Hunter couldn't agree more.
"I like his very strong stance on the traditional family model," Mr. Hunter said.
- 
10:34 P.M. | Gingrich Looks to Connect with Regular People
One of the tougher challenges for Mr. Gingrich might be convincing voters that he is in touch with regular people.
"When I was young, we lived in an apartment over a gas station," Mr. Gingrich said, adding later that "today, I've had several relatives in the last few years who are out of work."
He also mentioned that his wife, Callista, runs a small company that produces movies and books.
What he didn't mention: The $500,000 line of credit that he and his wife had at Tiffany's, the jewelry story that stands as one of the nation's symbols of conspicuous wealth.
- 
10:31 P.M. | Romney on Personal Financial Struggles
Mr. Romney made the admission right away: "I didn't grow up poor."
The answer was to a viewer's question about the last personal struggle with finances that the candidates faced. For Mr. Romney, who is said to be worth $200 million, it was a potentially dangerous question.
Mr. Romney said that if voters are looking for someone poor to be president, they should look elsewhere.
But he said he understands the plight of people who struggle, in part because his parents made him and his siblings work while they grew up and knew the importance of frugality.
"When people lose jobs, marriages get strained, people's health gets affected," Mr. Romney said. "I understand what it takes to get America working again."
- 
10:27 P.M. | Leading Candidates Differ on Immigration
Immigration remains a hot topic in the Republican Party - and one on which the leading candidates continue to disagree.
Mr. Gingrich reiterated his belief that illegal immigrants already in this country should - under certain strict conditions - be allowed to earn legal residence in the country.
"That's not amnesty," he said, insisting that his proposal would hold back citizenship from people who have come into America illegally.
But that distinction is not enough for Mr. Romney, who said letting illegal immigrants stay in the country - as citizens or as permanent residents - "will then create another magnet that draws people into our country illegally."
Mr. Romney declined to answer a question about whether he would try to find and deport people who had come to the country illegally. Instead, he said, he would urge those people to register their presence in the country before having to leave.
Mr. Perry accused President Obama's government of failing to secure the border and of a "catch-and-release" program in which nonviolent offenders are allowed to stay in the country.
"They are released into the general population," he said.
- 
10:25 P.M. | Gingrich the Truth-Teller
One of Mr. Gingrich's signal lessons to his followers was that "language matters," and if nothing else, he has demonstrated his skill with language tonight. After Mr. Romney declared himself not to be "a bomb thrower," which was the role Mr. Gingrich assigned himself in Congress, Mr. Gingrich used a few rhetorical flourishes to equate himself with former President Reagan and cast himself as a truth-teller.
"I will tell the truth, even at the risk of causing some confusion sometimes with the timid," he said.
- 
10:23 P.M. | Fact Check: Fatah and Hamas
Speaker Gingrich said there is no difference between Fatah and Hamas. That is not entirely accurate: the two are separate Palestinian political parties, with different histories and approaches. Fatah is in control of the West Bank, ruling through the Palestinian Authority; the more radical Hamas holds power in Gaza, the smaller, poorer strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. The two parties are now allied, having agreed to a reconciliation agreement in April.
- 
10:18 P.M. | Gingrich Stands Firm on Palestinian Comments 
Given the chance to back off his comments that the Palestinians are an "invented people," Mr. Gingrich did anything but.
Mr. Gingrich said there is virtually no difference between Hamas and Fatah, the two leading and often competing Palestinian factions. 
"These people are terrorists. They teach terrorism in their schools," a defiant Mr. Gingrich said.
"It's fundamentally time for someone to have the guts to stand up and say, enough lying about the Middle East," Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Romney took issue with Mr. Gingrich's characterizations, calling it "a mistake on the speaker's part."
"I think we are very wise to stand with our friends, Israel, and not get out ahead of them," Mr. Romney said, adding later that he would approach the Middle East and foreign policy generally with "sobriety."
"I'm not a bomb thrower, figuratively or literally," Mr. Romney said.
- 
10:14 P.M. | Voter's View: On Gingrich and Palestine 
When Mr. Gingrich gave a full-throated defense of his statement about the Palestinian people being newly invented, adding, "Enough lying about the Middle East," Mr. Hunter said. "Oh, whoa! ... I agree."
Then when Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich got into a spat about whether the Palestinian comment would cause more trouble for Israel, Mr. Hunter said, "I think Newt got the better of that exchange."
- 
10:06 P.M. | Gingrich Goes to Clinton's Playbook
Mr. Gingrich has learned a lot from watching former President Clinton, and on the touchy marriage/infidelity question, he conveyed some humility. He gave an uncharacteristically nonconfrontational answer, saying that people had every right to ask every single question about him. "I've made mistakes" worked for Mr. Clinton; will it work for Mr. Gingrich?
Watch the Video
- 
10:03 P.M. | Explaining GOPAC
Mr. Santorum's fleeting reference to listening to the GOPAC tapes may leave some viewers puzzled. They were an essential element of Mr. Gingrich's rise to power in Congress in the 1980s and early 1990s. Mr. Gingrich made cassette tapes (remember those?) instructing young Republican candidates - like Mr. Santorum - in how to run for office. The candidates would listen to them as they drove around their districts, learning to think like Newt and speak like Newt and then, when they finally broke the Democratic stranglehold on Congress in 1994, to vote for Mr. Gingrich for Speaker.
- 
10:02 P.M. | Perry Attacks Gingrich's Character and Marriages 
Rick Perry went right after Newt Gingrich's character, saying that "if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner."
He did not mention any names, but it was clear that he was referring to Mr. Gingrich, who has been married three times, and admitted that he was unfaithful to his second wife.
"Not only did I make a vow to my wife, but I made a vow to God. That's pretty heavy lifting," he said. "That's even stronger than a handshake in Texas."
Mr. Gingrich, given a chance to respond, accepted the idea that the question was an important one.
"It is a real issue. People have to look at the person to whom they are going to loan the presidency," Mr. Gingrich said. "They have to have a feeling that this is a person they can trust."
In his own case, he acknowledged having made mistakes - without directly mentioning his marriages - and said he had "had to go to God for forgiving."
But he said he is now a 67-year-old grandfather and said he was encouraged by the number of people who have decided to support him.
"I'm delighted at the way people have been willing to look at who I am, look at what my record has been," he said.

- 
10:00 P.M. | Newt the Historian 
To audience members playing a drinking game with each reminder from Mr. Gingrich that he is a trained historian, the first chance for elbow bending was at the approximate 40-minute mark. With accusations flying that Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney each favored individual mandates for health care in the past, Mr. Gingrich said, "I just want to make one point historically." He went on to point out that in 1993, "in fighting Hillarycare, virtually every conservative saw a mandate as a less dangerous future than the one Hillary was trying to do.'' Even the Heritage Foundation supported it. Today, of course, the individual mandate is the centerpiece of what the Republican candidates call Obamacare, which all of them want to make history.

9:54 P.M. | Voter's View: Romney and Gingrich Clear Front-Runners 

"Well, I'll be honest with you, the two people who look the best are Romney and Gingrich," Mr. Hunter said at the first commercial break. "I think the shots at them ring hollow, they really do. Bachmann sounds shrill. I like Rick Santorum, too, but policy-wise, I think they're all committed to pretty much the same thing. So, it comes down to trust, and who you think has the ability to go the distance.
"I liked Rick Perry initially. I thought we were getting the second coming of Sam Houston but we got Yosemite Sam," Mr. Hunter said. "Every time he attacks, it's like bringing a knife to a gun fight. He's got a great record, he should run on it. If he concentrated on his own record and pushed it out there, he could have and would have done a lot better."
- 
9:53 P.M. | Bachmann Goes on Offense
Mrs. Bachmann has decided to get aggressive, fast.
She accused Mr. Gingrich of being part of the problem, not the solution, suggesting that his office was on "the Rodeo Drive of Washington D.C., K Street."
And she created a new identity, "Newt Romney," to suggest that the leading Republicans are two peas-in-a-pod when it comes to the policies they would pursue.
Neither, she said, would provide much of a contrast with President Obama. Instead, Mrs. Bachmann suggested, she would be the true conservative who could face off against the president.
"If you want a difference, Michele Bachmann is the proven conservative," she said. "It's not Newt Romney."

9:51 P.M. | Romney Offers Perry a Bet
This was surely a first: a $10,000 bet in the middle of a presidential debate. 
It came from, of all people, Mr. Romney, a man known for his frugality and a former leader of Mormon church, which frowns on gambling of all kind. 
Mr. Romney made the surprising offer to Rick Perry when the Texas governor raised the issue of the changes between versions of Mr. Romney's book.
"Rick, I'll tell you what, ten thousand bucks?" he said to a somewhat stunned Mr. Perry. "$10,000 bet?"
Mr. Romney looked quite serious, and it was clear the line was one he had ready for just this situation. Mr. Perry was not so ready, but quickly recovered.
"I'm not in the betting business," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Romney seemed thrilled that Mr. Perry had declined the wager, suggesting it proved he, rather than Mr. Perry, was correct.

- 
9:41 P.M. | Voter's View: Romney and Gingrich 
Mr. Hunter said that he is usually out putting up yard signs by this late date. A board member of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative advocacy group, he is highly engaged in local and national politics.
While he is not a Romney supporter, he did find reason to praise Mr. Romney after the host George Stephanopoulos asked the candidates who among them was the most consistent conservative.
"Oh, George!" Mr. Hunter said.
The host then sought to have Mr. Romney respond to a comment made previously by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, that he, Mr. Gingrich is the more conservative of the two.
"That's one of those gotchas where they want people to beat up on each other, and he didn't take the bait," Mr. Hunter said of Mr. Romney. "I commend him for that."
But the gloves came off with the next question, and Mr. Gingrich pounced on Mr. Romney's record in politics, particularly an early loss to the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Democrat of Massachusetts.
"I think he scored a point," Mr. Hunter said. "It was unexpected, but correct."
Representative Michele Bachmann really got a reaction out of Mr. Hunter when she started referring to Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich as one person named "Newt Romney" in an effort to link their beliefs and records.
"Newt Romney? No, that's just not flying here," Mr. Hunter said. "That just rings hollow. I've looked at them closely before and that's not true."
- 
9:39 P.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich Said He Would Support Cap and Trade
Mr. Gingrich said he never favored cap and trade to reduce pollution, but on PBS's "Frontline" in 2007, he said he would support it.
"I think if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur, and if you have a tax-incentive program for investing in the solutions, that there's a package there that's very, very good," he said then. "And frankly, it's something I would strongly support."
- 
9:38 P.M. | Echoes From 1996
This "Newt/Romney" hybrid name invoked by Michele Bachmann is much like the "Dole/Gingrich" hybrid invoked by the Democrats in 1996.
- 
9:35 P.M. | Romney and Gingrich Clash on Experience 
Mitt Romney was the first one to take after Newt Gingrich, with a little urging from the moderators. 
Asked to note their differences, Mr. Romney noted that Mr. Gingrich had once called for a colony on the moon and would eliminate some child-labor laws. But he also went quickly to his main point - Mr. Gingrich's ties to Washington.
"I spent my life in the private sector," Mr. Romney asserted.
But a smiling Mr. Gingrich refused to be rattled. He quickly answered Mr. Romney, point by point, saying he would be "happy to defend the idea that America should be in space" and that kids "ought to be able to work part time in schools."
To the charge that he's a creature of Washington, Mr. Gingrich generated laughs in the audience by looking at Mr. Romney and saying, "Let's be candid, the only reason you didn't become a career politician is because you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994."
Mr. Romney's comeback was quick, saying he'd be a professional football player if his dreams as a kid came true.
"We don't need folks who are lifetime Washington people to get us out of the mess that we're in," Mr. Romney said.

9:23 P.M. | Bachmann and Romney on the Payroll Tax
Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney agree on the payroll tax, sort of.
Mrs. Bachmann says she's opposed to extending the payroll tax cut for another year, saying the idea is one of President Obama's "temporary gimmicks not permanent solutions."
Mr. Romney agrees, calling the tax cut a "little Band-Aid." He used the opportunity to slam Mr. Obama for making " this country a less attractive place for investing."
But Mr. Romney said clearly in the debate tonight that he would nonetheless extend the tax cut for another year.
 "I don't want to raise taxes on people," Mr. Romney said. "It's a temporary tax cut and it will help people in a very difficult time."
- 
9:16 P.M. | Cain Still a Presence 
Here's a testament to the impact of Herman Cain, who departed the race this month amid a sexual harassment scandal.
His signature tax plan - 9-9-9 - was just mentioned by Michele Bachmann, who then said that she wants a "win, win, win" plan that would repeal the tax code and replace it with something better.
One of her ideas: make sure that all people pay some income tax, no matter what their income.
"Today, 47 percent of the American people pay nothing," she said.
- 
9:12 P.M. | An Early Contrast Between Romney and Gingrich 
Here's an early contrast: In an answer to how to create jobs, Newt Gingrich focused immediately on his government experience, while Mitt Romney went in the opposite direction, focusing on his business experience.
Jobs "are not created in government. They are not created in Washington," Mr. Romney said in a swipe at his chief rival.
Mr. Gingrich promised "lower taxes, less regulation, an American energy plan, and actually be positive about people who create jobs."
But he bragged first about having worked for years in Washington, first with President Ronald Reagan and later with President Bill Clinton.
It's a theme we're sure to see more in the next few minutes.
- 
9:06 P.M. | A Smaller Crowd on the Stage to Start Debate
The debate is under way. Get ready for what could be a critical two hours in the Republican presidential primary.
One thing to note: This is the smallest number of candidates on the stage since the primary season got under way. So that means that there should be more time for each candidate. 
Though, as always, there will still be room for complaining about which candidates get too little time.

9:04 P.M. | Watching the Debate With an Undecided Voter 
Keith Hunter is a 53-year-old father of two who works in the home mortgage division of a major bank in Des Moines. We're comfortable on his sofa with a kitty named Liberty, a 14-year-old tabby whom he found on the Fourth of July. 
In 2008, Mr. Hunter, who describes himself as an evangelical Christian, supported Mitt Romney. But not this time. He thinks our nation's faith and values, as well as foreign policy and economy, are all headed in the wrong direction. He's looking for someone who not only articulates his values, but will govern by them, too, he says.
"Mitt Romney may be the poster child for my value system, for clean living, but I find some of his personal characteristics challenging," Mr. Hunter said. "I think it comes down to a matter of trust. Most people in our community do not trust him."
"I may walk in caucus night not knowing who I'm going to caucus for, or I might have my mind made up by the end of this evening," he added. "I just don't know."

7:54 P.M. | What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
Debates are always important in presidential elections. They seem to be even more critical this year. And there's nothing like a debate just weeks before voting begins.
That makes the Iowa face-off tonight on ABC even more dramatic.

What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
- 
7:44 P.M. | Setting the Stage
Six candidates will take the stage at Drake University in Des Moines. (Jon M. Huntsman Jr., still lagging in the polls, did not qualify; Herman Cainhas dropped out.) They will debate for two hours, from 9 p.m. Eastern time, in a session sponsored by ABC and The Des Moines Register and moderated by Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos.
Much of the attention tonight will be on Newt Gingrich, whose surge in the national and state-by-state polls has drastically reshaped the race in the final weeks of 2011. The interaction between Mr. Gingrich and Mitt Romney, his chief rival, will be a featured part of the night.
But the energy of the debate may be generated by the other four candidates - Representatives Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Rick Santorum - each of whom may be shifting into desperation mode as the election draws nearer.

HEADLINE: When a Catholic Terrified the Heartland

BYLINE: ROBERT A. SLAYTON


HIGHLIGHT: Trepidation about Mitt Romney's Mormon faith recalls vicious attacks against Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate. 

 BODY:
Orange, Calif.
WITH Mitt Romney, a member of the Mormon church, quite possibly heading toward the Republican nomination, Americans may be faced with a presidential aspirant whose faith many find strange and troublesome. It would not be the first time that has happened, and during a previous campaign the response was pretty nasty.
By any measure, Alfred E. Smith, the Democratic candidate against Herbert C. Hoover in 1928, had a formidable record. Growing up poor, Al (as everyone except The New York Times called him) left school at age 12 to go to work, at jobs that included a stint in the Fulton Fish Market.
An outgoing lad with a fine speaking voice, he gravitated to street corner politics and on to Tammany Hall. Smith started as an unknown member of the New York State Assembly and rose to become speaker. In 1911, he led the investigation of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire and sponsored the subsequent reform legislation that influenced fire codes nationwide.
Like Mr. Romney, Smith was the governor of a northeastern state. He served four nonconsecutive terms beginning in 1919, and a good argument can be made that Al was the greatest chief executive in the history of New York State, where he created the precursor of the New Deal.
So Smith should have been an impressive candidate, but the electorate had several problems with him. Voters reacted to his equivocal stance on Prohibition, to his Irish heritage, even to his New York roots. Their foremost objection by far, however, was to his religion: Smith was a devout Roman Catholic.
The response to this belief was public and private, during a campaign that lasted only two months, from September to November. Yet feelings were so strong that they swirled into a hurricane of abuse, a crescendo of fear and hate blasting through eight weeks. The school board of Daytona Beach, Fla., sent a note home with every student. It read simply: "We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is elected President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible." Fliers informed voters that if Smith took the White House, all Protestant marriages would be annulled, their offspring rendered illegitimate on the spot.
Opponents blanketed the country with photos of the recently completed Holland Tunnel, the caption stating that this was the secret passage being built between Rome and Washington, to transport the pope to his new abode. Countless copies of a small cartoon appeared on lampposts and mailboxes everywhere. Titled "Cabinet Meeting - If Al Were President," it showed the cabinet room, with the pope seated at the head of the table, surrounded by priests and bishops. Over in the corner was Al Smith, dressed in a bellboy's uniform, carrying a serving platter, on top of which was a jug of whiskey. Summing up, the minister of the largest Baptist congregation in Oklahoma City announced, "If you vote for Al Smith you're voting against Christ and you'll all be damned."
The Ku Klux Klan became actively involved in preventing a Catholic from ever getting near the White House, going all out to defeat Smith. One Klan leader mailed thousands of postcards after Democrats nominated the New Yorker, stating firmly, "We now face the darkest hour in American history. In a convention ruled by political Romanism, anti-Christ has won." A Klan colleague in remote North Manchester, Ind., warned his audience, in booming tones, of the imminent arrival of the pope: "He may even be on the northbound train tomorrow! He may! He may! Be warned! America is for Americans! Watch the trains!" When I interviewed Hugh L. Carey, only the second Roman Catholic elected governor of New York, for my Smith biography, he remembered Klan parades in Hicksville when he was 9 years old and how frightened he was, because "there was a real anti-Catholic sentiment."
At least as nefarious were the private conversations, whisperings that went on in homes, workplaces and schools across America. One woman wrote Franklin D. Roosevelt that she had heard that "if Governor Smith is elected president, the pope's son will be his secretary." F.D.R. asked, in his reply, how many sons did the lady think the pope had, and what were their occupations? Down in Amarillo, Tex., Representative Marvin Jones, a good Democrat, went into his local drugstore, and the owner asked him whom he was going to vote for. Mr. Jones answered with Smith's name. His neighbor bluntly replied, "We've been fighting that bunch for 2,000 years. Do you think I'm going to turn the government over to them?"
Simon Rifkind, at the time I spoke with him, was one of the last people alive to have actually been on the Smith campaign train. He noted that, when he was growing up in New York City, Catholics were all around him (Mr. Rifkind was Jewish), and "I had not been aware of the intense anti-Catholicism that prevailed in this country." But that year, "when I came to mid-America," he said, "it hit you in the face." Explaining that Smith would sometimes "be boycotted because he was a Catholic," Mr. Rifkind went on, "There were some times when nobody showed up at the platform." In Kansas, a little girl came home and asked, "Mama, why don't they kill that bad man Smith that they told us about in Sunday school?"
Even experienced political figures were stunned. Frances Perkins, later the first female cabinet member, campaigning for Smith in Maryland, founded as a Catholic refuge, still faced what she described as "some of the most terrible fantastic prejudices and dreadful yarns I have ever heard." Someone pointed out to her "the estate which had been purchased for the pope and where the pope was coming" as soon as Smith was elected. "They knew it for a fact." Lillian Wald, a leader in the settlement house movement and New York's pre-eminent authority on social work, despaired over "the organized bigotry, the like of which I have never seen. I feel as if some poison gas had spread over us and that our democracy will suffer from this for many years to come."
Smith lost that year, badly. Hoover got 58.2 percent of the votes, his opponent a dismal 40.8 percent. Even worse was the Electoral College; Hoover carried it by 444 to 87, winning 40 of the 48 states. The Roman Catholic candidate lost every western state and every Midwestern industrial state, even liberal ones like Wisconsin, while the solid Democratic South split over him. What really broke the governor's heart, however, was that his own beloved home state thoroughly rejected him; New York went for Hoover, and outside of the five boroughs, only a scant four counties returned for Smith. Even among Gotham's smart set, the "in" joke after Smith lost was that, upon learning of his defeat, the first thing he did was send a one-word telegram to the pope. It read, "Unpack."
The problem with such sickness is that it ignores reality and facts, the most important of which is this: There is absolutely no evidence that a religious hierarchy, either that of Al Smith's Roman Catholicism, of Mitt Romney's Mormonism or of Representative Keith Ellison's Muslim faith, has ever dictated these politicians' positions on the issues or challenged their allegiance to the Constitution. Every American has a right to private beliefs, but we are not voting for which church someone goes to, or which movie he sees or what book she reads. The question should be the candidate's outlook on the country's problems and what policies he advocates in response. Those are what count, and they are weighty enough concerns.
1. An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Hugh L. Carey, a former governor of New York. While Carey, who served from 1975 to 1982, was the second Catholic to be elected governor of New York State, he was not the second Catholic to hold the position. The printed correction also said that the second Catholic governor was Malcolm Wilson, who succeeded to the office when Nelson A. Rockefeller resigned in 1973 and lost to Carey in the 1974 election, but that is not the case.
2. An opinion essay on Dec. 11 about anti-Catholic prejudice during the 1928 presidential campaign of Alfred E. Smith referred imprecisely to Hugh L. Carey, and a correction in this space on Dec. 18 erroneously attributed a distinction to Mr. Smith. While Mr. Smith (who served from 1919 to 1920 and again from 1923 to 1928) was the first Catholic to be elected governor of New York State (and Mr. Carey, who served from 1975 to 1982, was the second), Mr. Smith was not the first Catholic governor. The correction also referred incorrectly to Malcolm Wilson, governor from 1973 to 1974. He was one of several Catholics who succeeded to the position without having been elected (including Martin H. Glynn, who served from 1913 to 1914 and was the state's first Catholic governor). Neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Carey was the second Catholic governor; Mr. Smith was.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: (Not) According to Plan

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at the president's weekly address and happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
An intense lobbying push helped for-profit colleges diminish the Obama administration's efforts to tighten rules on the $30 billion industry, offering what Eric Lichtblau describes in vivid detail as "a case study in Washington power broking." 

        
If recent polls are any indication, Republicans stand to become the first major political party to choose between two candidates who both are not Protestants, a phenomenon that is a testament to the broad-mindedness of American voters but also one that belies prejudices that still remain, Mark Oppenheimer writes.

        
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has a tendency to toss out big ideas, like making Congress part-time or a $175 billion public-private transit project for his state. That transit idea went bust but the tale of how Mr. Perry survived re-election and rose to become a Republican presidential hopeful, epitomizes how he operates and shows his ability to weather controversy, Deborah Sontag writes.

        
House Republicans expect some bipartisan support when they vote next week on a bill unveiled on Friday that ties an extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits to the transnational Keystone XL oil pipeline, Robert Pear writes. He adds that politically, the legislation offers them a chance to split two Democratic constituencies: labor unions versus environmentalists.

        
The Supreme Court thrust itself into the partisan battles of redistricting on Thursday, blocking the implementation of court-drawn districts in Texas believed to favor Democrats and Hispanics and agreeing to hear the cases, Adam Liptak writes. He quotes an expert saying that the court's decision next year could decide control of the House.

        
The National Labor Relations Board withdrew its politically charged case against Boeing on Friday after a workers' union won concessions from the company and withdrew its complaint, Steven Greenhouse reports.
Around the Web:

        
 Senate Democrats and House Republicans have both offered to pay for their payroll tax plans by increasing fees at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giants, raising the hackles of those in the real estate industry concerned that the costs will be passed on to borrowers, the Wall Street Journal reports.

        
The Washington Post explores what it is about Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current Republican presidential front-runner, and zoos.

        
Add how many justices there are on the Supreme Court to the list of things Mr. Perry has flubbed since his viral Oops! moment, the Associated Press reports.
The Weekly Address:

        
Inhis weekly address, President Obama ended the week the same as he started it, blaming Republicans for blocking an extension of the payroll tax and calling on them to stop blocking Senate confirmation of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Lawmakers, he said, should not go home next week before those issues are resolved.
The Week Ahead:

        
The Obamas and the Bidens will attend the 112th playing of the annual Army-Navy football game on Saturday at FedEx Field in Landover, Md. On Sunday, they'll attend "Christmas in Washington" festivities at the National Building Museum.

        
Mr. Obama will discuss the American withdrawal from Iraq when Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki visits the White House on Monday.

        
The House returns next week with lawmakers facing the possibility that they will have to stay through the weekend. The Senate is also in session.

HEADLINE: Our Own Worst Enemies

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Earlier this year, one of the defining villains of the age met his end. A generation of children grew up frightened by his legend and haunted by the image of his face. More than just an evildoer, he seemed at times to be the embodiment of evil itself, the ruthless leader of a vast and shadowy network whose very principle was terror. His death was unsurprisingly violent, widely celebrated (with a few qualms expressed here and there) and also curiously anticlimactic. His diabolical charisma -- the power of his name alone to inspire shudders of dread and revulsion -- dissipated almost instantly. Life resumed its ordinary, anxious course.
Voldemort was gone. 
Yes, him. Parallels between the malefactors of fantasy and their real-life counterparts are always suggestive, even if the alignment is never exact. Osama bin Laden and the demonic artist formerly known as Tom Riddle were both wayward sons of privilege, but the convergence of their careers is simply a historical accident, or perhaps an example of the kind of serendipity that takes on significance only in hindsight. Bin Laden was active in the early and mid-'90s, before J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels became a global sensation, but Bin Laden himself only achieved that status with the Sept. 11 attacks, which occurred two months before the release of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' the first of eight feature films.
The last one, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,'' arrived in theaters this July, just between the Navy Seal raid in Abbottabad and the 10th anniversary of the attacks. And while there is no obvious causal or allegorical relationship between the war on terror and the turmoil in the wizard world, it does seem that 2011 marked the end of an era of evil.
Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that the death of the actual Bin Laden and the fictitious Voldemort confirmed a shift -- a temporary vacillation or an epochal pendulum swing -- in the character of American nightmares. Whether or not we are wired, as a species, to dream up boogey/men, we are habituated, as a culture, to seeking them out in shapes that conform to our collective anxieties. The scale of Voldemort's ambition and the perfection of his depravity made him one of the exemplary movie bad guys of his time -- the slithery Satanic verve of Ralph Fiennes's noseless performance certainly helped -- but by the final installment in the franchise, his imperial, metaphysical badness had lost some of its negative sublimity. His cruelty to his followers made it hard to credit the intensity of their loyalty, and the way his baleful powers seemed to multiply and dissipate at the same time was a source of confusion as well as dread.
The grand, Manichaean battle between Voldemort and Harry had to be seen to its conclusion, of course. But more memorable and more moving than their final confrontation were the secondary conflicts and supporting characters that were the true lifeblood of the series. The denouement of Ron and Hermione's seven-year mutual hate-crush. Mother Weasley's dispatching Bellatrix Lestrange. The fractious politics at the Ministry of Magic and among the Hogwarts faculty. And above all, the unquiet life and noble death of Severus Snape.
''Deathly Hallows'' might have been Voldemort's Gotterdammerung, but it was Snape's apotheosis. Ambivalent, vain, a target of bullying who grew into a bully, Snape, played with such subtle mastery by Alan Rickman, was a brilliantly gray exception to the black-and-white moral scheme of the Potter universe. Snape's dalliance with the Death Eaters may have been unforgivable, but his lifelong grievance against James Potter proved to be justified, and the intensity of his mixed motives was a source of perpetual unpredictability and, in the end, tremendous pathos.
Severus Snape is more in tune than Voldemort with a popular culture that seems, at least for the moment, to prefer ambiguities instead of absolutes. Over the past decade, we have become accustomed to agonized or shadowed heroes, including Tobey Maguire's moody Spider-Man, Christian Bale's brooding Dark Knight and the strangely melancholy James Bond incarnated by Daniel Craig. Even Harry Potter had his moments of anger, moroseness and ill humor. But the grimness of these heroes arose less from the moral defect of being tempted by evil than from their intimate knowledge of its depths. They could be lawless, vengeful, guilty and tormented, but only because the enemies they faced were so utterly beyond the reach of compassion or reason. Fiennes's Voldemort represented one face of this kind of unredeemable vileness: grandiose, totalitarian, obsessed with power. The other side -- whimsical, chaotic, devoted to destruction for its own sake -- was brought most vividly to life by Heath Ledger's Joker in ''The Dark Knight.''
There were a few stabs at this kind of villainy on screens this year, but they seemed more cartoonish than awe inspiring. Red Skull, the nemesis of Captain America, was a creature of comic book retro-kitsch, so over the top in his fiendishness that even the movie's Nazis felt he went a bit too far. And the heavy-metal, supermean Decepticons? They're toys, so lumbering in their belligerence that any 8-year-old knows better than to take their threats seriously.
In the fantasy and superhero realm, the most chilling and compelling villain of the year was surely Magneto, who in ''X-Men: First Class'' is more of a proto-villain, a victim of human cruelty with a grudge against the nonmutants of the world rooted in bitter and inarguable experience. Magneto is all the more fascinating by virtue of being played by Michael Fassbender, the hawkishly handsome Irish-German actor whose on-screen identity crises dominated no fewer than four movies in 2011. In addition to Magneto, Fassbender was Rochester in Cary Fukunaga's ''Jane Eyre'' (a romantic hero who for much of the story wears a plausible guise of gothic menace); the psychiatrist Carl Jung in David Cronenberg's ''Dangerous Method''; and the sex-/addicted protagonist of Steve McQueen's ''Shame.'' All of these men are studies in ambivalence, divided against themselves and soliciting, at best, a wary sympathy from the audience.
Magneto, more than the others, also evokes a curious kind of self-reproach, because his well-founded vendetta is, after all, directed against us. (And the worst of us is represented by Kevin Bacon's Sebastian Shaw, the nemesis behind the nemesis.) Magneto's tragic beginnings give him something in common with Caesar, the chimpanzee who transcends his species-based oppression to become a simian Spartacus in ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes.'' There is nothing malevolent about Caesar at all: he is the underdog we are expected to root for, even if as a consequence we are rooting against ourselves. The bad guy in ''Planet'' -- the greedy Big Pharma C.E.O. played by the British actor David Oyelowo -- is more of a scapegoat than an agent of evil. His indifference to the well-being of his company's research subjects is not really what dooms humanity to decimation by virus and enslavement by our primate cousins. The true culprit in that regard is Will Rodman, James Franco's serious, sensitive scientist, an unwitting Prometheus whose experiments give the apes the genetic boost they need to take over the planet.
Will's motives, throughout, are irreproachable: he wants to cure his father's dementia and also to nurture Caesar, his pet and protege. But the consequences of his good intentions are catastrophic, making ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' one of quite a few movies released in 2011 that might have drawn their tag lines from an old Pogo comic strip: We have met the enemy, and he is us.
''Us'' may not be how we would prefer to think of the investment bankers in J. C. Chandor's ''Margin Call,'' who scramble for damage control after unleashing destruction on the world economy. In the current idiom of political outrage, these guys -- Demi Moore is the only woman in their circle, which also includes Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey -- are the nefarious 1 percent, divided from the rest by their greed, ruthlessness and lack of accountability. But not so long ago, the sharks in suits were exactly who the rest of us were supposed to aspire to be, and the queasy brilliance of ''Margin Call'' is that it leaves the attractive patina of ambition and power intact while exposing the ethical ugliness beneath it. Some critics have faulted Chandor's film for being insufficiently condemnatory of Wall Street, but to my eyes it is all the more devastating by virtue of its refusal to move outside the bubble of rationalization and self-regard that makes the world go around.
Until, that is, it stops. This was a banner year for apocalypse, whether man-made or cosmological or some scary combination of the two. Human life, life on earth, the earth itself -- these were threatened by disease (''Contagion''), freaky weather (''Take Shelter'') and a rogue planet summoned by Kirsten Dunst's bad mood (''Melancholia''). The prevalent dangers are metaphysical and systemic. Rottenness pervades the Sweden of ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' but while that movie, like its source novels, is full of horrible people -- a sociopathic social worker, a family of serial killers -- they are less figures of self-contained Voldemortian demonism than emanations of a cruel and corrupt social order. The terror that Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist fight against is all the more frightening because it has no single cause or agent. It is hydra-headed, viral, atmospheric: the inevitable byproduct of pervasive and perfectly ordinary misogyny, avarice and contempt for the weak.
And such evil is hard to defeat, even with a few sequels in store. Outsize devils like Voldemort may be unspeakably scary, but they are also comforting because they can be identified, named and then vanquished. The sins that seem intrinsic to the human condition are unlikely to be so easily beaten. War, racism, inequality, the abuse of authority -- we can imagine small, partial victories against all of them, but nothing like the cathartic deliverance of the kind we crave from our stories.
Which means that the old demons are likely to return eventually, at least as metaphors for the desire to be free of the stubborn, invisible ills they represent. But right now it does not seem so easy to picture them or to envision their final defeat. Even at the movies, things are a little more complicated, a little more unsettled and inconclusive. We may not always love our monsters -- apart from the studly werewolves and dreamy vampires -- but we know them too well to hate them completely. They are us, after all.

HEADLINE: To Rethink Government, Start Close to Home

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
GOVERNMENT gets no respect.
Some of the antipathy may stem from fancy economic theories that say free markets magically render government unnecessary. But much more of it surely results from the annoying experiences that many Americans have had in government offices.
High on many lists of miserable places to spend an afternoon is the local office of the department of motor vehicles. 
For decades, people have complained of long lines and rude service at D.M.V. offices all over the country. There's a widespread impression that D.M.V. employees consider their customers' time worthless.
One blogger, for example, described a visit to a rural Ohio motor vehicle office where he ignored the ''take a number'' sign, since he was the only customer in the room. When he approached the counter, the clerk glared at him and sternly ordered him to take a number. He dutifully complied, adding that ''as soon as I sat down, she called out, 'One!' '' ''That's me!'' he responded, and only then did she deign to scrutinize his forms.
After countless experiences like these, is it any wonder that many people believe that government is the problem and not the solution, as President Ronald Reagan contended in his first inaugural address? In the years since, increasingly harsh antigovernment rhetoric has dominated American public discourse: All taxation is theft! Starve the beast! Or, in Grover Norquist's memorable words, we should downsize government enough to ''drown it in the bathtub.''
Yet no society can prosper without government. Without collective action, how could we defend ourselves, or enforce property rights, or build and maintain public infrastructure, or curb pollution? And if government is unavoidable, surely it is worth asking whether we can make it better. Some societies have demonstrably more effective governments than others, after all, and some of our government institutions function much better than others.
I stumbled upon an instructive case study close to home -- in Ithaca, N.Y., at the Tompkins County Department of Motor Vehicles office. The Ohio blogger could have been describing the D.M.V. I dealt with when I first moved to Ithaca in the 1970s -- surly service, endless waits, mindless bureaucratic rigidity -- the whole litany. But these days, the local D.M.V. is nothing like that.
For example, when I was selling my car to an out-of-town buyer last March, he said he was excited to complete the transaction except for the fact that he would need to visit his local D.M.V. I suggested that he register the car in Ithaca, where he'd be in for a pleasant surprise. We went together one morning to a harshly lit, warehouse-like building that still seemed to scream ''bureaucracy.'' There were forms to fill out, and he found them confusing. Though he made several errors, an employee cheerfully guided him through the process. Much to his astonishment, we were out the door with his plates in 15 minutes.
Curious about what had caused this transformation, I called Aurora Valenti, the Tompkins County clerk, who's been in charge of the local D.M.V. for the last 21 years.
Things were a mess when she first took office, she told me. Employee morale was low, and customers complained bitterly and often. One big annoyance was that they had to wait in one line to have their forms processed, then start all over again in another line to pay their fees.
She discovered that the reason for the separate line was technological: terminals used to process licenses and other forms couldn't handle transactions involving money. So she negotiated with state officials in Albany to get what was needed to allow each clerk to do both tasks. Now customers wait in only one line. That may not seem like a big deal in itself, but the intelligent use of technology -- which also sometimes allows customers to complete their forms online, and not even visit the D.M.V. -- has contributed to a quiet revolution.
BUT that's only part of the story.
Ms. Valenti's other major initiative was a heavy dose of sensitivity training for employees, which she delivered in person. ''Most customers would rather have a root canal than visit the D.M.V.,'' she told them, ''and that's making both you and them unhappy.'' Her explicit goal was to empower clerks to tell customers quickly and cheerfully that there were simply no problems they could not solve.
From what I've seen, this training worked. Morale now seems high. When I told the employee who helped us why I'd suggested that the buyer come to the Ithaca office, she blushed with pride. ''We all really enjoy working here,'' she said. And customers with whom I've spoken say they are very happy with their experience at the office -- at any rate, as happy as they can be with time spent doing government business.
The Tompkins County D.M.V. is not unique. While many people around the country may still detest their local office, friends and colleagues in New York City and other places -- both inside the state and out -- say they have also noted improvements.
These small victories should be celebrated, because without decent government the free enterprise system would quickly grind to a halt.
If government is inevitable, why not try to create the most effective one possible? Success requires focus and hard work, which in turn require dedicated and competent public servants. But experience shows that it's possible.
Annual surveys by Transparency International, a nonprofit group based in Berlin, consistently place the same nations -- New Zealand, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada and the Scandinavian countries among them -- atop the list of those whose own citizens think most highly of their governments. The United States does not rank in the top 20.
Antigovernment rhetoric is surely not the only reason for our low ranking. But incessant government bashing isn't making it any easier to recruit the kind of people who make good government, and short lines at the D.M.V., possible for the rest of us.

HEADLINE: About That Drinking Problem

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
Sugar Hill, N.H.
THERE are so many Subarus here in northern New Hampshire that people joke about it being the official state car. But the owners don't joke about their fuel economy, which pretty much stinks.
This consumer displeasure has not escaped the attention of Subaru, which concedes that lackluster gas mileage has cost it sales. The company finally addressed the issue when it redesigned the midsize Legacy and Outback for 2010, and it has followed up by greatly improving the mileage of the redesigned 2012 Impreza compact.
The new Impreza sedan with an automatic transmission is rated at 36 miles per gallon on the highway, a whopping 38 percent increase from last year's figure of 26 m.p.g. The city mileage estimate has jumped to 27 m.p.g., from 20 m.p.g., a leap of 35 percent.
The gains also make the Impreza the most fuel-efficient all-wheel-drive vehicle sold in the United States. Its closest competitor is the 2012 Mini Cooper Countryman S All4 with a 6-speed manual transmission. That Mini is rated at 25 m.p.g. city and 31 m.p.g. highway and, in contrast with the easy-to-please Impreza, has a gas snob's taste for premium fuel. 
In addition to the Impreza sedan, there is a four-door hatchback (which Subaru persists in calling a five-door). Each has a 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment.
The sedan with the stick shift is rated at 25/34 m.p.g., a gain from last year of 5 m.p.g. in town and 7 on the highway. The new hatchback with the manual is rated at 25 m.p.g. in the city (a gain of 5) and 33 on the highway (up 6).
Happily for consumers, and for Subaru, the new Impreza offers more than an improved ability to shun gas stations. It blends practicality -- particularly with the hatchback -- with more entertaining handling.
The sedan starts at $18,245 and the hatchback at $18,745. Some states require a cleaner PZEV-rated version (for Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle), which adds $300 to the price.
The continuously variable automatic transmission, a fuel-saving design without discrete gears, adds $1,000.
I spent a week in a sedan with the C.V.T. and Premium trim. The price, with a $3,000 option package that included alloy wheels, sunroof, navigation system and heated seats was $23,545.
An automaker seeking to coax some small gains in fuel economy can typically come up with a few tweaks here and there. But to manage improvements of this magnitude it is necessary to spend some serious money for a new engine and transmission.
The variable transmission, which replaces a quaint and uncompetitive 4-speed automatic, is a smaller version of the C.V.T. in the Legacy and Outback. The unit responds promptly to the gas pedal, but during cruising it also lets the engine speed drop, improving fuel economy.
The other big change is a new 2-liter 4-cylinder engine, an offspring of Subaru's first all-new engine family in two decades. It is a smaller version of a 2.5-liter power plant introduced in the Forester last year, and like other Subaru engines it is a horizontally opposed, or Boxer, design.
Subaru says the engine is more efficient and includes some lighter components because it was not designed to be turbocharged: some parts of a turbo engine have to be stronger to withstand additional pressure created by the turbocharger.
The new engine is rated at 148 horsepower at 6,200 revolutions per minute and 145 pound feet of torque at 4,200 r.p.m. That's a big drop from the 170-horse engine of last year, but Subaru says the new transmission's quicker response helps to make up for the loss of power. Also, the new Impreza weighs less -- in the case of my test car, about 130 pounds.
In about 400 miles of travel on Interstate highways and hilly roads through the White Mountains, I never felt the Impreza was seriously underpowered. But neither would I say that its acceleration was brisk.
Once up to speed, the Impreza is a fine companion for the driver in a hurry. The electric power steering's consistent weight and feel are quite good -- indeed, far superior to the steering in other recently redesigned Subarus like the Outback. With a reworked suspension and stronger body, the car responds quickly when the driver wants to change direction. Rumpled roads don't upset either the Impreza's handling or the comfort of its occupants.
I also briefly drove a hatchback and found the handling was similar. Subaru says it tried to make all the Imprezas ride and handle the same.
The new Impreza line does not, however, include new versions of the high-performance WRX and WRX STI models. Those cars got a makeover last year, though they continue to use the Impreza platform, and Subaru says it will be several years before new versions arrive.
The interior of the sedan and hatch are nice-looking, though hardly benchmarks for econo-elegance. There is adequate storage, and the basic climate controls are logical and include refreshingly simple knobs.
The driver's seat has a height adjustment, and it is possible to easily adjust the closeness of the front head restraints to the back of one's head.
While the overall lengths of the sedan and hatchback have not changed, the wheelbase is one inch longer. Clever packaging increased the rear legroom by almost two inches. But the seat cushion is close to the floor, and 6-footers will find the accommodations tight.
Standard equipment includes all the important safety equipment, including electronic stability control. After a series of crash tests, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has listed the Impreza as a Top Safety Pick.
The sedan's trunk is rated at 12 cubic feet, an increase of almost one cubic foot. The hatchback has 22.5 cubic feet behind its second row, a gain of 3.5 cubic feet. If you plop down that second row, you create a cargo hold of 52.4 cubic feet, making the hatchback the far more versatile choice.
Like all current Subarus, the Impreza has an all-wheel-drive system admired in snowy areas for its ever-ready competence. But the new sedan and hatchback are somewhat vulnerable in deep snow because of their carlike ground clearance of just 5.7 inches. (The Sport version has 5.9 inches.)
Subaru will remedy that deficiency in the fall of 2012 with an Impreza variant to be called the Subaru XV, which is to have 8.7 inches of ground clearance.
While an economy rating of 36 m.p.g. is impressive for an all-wheel drive car, an even more fuel-efficient hybrid version may be coming. At the Detroit auto show in 2010, Masatsugu Nagato, who was then the director of Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, said the automaker's first hybrid would be introduced in 2012, based on a new model -- a bit of timing that coincides with the Impreza's debut.
Subaru officials recently declined to comment on whether a hybrid Impreza was on the way, but they said repercussions from the Japanese earthquake last March made it likely the hybrid would not arrive until 2013.
For most people, all-wheel drive isn't a necessity, so it is easy to see why potential customers were scared away by the previously uncompetitive mileage. But stunning changes to the Impreza have suddenly made its fuel economy a strength and its all-wheel drive a no-fault bonus.

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Europe

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
FINANCIAL markets are transfixed by events in Europe, and no wonder. The euro zone is under severe stress. A breakup could make recent volatility look like a day at the beach.
Whether the latest agreement of European leaders brings a final resolution to the euro crisis won't be clear for some time, but few people are betting on it. And a reprieve from euro jitters might just focus attention on another trouble spot: Washington, where a Congressional supercommittee failed to reach a budget-cutting compromise last month and measures to extend the payroll tax cut are stuck in political gridlock. A long impasse could weaken the already none-too-strong economy.
''If Congress and the White House continue to be unable to get anything done,'' said Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, then ''we are playing with fire.'' In short, continued bipolar stress is most likely -- with market anxiety swinging back and forth across the Atlantic. 
These problems certainly loom large. But Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says they aren't really the most important prospects on the horizon. In his view of the world, developments in Brazil, Russia, India and China -- enormous and rapidly growing economies, which he labeled as the BRIC's 10 years ago -- will prove ''far more important to investors'' than the issues now weighing down the United States and the 17 countries of the euro zone.
Because the euro crisis is of ''obsessive interest'' around the world, he said in a telephone interview last week, European policy makers need to ''make it clear that they're not going to let the euro area implode.'' That, he said, should help make people ''a bit more relaxed and a bit more balanced.'' And instead of focusing primarily on ''tail risk'' -- on hedging against the extreme damage that a euro collapse could wreak -- it may be possible for more people to realize that we are in the middle of an exciting economic transformation, he said.
Mr. O'Neill has a new book, ''The Growth Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond.'' In it, he says that Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as -- Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey -- are economic powerhouses and should no longer be called emerging markets. He prefers the term ''growth markets'' for them, a name that may help investors ''to understand the scale of the opportunity here, and for policy makers to grasp what is changing in the world.''
All these countries, he says, enjoy ''largely sound government debt and deficit positions, robust trading networks and huge numbers of people all moving steadily up the economic ladder.'' Their governance in some cases may leave much to be desired -- he cited Russia as an example -- but their economies compare favorably in many respects with the developed nations that are having so much trouble these days.
The eclectic countries comprising the growth markets all have relatively large populations tilted toward a young demographic -- South Korea is the smallest but most prosperous of the group, per capita -- and have already begun to grow at a very rapid pace.
The growth of China, the economic heavyweight among them, is likely to slow from an annual rate in the double digits to 7 or 8 percent, he said. At that pace, China should surpass the United States as the world's largest economy by 2027, which, he said, was a very conservative estimate.
He acknowledges that Brazil, India, Russia and China have relatively little in common. That's one reason, he says, that they are unlikely to be an enduring and cohesive political bloc. But what they shared in 2001, he says, ''was that they all appeared increasingly eager to engage on the global stage,'' and each, he says, has actually prospered mightily from world trade over the last decade.
In the intervening years, they have accounted for roughly a third of the growth of the world economy. To put that into perspective, he says, their combined increase in G.D.P. was ''more than twice that of the United States, and it was equivalent to the creation of another new Japan plus one Germany, or five United Kingdoms.''
In the last year alone, he says, the economies of the four BRIC countries have almost expanded enough to ''add another Italy'' to the size of the world economy. And barring disasters, he says, this kind of growth is likely to continue.
As for the United States, whose strongest rising export markets are China, Brazil and Mexico, he says, ''this is a fantastic opportunity'' to help re-engineer the economy.
Will this mean more jobs moving offshore? Mr. O'Neill, a fervent advocate of free trade and globalization, allows that it may, in some manufacturing industries. But as the growth markets become more affluent and labor costs rise, wages in the United States will become more competitive, he says, and some jobs are likely to return. For the growth markets to fulfill their potential, he adds, restrictions on trade and currency controls in countries like China will need to be liberalized.
They will all need to avoid ''disastrous setbacks,'' he says, and many of them will need to combat ''corruption.'' Russia, in particular, needs to ensure that its government is more responsive to the desires of its citizens, he says. But the net effect of truly free trade, he maintains, is always positive over the long run.
AMONG the developed nations, he says, the United States is in a comparatively good position for sustained growth over the next few decades, partly because its population is relatively young compared with that of Europe and Japan, and because it will retain many of its current advantages, especially its strength in innovation.
A boom in the growth markets won't mean profit for investors if the price isn't right, he says, and without deep knowledge of a country, it's easy to lose your way. It's possible to reap many of the benefits of direct investment by holding shares in multinational corporations based in the United States. Over the long haul, he says, ''America should learn to love the BRIC's.''

HEADLINE: As Money Flees Russia, Tycoons Find Tough Times

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW
NIKOLAI MAKSIMOV, one of the richest men in Russia, was sitting in a grimy jail cell in the Ural Mountains.
Through the murk, Mr. Maksimov saw his cellmate -- a man, he says, who appeared ill with tuberculosis, a scourge in Russian prisons. ''I had the feeling that I was put in this cell on purpose,'' Mr. Maksimov, now free on bail, recalled recently.
Mr. Maksimov, who was arrested in February on suspicion of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars, is hardly the only Russian tycoon who has run into trouble. Among the six men who have topped the Forbes rich list here in the last decade, one, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, is in prison, and another, Boris A. Berezovsky, is in exile. They, like Mr. Maksimov, maintain their innocence.
Even before the authorities here acted last week to quash protests against the government and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's rich were growing agitated, too. Evidence is mounting that conditions are deteriorating for the maintenance and investment of their vast wealth -- and while this development may gladden populists, it may become an economic threat. 
Post-Soviet privatizations shifted state-owned factories into the hands of a coterie of well-connected businessmen -- the oligarchs. Partly as a result, Russia has 101 billionaires, behind only China, with 115, and the United States, with 412, according to Forbes.
Only now, capital flight, a problem in the 1990s, has re-emerged. Money is flowing out of Russia faster than it is flowing in. The net outflow is expected to reach $70 billion by year-end, and the figures suggest that the bulk of that will be from large investors.
Yaroslav Lissovolik, chief economist for Deutsche Bank here, notes that ''the scale of capital flight has more than compensated for the rise of oil prices.''
Even if oil output is maintained and crude prices stay relatively high, according to Russian finance ministry estimates, the nation's current account will slip into deficit by 2014. Then Russia's economy, like that of the United States, will depend on an inflow of investment, economists say.
The Russian government has recently made modest gains in attracting foreign investment. The problem is that for every foreign company that invests -- from Exxon on the Russian Arctic Shelf to Cisco Systems in a high-technology park going up outside Moscow -- far more Russian entrepreneurs head for the exits, gauging the risks too great.
Officials understand that oil can take Russia only so far and are eager to lure investment from all quarters. ''The amazing thing is that they are doing far better with the foreign investors than the locals,'' says Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs here.
It's hard to know how big a role cases like Mr. Maksimov's have played. Mr. Maksimov, 54, is withering in his criticism of the authorities. The suggestion is that his business enemies enlisted the police to try to persuade him to resolve a dispute.
''I was on the Forbes list; now I'm going to jail,'' he says. ''It's normal. It's Russia.''
His troubles began three years ago, when he sued Vladimir S. Lisin, another steel tycoon, touching off the dispute that eventually led to Mr. Maksimov's arrest.
The two had made a deal, which quickly soured, for Mr. Lisin to buy 50 percent plus one share of Mr. Maksimov's company, the Maxi Group. Maxi was estimated at the time to be worth $1.2 billion after debts. Mr. Lisin's company, Novolipetsk, paid Mr. Maksimov an advance of $317 million. It was to pay the remainder after an outside auditor estimated the extent of the company's debt, within 90 days.
Executives of Novolipetsk declined to pay. In an interview at its headquarters here, lawyers for Novolipetsk accused Mr. Maksimov of transferring large sums out of the Maxi Group to the bank account of his girlfriend. He denied the accusation, saying he had been buying out shares that his girlfriend, who was also a business partner, owned in business subsidiaries.
Whatever the case, such disputes were supposed to be settled by an international arbitration panel under the terms of the agreement. By February, Mr. Maksimov felt that he was close to winning. He said he had rebuffed informal discussions of a $100 million settlement and was holding out for the full balance, $287 million. He called a news conference at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Moscow on Feb. 14.
Along with the media, men toting Kalashnikovs showed up.
''Russia is always interesting,'' Mr. Maksimov says. He was whisked out of the hotel in a Russian version of a ''perp walk.'' Soon enough, he was handcuffed to a chair in a dingy police station on the city's outskirts.
FORMALLY, he was held on charges related to the payment to his girlfriend, which had in any case been repaid to the Maxi Group. But Mr. Maksimov says the investigator also discussed with him the arbitration with Novolipetsk. As Mr. Maksimov recalls it, the investigator sat on the edge of the table during the questioning and asked: '''You were offered $100 million. Why didn't you take it?''
Mr. Maksimov says he was then escorted to the airport to fly to a prison in Yekaterinburg, in the Urals. Awaiting the flight, he says, he was again urged to make a deal with Novolipetsk.
''You won't like people in jail,'' he says he was told. ''They aren't your type.''
Anton Bazulev, director of external relations for Novolipetsk, said in an interview that it had never made a settlement offer to Mr. Maksimov and denied that it had orchestrated his arrest. Mr. Bazulev said Novolipetsk handed evidence to the police of possible fraud and was obliged to do so under Russian law as a publicly traded company.
Five days after his arrest, Mr. Maksimov was released on bail. A month later, in March, a Moscow International Commercial Arbitration panel awarded him $287 million in a ruling that, under terms of the chamber, is final and not subject to appeal.
When capitalism and democracy arrived in Russia in the early 1990s, many people thought a new industrialist class would become a pillar of the state, substituting for the Communist Party, the Red Army and the K.G.B. But under Mr. Putin, a K.G.B. veteran, the security services resurged as a force in society and business. Last Sunday's poor election showing for his party, United Russia, suggests some Russian voters are cooling toward Mr. Putin, who intends to wage his own three-month campaign to return to the presidency.
In 2000, when he first ran for president, he vowed to eliminate the oligarchs ''as a class,'' but that didn't happen. Some who seemed to clash with him directly, like Mr. Khodorkovsky, lost fortunes.
A loose system of patronage, in which security services and big business overlap, is still pervasive.
In one prominent case, a hedge fund called Hermitage Capital, once the largest foreign money management firm in Russia, accused several dozen midlevel police, tax inspection and judicial authorities of abusing their offices to steal $230 million in a fraudulent tax refund. After the fund's lawyer, Sergei L. Magnitsky, testified in the case, he was arrested and held 10 months in dank cells before dying, possibly of a heart attack or pancreatitis.
Novolipetsk says it has litigated the failed deal with Mr. Maksimov in 141 separate cases in Russian state courts, winning 90 times. Such a proliferation of hearings is common in Russian business law, as all sides typically jurisdiction-shop for sympathetic judges by filing similar lawsuits in dozens of courts.
Importantly, lawyers for Novolipetsk have obtained rulings suggesting that even if contract parties specify arbitration to resolve disputes, Russian courts can claim jurisdiction, a precedent that could damp foreign investment, too. Russian civil courts have refused to enforce the arbitration panel's ruling.
After the favorable ruling in March, Mr. Maksimov's lawyers successfully appealed to courts in the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Cyprus to freeze shares in six European steel mills. Novolipetsk has appealed on jurisdictional grounds and won a ruling against him in Amsterdam in November, though the court left in place the restriction against selling the European assets.
Mr. Maksimov has put what remains of his wealth into a British-domiciled holding company.
WHILE his money has escaped from Russia, it is less clear that he will himself. The police are now investigating him in a separate fraud case. They argue that because Russian courts do not recognize the arbitration panel ruling, presenting that ruling, even to a foreign judge, is fraudulent -- even if a European court accepts its validity.
''We understand this as blackmail,'' says Vladimir Melnikov, a lawyer for Mr. Maksimov. ''If you receive the money in Holland, you go to jail in Russia.''

HEADLINE: Police Evict Protesters From Occupy Boston Site

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The police swept into Occupy Boston's campsite early Saturday morning, bringing one of the country's largest continuous demonstrations inspired by New York City's Occupy Wall Street protest to an end.
Boston police said 46 people had been arrested during what the city's police commissioner, Edward Davis, said was ''by and large'' a peaceful eviction.
Police officers arrived shortly before 5 a.m., dragging tents out of the camp and warning the roughly 75 protesters who had stayed the night there that they would be arrested if the did not leave. 
''The first thing I heard was the sound of a knife ripping through a tent,'' said Mike Hipson, a demonstrator who stayed through the night. A group linked arms and awaited arrest as police officers backed vans into the camp.
Some protesters noted that they could not read police badges, and some members of the media said they were kept at a distance as arrests were being made.
The sweep was not a surprise. On Thursday, a Boston judge lifted a temporary restraining order that had barred the police from evicting the group. By Friday, protesters had received eviction notices warning them that they risked arrest if they did not vacate Dewey Square by midnight, and many began clearing tents and valuables from the camp. But that night, a crowd of more than 1,000 gathered in and around the square. ''The mayor and I decided it was good to hold off 24 hours after the deadline,'' Commissioner Davis said.
By 8 a.m. Saturday, the city's cleanup of Dewey Square was in full force, with workers using leaf blowers and moving garbage into dump trucks. Others had begun power-washing posters off of the building they had adorned in the square.
Across the street, a couple of dozen protestors chalked messages, like ''Occupy Boston Lives,'' on the pavement outside of South Station, using supplies from the group's ''mobile sign unit.'' The supplies, one housed in a sign-making tent, were now inside a child's wooden wagon.
One of the protesters, Steve O'Brien, a homeless 18-year-old, said he did not know where he would go now.
''I'm hoping it will be reinstated, that we go back in and set it up again,'' Mr. O'Brien said. He said he had wanted to be arrested, but that the police told him he was too young.
The group scheduled a general assembly for Saturday night on the Boston Common to discuss its next move.
''We have a lot of options,'' said Robin Jacks, 31, who, along with one other, helped begin the Boston occupation. Ms. Jacks has expressed interest in transitioning, as other groups around the country have done, from a public occupation to action like occupying foreclosed homes.
''This is not over. There's no way that we're going to dispense and not be us anymore.''
At a news conference on Saturday, Mayor Thomas M. Menino said safety was the primary motivator behind the eviction, praising the police for acting with ''patience and respect.'' Mr. Menino had words of gratitude for the protestors, too.
''They shined a much needed light, still needed, on growing economic inequality in this country. In the end, they also acted with restraint, I thank them for that,'' Mr. Menino said.
But he said the city would immediately move to evict protesters from any new campsites.

HEADLINE: A Pentagon the Country Can Afford

 BODY:
If you listen to defense industry lobbyists, hawks in Congress and the Pentagon, the sky is falling and with it, American security. It isn't.
The failure of the ''supercommittee'' to reach a deficit agreement is supposed to trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts in federal spending over the next decade, nearly $500 billion of that from the basic Pentagon budget. Many Republicans, and some Democrats, are already talking about getting the Pentagon off the hook. Representative Howard McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has promised legislation to prevent the cuts from taking effect. We are no fans of the supercommittee process, but if the Pentagon's spending is wrestled back into rationality, it will be progress. Walking away would be a blow to Washington's financial credibility. There is room to cut, if it is done with prudence and innovation.
The Pentagon has had a blank check for most of the last 10 years. Last year's basic budget of $530 billion (not counting the costs of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan) was about $140 billion higher, in inflation-adjusted terms, than in 2001. This year's base budget is expected to be about $526 billion, which is still excessive. 
Besides the nearly $500 billion in cuts that are supposed to start in January 2013, the budget act that created the supercommittee mandated an initial cut of roughly $450 billion in defense spending, spread over the next decade. According to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, that would put basic defense spending for 2013 around $472 billion -- about the same, in inflation-adjusted terms, as what was spent in 2007.
There is also a misperception that the Pentagon cannot handle cuts right now because a decade of war supposedly decimated the arsenal. A new study by the Henry L. Stimson Center calculated that the Pentagon spent $1 trillion on procurement during that time -- a 97 percent increase from 2000 to 2010 -- and was able to ''modernize and improve our equipment inventory across the board.''
Of course, the cuts must be made wisely. There is a serious problem with the law's requirement that all programs -- vital or not -- be cut by the same percentage to reach the ''sequester'' number. The budget control act does allow an exemption for pay and benefits for military personnel, but if that option is exercised, other accounts have to be cut by even more.
If the cuts do go forward, Congress and the administration need to find a way to give the Pentagon some flexibility to choose between high-value programs and those that can be ended, scaled back or delayed. Lawmakers should consider phasing in the cuts somewhat more gradually, so the choices can be smarter and disruption minimized.
The Pentagon will have to be pushed. Indeed, officials say they are making no contingency plans for the 2013 cuts. Instead of waiting for rescue, they should be figuring out what reductions make sense and how to carry them out.
Making cuts of this size will not be easy. Logical places to look include reducing the cost of personnel and benefits. Because the wars are winding down, the Army can come down in troops, to 520,000 from roughly 569,000; to a lesser extent, so can the Navy and the Air Force. The premium for Tricare, the military health insurance program, could be raised by $50 a month for employed, working-age military retirees, and other reforms could be applied to pay and benefits. Altogether this could save $20 billion annually.
Cutting the Pentagon civilian work force by 10 percent, or 74,000 people, and retiring old fighter planes and bombers could save $13 billion a year from operations. Closing some bases in the United States and overseas, and curbing construction, including suspending plans to locate families with troops deployed in South Korea, could save at least $5 billion more over the next decade. Tens of billions are spent annually on cold-war systems ill-suited to 21st-century needs -- aircraft carriers, nuclear attack submarines, stealth destroyers and manned aerial combat fighters. Some $15 billion could be saved annually by pruning the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter order to 1,000 and ending the V-22 Osprey program and the Joint Tactical Radio System. Another sound target: bloated nuclear-related programs, which could cost upward of $600 billion over the next decade across the government.
To do any of this effectively, the Pentagon will also need a major change in culture and procedure. President Obama and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates began enforcing more spending discipline two years ago, but much more is needed. Weak oversight of contractors, and the Pentagon's passion for excessive bells and whistles, have raised costs on almost every major weapons system. Military commitments must be scaled back. One expert says the Navy can shrink its fleet and save $15 billion annually if it keeps ships abroad longer while rotating crews in and out.
Even after the sequester cuts, the United States would still be investing about as much in defense as China, Russia, Britain, France, Japan and Germany combined, and could still protect vital national security interests.
Defense lobbyists are in overdrive, warning about an enormous loss of jobs if the cuts take effect. We agree this is the worst time to increase unemployment, of any kind. That is why Congress should be working to stimulate the economy now, so the country can get its fiscal house in order once the economy recovers. When it is time to cut, there is nothing sacrosanct about defense industry jobs.
Congress needs to compromise soon on a rational deficit plan with both tax increases and spending cuts. Whatever happens, the Pentagon needs to learn to live within the country's means.

HEADLINE: Loans for Multifamilies

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE rental market's strength may be enticing some buyers to look at multifamily properties, but qualifying for a mortgage on rental units is often more difficult than on a single-family residence.
Borrowers should be prepared to gather more documentation, and the interest rate and required down payment will very likely be higher.
''It looks a lot easier than it is,'' said Neil B. Garfinkel, a partner in charge of the real estate practice at Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson, suggesting that anyone new to this subject work with a real estate professional experienced in rental properties. 
But the extra effort may be worthwhile for some people looking for income, or at least help with covering monthly expenses.
A recent report by Frank E. Nothaft, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, noted that ''the rental market has been a bright spot in the housing sector this year,'' as more households postpone home-buying because of the uncertain economy. The overall rental vacancy rate in Manhattan is hovering around 1 percent, while rents are up for all kinds of apartments.
Mr. Garfinkel, who is also an owner of apartments in Brooklyn and the Bronx through an investment firm, says buyers of multifamily property will need to do their due diligence on all the active leases and any service contracts for the building, including the employment terms of the superintendent.
Some lenders are more comfortable lending for property with tenants in place, said John Manning, a Brooklyn mortgage broker, while vacant buildings would be fine with others.
Mr. Manning's advice: ''Expect to put down 25 to 35 percent, or even more, as a down payment,'' well above the 20 percent typically expected these days on single-family loans.
He also notes that because multifamily properties are considered riskier, government agencies like Freddie Mac impose a ''risk-based pricing adjustment,'' which adds a quarter to a half percentage point to the mortgage rate (or buyers can pay a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount).
The size of the multifamily building determines how lenders evaluate it. A two- to four-unit residence can usually be financed under Fannie Mae's conventional mortgage guidelines, but if the owner does not plan to live there, he or she can expect to pay a higher mortgage rate. Borrowers' incomes, credit scores and financial standing will be key.
Mortgages for buildings with five or more apartments generally fall in the nonconforming-loans category, and may even be considered a commercial mortgage. The lender will be evaluating these rental properties as if they constituted a small business, Mr. Manning said, which means it will want to make sure that the rents cover the mortgage and other expenses.
In many cases, these loans will come from a bank's commercial lending department. Sometimes local or regional banks will offer them, but only if the property is in their area, according to Mark Lazar, an owner of Allied Financial, a mortgage brokerage in River Edge, N.J.
Mr. Lazar says that those considering renting out their primary or second homes shouldn't assume that the rental income will help them qualify for a mortgage. Many lenders require a homeowner to have at least 30 percent of the home's value in equity before counting any rental income.
For a first-time landlord, he added, only about half of lenders will count the rental income toward the total income needed to finance the multifamily purchase.
''If you do not demonstrate experience as a landlord,'' Mr. Lazar said, ''we will not allow the credit to income,'' even if the rent checks have come in steadily for the previous owner.
Multifamily buyers should also consider the tax implications, including some favorable deductions for maintenance, snow removal and depreciation.

HEADLINE: Scientists Say Cod Are Scant; Nets Say Otherwise

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
GLOUCESTER, Mass. -- Federal regulators are considering the unthinkable in New England: severely restricting -- maybe even shutting down -- cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine, from north of Cape Cod clear up to Canada. New data suggest that the status of the humble fish that has sustained the region for centuries is much worse than previously thought.
Fishermen insist that there are plenty of cod and that the real problem is fuzzy science. They say the data are grossly inconsistent, pointing to a 2008 federal report that concluded that Gulf of Maine cod, though historically overfished, were well on the way to recovery.
The news is causing high anxiety in Massachusetts, where a wooden ''Sacred Cod'' has hung in the State House for more than 200 years and the fishing industry, though struggling, still figures prominently in the state's identity. 
''I can't think of another fishery shutdown that would have the economic consequences of this,'' said Steven Cadrin, a scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, who helped with the assessment.
From May 2010 to April 2011, commercial fishermen caught about nine million pounds of Gulf of Maine cod, according to the New England Fishery Management Council, earning more than $2 per pound on average.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration set a deadline in 2004 to rebuild the cod species by 2014, and the 2008 survey suggested that goal was within reach. But researchers now say the survey might have sharply overestimated the number of young cod; the new data suggest the spawning population is at only about 20 percent of the rebuilding target. The estimates are based on a mathematical model that uses data from a number of sources, including catch records and research trawlers that fish in the gulf several times a year.
''It's just mind-boggling,'' said Maggie Raymond, executive director of Associated Fisheries of Maine, a trade group, and the owner of two fishing boats. ''Some years you get better news, some years you get worse. But to have two such totally opposite conclusions is really hard to wrap your head around.''
Some fishermen say they are seeing more cod in the Gulf of Maine than they have in years. Many in Gloucester have already reached their quota for the fishing year that started in May and are looking to buy the rights to catch more from others who have not yet reached their federal limit. Recreational fishermen, who land more than 30 percent of the total Gulf of Maine cod catch, are reporting similar observations.
''I'm telling you, it's out there,'' said Russell Sherman, who started fishing for cod in 1971 and has just about reached his annual allocation of 25,000 pounds. ''We've had no problems locating codfish.''
But scientists take more into account than what fishermen see.
''Fishermen will almost always tell you that, and it's not that they're lying,'' said Mark Kurlansky, whose 1997 book, ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World,'' documented how Canada's once-abundant Atlantic cod were fished almost to extinction. ''Landing a lot of fish can mean the fish are very plentiful, or it can mean the fishermen are extremely efficient in scooping up every last one of them.''
Independent scientists conducting a peer review of the data are expected to make recommendations in January to the New England Fishery Management Council, which sets regional fishing policy. The council will then decide what new cod restrictions should be imposed in the Gulf of Maine, the starkest of which would be a first-ever shutdown of the fishery. Any new restrictions would most likely start in May.
Even though the data have not been finalized, NOAA has taken the unusual step of convening a team to meet with fishermen and discuss options. Eric Schwaab, assistant administrator for the NOAA Fisheries Service, said it was ''too early to speculate'' on the likelihood of closing the fishery.
''We think we have a lot of tools yet in our toolbox before we would get to that kind of place,'' he said.
At a meeting with fishermen on Friday in Portsmouth, N.H., regulators said that even without closing the fishery, the catch might have to be reduced by as much as 90 percent. Under that scenario, they said, groundfish revenues would drop by 90 percent in New Hampshire, 54 percent in Maine and 21 percent in Massachusetts, with Gloucester seeing a 60 percent decline.
A separate stock, Georges Bank cod, which is found south and east of Cape Cod, would probably not face new restrictions next year. But most of the small dayboat fishermen who focus on Gulf of Maine cod could not fish for it, partly because it requires longer trips to more distant fishing grounds and larger boats.
One possibility is extending the deadline for rebuilding the fishery, although even then, ''you would still have to cut back tremendously,'' said Peter Shelley, senior counsel at the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group in Boston. Other possibilities might be requiring different gear or closing sections of the Gulf of Maine, he said.
Shutting down the fishery, or even sharply curtailing the allowable catch, ''would be devastating,'' said Joe Orlando, a fourth-generation Gloucester fisherman who landed 160,000 pounds of cod last year, about 80 percent of his total catch. ''It would cut the legs right off of us.''
Such restrictions would make it hard to fish for other species, Mr. Orlando and others said, because it is nearly impossible to trawl for any other groundfish -- those that live near the sea bottom, like flounder and haddock -- without bringing up cod.
The new data are coming at a time of extraordinarily high tension between New England fishermen and federal regulators. The industry is still adjusting to a new management system, started last year, that divided fishermen into groups, called sectors, that share an allotted catch of each species. Though the allotments were intended to provide fishermen with steadier income, many have complained that they were set too low and that small boats, in particular, were being pushed out.
''It feels like they're yanking the rug out from under us just as we're finally starting to get acclimated to this new system,'' said Dennis Robillard, who lands about 113,000 pounds of cod a year and was offloading about 700 pounds of it the other day at Fisherman's Wharf here.
He and other fishermen said they expected that the public would blame them for the bleak new numbers, assuming that they had heedlessly overfished, when in fact they had been sticking to the limits regulators set in light of the rosy 2008 population estimate.
''It's not fishermen who've caused this problem,'' said Ms. Raymond from the Maine trade group. ''But that's the interpretation the public gets, when what they should be understanding is that this is a very imprecise science.''
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, has been a vocal critic of NOAA over the last year and has even called for the firing of Jane Lubchenco, the agency's leader. Mr. Brown said he had never seen an agency ''that is so distrusted by the folks it's supposed to regulate.''
''This just adds fuel to the fire of that lack of trust,'' Mr. Brown said.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said his staff was already putting together a proposal for federal disaster assistance ''to tide people over'' should cod fishing be curtailed or shut down. But he added that the new data should be taken seriously.
''We have to be very sober in our assessment of this thing,'' he said. ''The important thing is this fishery be saved and exist for centuries to come.''

HEADLINE: Red Bull Quits a Formula One Group

BYLINE: By JONATHAN SCHULTZ

 BODY:
The body created to represent the mutual goals and grievances of Formula One teams is losing two highly visible members of its rank and file.
Red Bull, the winner of the 2010 and 2011 Constructors' championships, and Ferrari announced their withdrawals from the Formula One Teams Association on Dec. 2. 
''FOTA's drive has run its course,'' said Ferrari in a statement.
Among the association's most contentious projects was to establish spending caps, which were agreed on in principle by the association's 11 member teams in 2009, as a means of controlling costs and leveling the playing field. The so-called Resource Restriction Agreement was introduced when Luca di Montezemolo, the Ferrari chief executive, led the association.
The remaining members of the association are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss next steps for the organization.
In other motorsports news:
Bernie Ecclestone, the boss of Formula One, extended the deadline for organizers of the United States Grand Prix, the Formula One race scheduled for Nov. 18, 2012, in Austin, Tex., to prove that the requisite funding was in place for the race. The World Motor Sport Council is expected to ratify the 2012 Formula One calendar on Wednesday, the day on which Mr. Ecclestone said adequate funding must be proven by the organizers. The grand prix would take place at the Circuit of the Americas, a race circuit that was under construction outside the Texas capital until last month, when organizers stopped work because they did not have a contract in hand from Mr. Ecclestone to host the race.
Sprint Cup will be called Sprint Cup through at least 2016. Nascar announced on Dec. 3 that its title sponsor in the elite Cup series signed a three-year contract extension. The current contract with the telecommunications company applies through the 2013 season. Officials at Nascar said they hoped that the commitment from Sprint would help teams secure sponsors to fund their race campaigns, a difficult proposition even for successful teams.
Newman/Haas Racing, the team co-founded by the actor Paul Newman, announced last week that it would not field a team for the 2012 IndyCar season. ''The economic climate no longer enables Newman/Haas Racing to participate in open wheel racing at this time,'' said Carl Haas, who founded the team with his friend Newman in 1983, in a statement. Newman/Hass driver Oriol Servia finished fourth in the overall championship in 2011.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Next First (and Only) 100 Days

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I'VE been saying this for a while, but now it feels even more acute: America's democracy has shrunken to ''the only 100 days.'' Since F.D.R., we've measured presidents by their ''first 100 days.'' But now it's really ''the only 100 days.'' Presidents lately seem to have just those 100 days to lay down a transformational agenda and get it passed in their first year -- before they have to tailor their politics to the midterm elections -- and then, if, as often happens, their party loses the midterms they have to focus on the next presidential election. China has five-year plans. We have 100 days every four. So all I'm thinking about now is how we get the most out of the first 100 days of 2013 -- our next quadrennial chance to make serious policy (barring a crisis that forces our hand).
Our priority is obvious: jobs. ''We are having three jobs crises at once,'' argues the Harvard labor economist Lawrence Katz, and there is no way we will reduce inequality without addressing all three. 
The first jobs crisis is the one driven by the steep drop in aggregate demand for goods and services that began with the 2008 subprime crisis, notes Katz. ''Way too many firms are not hiring workers because they just don't see the demand.''
The second jobs crisis grows out of the first. It is long-term unemployment -- people who have been out of work for so long ''they've lost their connections to the job market and need help getting back,'' said Katz.
The third jobs crisis flows from the merger of globalization and the I.T. revolution. The president described it in his Kansas speech: ''Steel mills that needed 1,000 employees are now able to do the same work with 100 employees, so layoffs too often became permanent, not just a temporary part of the business cycle. ... Today, even higher-skilled jobs, like accountants and middle management can be outsourced to countries like China or India.''
So the next president must have a plan to address all three jobs crises in his only 100 days -- and an electoral mandate to implement it. The Republican Party intends to run again on a just-cut-taxes-and-that-will-cure-all platform, which we know doesn't work. So the country's only hope is for President Obama -- or, if he won't, a third party -- to offer the plan we need and not just run on ''I'm not as crazy as that G.O.P. guy.''
For starters, we need a focused, near-term stimulus -- I call it ''investment'' -- that both stokes aggregate demand and expands the job markets of the future. The days when Ford or General Electric would come to your town with a 25,000-person factory are over. That factory, notes Katz, is now 500 people operating machines and robots. Manufacturing can no longer carry America's middle class.
We need to think of the future middle class as being generated not by factories ''but by hubs,'' argues Katz. These are networked urban areas like Austin, Silicon Valley and Raleigh-Durham, where people learn, imagine and create value rapidly by combining universities, high-tech manufacturers, software/service providers and highly nimble start-ups that collaborate and compete to invent things that make people's lives more entertained, productive, healthy, educated and comfortable.
The knowledge workers in these hubs will be the big profit generators. Their profits can and will support lots of other middle-class jobs, but those, too, will require more skills. They will require workers to bring something extra, something creative -- ''like the artisan'' of old -- to whatever job they do, says Katz, and through this extra command more pay. That's the carpenter who learns some design skills, the nursing home employee who can put a smile on the faces of the elderly, the auto mechanic who learns customization. Our wealth as a country, says Katz, will be driven by the goods and services these hubs sell into the global market. But whether that wealth remains confined to an elite group or spreads, he adds, ''will depend to a large degree on the skills our work force develops and the creativity of individual workers.''
To spawn more of these hubs, big and small, any stimulus should focus on building telecommunications and infrastructure to support networked cities and on getting more young people access to vocational or college training. Obama has proposed that. But his stimulus will never pass without being integrated with a credible plan to fix our long-term fiscal imbalances by raising taxes and cutting spending -- a plan more credible than anything Obama has proposed so far. It has to be a fiscal plan at the scale of our problem that can garner bipartisan support, a la Simpson-Bowles.
If we had a stimulus focused on 21st-century jobs, and a credible long-term fiscal reform plan, it would unlock the scale of investment we need to revive the employment market today and address the future. If Obama ran on that big plan, he would win and have an electoral mandate to implement it in his only 100 days. Sadly, he seems intent on playing small ball. He is capable of, and the country needs, much bolder leadership.
Oh, well. There's always the first 100 days of 2017.

HEADLINE: Just Getting On With It

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
FOR the last few days I've been in London on assignment, staying at the Portobello Hotel, where -- my friend Tim Blanks tells me -- he used to visit Nico in the '70s. ''It may have been the first boutique hotel in London,'' he said, recalling that the front-desk man in the Nico era wore a cropped Vivienne Westwood top with feather trim.
To me, the Portobello, in Notting Hill, is actually the un-boutique hotel. It doesn't charge for Wi-Fi, and you can get porridge any time you want it. Somebody in the management thought to add a small carton of milk to the familiar bottles in the mini bar (with a cereal bowl in the cupboard). In other words, the hotel gives you exactly what you need, and doesn't try to be stylish or hip. It just is. 
This is the first time I've stayed for a length of time in Notting Hill. I made one dash early in the week to the West End to meet Hussein Chalayan for lunch at J. Sheekey, which was packed, as many restaurants in this end of town are.
This morning I'm going to the National Gallery to see the Leonardo da Vinci show. But otherwise I've stayed around Notting Hill, and one tends to notice things: the variety of small retail businesses that cater to the neighborhood (and people who come to the Portobello Market), the many organic and fair-trade food purveyors, the amount of Christmas stuff (greens, cards, toys) that is generally nicer and less expensive than what you find in New York.
At the end of the day, when I'm walking back to the hotel, taking a different route to discover something new, I'm actually finding things I want to buy. And I can't remember when I last had that desire in Paris or on one of London's big commercial streets.
Anyway, I'm not sure what to think. The London newspapers are filled with reports about the eurozone crisis, British unemployment and inflation, and firsthand accounts of the recent riots. One article expressed the concern that England was following the United States and becoming a nation of haves and have-nots.
In The Guardian, a 20-year-old law student described feeling happy when he joined the looting during the riots and set fire to a sports car in a showroom. He said he felt untouchable. I don't know what kind of lawyer the man will make, but you can understand why the riots remain on people's minds.
''Fashion has always pursued the rich,'' Mr. Chalayan said over lunch. (More from our conversation later.) Fashion has also pursued ideas and innovation, with a dose of reality. I have to admit Karl Lagerfeld's Indian banquet show for Chanel last week left me cold, as did his comment to Lisa Armstrong in The Daily Telegraph: ''People have always responded to difficulty by dressing up in jewels.''
Really? I prefer the Duchess of Cambridge's more contemporary response. For a benefit concert the other night, she wore a $100 dress from Zara. She just got on with it.
By the way, check out Kurt Anderson's excellent piece in Vanity Fair about why there has been a lack of innovation for the last 20 years in the arts and style.

HEADLINE: In Anaheim, a Welcome and a Lesson for Pujols

BYLINE: By GERARD WRIGHT

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- He could be forgiven for missing the distinction as he gazed out on another sea of red, after 72 hours that upended the game and redefined his life and career.
''It was a tough decision,'' Albert Pujols, baseball's newly minted $250 million dollar man, told the crowd of fans gathered at the home-plate entrance to Angel Stadium on Saturday.
But recalling the ''love and the kindness'' that were part of his life as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals for 11 seasons, he said, ''I'm going to bring that here to the city of L.A.'' 
The crowd roared in derision, perhaps disbelief.
Pujols recovered quickly. ''Anaheim -- sorry.''
It was Pujols's first lesson about his new home. It might be Southern California, 70 degrees in December, with fans tossing footballs in the stadium parking lot as they waited for the official introduction of their team's new stars, but it's not Los Angeles.
Pujols, 31, who signed a 10-year, $254 million deal with the Angels on Thursday, was introduced to the fans alongside the former Texas Rangers left-hander C. J. Wilson, who signed a five-year, $77.5 million contract.
The $331.5 million splurge had its origins in discussions that the Angels owner Arte Moreno began with the Fox Sports television network in February 2011. The outcome of those negotiations was an extension of the team's existing deal with Fox. The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the deal was worth $3 billion over 20 years.
Moreno would not confirm this figure. ''Nobody knows about it right now,'' he told reporters. ''You're guessing.''
But Moreno did confirm that the new deal made the Angels an unannounced player in the Pujols stakes. ''We tried to keep it quiet,'' he said of the team's interest, ''sort of sneak in the back door.''
The search for a player of Pujols's stature had its origins in the Angels' last playoff appearance, when they lost to the Yankees in the 2009 American League Championship Series.
''We were on a plane where we could play Boston, then the Yankees, and we weren't prepared to play with them,'' Moreno said. ''You look at what you can develop in the organization, what can you do in the in market, what are the Band-Aids you can apply. We just didn't feel like we had the depth to compete at the level we wanted to compete at.
''Everybody can be a victim when they want to be a victim, but we wanted to look at what the opportunities were in the market. We've been very blessed, economically, with the fans and with our TV package. We were just hanging around the fringe.''
Jerry Dipoto, appointed as the Angels' general manager after a postseason cleanout of the team's front office, had dinner with Pujols's agent, Dan Lozano, in mid-November as a means of keeping every recruiting option open.
''Jerry turns over the rocks,'' Moreno said, later calling Lozano ''a stand-up guy.''
The Angels made their first contact with Pujols on Tuesday night. Twenty-four hours later, Moreno found himself exchanging text messages with Lozano.
''In a perfect world, he's a Cardinal,'' Moreno said of Pujols, adding later, ''I didn't want to be in a situation where I was disrespectful to the Cardinals and just running up the price.''
Moreno bought the Angels eight years ago. His focus, he said, has been to make the team debt-free and to build a connection with the community. Along the way he announced his intention to expand the team's reach into what was once perceived as Dodgers territory by renaming his team the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.
''Obviously, I've had my battles about names, but that's just business,'' he said.
By midweek, Moreno knew he had the opportunity to make a career-changing and franchise-changing purchase. He said he found himself thinking what it would mean to the fans ''to bring a guy of this caliber, and that's when all of your plans and objectivity go out the window.''
Back on the podium, Pujols, a three-time most valuable player, looked like, well, a quarter of a billion dollars, in a sharp black suit -- soon to be covered by an Angels jersey, No. 5 -- and a large diamond-encrusted watch.
Wilson, born and raised nearby, was giddy.
''Do you miss Southern California?'' Moreno had asked him early in the season. ''You're a Newport guy. The beach -- that's nice.''
''I know, I know,'' Wilson replied.
Unlike Pujols, Wilson could hardly have faced a decision that was easier or more painless.
''I can't even begin to describe how amazing it feels to be from here and be part of this,'' Wilson told the crowd Saturday before breaking from his escort and trotting over to the security barriers, high-fiving a 50-foot line of fans.
He knew where he was.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions last Sunday about Albert Pujols's news conference after he signed with the Los Angeles Angels rendered the surname of the team's general manager incorrectly. He is Jerry Dipoto, not DiPoto.

HEADLINE: The Pipeline We Actually Need

BYLINE: By GREGG EASTERBROOK. 
The author, most recently, of ''Sonic Boom: A Guide to Surviving and Thriving in the New Global Economy.''

 BODY:
LISTENING to the debate over the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, you might think that all pipelines are bad. But thousands of miles of pipeline already crisscross the United States. Without them, there would not be gasoline at filling stations, or natural gas in restaurant kitchens. It is 100 percent certain that new pipelines must be built.
The question is: what kind of new pipelines are needed? Oil pipelines that prolong the nation's addiction to imported petroleum, or natural gas pipelines that carry a cleaner, domestically produced fuel? 
The Keystone XL project -- which the Obama administration has moved to table until after the 2012 election -- would move synthetic petroleum from the Canadian province of Alberta to Gulf Coast refineries for conversion into gasoline. Yet even if all were to go well with the pipeline, which would be built to high safety standards, the United States might be better off without still more imported oil.
At the same time, there is a better kind of pipeline -- but it is nowhere close to construction. That pipeline would bring natural gas from Alaska to the lower 48 states. Access to Alaskan natural gas would reduce greenhouse emissions, while providing an alternative to coal in electricity production and to oil in transportation. And don't assume it's a bad idea just because Sarah Palin favors it.
Today, natural gas is being found in tremendous quantities in the shale formations of the East Coast (owing in part to the controversial extraction method known as hydraulic fracturing), the Bakken shale field in North Dakota (where the gas is being ''flared'' or burned off as a waste product, because there are no pipelines to carry it to consumers), Prudhoe Bay and Cook Inlet in Alaska, the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada and elsewhere.
An opportunity exists to replace coal and oil, the most carbon-intense fossil fuels, with natural gas, which produces 30 percent less greenhouse gas per unit of energy generated than oil, and 50 percent less than coal.
Even without access to Alaska's abundant natural gas, domestic production has risen steadily for a decade, last year hitting its highest level since 1973, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. ''Proved reserves of natural gas have grown significantly over the past several years,'' the agency said recently. It estimates, moreover, that the country has about a century's worth of technically recoverable natural gas resources at current rates of consumption. (United States oil reserves equal about a three-year supply.) Production of natural gas has risen about 20 percent over the last four years despite a low prevailing price for this commodity -- an ideal situation for consumers.
Policy makers might not have noticed the boom in natural gas reserves, but the market surely has. In October, Kinder Morgan, an energy giant that owns many of the terminals used for oil and coal transportation, bid $21 billion for El Paso Corporation's natural gas pipelines. The deal would make Kinder Morgan the country's largest operator of natural gas facilities.
Some urban buses already run on natural gas. Honda began selling a Civic that runs on natural gas; its energy use equates to 31 miles per gallon of gasoline at $2 a gallon, with low greenhouse-gas emissions. The financier T. Boone Pickens is backing a bid to install natural gas pumps at truck stops. Cheniere Energy, a Houston company, has agreed to export liquefied natural gas to Spain. As Washington wrings its hands about dependence on imported oil, American companies will ship a superior, cleaner fuel overseas.
Yet energy policy is still premised on the notion that coal and oil must be used for most needs, while carbon-neutral green energy from the sun, wind and biofuel is the main alternative. Here, the perfect becomes the enemy of the good. On paper, green energy can eliminate greenhouse emissions, while natural gas cannot: using gas instead of coal and oil would merely reduce carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. But most practical applications of all-green energy remain years off, if not decades.
That's where the missing pipeline comes in. Prodigious amounts of natural gas are sitting in Alaska. It is conventional gas, which can be extracted without the problems associated with hydraulic fracturing for shale gas. (Some research suggests shale gas production via hydraulic fracturing causes methane emissions that offset the clean-burning advantage of gas.) If the natural gas in Alaska could be moved to the contiguous states, substantial long-term supply would be ensured. Buyers confidently could switch to natural-gas vehicles or gas heating; utilities confidently could switch from coal-fired generation, the dirtiest form of megawatts, to gas power.
Several Alaskan natural gas pipeline routes have been proposed. All require either cutting across British Columbia or converting natural gas into a liquid for shipment by tanker. All proposals entail complex capital-intensive efforts that would take years, require government support in the form of loan or price guarantees, and almost certainly cause political brawls -- since everyone wants low-cost natural gas, but no one wants the pipelines or shipping terminals nearby.
Right now, with the price of natural gas low, private capital isn't interested in building a major pipeline to Alaska. Such a pipeline could serve the national interests of the United States for decades. That makes support of an Alaska gas pipeline an appropriate role for the federal government. Yet the Obama administration is not interested -- because only the word ''green'' is politically correct.
Some assume that the cost and complexity of major new pipelines make them politically impossible. But Canada has overcome domestic obstacles to Keystone XL.
Because the United States and Canada have a long, admirable history of cooperation, approval of the Keystone XL project is likely. But at the least, American consent for moving Canadian oil-sand products across the Midwest should be tied to Canadian consent for an Alaskan natural gas pipeline across British Columbia. The two should be a package deal.
Beyond that, policy makers need to encourage natural gas production -- and better regulations to reduce methane leaks from gas production -- while embracing natural gas as a good, though not perfect, alternative for the next few decades.

HEADLINE: Black, Female and Single

BYLINE: By ANGELA STANLEY. 
A researcher at the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University.

 BODY:
FEW things in life are more irritating than the unsolicited comments I get that black women, like me, are unlikely to marry. Family members ask, ''Are you ever going to get married?'' as if I am remaining single purposely to keep them from attending my wedding. Well-meaning married friends try to sell me on the idea that being single is liberating. And then there is my octogenarian aunt whom I love, but who also manages to unintentionally sucker punch me whenever I visit with the comment, ''Maybe if you'd just straighten your hair you'd be able to find a man.''
I'm almost positive the people in my life don't mean to add to the anxiety I already feel about being single in my 30s without children. Implicit in some of their comments is the idea that my failure to marry is beyond my control, a function of being born black and female. 
It's not simply an unhelpful observation. This culturally popular notion that 70 percent of black women don't marry is just a myth. For the last few years, I have been hearing from every source imaginable that the vast majority of black women will never marry. This never made sense to me because so many black women I know are married. And indeed, eventually, most black women do marry.
A look at recent census data will tell you that the 70 percent we keep hearing about has been misconstrued. According to 2009 data from the Census Bureau, 70.5 percent of black women in the United States had never been married -- but those were women between the ages of 25 and 29. Black women marry later, but they do marry. By age 55 and above, those numbers showed, only 13 percent of black women had never been married. In fact, people who have never married in their lifetimes are in the clear minority, regardless of race.
With all the attention on black women, I had assumed that black men must be marrying in droves; otherwise they would be the focus of similar scrutiny. Not the case. Census numbers show that 73.1 percent of black men between the ages of 25 and 29 have never been married. That is actually higher than the numbers associated with black women.
Without warrant, black women have been the main focus of the ''marriage crisis.'' Marriage as the norm in the United States has been on the decline for decades; married couples now make up less than half of American households.
So why all of the negative attention on black women?
It is part of a persistent historical and present-day attack on black people in America, with black men made into deviants and black women into problems.
As Pearl Cleage writes in ''Deals With the Devil: And Other Reasons to Riot,'' it's a no-win competition. ''We're all in terrible shape because of the presence of racism and sexism in our lives. ... Sexism is still not a word that gets used much in the black community, even though it describes a form of oppression that affects the majority population of the community -- women! -- and is no less virulent and deadly than racism.''
The marriage crisis is the just the latest example.
There are logical reasons for black women to marry in their late 30s through their 40s, compared with women of other races who are more likely to marry in their late 20s and early 30s. Significantly more black women than black men are earning college degrees. That means significantly fewer black men are on college campuses, and thus in their 20s are not in the same arenas physically, educationally or professionally, making it more difficult to find black partners of equal footing -- and the reality is that a lot of black women still prefer black men as partners. With age, the numbers of unmarried black women and men become significantly lower, suggesting that both find themselves at places in their lives where they are ready and able to commit.
Where are those black men who might be in college? The drug war has swept millions of poor people of color, a disproportionate number of whom are black men, into the criminal justice system. Generally, those men entering the system tend to be in their 20s, the age at which many women embark on their educational and career aspirations. These men have significantly reduced employment and economic opportunities and are sometimes viewed as less viable partners.
This kind of structural inequity affects everyone. My single friends and I can attest to the trials that come with having fewer dating options and outnumbering black men in our college and professional lives.
This is not to imply that there are no great single black men out there or that all single black women are the best catches, but the theories behind supply and demand are real. For some women, this dynamic is fine, but many others are opting out. Some black women choose to be single rather than settle, but rarely is this discussed as a real explanation for why some black women are unmarried. When a black woman says she is choosing to be single, most people assume she just can't get a man. And it's not as if successful black women are driving black men into the arms of women of other races. The census numbers confirm that black men largely still marry black women over any other race.
Ralph Richard Banks, a Stanford law professor, suggested in a widely reviewed book earlier this year, ''Is Marriage for White People?'' that black women should give up the dream of finding a black man and look to white, Asian or Latino men as potential mates.
Many black women are open to dating interracially. But that might be more difficult than it appears. A much talked-about report from the popular online dating Web site OKCupid.com found that black women received fewer responses than any other group, even though they sent the most messages.
They also found that white men and women have a stronger preference than any other group to date and marry within their own race. Similarly, a 2008 study from the University of California, Irvine, found that women of color were more likely to include white men in their dating pools while white men were more likely to exclude black women.
Proposing interracial dating as a solution requires more than just black women acquiescing. Understanding the numbers and the realities of single black women takes more than just a lopsided glance. Despite the visibility of people like Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Condoleezza Rice, black women as a group are still largely negatively stereotyped in movies, television, music and other forms of popular culture. However, because black men have been disproportionately affected by social inequities, black women have been implicitly conditioned not to add to that burden. Being critical of black men, instead of being supportive and sympathetic, is often viewed as adding to the problems of black men.
What has happened, though, is that black women have been silenced. When we are vocal, we are problems. The marriage debate highlights the need for black women to tell our own stories; it calls for an honest and holistic conversation that includes black men and it requires a critical analysis of structural inequities and mass incarceration.
In the meantime, I'll be working on my snappy comebacks for everyone monitoring my relationship status.

HEADLINE: Goodbye House, Hello Pot Plantation

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL. 
An economics reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
A MAN'S home is his castle -- except when it becomes someone else's marijuana plantation, crack den, movie set, homeless shelter, farm or public park.
Such opportunities for conversion present themselves in the United States, which now has about 1.2 million more vacant homes than there would be in normal economic times. In fact, the depressed housing market has become a case study in how an economy adapts -- if only in an early transitional phase -- when one of its pillars suddenly collapses.
Foreclosures, home abandonments and devalued houses have helped to inspire creative thinkers, political protesters, opportunists and civic leaders who envision new uses for homes besides nesting. 
Detroit, where nearly one in four homes is vacant, has been at the vanguard of all manner of manorial makeovers for some time now. Artists and political campaigners have adopted abandoned properties as their own nontraditional canvases, painting some empty houses bright orange or quite literally freezing them by dousing them from the roof down with hydrant water, to draw attention to the housing crisis. The Motor City's epic housing wreckage has also inspired a couple of breathtaking photography projects.
Much of the rest of the country is following suit in adapting to the housing bust with ingenuity and audaciousness.
An Atlanta filmmaker dreamed up a post-apocalyptic indie drama set in deserted and dilapidated dwellings in and around the city. In Las Vegas, where 1 in every 171 homes has been served with a foreclosure notice, the authorities found a stretch of empty homes that had been turned into marijuana greenhouses. Some empty houses have become de facto dormitories in places like Merced, Calif., as college students opt to rent chandeliered chateaus instead of living in cramped rooms on campus.
Of course, political protesters were bound to find potent symbols in the forsaken dwellings of the downturn. And so the Occupy movement last week began an action called Occupy Our Homes in cities like Chicago and Atlanta to fight evictions and protest what the movement leaders say are unfair lending practices by banks. In Oakland, Calif., protesters seized foreclosed property and turned it into a headquarters.
Not all of the repurposing is serious. In Fresno, Calif., empty McMansion swimming pools have been covertly converted into makeshift skateboarding parks, turning someone's dashed dreams into good, clean teenage fun.
Sometimes the unapproved abode adoptions are less wholesome, attracting criminal elements and feral animals, thereby unsettling neighbors and inspiring boomlets in security services and pest control. Wary of blight risks, many state and local governments are paying to fix up, tear down or rent out empty housing stock.
The governments of James City County, Va., and Perris, Calif., for example, are retrofitting foreclosed homes to make them more energy efficient, in the hope that weatherization will make the houses more attractive to buyers when the market does come back.
Across Ohio, Michigan and many other states, governments are simply bulldozing empty homes and replacing them with urban farms, public parks or other infrastructure. It's little wonder houses sit unsold and empty when tighter credit requirements have most likely discouraged some 13 million households from buying homes, according to Capital Economics. As a result, rents are at record highs, prompting some homeowners to voluntarily vacate so they can rent out their homes at a tidy profit -- the so-called leveraged move-out.
The Obama administration has expressed interest in increasing this shift from failed ownership to renting, and already federal programs are backing the process. Spacious homes in wealthier areas of Newport News, Va., and Antioch, Calif., have been converted to Section 8 housing, a program that subsidizes rent for low-income families by directly paying private landlords.
This is hardly the first time that overbuilding of luxury homes has meant hand-me-downs for low-income Americans, of course. Harlem was originally built up as a luxury community in the late 19th century, in anticipation of a new mass transit station's coming to the neighborhood. Then overbuilding and subway construction delays (sound familiar?) led housing values to plummet. By the early 1900s, poor immigrants and blacks instead absorbed the excess housing and redefined the neighborhood.
Finding brand-new homeowners may also be today's best hope for healing the depressed housing market. And as in Harlem in the early 20th century, some of those new homeowners could be immigrants. Two senators, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, have proposed a bill that would offer three-year visas to foreigners who spent at least $500,000 to buy homes in the United States. But the idea has many opponents who fear expanding the nation's oversupply of workers (a worry not shared by a fair number of economists). Still, the supply of homegrown homeowners may expand soon anyway.
Household formation has slowed dramatically since the recession, as cash-strapped families double up and unemployed recent college graduates are unable to leave behind their parents' couches. To judge just from demographic statistics, more than a million households that should have been formed in the last few years weren't, according to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.
The tally of missing households is approximately equal to the country's current surplus of vacant homes. The implication is that once people start getting jobs again, doubled-up families will peel off and quickly sop up a lot of that excess housing inventory.
Think of such houses as castles once again, though hardly out of a fairy tale.

HEADLINE: Sprinkles of Pixie Dust

BYLINE: By ANA DUTRA. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
GROWING up in Brazil, I developed a high tolerance for ambiguity. The country had a history of political instability and was volatile and complex. You never knew what you were going to find from day to day, from the price of gas to whether your parents would still have jobs.
It was also an insular country. I developed an incredible desire to see the world and often gazed at a globe. At 7 or 8, I asked my parents to send me to language classes. We spoke Portuguese and learned English and Spanish in school, but I wanted to learn other languages, too. 
One of my younger sisters had health problems, so my parents enrolled me in preschool early to devote more attention to her. I graduated from high school at 16. Then I attended a university in Rio de Janeiro during the day for a degree in economics while also attending another school at night in a different part of the city for a law degree (which I was allowed to do in Brazil).
I practiced law as part of an apprenticeship for my international law degree. At 22, I was both an economist and a lawyer . Then I taught economics at my undergraduate university while I studied for a master's in economics.
In 1985, I.B.M. was recruiting in Brazil and was the hot company to work for. I applied and was hired as a sales representative. It was a great training ground for learning about marketing. In 1991, a colleague came into my office and told me he was leaving for the United States to get an M.B.A. After work that day, I went to the United States consulate to find out more about American schools that offered the degree. I applied to Northwestern University and enrolled in its M.B.A. program in 1992.
After graduating, I worked at several consulting firms for the next 14 years. Before I moved to my current position, I was at Accenture, where I was the global managing partner for the organization strategy consulting business.
In 2008, I left and joined Korn/Ferry in its Chicago office. I run the consulting business, which helps companies with their organization strategy and their leadership and talent development. Companies often call us about C.E.O. succession. Or they have their growth strategy in place, but they're not sure what competencies and capabilities they need to develop -- and how to do so. Or they need help in finding the next generation of leaders in the company.
I started my career helping companies with growth strategy, but I felt that they lacked the capabilities to put the recommendations into practice. I moved to the organizational change area and acquired the skills to help them. From there, I moved to leadership effectiveness.
Some projects I've worked on have involved mergers where large companies had to make decisions very quickly. It's complicated to pick the best from two companies' cultures and decide which executives should stay and which should go. Every decision in the first three months after a merger is crucial to its success.
I have never forgotten something that a boss told me early in my consulting career. He asked me what we did for clients, and I said we helped them achieve their highest performance level. He said, ''No, what do you really do?'' And I said, ''We advise clients on their growth strategies.'' He said that I didn't get it, and that we really gave clients ''pixie dust.'' He explained that all executives have ambition, but that they don't believe they can fly. We were there to sprinkle pixie dust, the way Tinker Bell did in ''Peter Pan,'' and to hold their hand so they could achieve things they never thought possible. It taught me empathy. Sometimes, I bring glitter to meetings to make his point.

HEADLINE: At the Heckscher, Works Torn From Life

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
The title ''Ripped: The Allure of Collage'' hinges on a bit of clever wordplay, suggesting gym-toned bodies and six-pack abs. Of course, collage originally involved torn paper rather than taut muscles. But the hint of sexiness is appropriate, since collage is one of modern art's most seductive mediums, in which cast-off and non-art materials are assembled into avant-garde objects.
The exhibition at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington gets part of this narrative right, showcasing early collage works that resonate with the excitement of the new and slightly forbidden. The show is far weaker, however, when looking at contemporary art.
Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque first discovered the advantages of collage for creating compositions in the early 20th century when they began to use torn and cut paper, rather than paint. Papier colle, French for glued or pasted paper, became one of the earliest types of collage, but its radical possibilities were embraced and extended by artists associated with Dada, Surrealism, Pop Art and other movements. 
There are no works by Picasso or Braque here, but there are works by Hannah Hoch, Jean Arp, George Grosz and Salvador Dali. Hoch, who was involved with Dada in Berlin after World War I, is represented by ''The Dream of His Life'' from 1925, a photomontage -- that is, a collage using photographic source material -- depicting a garlanded young woman that in its imagery also leans toward Surrealism and its Freudian obsession with dreams.
Arp's undated ''Abstraction,'' a biomorphic shape made with paper, similarly negotiates the divide between Surrealism and Dada's love of the irrational and accidental, suggesting an embryo or a murky, unconscious image. Grosz, another Berlin Dadaist, is represented here, but the work is from much later, around 1958. ''Moveable Feast'' retains the critical bite of Grosz's earlier years, however, and it is applied here to consumerism in a buffet of cut-up images of eyes, mouths and noses nestled amid an abundant spread of food.
Postwar consumerism was also central to Roy Lichtenstein's Pop Art, although the two collages here, both made in 1967 using shimmery Rowlux, are nothing like the paintings of comic strips and advertisements for which he is known.
Collage accommodated oddball 20th-century artists who worked at the margins of movements. Joseph Cornell, an American who lived and worked in Queens and is sometimes associated with Surrealism, is represented by ''Penny Arcade (Lanner Waltzes Series)'' from 1962, which looks like a greeting-card version of a face pasted into a nocturnal sky. It is an unremarkable assemblage -- except that it was made by Cornell, who is something of a cult figure. Ray Johnson worked at the periphery of Pop (although it's debatable whether there was ever a ''center''). His ''Untitled (Peter Beard profile with Tarot Card, Cornell Bunnies, and Buddha),'' carries a funny date -- 1976-1987-88-89-90 -- that conjures the adage that a work of art is never completed, merely abandoned. It also pays homage to Cornell, while mixing a bit of '60s mysticism into the Pop idiom.
Romare Bearden was one of the greatest collagists of the 20th century, and an artist who was allied with Picasso in a roundabout way. Bearden, an African-American, wrote about how Picasso's embrace of African sculpture in the early 20th century was not a negative, ''primitivist'' gesture, but an affirmation of the contributions made by a continent often overlooked in global art discussions. Works from Bearden's ''Ritual Bayou'' series from around 1972 used paper and photographs to tell the story of African-Americans in the Deep South -- and hark back to Jacob Lawrence's ''Migration'' series of paintings from the 1940s, which look a bit like collages.
Miriam Schapiro's ''The Measured Heart,'' from 1982, puts forward a feminist narrative that is also subversive. Her fabric collage, which she called ''femmage,'' looks like a garish 1980s ski jacket, and that is the point. Bold, colorful and emotive, her work is an aggressive argument against the coolness of Minimalism and other late-modern movements that championed the cerebral over the passionate.
When the exhibition moves closer to the present, ''Ripped'' hits a road bump. There is a fine 2005 collage by Jane Hammond, who mines materials from children's books and scientific manuals, and there are works by Jiri Kolar and Mark Wagner, artists represented by the Manhattan gallerist Pavel Zoubek.
Mr. Wagner's funny yet critical collages, made from cut-up United States currency, are a welcome inclusion. The one here, ''Took for Granted'' from 2008, remakes Grant Wood's ''American Gothic'' from 1930, and feels perfect for a moment in which economic problems dominate the national conversation.
But the show, which was organized by Kenneth Wayne, a guest curator, comes up short when it shows three or four works each by Ethel Camhi, John Digby, Steven Ford, Frank Olt and Nancy Scheinman. The pieces are generally competent, but these artists are granted an inordinate amount of wall space; one gets the sense that Mr. Wayne has run out of ideas. And that is too bad. It leaves us with the impression that contemporary collage is difficult to track down, which is far from true.
In fact, collage is one of art's most enduring and popular forms. Its core logic, found in the juxtaposition of disparate elements culled from existing or irreverently non-art sources, has informed everything from sampling in hip-hop and, more recently, mash-ups, to the celebrated sculptures of Jessica Stockholder and Rachel Harrison, which extend collage into three dimensions.
It is also interesting to note that collage has often been a mainstay for female artists, who didn't always have access to the same training (or achieve canonization within traditional disciplines, like painting) as men did. And here Mr. Wayne could have looked back even earlier, to the scrapbooks made by Victorian women in Britain, which turned cut photographs of family, friends and famous people into fanciful, Alice-in-Wonderland-like collages.
It is easy, of course, to re-curate a show in print. But collage, with its open-endedness, allows for just this kind of thinking. In our culture, which feels as though it has seen everything, perhaps all that is left to do is creatively reimagine and reconfigure what remains. Collage may have started with papier colle, but its logic has since exploded into every realm, including postmodern architecture and culinary experimentation, resulting in things like chocolate bars laced with bacon or mushrooms.
''Ripped'' delivers a taste of collage's history and allure. But in the end, the exhibition underestimates its subject and fails to show viewers just how culturally significant the simple act of ripping paper or cutting up photos became within the swift course of a century.

HEADLINE: For a Dustier West, Air Quality Is an Issue as Murky as the Sky

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Oh say, can you see across the Grand Canyon? Not as well as you used to on some days.
The question of how clean the air is in the American West has never been an easy one to answer, strange to say. And now scientists say it is getting harder, with implications that ripple out in surprising ways, from the kitchen faucets of Los Angeles to public health clinics in canyon-land Utah to the economics of tourism.
It is at least partly about dust, something that has been entwined with Western life for a long time, and now appears to be getting worse.
In the 1800s, the high deserts stretching west and south of the Rockies became a famed destination for respiratory sufferers like ''Doc'' Holliday, the gunfighter-dentist (and tuberculosis patient), who came to take what was called the desert cure. 
But cattle and sheep by the tens of thousands were at the same time trampling across those fragile landscapes, loosening once stable soils to the four winds and creating a kind of parallel -- but equally true -- Western mythology around the tumbleweed and the dusty trail.
The region's air quality, then as now, was partly pristine and partly poor depending on when and where you looked and which way the wind blew.
But now a new and even more complicated chapter appears to be unfolding, researchers in many different fields say. From off-road vehicle use, which has in some places replaced the clumping trod of the old cattle herds, to drought's impact on plants with their soil-anchoring roots, more dust appears to be up and moving.
And scientists say they are also understanding for the first time the deep connections between the dust's main source -- a vast high-desert region called the Colorado Plateau, which stretches through four states and is home to national parks like the Grand Canyon and Arches -- and the economic, environmental and demographic life in cities and suburbs far removed.
''Changing conditions on the Colorado Plateau affect high-elevation water sources, commerce and population centers with tens of millions of people,'' said Richard L. Reynolds, a research geologist who has been studying dust at the United States Geological Survey. And with climate models suggesting a hotter, drier future in much of the West, potentially compounding dusty conditions, the dust is also opening a window on how the region is changing. ''It's giving a glimpse of what we can expect,'' Dr. Reynolds said.
In the last few years, winter dust storms on the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado have sharply increased in number, affecting the rate of melting snows into the Colorado River, a main source of water for agriculture and for the drinking supply for more than 20 million people. Of 65 so-called dust-on-snow events since 2003, when tracking began, 32 have struck in just the last three years, according to the Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies, a nonprofit research group based in Silverton, Colo. Dust can accelerate how fast snow melts because it absorbs heat.
''It's not a mysterious process,'' said Chris Landry, the organization's executive director. ''Anybody who has thrown coal dust on their driveway or sidewalk to melt it down knows the theory.''
Much of the dust carries a distinct chemical signature, too, heavy in iron oxides. The same rust-colored mineral that makes red-rock canyon country of Utah and Arizona can also absorb solar energy, again potentially accelerating the rate and timing of snow melt in crucial watersheds.
And perhaps most alarming are suggestions that asthma rates, though not definitively linked to dustier air, may be increasing.
The Utah Department of Health said in its most recent survey that asthma rates in the state's southeast corner, which is identified in other studies as a hot zone for dust deposition, had exceeded the statewide asthma prevalence for the first time in 2010 after gradually increasing over the previous few years.
The survey said that 13.6 percent of the adult residents in the deeply rural and mostly undeveloped region suffer from asthma, compared with about 7.5 percent nationally, according to federal figures.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said there was no clear explanation for the increase.
Scientists caution that links between asthma and dust are not certain. Other air problems in the West, like ground-level ozone in natural-gas drilling areas that has plagued some places in Wyoming and pollution from coal-fired power plants, complicate the air story as well. Asthma rates have also gone up in many other parts of the country.
But a study this year looking at dust generated by off-road vehicle use at the Nellis Dunes Recreation Area near Las Vegas found dust samples with naturally occurring arsenic and palygorskite, a mineral similar to asbestos, which could under certain circumstances pose potential health risks. The study, commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Land Management, said that four-wheelers and bikes stirred up as much of the mineral-laden dust as wind did.
In any event, scientists say the new dust studies are highlighting a disparity in how air is regulated.
Pollution research has mostly focused on urban areas, where air quality is historically worse, and on the tiniest of pollution particles from industrial sources, which are generally more dangerous because they can be inhaled more deeply into the lungs. The new dust problem in the West is flying under the radar: generally larger particles in areas with a lower population density involving mostly naturally occurring minerals from soil. And since dust is periodic, rather than constant -- like, say, urban vehicle emissions -- air quality standards rarely exceed the federal thresholds of compliance that can trigger action or an alert.
The ''Doc'' Holliday sort of air, pristine mostly, is what state and federal records tend to capture.
''There's a mismatch between urban issues and what appears to be emerging in these rural areas,'' said Jason C. Neff, an associate professor of geology and environmental studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ''We're not monitoring what we should be monitoring, and so we haven't been able to put it together with the human health component.''
Dr. Thomas Painter, a scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology who has written widely on dust in snow, said he could partly follow his own nose in chasing the story.
''I have horrible allergies when it comes to dust,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China's Spies Are Catching Up

BYLINE: By DAVID WISE. 
A writer and historian of intelligence and espionage. His most recent book is ''Tiger Trap: America's Secret Spy War with China.''

 BODY:
Washington
IN 1995, a middle-aged Chinese man walked into a C.I.A. station in Southeast Asia and offered up a trove of secret Chinese documents. Among them was a file containing the top-secret design of the American W-88 nuclear warhead that sits atop the missiles carried by Trident submarines.
He told a story to the C.I.A. that was so bizarre it might just be true. He said that he worked in China's nuclear program and had access to the archive where classified documents were stored. He went there after hours one night, scooped up hundreds of documents and stuffed them into a duffel bag, which he then tossed out a second-story window to evade security guards. Unfortunately, the bag broke and the papers scattered. 
Outside, he collected the files and stuffed them back into the torn bag. Although many of the documents were of interest for their intelligence content, it was the one about the W-88 that roiled American counterintelligence most because it contained highly classified details about a cutting-edge warhead design.
The United States had been producing small nuclear warheads for decades, and the Chinese were desperate to find out how to build miniaturized warheads themselves. China's military was, and still is, playing catch-up to the United States.
China's success in obtaining the secret design of the W-88 is the most dramatic example of a fact that United States counterintelligence agencies have been slow to recognize: just as China has become a global economic power, it has developed a world-class espionage service -- one that rivals the C.I.A.
During the cold war, dozens of counterintelligence agents in the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. pursued Soviet and then Russian spies. The K.G.B. was seen as the enemy; China took a back seat. Only a handful of F.B.I. agents specialized in Chinese spy cases, and their work was not regarded as career-enhancing. Washington's ongoing failure to make Chinese espionage a priority has allowed China to score a number of successes in its espionage efforts against the United States.
China's foreign intelligence service and its military intelligence agency actively spy on the American defense industry, our nuclear weapons labs, Silicon Valley, our intelligence agencies and other sensitive targets.
In January, when Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, was visiting China, Beijing unveiled a stealth fighter jet, the J-20. The disclosure demonstrated that China had achieved a stealth capability, allowing it to conceal its planes, ships and missiles from radar -- similar to the American stealth technology that China has been seeking to acquire by clandestine means for years.
Later that month, an engineer who worked on the B-2 stealth bomber for Northrop Grumman was sentenced to 32 years in prison for passing defense secrets to China. In exchange for more than $100,000, he had helped design a stealth exhaust system for China's cruise missiles to make it difficult to detect and destroy them.
And in August, reports attributed to American intelligence officials asserted that Pakistan had allowed Chinese experts to inspect the remains of the stealth helicopter that crashed during the May mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Although Pakistan and China denied the reports, Beijing would have a great interest in examining the tail of the Black Hawk helicopter, the part of the aircraft that was not destroyed by the Navy Seals team, to learn more secret details of American stealth technology.
Meanwhile, the mystery of the leaked W-88 warhead design remains unsolved. At first, the American government suspected that Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos nuclear scientist, had leaked the W-88, but it produced no evidence that he had done so. He was held in solitary confinement for nine months, eventually pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling classified information and won an extraordinary apology from the federal judge who presided over the case.
Misled by the Energy Department, the F.B.I. had chased the wrong person for three years. Finally, in 1999, Robert Bryant, then the bureau's deputy director, enlisted Stephen Dillard, a veteran counterintelligence agent, to head a major investigation of how China had acquired the design of the W-88.
The inquiry was led by the F.B.I. and run by a task force of 300 investigators from 11 federal agencies, including the Defense Department, the C.I.A., the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. On Sept. 11, 2001, some of the investigators were killed when American Airlines Flight 77 was flown by terrorists into the Pentagon.
But the investigation went on. Mr. Dillard's task force, operating out of public view, looked at the nuclear weapons laboratories, government agencies and defense contractors in California and several other states who had manufactured parts of the warhead. The F.B.I. interviewed the walk-in, who was by now living in the United States, but he could shed no light on the source of the document.
Finally, after four years, the investigation ended with American intelligence agencies no closer to knowing how China obtained the secret design of the nuclear warhead. The answer remains locked up in Beijing.
More than a decade later, China's spies continue to conduct espionage against military targets. Last year, a Pentagon official was sentenced to prison, the last of 10 people rounded up by the F.B.I., all members of a loosely connected Chinese spy network on the West and East Coasts that was run by Lin Hong, a spymaster in Beijing. The data that made its way to China included information on the Navy's Quiet Electric Drive, designed to make submarines harder to detect, the B-1 bomber and projected American arms sales to Taiwan.
China has even penetrated the F.B.I. In 2003, Katrina Leung, an F.B.I. informant for two decades, was found to be working as a double agent for Beijing. Astonishingly, the two top F.B.I. agents in California responsible for Chinese counterintelligence were having affairs with Ms. Leung at the same time, allowing her to help herself to classified documents that were brought to her home by one of the agents.
China's success in stealing American secrets will provide a continuing challenge to the spy catchers. And Washington's counterintelligence agents, accustomed to the comfortable parameters of the cold war and more recent battles against Al Qaeda, must rethink their priorities and shift their focus, resources and energy eastward to counter China's spies.
If not, more secrets like the W-88 nuclear warhead will continue to find their way to Beijing.

HEADLINE: In Euro Era, Opening Bell Is a 2:30 A.M. Alarm

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
As the European debt crisis roils the markets, American traders who once awoke at dawn are now rising in the dead of night to gain an edge when business begins in London, Paris and Frankfurt.
Gone are the days when traders showed up to work just before the New York Stock Exchange opened at 9:30 a.m. Now, Wall Street has an unofficial opening bell: the 2:30 a.m. alarm clock.
''We have a new credo: carpe noctem -- seize the night,'' said Douglas A. Kass, a hedge fund manager who routinely sets his alarm for precisely that time to scan the headlines coming out of Europe. All last week, the musings of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other European leaders put the markets on edge. ''You are almost forced to get up and watch the goings-on,'' he added. 
The nest of night owls is growing more crowded. Senior executives at the Pacific Investment Management Company, the giant bond-trading house, wake up at 1 a.m. in Southern California, to check their BlackBerrys for updates from colleagues in Europe.
''Your nerves are twitching,'' said Christian Stracke, Pimco's global head of credit research.
Michael Mayo, a longtime bank stock analyst, said he was working the lobster shift so often just to keep up with the latest International Monetary Fund rescue or Slovenian parliamentary vote that he might as well call himself a 24-hour-a-day research shop. ''Who would have thought we would have to be looking at Italian sovereign debt yields to figure out what Morgan Stanley's stock will do?'' he said.
For traders, there is too much to lose if they sleep through history.
That's why Craig Gorman, a partner at First New York Securities, routinely monitors his trading positions in the middle of the night. He turns on CNBC and fires up the Bloomberg terminal with six screens at the foot of his bed. ''With the TV and all my monitors on, it gets a little bright in there,'' he said. ''My wife is not thrilled about it.''
The other downside? It is hard to fall back asleep once the adrenaline from trading starts pumping. Even so, Mr. Gorman said it was worth the price: ''You can't get the same feel for market psychology looking back at the charts in the morning as when you are up,'' he added.
News organizations and brokerage firms see an uptick in early-morning activity, too. Bloomberg reports at least a 30 percent jump from a year ago in the use of its mobile applications, which allow customers to remotely log into the trading terminal at their office desk. The biggest spikes have occurred well before the New York markets open, between 5 and 7 a.m., when traders wake up and commute to work, as well as between midnight and 3 a.m., when trading in Asia winds down and the European markets open, according to company officials.
CNBC has recorded a 50 percent increase in the tiny audience watching ''Worldwide Exchange,'' which broadcasts between 4 and 6 a.m. Traffic on its Web site between 2 and 5 a.m. has risen about 30 percent compared with a year ago.
There are also signs that predawn trading by American retail investors has increased. TD Ameritrade, which caters to individual investors, said customer trading volume in S.& P. futures -- a bet on the coming day's direction in the market -- has more than doubled between 3 and 6 a.m. over the last year.
Wall Street has long been the land of the early riser, and plenty of fixations in high finance have come and gone. In the late 1970s and 1980s, traders obsessed over the state of the money supply; in the late 1990s, they focused on rapidly rising Web page views of the leading dot-com companies. Last year, traders acted like armchair engineers in deep-water drilling as they monitored images of the BP oil spill gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.
Whether or not Europe's new plan struck on Friday to achieve budgetary discipline brings market stability, some suggest that the current middle-of-the-night frenzy heralds a lasting change for an industry that coined the term ''bankers' hours.''
''It is now making people aware that they can become a global trader,'' said J. J. Kinahan, the chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. ''They don't have to rely on the hours of the New York Stock Exchange'' between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time.
Several forces are at play. The convergence of mobile technology and financial information allows investors to trade on news -- anywhere, anytime. The markets, meanwhile, have grown so interconnected that what happens with sovereign bonds can quickly affect equities.
Any whiff of trouble in Europe can send markets into a tailspin and easily overwhelm the hard-earned edge a trader might have gained by digging deep into the financials of an individual stock.
''The degree to which asset prices are connected is off the charts,'' said Dean Curnutt, the president of Macro Risk Advisors and another early riser.
That is the main reason that Brad Alford, the chief investment officer of Alpha Capital in Atlanta, rolls over in bed, grabs his iPad and glances at the Bloomberg market feeds with one eye, sometimes two, before the sun comes up. Or why Mr. Kass trudges over to his poolside home office in Palm Beach, Fla., to e-mail hedge fund friends about the latest troubled country du jour. ''There is a pretty active cabal in those early hours,'' he said.
It is also why Al Moniz, a European bond fund manager at Fore Research and Management in New York, has been waking up at 2 a.m. at least several times a month, and expects even more bleary-eyed nights next year.
''It is probably going to get worse,'' he said. ''I don't think there is any end in sight.''

HEADLINE: Pet Supplies? Yarn? Patter? 'I Got That'

BYLINE: By ANDREW COTTO

 BODY:
NOT all of Brooklyn glows with gentrification. Deep in the borough's southwest pocket is Bath Beach, a few dozen blocks sandwiched between Bensonhurst and the Belt Parkway. Shuttered storefronts and signs in competing languages testify to economic hardship and ethnic flux. But amid the comings and goings is a monument to fortitude: Nick's Discount Store.
The double-wide storefront offers an astounding assortment of goods. Stacked on shelves and lining the narrow aisles are groceries, greeting cards, gift bags, toys, remedies and holiday decorations. There are lawn ornaments, skin lotions, school supplies, pet supplies, coin wrappers, yarn, diapers, picture frames -- pretty much everything. There's a full deli up front, and a counter where the store's owner, Dominick Cavalieri, known as Big Nick, holds forth. 
Mr. Cavalieri, 49, is tall and angular, with a shaved head, thin-framed glasses and a large silver cross around his neck. His gesturing hands encourage conviviality, and he is always ready to hear anyone's business and share opinions on any subject.
''What's doing, kid?'' he asked a young man in a Giants jersey one recent morning; the customer was bemoaning his team's record.
''Ahh,'' Mr. Cavalieri said, waving those hands. ''They got smacked around. So what?''
A rival fan weighed in, predicting a playoff berth for the Jets.
''Get out of here,'' Mr. Cavalieri laughed. ''They're terrible, too.''
Mr. Cavalieri broke from the chatter to give a woman wearing a hijab change for the bus, and a warm smile.
Then he pressed a lard roll, filled with salami and provolone, on a young boy, the grandson of a regular, who had said he was hungry. ''They're good, right?'' Mr. Cavalieri asked.
Another customer asked for a certain kind of Christmas light. ''I got that,'' Nick said.
''I got that'' is something Nick says often, whatever the request -- even if it's not directed at him. A woman was trying to wave Nick away as she spoke into her cellphone about vacuum seal storage bags. Finally, Mr. Cavalieri was able to win her attention.
''What, Nick?'' she asked with impatience. ''What?''
''I got that!'' Mr. Cavalieri cried, shaking his hands as if they were on fire.
Mr. Cavalieri was born in an era when Bath Beach was largely Italian-American. As a teenager, he delivered liquor for a store on the same block of Bath Avenue where, 17 years ago, he opened his store. His constant patter with customers can make the cluttered space seem even tighter, especially once the confidences start flying.
''You know,'' Mr. Cavalieri said with a shrug, ''I know people's problems, and they know mine. It's not a problem.''
''It's a problem for me,'' Pauly Tagliatele, 26, joked from behind the deli counter. As a teenager, Mr. Tagliatele lasted only one day as an employee at the store, but he came back three years ago to a job as varied as the store's offerings, doing whatever is necessary to keep customers happy.
These days, having customers to keep happy is the challenge, though. A discount store has to move a lot of merchandise, and making regulars out of new neighbors of Arab and Asian descent has been a challenge. Mr. Cavalieri meets newcomers on the sidewalk, holds barbecues in the summer and distributes candy on Halloween. A beefy friend of his works out front in a Santa costume during the holiday season.
''The first generation is the hardest,'' Mr. Cavalieri said. ''But you work hard to make people feel welcome. Like part of the neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: Will Staten Island Change? Should It?

 BODY:
In last week's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante wrote about a major waterfront development project on Staten Island's North Shore, asking whether it could help attract young people to the borough, as similar initiatives have helped revitalize other New York neighborhoods.
I am a 24 year old living on Staten Island (born and raised); college educated and have worked on the island for a while. After a brief move to Williamsburg, I returned to Staten Island and will likely remain here. I am an artist and often frequent ETG, Deep Tanks, the Full Cup and other contemporary arts galleries, shows and venues. 
I think this article paints a very shallow portrait of Staten Island's North Shore. While some young people choose to move away, many come back once they realize how quaint and vibrant Staten Island actually is.MWest
Staten Island
Downtown SI by the waterfront has always been home to a small community of artists/writers, musicians who are attracted to the Victorian homes within two historic districts, great space and water/city views.
I don't see it becoming another showy Williamsburg type of place but rather more like a quaint Cobble Hill/Carroll Gardens neighborhood.
Many more educated professionals in their 30s have moved here from Bklyn/Manhattan since I moved here five years ago. The redevelopment of the 36-acre waterfront with hotel, office space, retail by a reputable developer will surely speed things up.George
Stapleton Heights
Overlooked in this article, and in city planning in general, is the relentless and destructive effect of walling in the waterfront.
This neighborhood will get awfully ordinary when development blocks the remaining views of the river and Manhattan.
For sure the views IN the developments will be great, but at the expense of the views from the roads, sidewalks and homes.
Dan Chilton
Staten Island
Staten Islanders should not have to pay NYC taxes, because it feels like a total waste of a lot of money. Without the monetary penalty, S.I. would really blossom. Of course, it will never happen, but one can always dream.
Jim
Kings Park, NY
The last thing we need is to detach ourselves from the connection to this region's economic engine -- namely, the City of New York.
Its diverse business and arts sectors are what keep our ridiculously low property taxes ridiculously low. Its range of vital services and sophisticated service-delivery mechanisms make life livable for many low-to-moderate-income Staten Islanders.
We could never provide those services with a local economy whose largest employer is a private hospital. Secession is a loser on Staten Island, as a recent attempt to revive it proved.
bencharif
Staten Island, NY
It's one thing to develop like Hoboken and Jersey City, it's another thing to recognize that those city's public transit into Manhattan is a large reason for their success.
There will not be better public transit for Staten Island as long as the people and the local elected officials there clamor more about access into Manhattan for their cars than for better public transit.
AuntBarb
Staten Island
Staten Island's North Shore needs public transportation. This should be amazingly easy to accomplish.
There is an abandoned track running from the Staten Island Ferry Terminal all the way across the North Shore of the island, along the Kill Van Kull. This line was part of the Staten Island Rapid Transit system, later known as the SIRT. It ran until 1953, when it was abandoned by its owner, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
This forgotten rail line is waiting to be reopened. Furthermore, a bridge over the Kill Van Kull could connect it to existing lines in Bayonne, which in turn could lead directly to Manhattan.George Jochnowitz

HEADLINE: Anarchist Anthropology

BYLINE: By THOMAS MEANEY. 
Thomas Meaney, an editor of The Utopian, is a doctoral student in history at Columbia University.

 BODY:
The anthropologist David Graeber has a strong claim to being the house theorist of Occupy Wall Street. A veteran of the antiglobalization uprisings in Seattle and Genoa, he helped orchestrate the first ''General Assembly'' in New York this summer, and has since become one of the movement's most outspoken defenders. For him, the encampments in cities across the country prefigure the kind of anti-hierarchical, stateless society that ought to be our future. In a recent opinion article in The Guardian of London, Graeber proclaimed OWS ''the opening salvo in a wave of negotiations over the dissolution of the American Empire.'' For a movement that has attracted an array of political sympathies, his voice reminds us that at its organizational core, Occupy Wall Street cleaves to anarchist principles. 
But Graeber's most important contribution to the movement may owe less to his activism as an anarchist than to his background as an anthropologist. His recent book DEBT: The First 5,000 Years (Melville House, $32) reads like a lengthy field report on the state of our economic and moral disrepair. In the best tradition of anthropology, Graeber treats debt ceilings, subprime mortgages and credit default swaps as if they were the exotic practices of some self-destructive tribe. Written in a brash, engaging style, the book is also a philosophical inquiry into the nature of debt -- where it came from and how it evolved. Graeber's claim is that the past 400 years of Western history represent a grievous departure from how human societies have traditionally thought about our obligations to one another. What makes the work more than a screed is its intricate examination of societies from ancient Mesopotamia to 1990s Madagascar, and thinkers ranging from Rabelais to Nietzsche -- and to George W. Bush's brother Neil.
That an anthropologist should feel obliged to assess the role of debt in modern society is perhaps no surprise. The discipline has always taken pride in undermining the assumptions of classical economics. In 1925 the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss published his classic essay ''The Gift,'' which argued that contrary to the textbook account of primitive man merrily trading beaver pelts for wampum, no society was ever based on barter. The dominant practice for thousands of years was instead voluntary gift-giving, which created a binding sense of obligation between potentially hostile groups. To give a gift was not an act based on calculation, but on the refusal to calculate. In the societies Mauss studied most closely -- the Maori of New Zealand, the Haida of the Pacific Northwest -- people rejected the principles of economic self-interest in favor of arrangements where everyone was perpetually indebted to someone else.
Picking up where Mauss left off, Graeber argues that once-prevalent relationships based on an incalculable sense of duty deteriorated as buying and selling became the basis of society and as money, previously a marker of favors owed, became valuable in its own right. The first interest-bearing loans originated in ancient Mesopotamia. Poor farmers would borrow from merchants or officials, fall into arrears, see their farms and livestock seized and, in many cases, their families taken as debt peons. Faced with the prospect of social chaos, Sumerian and Babylonian kings periodically announced ''declarations of debt freedom,'' known in Biblical times as the Law of Jubilee, which canceled all debts more than seven years old. As Graeber points out, the first word for ''freedom'' known in any language, the Sumerian ''amargi,'' means literally ''return to mother'' -- presumably, because all the indentured children were free to go home.
With debt at the heart of revolts and palace coups throughout the ancient world, the world's great religions felt compelled to weigh in. Morality, they held, had to be based on something higher than paying one's debts to society. The Lord's Prayer, Graeber reminds us, could just as well read ''forgive us our debts, just as we forgive our debtors'' -- and Christ was called a ''Redeemer.'' But at the same time, religions used a logic of their own to speak of the immeasurable debts we owe to God or the cosmos, and savvy monarchs used that vocabulary to entrench their own power. In many languages, the word ''debt'' is the same as ''sin'' (in some cases the interest could be paid in sacrifices, but the principal was always one's life).
The traditional understanding of debt as moral obligation changed radically in the 17th century, according to Graeber, when people started to see themselves as independent contractors who could rent out their services to fellow citizens. Individuals now faced one another as equals, and the language of the feudal household -- ''please'' (as in ''if you please, My Lord'') and ''thank you'' (which derives from ''think,'' as in ''I will think on it'' or remember) -- lost its deferential connotations and entered everyday life. But there was a dark side to these developments. ''Those who have argued that we are the natural owners of our rights and liberties,'' Graeber writes, ''have been mainly interested in asserting that we should be free to give them away, or even to sell them.'' Although ''mainly'' is a bit tendentious, Graeber's point is that we ended up enslaving ourselves by thinking of ourselves as fully autonomous. As anyone who works a 9-to-5 job knows, the ''right'' to sell one's labor hardly feels like privilege.
So what, then, is to be done? Graeber finds reasons for hope in some unexpected places: corporations where elite management teams often operate more communistically than communes; in the possibility of a Babylonian-style Jubilee for Third World nations and students saddled with government loans; and from his own study of the Malagasy people of Madagascar, who he claims were adept at evading the snares of consumer debt encouraged by the state. But there is a sizable gulf between Graeber's anthropological insights and his utopian political prescriptions. ''Debt'' ends with a paean to the ''non-industrious poor.'' ''Insofar as the time they are taking off from work is being spent . . . enjoying and caring for those they love,'' Graeber writes, they are the ''pioneers of a new economic order that would not share our current one's penchant for self-destruction.''
It's an old dream among anthropologists -- one that goes back to Rousseau. In 1968, Graeber's own teacher, Marshall Sahlins, wrote an essay, ''The Original Affluent Society,'' which maintained that the hunters and gatherers of the Paleolithic period rejected the ''Neolithic Great Leap Forward'' because they correctly saw that the advancements it promised in tool-making and agriculture would reduce their leisure time. Graeber approves. He thinks it's a mistake when unions ask for higher wages when they should go back to picketing for fewer working hours.
Whatever becomes of the Occupy movements, the politics of debt are now our politics. While politicians argue over how to unwind our liabilities, Graeber uses his reading of the historical and ethnographic record to imagine a world where such liabilities might be forgiven altogether. James Scott, a former colleague of Graeber's at Yale, takes a more limited and tragic view of the possibilities anthropology can offer social movements. ''David's become something of a cult figure in anthropology now,'' Scott said. ''His field work on Madagascar is well respected, but it's worth remembering that academics are bad at looking into the future.'' ''Still,'' he added, ''if we can't tolerate cantankerous people like David, then we don't deserve to exist.''

HEADLINE: Peru Official Steps Down Amid Fight Over a Mine

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Peru's cabinet chief, Salomon Lerner, abruptly resigned Saturday after failing to negotiate a resolution to simmering protests against a large mining project led by an American company, the Newmont Mining Corporation. Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, replaced Mr. Lerner with his interior minister, Oscar Valdes Dancuart, a former military officer. 
Mr. Humala, himself a former military officer, did not disclose the reason for the resignation of Mr. Lerner, a noted moderate who led his campaign. But the shake-up raises questions over a potential reorientation of policy by Mr. Humala, who became known for leading a failed military uprising in 2000.
Aldo Panfichi, a political analyst at Catholic University in Lima, Peru, said the move could signal a shift from the conciliatory policies of Mr. Lerner toward a more hard-line approach. ''The new minister is a retired military man who had been Humala's instructor,'' Mr. Panfichi said, noting that Mr. Humala relies on royalties from mining projects to finance social welfare programs.
The resignation comes at a difficult time for Mr. Humala, who declared a state of emergency last week in the northern region of Cajamarca after weeks of clashes between demonstrators and the police over the $4.8 billion gold and copper mine proposed by Newmont and a Peruvian company, Buenaventura.
The Conga mine, which has drawn the anger of farmers in Cajamarca who say it would contaminate water supplies, is among Peru's largest private investments. Aided by high global commodities prices, Peru's economy has recently benefited from exports from other large mines. But protests against numerous projects have persisted.
In a resignation letter, Mr. Lerner said he had sought to achieve ''dialogue and a search for consensus.'' By resigning, he said, Mr. Humala could move on with a ''new stage of government work.''

HEADLINE: In Vermont, Slides and Slopes Side by Side

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
SEVEN miles from the Canadian border in northern Vermont, Jay Peak has always been so remote that only the ardent found it. For those who did, the mountain's miles of out-of-bounds terrain became a cultlike destination, drawing a loyal, if limited, following that included many Canadians.
Most days, that did not add up to what you would ever call a crowd. Despite being blessed with an annual snowfall that usually exceeds that of every other Eastern resort, Jay Peak was largely overlooked by American tourists.
A glimpse of the local niceties helped explain why: Yes, there was running water in the lodge and electricity in the dated hotel. There was a cafeteria and congested bar. Ten miles down the road, you could stay at Grandpa Grunts, a $35-a-night hostel-like lodge with a basement B.Y.O.B. lounge. 
But watch your step. On your next visit, you might trip into the just-completed wave pool at Jay Peak's 50,000-square-foot glass-enclosed water park, which is heated like a tropical paradise -- one with water slides and a retractable roof. It's right there, a few steps from the all-suite hotel and the professional-size hockey rink that went up last year.
From there, it's a short walk to the new Nordic center and golf clubhouse. Soon, you will be able to get a penthouse suite overlooking it all at the 173-room Hotel Jay, which will have a conference center and three restaurants.
All this luxury and leisure activity at Jay Peak is north of Stowe, Sugarbush and Stratton -- north of everything in Vermont but the customs stations entering Quebec.
And where, oh where, has scruffy, unkempt but lovable Jay Peak gone?
''It's certainly a culture shock, but we will never lose sight of our core values,'' said Bill Stenger, a co-owner of Jay Peak. ''The mountain and the freedom to enjoy it are still the essence of the experience. But if we didn't adapt, the ski operation by itself might not survive.''
The new Jay Peak is the latest example of an ever-expanding working model for a snow-sports resort, and it is built on this premise: diversify or die. Become a four-season resort (or at least a two-season resort), and the skiing and riding operation will be swept along with the ancillary profit. Try to make it as a major resort with only a stand-alone winter business, and one overly warm, snowless winter could bring bankruptcy.
''Jay Peak needed to give people other things to do,'' Mr. Stenger said. ''And there's nothing wrong with that. In many families, there are people who don't ski or snowboard. There are young children who don't want to ski seven hours in a day.''
The hope is that a remade mountain resort can be all things to all people, without offending any constituency.
Jay Peak, the fancied-up version, began its metamorphosis in 2008 with the construction of the all-suite Tram Haus Lodge, the first stage of a development entirely financed by the federal EB-5 program. The resort's management raised about $250 million through the program, which permits foreign investors to obtain green cards in exchange for a minimum $500,000 investment in capital projects in high-unemployment areas. The project must create at least 10 new jobs.
Jay Peak has found more than 330 investors from 55 countries and is recruiting more. The resort said that this has translated to more than 3,000 direct and indirect jobs in the life of the development.
On my first visit to Jay Peak 25 years ago, I walked into what seemed like an oversize hut next to one of the lifts. I asked where I could find the base lodge.
The woman behind the counter began giggling, and that's when I knew I was in the base lodge. But, oh boy, what a great day of skiing there was to be had outside that little building.
No one arriving at Jay Peak these days will wonder where the base of activity is. The hotels, rink and water park beckon, looming at the top of the resort's access road, and I admit that at first they were jarring. But even I, a New England native and something of a skiing purist, had one of the most varied and entertaining trips to Jay ever over the recent Thanksgiving weekend.
It started with several quick descents on reliable, top-to-bottom snow over the mountain's east side. This was made possible thanks both to improved snowmaking ability and the phenomenon known as the Jay Cloud -- a cloud that locals insist hovers over the mountain during snowstorms and had recently delivered nearly a foot of snow.
The Jay Cloud is myth to some and meteorological reality to others, but the fact is that Jay Peak often reports 2 to 10 inches more snow than other Vermont resorts after most snowstorms. That pushes the season total beyond 400 inches some winters.
Still, on a warm weekend, even the Jay Cloud had its limits. By noon, the sun was softening the early snow, and it was time for lunch. Traditionally, lunch was a meal that offered little in the way of options beyond cafeteria chicken fingers and hot dogs, so most Jay veterans would bring their own, hunkering down in the small, cramped lodges with sandwiches and Tupperware.
But on this trip, we found a place to sit at Alice's Table, where the menu is replete with ingredients drawn from nearby farmers and foragers. Among the choices: butternut-squash soup, seared venison and grilled chicken breast with a Vermont Cheddar gratin.
But while the ''new'' is certainly omnipresent, notable efforts have been made to remind visitors of the mountain's past. Old chairlift-tower wheels were assimilated into the design of the Tower Bar of the lodge, for example. The tables inside Alice's Table were created from local reclaimed barn wood from neighboring farms. The throw blankets inside the 57 suites were manufactured by Johnson Woolen Mills 30 miles down the road.
In past years after lunch, the only Jay Peak choice would have been more skiing or snowboarding. And indeed, if it had been midwinter and the entire mountain was open, we would have happily headed back out.
But with limited terrain open and a brand-new water park right there, I concede I was soon sitting in the 85-degree Pump House water park, where I gazed up at the snowy mountain trails I had just traversed through wide-paneled glass windows. And I did not feel too bad about that choice at all.
It wasn't until a few minutes later, when I was standing in the entry to La Chute, the Pump House's signature water slide, that I started to question my decision. La Chute, it seems fair to say, was designed especially for those self-congratulatory hard-core skiers who might scoff at the softer pleasures a water park offers.
If there is such a thing, La Chute is a double black diamond water slide. To enter La Chute, you step into an upright, cryptlike chamber with a glass lid that slowly and scarily closes around you head to toe. There is a countdown before an attendant pushes a button, which releases the trapdoor floor of the chamber, and you plummet at a rate of 45 miles an hour through the chute.
After several twists and turns, including a long upside-down flip, you splash into a collection area. I immediately understood why I was warned beforehand to tighten the drawstring on my swimsuit. La Chute is intense, and maybe not for everyone, but it was worth it. I'll add that I was just as happy with my next decision: a drink at the 50-foot-long mezzanine bar overlooking the Pump House ground-floor playground.
Mr. Stenger said that lodging reservations for the 2011-12 season were already up 120 percent from last season. Some of the increase is due to the hockey teams playing tournaments in the ice rink that opened last year. Youth teams seem oddly attracted to the rink and water park combination.
''Much of that added revenue will be funneled back into making the mountain experience better,'' Mr. Stenger said. ''It will mean more snowmaking, a better ticketing system, and we plan to develop another 250 acres for trails on the west edge of the mountain. It's an area that gets a lot of natural snow, and we can add some intermediate tree runs and classic New England twisters.''
The plan is to open that area in three years.
Still, for all the fun a tourist might have, not everyone was happy with the new direction at Jay Peak. The Internet chatter and protests registered by Jay Peak's most staunch, and longtime, devotees was fiercest when the base-area development began in 2009 (though the jobs created by the extensive construction seemed to quell some of the dissent).
On a different visit in February, when the Tram House Lodge and hockey rink had already attracted more overnight visitors, I occasionally heard the Jay Peak lifers complaining in lift lines, something you could not have heard before, since it was hard to find a lift line. In the Tower Bar at the end of the day, Bob Green, who lives in nearby Newport, Vt., noted that he never had to wade past a row of tourists to get a Sam Adams lager in the old Jay Peak days.
Standing near him, his friend Tommy Sanderson added, ''True, but at least we now have room to drink it.''
IF YOU GO
Jay Peak is not the easiest place to get to, which is part of its charm. Everyone who makes it there is a devotee. Or a local. Or both.
The mountain is about a six-hour drive from New York City with no traffic or four hours from Boston. Multiple airlines serve the Burlington International Airport, and it's about a 75-minute drive northeast to Jay Peak.
Most of the lodging is resort-owned and at the base of the lifts, with the 57-suite Tram Haus Lodge (802-988-2611) now open and the Hotel Jay, more than three times as big as the Tram Haus Lodge, set to open in February.
There are several bed-and-breakfasts and small inns in the area, but they are generally spartan after years of catering to the ski-bum crowd. Grandpa Grunts (802-326-4572), an inexpensive hostel-like choice, is about 10 miles down the road if you are a college student or want to feel like one again.
If you go before the Hotel Jay opens, you will have a short walk to and from the Tram Haus Lodge when visiting the water park, so bring something to wear on the way back. Northern Vermont is especially cold with wet hair. Once the hotel opens, there will be a connected walkway to those rooms.
There are good dining choices at the resort, but have at least one meal at the Belfry (802-326-4400), just down the access road toward the little town of Montgomery, Vt. A former country schoolhouse, the Belfry is loud and rustic with a bar full of locals. Order from the large blackboard of specials, which always seem to include a surprisingly vast array of fish and steak, and you shouldn't be disappointed.

HEADLINE: What Latin America Can Teach Us

BYLINE: By JORGE G. CASTANEDA. 
A professor of politics and Latin American and Caribbean studies at New York University, who served as foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.

 BODY:
IN a Bertelsmann Foundation study on social justice released this fall, the United States came in dead last among the rich countries, with only Greece, Chile, Mexico and Turkey faring worse. Whether in poverty prevention, child poverty, income inequality or health ratings, the United States ranked below countries like Spain and South Korea, not to mention Japan, Germany or France.
It was another sign of how badly Americans are hurting their middle class. Wars, famine and violence have devastated middle classes before, in Germany and Japan, Russia and Eastern Europe. But when the smoke cleared and the dust settled, a social structure roughly similar to what existed before would always resurface.
No nation has ever lost an existing middle class, and the United States is not in danger of that yet. But the percentage of national income held by the top 1 percent of Americans went from about 10 percent in 1980 to 24 percent in 2007, and that is a worrisome signal. 
So before the United States continues on its current road of dismantling its version of the welfare state, of shredding its social safety net, of expanding the gap between rich and poor, Americans might do well to glance south. The lesson is that even after a large middle class emerges, yawning inequities between rich and poor severely strain any society's cohesion and harmony.
If ever a geographical stereotype had some truth to it, it would be that in Latin America, where a handful of immensely wealthy magnates wielded power over a sea of the poor. If there has ever been a social cliche with roots in reality, it would be that a vast middle class was always the backbone of the United States' strength.
The United States has never had the type of robust welfare state that Europeans built after World War II. It didn't need that. Through private initiative and efforts to equalize opportunity, Americans long ago ensured that a huge middle class would provide the social glue to hold their society together.
If that middle class withers, what might America look like? Well, what Latin America used to be, and in some ways still struggles to stop being.
So here are two questions: Does the United States really want to look like what Latin America was? And is there a lesson to be learned from its neighbors to the south -- that once inequality becomes entrenched, reversing it becomes incredibly difficult?
Consider, first, some history. From the pre-Columbian era through most of the 20th century, conventional wisdom painted Latin America as the planet's most unequal region, where the extreme poverty of its destitute was matched only by the extreme wealth of its rich.
In fact, this perception began departing from reality some 50 years ago in most of the region, and today it is true for only a few nations: Haiti, Honduras, Bolivia and maybe Nicaragua. By 1970, the larger nations like Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Peru had all witnessed the emergence of sizable middle classes. Others, like Argentina and Uruguay, had been, for all practical purposes, middle-class societies since at least midcentury (although the Argentines in later decades worked hard at regressing.)
But there was always a gulf between those societies and the United States. Until quite recently, the Latin middle classes made up barely one-third of the population, and some of their most prominent members -- Che Guevara in Argentina, Fidel Castro in Cuba, Salvador Allende in Chile -- made political careers out of the cause of eradicating inequality. That cause was shared by thousands of students, union leaders, academics and middle-of-the-road politicians, who found their own way of life morally intolerable and politically untenable.
After years of frustration and failure, at the end of the 20th century something began to change. And over the last 15 years the trend has become unmistakable. According to one definition of the middle class used in recent research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the middle class is in the majority in Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Costa Rica and to a lesser extent Colombia. In the 1960s and '70s, even after decades of robust growth, those middle classes were barely at 30 percent; today in Mexico, Brazil and Chile the figures range from 55 to 60 percent.
Yes, it is still a slim and precarious majority, and it is not your mother's middle class -- as secure and well-off as in Europe, North America, Japan or South Korea. The Latin middle class still struggles, with living standards far behind those of the local affluent. But a middle class it is nonetheless: with cellphones and used cars; with tiny but well-built homes with every appliance; and with modest but deeply enjoyable holidays at the beach.
Consumer markets have expanded. The World Bank and the O.E.C.D., writers like this one and universities like the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro have produced reams of data and analysis about the size, depth and lasting power of this middle class. Politicians know they can be elected only if they connect with that class and are doomed when they appeal exclusively to the poor, who, though now a minority, are still too large a share of the population.
So it can be said that much of Latin America has arrived: it is democratic, with a slight but growing majority of its people prosperous, competitive and possessing international ambitions (real, though not always realistic).
But reducing poverty and building broad middle classes do not automatically reduce inequality. The statistical measures of inequality known as Gini coefficients have begun to fall slightly in Latin America, but remain the highest in the world, with the wealthiest 1 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent of the population controlling incredibly high shares of total wealth or income. In Brazil, Chile and Mexico, which together account for nearly 70 percent of the region's G.D.P. and population, the wealthiest 10 percent held an average of 42 percent of national income in 2008-9; the equivalent figure for the United States was 29 percent.
This is why hundreds of thousands of Chilean students have brought their country's government to a virtual standstill this year, even though Chile is the most successful Latin nation by any economic or social standard. It is why Colombia, Brazil and Mexico have murder or kidnapping rates far higher than those of the richer nations, which are, despite their wealth, less unequal.
Indeed, the historic inequalities that linger have produced singular traits of national character, handed down between generations, that must change if these societies are to continue equalizing their wealth and realizing their promise. Brazilian fatalism, Chilean insularity and Mexican individualism are being slowly shed. And that is good; these traits should be jettisoned completely if these societies ever hope to achieve the level of equality for which the United States has been their model.
And yet, as all of this is occurring, the United States -- that epitome of the middle-class society, of the egalitarian dream that pulled millions of immigrants away from Latin America -- has begun to go Latin American. It is in a process of structural middle-class shrinkage and inequality expansion that has perhaps never occurred anywhere else (again, possibly excepting Argentina).
Americans can object -- and in this they have a point -- that their society differs from Latin America because there is mobility at the top and the bottom. South of the Rio Grande, the affluent are always the same; in the United States, they vary from generation to generation, often strikingly. This is what gives so many Americans the impression -- false as it must be for most -- that one day they might reach the top and that those already there will make room for them. But this ability to aspire does not really address the issue of how large the distance is growing between those at the top, middle and bottom; nor does it comfort those in the middle who see their chance of moving up growing ever more slight.
WHICH leads to a question for the United States: why would you allow that to happen, when we in Latin America can show you how difficult it is to achieve the kind of exemplary middle class that you invented in the first place, and that gave you such economic power and social cohesion -- at least since the 1920s? Especially when we all know its existence is crucial to preserving some of the best traits of your own national character.
Alexis de Tocqueville made the point nearly two centuries ago. Something in the American character had produced a far more egalitarian society than any in Europe, and something in that society was producing a different, more modern and exciting national character, with room for experimentation, cooperation and acceptance of differences. Americans cannot retain the tolerant, forward-looking and innovative national character they cherish if they give up the egalitarian middle-class configuration that comes with it.
Mexico and other Latin American lands are reshaping our national characters and democratic politics in our quest for a larger and more vibrant middle class, and at last we are having some success. The United States' middle class is coming under increasing pressure as the income gap between it and the very rich widens.
Do Americans really have nothing to learn from us, after we have learned so much from them?

HEADLINE: Club Kids Are Storming Music Museums

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
WE critics have long argued vehemently that if major musical institutions hope to be regarded as vital, modern institutions, they must keep their listeners (and performers) in touch with the ideas, trendy or otherwise, that excite the composers of their time. But truth be told, we are a little bipolar on that subject. Though we criticize the big organizations for fostering a museum culture, we actually value the museums they have become.
Our attitude toward the classical canon, after all -- and this increasingly applies also to older forms of jazz and pop -- is that great music transcends time. If the New York Philharmonic did not regularly give us Beethoven, Brahms and symphonies, we would complain that it had abandoned the conservationist aspect of its charter and lament the disappearance of works that had moved people for decades or centuries. 
That tension is not easily resolved. Even a model in which orchestras, chamber groups and opera companies present themselves as museums with substantial contemporary wings has almost insurmountable limitations circumscribing the possibility of hearing much new music. Consider that within the last 50 years Mahler, Shostakovich, Bartok, Sibelius and Copland have all moved from the periphery of the orchestral canon to its center, yet Beethoven, Brahms and company have not fallen out of fashion; and Bach, Haydn and Mozart, long ceded to period-instrument bands, are returning to the modern orchestra repertory. All this at a time when the world of young, inventive and often populist composers is exploding.
These young composers may hold the key to classical music's future, and the future they create might not be what you expect. Increasingly they have come to consider the machinations of the big-ticket musical organizations -- and debates about how to get them to accommodate new music -- as beside the point.
Instead of waiting for established ensembles to give them a hearing, they have built an alternative musical universe. Its complex ecology and hierarchy of coolness includes webs of composer-performer collaborations, circuits of preferred concert spaces and an expanding number of record labels: among them, New Amsterdam, Cantaloupe and Tzadik, all composer run and stylistically freewheeling.
This world is centered in New York, though it has counterparts elsewhere. (Reykjavik, Iceland, seems unusually influential at the moment.) It thrives in concert spaces that make a point of informality. Some, like Le Poisson Rouge and the Cornelia Street Cafe in Greenwich Village and Galapagos in Brooklyn, are like jazz clubs: you can nurse a drink while listening to a performance, but the atmosphere is quiet and focused. Others are hole-in-the-wall funky: on summer nights at the Stone, in the East Village, performers debate whether to turn on a noisy fan or stifle with their listeners. Lately new-music haunts like the Issue Project Room and Roulette have found larger spaces (both in Brooklyn) and the money to pay for them.
Just as crucial, emerging composers have built an enthusiastic, growing audience that, while mostly young, is expanding across age and demographic lines. Perhaps because the music these composers produce is wildly eclectic, dogma free and more likely to have undercurrents of humor than doctrinaire earnestness, it is attracting older music fans who, it turns out, were seeking composers to champion all along but were left cold by the harshness of the serialists and bored by the repetitiveness of the minimalists, and found too few havens between those extremes.
It would be wrong to suggest that the young composers who have created this burgeoning alternative world have no interest in the big institutions. Nor do they disdain the standard repertory. Most would love to have their works performed by major orchestras, and some get lucky: Anna Clyne and Mason Bates were appointed composers in residence at the Chicago Symphony; Nico Muhly will have a work performed at the Metropolitan Opera.
But they have other models too. They attended conservatories and went through the same rigorous training as their predecessors, but they have not inherited their teachers' battles. For them serialism and Minimalism are equally useful tools in a gestural language that draws on rock, jazz, hip-hop, world music and every reconfiguration of classical language from medieval times through Romanticism. And though there was a time when classical-music students played little but classical music, these musicians have played it all. Today you can hardly find a composer under 40 who did not play in rock bands as a teenager.
Some still have them, but now they include orchestral instruments and computers alongside electric guitars and basses, drums and electronic keyboards. In all this music the timbres, the textures and, often, the energy are those of rock, but the structures, substance and time scales are rooted in classical music. Electric guitars may simmer or wail, and drums may pound, but this is not the stuff of pop hits. When you listen to the Now Ensemble or the amplified, heavily processed string quartet Ethel or groups led by the composers Missy Mazzoli, Du Yun,Judd Greenstein,Caleb Burhans or Bryce Dessner, you inevitably wonder whether you're hearing a rock band or a chamber group, and whether it matters.
A polished composer like Jefferson Friedman can have it both ways. Having poured his stylistically wide-ranging thoughts into his string quartets, he happily allowed the electronica group Matmos to remix them, adding beats and other sounds, and cutting and pasting musical lines. Several of these composers have the D.J.-remix-mash-up culture of post-1980s pop in their blood.
This scene was not suddenly created from nothing. If you pick at its fabric, you will find strands stretching back to the late 1960s, when Minimalists and avant-gardists began forming bands and giving loft concerts, and when European art-rock bands like Tangerine Dream, Gong, Faust and Henry Cow began exploring unusual (for rock) meters, harmonies, textures and structures.
You see its origins in the late 1970s, when the Kronos Quartet began its long, iconoclastic run in San Francisco, while in New York, Rhys Chatham began writing serious pieces for electric guitars, and Glenn Branca became better known for his guitar symphonies than for his work with his No Wave rock band, the Theoretical Girls. Its early rumblings inspired a blossoming of lively avant-garde festivals in the late 1980s and early 1990s: among them, the composer-run Bang on a Can and MATA festivals, as well as Next Wave at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Serious Fun! at Lincoln Center.
This movement -- still nameless, though it is sometimes called alt-classical -- has really reached critical mass only in the last five years or so. Its economic muscle remains untested: packing a few hundred listeners into a club is one thing, but could that audience fill Avery Fisher Hall night after night? Does it want to? Part of this world's charm, after all, is its intimacy and informality, and its inexpensive tickets.
Yet when Carnegie Hall has presented concerts aimed at this crowd's tastes, usually in the small but technologically up-to-date Zankel Hall, the seats have been filled. Seats were also filled when Alarm Will Sound and other groups played at Alice Tully Hall recently and when Adrian Utley, of the British band Portishead, and Will Gregory, of the electronica duo Goldfrapp, performed a new chamber-rock film score for Carl Theodor Dreyer's ''Passion de Jeanne d'Arc'' as part of the White Light Festival last month, in the same hall.
That Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall are hoping to tap this market suggests that the mainstream musical world sees its potential. So do the conventional classical ensembles (the Emerson Quartet, Orpheus) and soloists (the pianist Helene Grimaud, the operatic tenor Joseph Calleja) who have recently migrated to clubs for record-release parties -- a practice borrowed from the pop world by way of labels like New Amsterdam -- or simply to trawl for a new audience.
The major institutions would no doubt love to tap into this world's energy, audience and of-the-moment cachet. But to do so they would have to rethink their repertories, ticket prices and performance styles radically, and it seems unlikely that their existing audiences and donors would stand for that.
That said, some organizations have nothing to lose. New York City Opera, the Brooklyn Philharmonic and the American Composers Orchestra, all venerable institutions that have fallen on hard times, are experimenting with genre-crossing orchestras and seeking new performance spaces. Whether they survive will tell us a lot about the power of this new approach and what it can mean for classical music generally.
But it may mean nothing for classical music. Perhaps instead of being a shot in the arm, this movement will lead to an epochal splintering in which composers in the new style continue doing what they are doing now: making artistic choices that draw as much on nonclassical influences as on classical ones and writing for ensembles that use computers, amplification, sound processing and non-Western instruments. This world may break away from traditional classical music much the way jazz split from blues in the 1920s; rock blossomed from rhythm and blues, country and soul in the 1950s; and hip-hop arose from within pop in the 1980s.
There is no reason the two worlds could not remain porous. But in that case today's orchestras would embrace their museum aspect wholeheartedly and become extensions of the period-instrument world, specializing in music written during the 19th and 20th centuries. Composers receiving their training now, and listening to jazz, rock, hip-hop and world music in their spare time, would write for new, amplified or partly electronic ensembles.
It is not a matter of whether this is a good development or a bad one; it is evolution in action. And if nothing else, it should afford a respite of several decades before we read hand-wringing reports about the graying of the Issue Project Room audience.

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
SUNSET PARK, by Paul Auster (Picador, $15.) Unfolding after the economic collapse, Auster's novel concerns Miles Heller, a college dropout ''trashing out'' foreclosed houses in Florida. His underage girlfriend, Pilar, is mature beyond her years, but the discovery of their relationship forces Miles to flee to New York, where he hides out among a group of young artists and intellectuals squatting in an abandoned house. 
A ROPE AND A PRAYER: The Story of a Kidnapping, by David Rohde and Kristen Mulvihill (Penguin, $16.) In November 2008, Rohde, a Pulitzer-winning reporter, was kidnapped by insurgents in Afghanistan while pursuing an interview with a Taliban commander. In this meticulously detailed book, Rohde and his wife take turns recounting his seven months in Taliban captivity, her negotiations for his release and his daring escape.
FOREIGN BODIES, by Cynthia Ozick (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) In Ozick's retelling of Henry James's ''Ambassadors,'' Bea Nightingale, a divorced schoolteacher in the Bronx in the 1950s, is charged by her abrasive brother with retrieving his son, who has sought refuge from his father in Paris. '' 'Foreign Bodies' is a nimble, entertaining literary homage,'' Thomas Mallon wrote in the Book Review.
WHY NOT SAY WHAT HAPPENED?: A Memoir, by Ivana Lowell (Vintage, $15.95.) Lowell, the daughter of Lady Caroline Blackwood and stepdaughter of Robert Lowell, takes stock of the emotional trials that shaped her: the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of an odd-jobs man when she was 6; her years trying to discover her true paternity; and her struggle to conquer alcoholism.
YEARS OF RED DUST: Stories of Shanghai, by Qiu Xiaolong (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) Set in a narrow street populated by Shanghai's once-characteristic courtyard houses -- and emphasizing the culture of gossip and intermingling that goes on in such close quarters -- these tales are consumed with China's national upheavals, from the Great Leap Forward to Tiananmen Square and beyond.
THE HIDDEN REALITY: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos, by Brian Greene (Vintage, $16.95.) Greene, the author of ''The Elegant Universe'' (1999) and ''The Fabric of the Cosmos'' (2004), distills research in cosmology, quantum mechanics and string theory that suggests our universe, once thought to be singular and all-encompassing, may be just one of many. In this formulation, Greene writes, lies the possibility that ''there are many perfect copies of you out there in the cosmos.''
THE PASSAGES OF H.M.: A Novel of Herman Melville, by Jay Parini (Anchor, $16.95.) Organized as a series of episodes, many of them imaginative reconstructions of what may have transpired on Melville's known sea voyages, Parini's biographical novel presents its subject as a lonely man, a tempestuous husband and an obsessed writer.
THE BOOK IN THE RENAISSANCE, by Andrew Pettegree (Yale University, $25.) This revisionist history explores the web of religious, economic and cultural concerns surrounding the early years of printing. Publishing, Pettegree argues, not only rescued ancient learning from obscurity, it was also a chaotic and financially grinding undertaking.

HEADLINE: Help Graduates Find Their Footing

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. GOLDFARB. 
Robert W. Goldfarb is a management consultant and author of ''What's Stopping Me From Getting Ahead?'' E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S understandable that many of today's college graduates view themselves as the generation that opportunity forgot.
This fall, I interviewed 85 recent graduates of various colleges to discuss their success in finding a job. We spoke in settings as varied as Zuccotti Park, the Occupy Wall Street site in Manhattan, and meetings of young conservatives.
Of those I interviewed -- many from prestigious schools -- only five are in the career field they prepared for; the rest are unemployed or in jobs they hope are temporary. Graduates with once-marketable degrees in accounting and computer science, for example, now compete with applicants who have five years of experience and will accept the same entry-level salary. 
Mainly because there are too many applicants for too few jobs, employers are ignoring resumes that once commanded interviews. But in my work as a management consultant, I find that many executives also feel that recent graduates have contributed to a perception problem: that young people have been so pampered by hovering parents and so untested academically that they bring little value to today's demanding workplace.
A surprising number of senior managers have always championed the hiring of young people who seem unlikely candidates for corporate life: theater majors, for instance, or campus activists with mediocre grades, or eccentric computer prodigies with few social skills. These managers realize that while irreverent newcomers might create chaos in quiet offices, they also bring fresh ideas.
But recently, I have heard some of these managers grumble that painful job hunts have sapped young people of their daring, creativity and willingness to challenge old procedures.
Until recently, common wisdom held that older employees resisted change, were slow to adapt to technology, were less productive than younger associates and resented taking direction from bosses younger than their children. Those perceptions are changing significantly in organizations I work with.
Older employees, desperate to rebuild their 401(k)'s, are reinventing themselves -- by welcoming new procedures, becoming technologically adept, bringing mature problem-solving to their jobs and responding willingly to younger bosses. Managers have become far less tolerant of the missteps that were once expected of any new hire, and are finding that older employees make fewer of them.
Some of the least judgmental, most supportive managers I know are criticizing recent graduates for poor quality of written and oral reports, and for difficulty in drawing essential facts from masses of data. Earlier generations heard this criticism, too, but employers flooded with resumes have become far more selective than their predecessors.
Amid relentless talk about unemployment, little is said of the impact on the nation's future of a generation convinced that the workplace has little use for it. This generation must regain its confidence if we are to remain the birthplace of ideas, products and services that shape the world.
The quickest way to rebuild that confidence is to form partnerships between recent graduates and the companies they hope will employ them. Entrepreneurs and corporate managers, current and retired, are eager to be mentors. They are active in the Young Presidents' Organization or in professional and alumni groups in many cities.
Corporations, in turn, should consider investing in training and developing a generation they will eventually need. High-potential graduates for whom there isn't an immediate opening could be hired, not as unpaid interns but as salaried trainees given three to six months to prove their value in a series of assignments. Those who don't seize the opportunity can quickly be dismissed. Trainees should be given mentors to help them avoid the small missteps that can damage a career before it starts.
DETERMINED to cut costs, many corporate officials will undoubtedly dismiss as impractical the idea of investing in employees they don't immediately need.
But a choice must be made: employers can keep faulting overindulgent parents, ineffectual teachers, colleges without required subjects and graduates unsuited to today's complex workplace, or they can play a greater role in training and developing a generation longing to take its place in the American mainstream.

THE BIG PROFILE
By Dave Itzkoff
MICHAEL BUBLE
Though Michael Buble has just released an album of holiday standards called -- what else? -- ''Christmas,'' don't assume this Canadian crooner wants to live inside an Irving Berlin lyric. Christmases with his family in Burnaby, British Columbia, were ''loud,'' Buble says, with ''a lot of love, too much food, probably too much alcohol.'' Besides, he was not much for Bing Crosby in those years. ''I thought Eddie Vedder was the second coming of Elvis,'' he says, ''and I remember jumping on the trampoline and listening to the Beastie Boys.''

Running out of flesh real estate? Nina Tran, 22, recently got her boyfriend's nickname (''Baku'') inked on her inside lower lip ''so I could hide it from my mom,'' she says. For beginners, California's Violent Lips offers temporary lip tattoos for about $10. A co-founder, Jeff Haddad, says they're ''for a world where people are constantly changing their mind.'' Kim Kardashian is a fan.
WASHINGTON MONUMENTS
By Matt Bai
WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, ROSS PEROT?
Is there an opening for a third-party candidate? No and yes. With fewer Americans feeling the need to hurl themselves into party politics, it's hard to imagine much interest in creating a new one. But there's almost certainly a market for an independent candidate -- perhaps a rich, Ross Perot type (minus the weirdness) who embodies reform and rejects party fealty. Sounds like Bloomberg, but he has his hands full.
GLASS HOUSES
By Maud Newton
''Make it all glass!'' the ''Hour of Power'' preacher, Robert Schuller, commanded the Crystal Cathedral architect, Philip Johnson. And although they were building in an earthquake zone, Johnson complied; 10,664 windows look out on the Los Angeles sky. At its completion three decades ago, it was the most extravagant symbol of American Protestantism. Now congregants are mourning its bankruptcy sale to a Catholic diocese. Schuller, who retired in 2006, once predicted that the place would ''outshine the preacher.''
THE MOB AND YOU
BULLETS AND VEGGIES
By Tom Folsom
''The more toppings a man has on his pizza, I believe the more manly he is,'' Herman Cain recently told GQ magazine. ''A manly man don't want it piled high with vegetables!'' Mob-savvy voters can infer from this anti-vegetable stance that the former C.E.O. of Godfather's Pizza (''a pizza you can't refuse'') would not have been a fan of real-life mobster Ciro (The Artichoke King) Terranova. Feared in the produce racket, Terranova inspired Mayor Fiorello La Guardia of New York City to briefly ban the sale and possession of artichokes in 1935. For Cain, it would have meant one less offending topping.
LEND ME A PAINTER
By Dan Kois
Need to fill a big wall? How about a new Calder for just $4 a month? From 1951 to 1982, the Museum of Modern Art's Art Lending Service let aspiring collectors rent-to-own pieces by Calder, Pollock and others. (The art was offered on consignment from galleries and artists.) After the three-month rental period, you could return the piece or buy it. ''I meet older collectors all the time who got their start through the A.L.S.,'' says MoMA's senior archivist, Michelle Elligott, who wrote about the A.L.S. in the art magazine Esopus. ''They usually say, 'Gosh, I wish I'd bought it!' ''

WHAT WE THINK
BUYER BEWARE
By Tom Vanderbilt
How do we ever know that we've bought the right brand or paid the right price? Research suggests that post-decision cognitive dissonance, or ''buyer's remorse,'' can emerge even with relatively minor goods, particularly in e-commerce. Microsoft is working on a cure called Prodcast, which predicts future price movements for consumer goods. Though you may still agonize over whether you've chosen the right color.

HEADLINE: From Florida to Brooklyn To Care for Ailing Sister

BYLINE: By ANASTASIA ECONOMIDES

 BODY:
When Sandra Dorne received a call in 2010 from a niece saying that Ms. Dorne's older sister was in desperate need of care, she did not think twice. She packed her life into a small suitcase, left her waitressing job in Orlando, Fla., and three days later booked a $150 one-way plane ticket to Allentown, Pa.
From there, Ms. Dorne, now 57, took a bus to Brooklyn, where her ailing sister, Patricia Trivisani, 69, lived with two Chihuahuas.
''I didn't like Florida anyway,'' Ms. Dorne said. ''After my husband died, being in the same place where he was was sad. It's also too hot there. I'm originally a Jersey girl.'' 
Ms. Dorne discovered that Ms. Trivisani, a retired litigation records clerk, was eating only cereal and noodles, and taking too many pills. She had been hospitalized after a neighbor found her on the floor -- she had accidentally overdosed on prescription pills.
''She was taking 50 a day,'' Ms. Dorne said. ''I'm not a doctor, but I knew that was too much.''
Ms. Trivisani is coping with a plethora of health problems: fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, acid reflux disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cataracts, dislocated spinal disks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
''I'll be honest -- I cry sometimes in bed,'' Ms. Trivisani said. ''I wish I can be out and working. I don't want to live this way.''
Yet she still has the strength to bicker with her sister, including about who can better recall the past and what pill treats what condition.
''We have our differences; it's the Aquarius in us,'' Ms. Trivisani said. (She and her sister both have birthdays in January.)
''It's just because you don't listen,'' Ms. Dorne said. ''You are stubborn.''
Ms. Trivisani has always faced hardships. She was abused by her stepmother, she said, and her husband, now dead, was a serious gambler. She accumulated $14,000 in credit card debt because of medical expenses. She also bears the emotional pain of having had numerous miscarriages and having lost a son two days after he was born.
''Why couldn't God let me have one?'' Ms. Trivisani said of children. ''All the others have kids,'' she added, referring to her six other siblings. Ms. Dorne has nine great-grandchildren.
Ms. Trivisani has tried to fill that void with her dogs. She has two, a brother and a sister. She keeps ashes of her previous pets in a cupboard in the living room. The rest of the apartment is decorated with religious statues, crosses and family photos. Her other siblings are scattered throughout New Jersey and New York, but Ms. Trivisani said Ms. Dorne, who lived the farthest away, was the only one to rush to her side.
The sisters have short haircuts and wear matching bracelets of Roman Catholic saints, though Ms. Dorne is not a Catholic. They live on Ms. Trivisani's Social Security benefits, $1,158 a month, and the $320 in food stamps that she receives.
''Me and Pat's always been close,'' Ms. Dorne said. ''She took care of me because I was the baby sister.''
But Ms. Trivisani, pointing at her own worn shoe soles, said, ''I feel bad for her; I can't get her clothes or shoes.''
The two have to prioritize which of Ms. Trivisani's medicines to buy, always getting heart pills first.
Medicaid can ease the financial stress by covering the cost of medicines and paying for a home-care attendant for Ms. Trivisani. But she does not qualify because her income is too high, according to Medicaid guidelines. To be eligible, she must have a total monthly income of $787 or less. But Ms. Trivisani said the guidelines did not take into account how much was left after she paid $560 a month in rent and about $400 in monthly bills.
When social workers at Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, heard of the sisters' predicament, they helped Ms. Trivisani get $250 from the fund to cover the fee for her enrollment in a pooled-income trust to set her on the path to qualifying for Medicaid.
Under the arrangement, Ms. Trivisani said, she would contribute $371 a month to the trust, which would be used to pay part of her rent and other living expenses, effectively leaving her with lower income on hand, enough to meet the eligibility for Medicaid, which would then help her get a home attendant. Her application is pending.
Ms. Trivisani is eager for the day when she can afford hearing aids, diapers for herself and shampoo that costs more than 79 cents a bottle.
In Ms. Trivisani's living room recently, a mirrored plaque inscribed with a poem about sisterly love was propped on a table. Ms. Dorne said she had bought it in New Jersey for $1. The last line of the inscription reads, ''You're loved and always will be.''
Ms. Dorne says she does not plan to ever leave her sister.
''If I caught anyone hurting her,'' Ms. Dorne said, ''I'd beat them senseless.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Toolkit Needed to Manage Climate Change

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
DURBAN, South Africa -- For 17 years, officials from nearly 200 countries have gathered under the auspices of the United Nations to try to deal with one of the most vexing questions of our era -- how to slow the heating of the planet.
Every year they leave a trail of disillusion and discontent, particularly among the poorest nations and those most vulnerable to rising seas and spreading deserts. Every year they fail to significantly advance their own stated goal of keeping the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels. 
That was the case again this year. The event, the 17th conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, wrapped up early Sunday morning with modest accomplishments: the promise to work toward a new global treaty in coming years and the establishment of a new climate fund.
The decision to move toward a new treaty -- and toward replacing the 20-year-old system that requires only industrialized nations to cut emissions -- was hard-won, after 72 hours of continuous wrangling. But for now it remains merely a pledge, and all details remain to be negotiated.
Negotiators also left for another day the precise sources of the money for the fund and how and by who it would be disbursed. Called the Green Climate Fund, it would help mobilize a promised $100 billion a year in public and private funds by 2020 to assist developing nations in adapting to climate change and converting to clean energy sources.
There is no denying the dedication and stamina of the environment ministers and diplomats who conduct these talks. But maybe the task is too tall. The issues on the table are far broader than atmospheric carbon levels or forestry practices or how to devise a fund to compensate those most affected by global warming.
What really is at play here are politics on the broadest scale, the relations among Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan and three rapidly rising economic powers, China, India and Brazil. Those relations, in turn, are driven by each country's domestic politics and the strains the global financial crisis has put on all of them. And the question of ''climate equity'' -- the obligations of rich nations to help poor countries cope with a problem they had no part in creating -- is more than an ''environmental'' issue.
Effectively addressing climate change will require over the coming decades a fundamental remaking of energy production, transportation and agriculture around the world -- the sinews of modern life. It is simply too big a job for those who have gathered for these talks under the 1992 United Nations treaty that began this grinding process.
''There is a fundamental disconnect in having environment ministers negotiating geopolitics and macroeconomics,'' said Nick Robins, an energy and climate change analyst at HSBC, the London-based global bank. Mr. Robins noted that the 20-year-old framework convention and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that amended it enshrined the two-tiered system in which so-called developed and developing countries are treated differently. China still is classified as a developing country and is thus exempt from any emissions limits, but it has a vastly larger economy than it had in 1992 and recently surpassed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
''They are working from a 20th-century agreement,'' Mr. Robins said.
The United States is determined to sweep away those distinctions and work toward a system where all countries are bound by the same rules. The conference here in Durban kept the tiered system alive for another few years, but it is fading. And by the time the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2020, a good many leaders hope that it will be gone for good.
Todd D. Stern, the chief American climate negotiator, revealed his qualms about the inability of the United Nations climate bureaucracy to deal with the broad political and financial questions posed by climate change. ''We want to see a green fund that is going to draw in a lot of capital from countries all over the world, including the United States,'' he said at a briefing. ''And although I love climate negotiators and spend much of my time with them, they are not necessarily the most qualified people to run a multibillion-dollar fund.''
So who is qualified to tackle these tasks? Two years ago, more than 100 heads of state and leaders of governments, including President Obama, joined the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen hoping to write a new, legally binding treaty covering all parties. That assignment proved too much even for the leaders, and the meeting collapsed in acrimony and finger-pointing. Few top leaders have shown up at the two subsequent meetings, in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, and in Durban this year. The agenda has narrowed and expectations have shrunk, yet the ship sails grimly on.
Others think that real progress will not emerge from any global forum but from action at the ground level, by entities unencumbered by the United Nations climate process.
Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, which arguably has done more to reduce carbon pollution in the United States than any other body, was in Durban as an observer. Ms. Nichols said that given the inability of the international bureaucracy or the United States Congress to move decisively on global warming, the job would increasingly fall to the states and local governments.
''Instead of waiting for them to negotiate some grand bargain, we have to keep working on the ground,'' she said. ''Progress is going to come from the bottom up, not the top down.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An article last Monday about an international climate conference in Durban, South Africa, misstated the position of the United States on the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 agreement on reining in greenhouse gas emissions. The United States signed the accord but never ratified it; it did not decline to sign it.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths DUNN, PATRICIA C.

 BODY:
DUNN--Patricia C.,Climbed from an entry-level position as a secretarial assistant to become the Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-based Barclays Global Investors (BGI) as it developed into the world's largest institutional money manager and subsequently served as the Non-Executive Chairman of the largest information technology company in the world, died on Sunday morning December 4th at her home in Orinda, CA. She was 58. The cause was ovarian cancer, according to William Jahnke, her husband of 30 years. Dunn was diagnosed with three different types of cancer over a three-year span starting in 2002, but remained active in various philanthropic causes until recently. Dunn's ascent in the investment and information technology worlds was remarkable; academically all she had was a degree in journalism from the University of California, Berkeley - no degree in business, economics, finance, engineering, or any other hard science. 
Her success in the professional and private life was due in part to her generous and gracious manner, her personal magnetism and the respectful manner in which she conducted her life. In 2006 Dunn found herself at the center of a media firestorm regarding an investigation by Hewlett-Packard to find the source of leaks to the press. Although the company later acknowledged she did not authorize, direct, or conduct the investigation she was asked to resign from the board because her continued presence had become a distraction given the attention to the matter by the media. Dunn graciously complied mounting an aggressive defense, which included testifying on Capitol Hill and, after being charged with four felonies, an appearance on 60 Minutes. All charges were later dropped in "the interest of justice" by a California Superior Court Judge before a scheduled preliminary hearing was held. Not only was the case against Dunn weak, there was evidence Dunn had been scapegoated. Dunn, a national merit scholar, attended the University of Oregon. She transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1975 with a degree in journalism. After being name CEO of Barclay's Global Advisors in 1998 she debuted at No. 11 on Fortune magazine's annual list of the most powerful women in business. At the height of media attention to the HP leak investigation story, the Bay Area Business Counsel inducted Dunn into its Hall of Fame for her contributions to the business community and philanthropic causes. At the time Dunn was the youngest recipient of the award and the only woman to be individually inducted in the Council's 64-year history. Dunn, who was legendarily even-tempered, collaborative and focused in her business dealings, was equally tenacious as a cancer patient. By some accounts, she underwent more chemotherapy at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center than anyone else in the institution's history, outliving the three-year life expectancy for her type of ovarian cancer by nearly five years. Dunn and her husband endowed a chair at UCSF's Department of Surgery and also funded clinical trials of an ovarian cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania in which, in some cases, she participated. Besides her husband Bill Jahnke, who is a former chief executive of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Dunn is survived by two daughters, Janai Brengman and Michelle Cox, a son, Michael Jahnke, and ten grandchildren, as well as a brother, Paul Dunn, and a sister, Debbie Lammers and her husband Chris, along with their children Paul Dunn, Jr. and Laura, Stephen and Kelly Lammers. (Additional information regarding Dunn's life will be found on her website www.PattieDunn.com).

HEADLINE: Consultant Nation

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Andrew Siddons contributed reporting.. 
The Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
FOR decades before Mitt Romney arrived at Harvard Business School in the fall of 1972, the traditional path for Harvard M.B.A.'s had been a straight one: join a major company right out of school and climb the ranks.
By the early 1970s, though, the culture of elite American business was starting to change. Brand-name corporations were losing some of their cachet. In their place was a rising new group of firms that did not sell goods and services to American households but instead sold advice to other companies.
These firms -- consulting firms and, to a lesser extent, investment banks -- paid more money and cast themselves in the same exclusive sheen as Harvard. They pitched themselves as a kind of Ivy League of adulthood.
As the good-looking son of a former presidential candidate, who finished in the top 5 percent of his Harvard Business School class, Mr. Romney had his pick of jobs upon graduation. He chose the Boston Consulting Group, which was only 12 years old at the time. Two years later, an upstart rival, Bain & Company, recruited him away. 
In the 30-plus years since, Mr. Romney and his chosen profession have enjoyed a striking, dual-track rise. Consulting became the most popular career choice not only at top business schools but also at many liberal arts colleges. Lawyers, doctors and scientists rushed into the industry as well. Consulting, with its rapid succession of different assignments, is the prototypical industry for a job market in which instability and change appear to be the norm.
The current chief executives of Boeing, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Morgan Stanley and PepsiCo are all alumni of either Bain, Boston Consulting Group or the most prestigious consulting firm of all, McKinsey & Company. So are the prime minister of Israel, the governor of Louisiana, Chelsea Clinton and the rhythm-and-blues star John Legend.
Even so, Mr. Romney remains the beau ideal of consulting. He used his career as a springboard -- just as the industry's college-campus recruiters promise is possible -- to both a high-profile private-sector job (running the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City) and a public-service career. He has built his presidential campaign on a narrative that comes directly from consulting: he is a problem solver who understands business, he says. His pitch to voters sounds an awful lot like the pitch that Bain or McKinsey consultants make to prospective clients.
And one final -- darker -- parallel exists, too: the chance that both Mr. Romney and the consulting industry have peaked.
Despite a thin field, Mr. Romney has struggled in the polls, with many Republican voters looking for any alternative, the latest being New Gingrich. If Mr. Romney wins the nomination, as many observers expect, President Obama's campaign awaits with a barrage of messages that depict him as an out-of-touch, profit-maximizing, flip-flopping friend of the rich.
Of course, any presidential candidate runs the risk of defeat. The problems facing the consulting industry, however, are both troubling and unexpected. Its popularity has slipped on both college campuses and in business schools in the last few years. Some students have decided that the work is not meaningful enough, perhaps influenced by college presidents who, like Mr. Obama, have urged young adults to pay less attention to their starting salaries. Others students have decided that if they are going to make money, they want to make real money -- and have joined hedge funds instead.
The fact that consulting delivers something short of true riches was a subtext of the recent indictment of Rajat K. Gupta, who once stood atop the profession as the managing partner of McKinsey (and also attended Harvard Business School in the early 1970s). Mr. Gupta, who says he is innocent, is accused of passing corporate secrets to a friend and hedge fund manager. Testimony suggests that Mr. Gupta, disappointed by the mere millions he had made at McKinsey, was hoping to strike it rich.
FOR the industry, perhaps the most damaging part of the case -- which also led to charges against a second McKinsey partner -- was the questions it raised about the nature of consulting. Critics have argued that Mr. Gupta became accustomed to sharing privileged information because he was already doing so as part of his normal work as a consultant.
''The scandal goes to the heart of McKinsey's business model,'' John Gapper, a columnist, wrote in The Financial Times. What consulting firms describe as ''best practices,'' Mr. Gapper argued, is just a euphemism for the information they gathered at one company and passed on to another. Felix Salmon, a widely read finance blogger at Reuters, went one step further and called the business model ''corrupted.''
Consulting executives reply that they are careful not to share confidential information. With everything else, they say, their clients are well aware that information flow is part of the bargain.
Compared with dutifully ascending the ladder at a single employer, a consultant's life has some obvious appeal, even glamour.
The top consulting firms hire an array of the nation's best-trained, sharpest minds: not just M.B.A.'s and business-minded college graduates but people from nearly every type of graduate school. About 20 percent of Boston Consulting Group's new consultants, for example, come from law schools, medical schools, public-policy schools, Ph.D. programs or other nonbusiness schools. That is up from about 5 percent in 1995.
After they are hired, consultants parachute into big companies, often meeting with top executives who are decades older. ''People see it as a way to get a tremendous amount of experience in a short period of time,'' said Mel Wolfgang of Boston Consulting Group, who has a doctorate in ocean engineering from M.I.T. Pulin Sanghvi, a former McKinsey consultant who runs the career office at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, added, ''It's especially useful if you don't know exactly what you want to do.''
In past decades, when American companies sat more securely atop the global economy, they might have spent the money to have their own big corporate-strategy department. Today, companies often outsource that function to bright young consultants.
For the consultants, the process itself can be rewarding. They pride themselves on looking at issues from as many angles as possible and asking questions that are important but not obvious. By definition, the answers can have real-world impact. Boston Consulting Group did some of the analytical work behind Mr. Obama's emergency automobile-industry task force. It also helped turn Victoria's Secret into a huge success.
Of course, consultants' failures also matter. Enron was a McKinsey client, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the onetime Enron executive now in prison, had been a McKinsey partner. More recently, McKinsey consultants told General Electric in 2007 not to worry about a credit crunch, according to Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive.
The larger debate about consulting runs through Mr. Romney's campaign. His critics point out that his work at Bain, as both a consultant and the head of an investment fund, often led companies to lay off workers. His defenders note that his work also helped start successes, like Staples, the office-supply chain.
In every case, what separates Mr. Romney and his fellow consultants from traditional business executives is that they remain somewhat removed from their decisions. Unlike those Harvard M.B.A.'s who climbed the ladder at one company, consultants do not execute the decisions they make and live every day with the consequences. They maintain an almost clinical distance, a distance Mr. Romney has struggled to overcome as a candidate.
To hear many consultants talk, this analytical approach is one of the intangibles -- along with the intelligence of their colleagues and the complexity of the issues -- that make the job appealing. But the money surely helps.
At a top firm, a new consultant with a graduate degree typically makes $150,000 to $200,000, including bonus. For M.B.A.'s, only finance jobs reliably pay more. For doctors and many Ph.D.'s, a consulting job pays far more than most other options. The rise of consulting is one more side effect of rising inequality: as the salary premium has grown, so has the cost of choosing of a less lucrative job.
Some observers suggest that people are choosing consulting for the money and claiming to like it more than they do. It can be grueling, requiring four days of travel a week. And parts of the work lack any larger economic or social purpose -- like helping Victoria's Secret sell underwear.
Drew Gilpin Faust devoted her first graduation speech as Harvard's president, in 2008, to discussing why so many students went into consulting and finance despite having little prior interest in the fields. ''Why am I doing this?'' she quoted one senior as saying. ''I hate flying, I hate hotels, I won't like this job.''
Ms. Faust then implored students: ''Find work you love. It is hard to be happy if you spend more than half your waking hours doing something you don't.''
Such urgings have not caused a radical change in student behavior. Consulting remains among the most popular career choices at both elite colleges and business schools. But it is no longer gaining.
Among bachelor's degree graduates from the University of Michigan's business school this year, 22 percent chose consulting, down from 30 percent a decade ago. At Stanford's Graduate School of Business, 27 percent of this year's M.B.A. class went into consulting, down from 35 percent a decade ago. At Harvard Business School, the numbers are also down.
One reason that consulting firms are looking beyond business schools, in fact, is that they cannot recruit as many top M.B.A.'s as they want.
THE rise of consulting has not only affected the career choices of young adults; it has also influenced American culture, turning consulting jargon -- outside the box, bandwidth, buy-in, win-win, ping -- into colloquial speech and making best sellers out of management tomes like ''In Search of Excellence.''
Its ascendance will be on full display in the 2012 campaign, and not just because of Mr. Romney. What did the other leading Republican candidate, Mr. Gingrich, do in the years after he was speaker of the House? He formed his own consulting firm, focused partly on health policy, and made millions. Some of that money -- some $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, the troubled housing-finance company -- has already become a campaign issue.
Mr. Obama is no consultant. Yet he has more than a little of the data-driven, empirical strain, and some of the same aloofness, that many consultants have. ''My core economic theory is pragmatism,'' he has said, ''figuring out what works.''
Most Republicans do not buy this claim, much as Democrats do not see Mr. Romney (or Mr. Gingrich) as a successful problem solver who can right the nation's economy. But self-image matters. It affects how people, including presidents, do their jobs. If you were going to speculate about how Mr. Romney's previous career would affect his presidency, you might conclude that his style -- if not substance -- would be more similar to Mr. Obama's than their many differences suggest.
A good portion of the 2012 campaign is likely to be devoted to fighting over which candidate can define himself in the way that consultants define themselves: as people who view the world as it really is and can devise win-win solutions for its problems.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Debate Sets All Eyes On Gingrich

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Newt Gingrich offered a robust defense of his views on the Middle East, his lucrative work after leaving Congress and his conservative credentials during a spirited debate here on Saturday night as his Republican presidential rivals urged voters to take a hard look at his candidacy.
With only three weeks remaining before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest, Mitt Romney raised questions about Mr. Gingrich's temperament, saying that by making a claim in a recent interview that the Palestinians were an ''invented people,'' Mr. Gingrich had thrown ''incendiary words into a place which is a boiling pot.''
Mr. Gingrich took fire for most of the evening, at many points seeming to relish his new role as the leader in the field. He kept his sense of humor and his calm, even as he delivered several attacks of his own, particularly against Mr. Romney. 
But when the question of his two divorces and acknowledged extramarital affairs were implicitly raised, Mr. Gingrich listened as his opponents pointedly highlighted their long marriages. He conceded that voters would need to make up their own minds.
''I think people have to render judgment,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''In my case, I said up front openly, I've made mistakes at times. I've had to go to God for forgiveness. I've had to seek reconciliation.''
As Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney tangled with each other over their backgrounds, their world view and their leadership styles, the rest of the Republican field took aim at both of the men, reflecting how the race is narrowing as voters draw closer to weighing in. Representative Michele Bachmann lumped them together as ''Newt Romney,'' saying both of them had supported a key aspect of President Obama's health care law, a mandate that all individuals purchase health insurance.
Mr. Romney, who repeatedly mentioned his defense for the middle class, veered from his disciplined stance at one point and seemed to unwittingly draw attention to his wealth when he leaned over to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and offered to place a $10,000 bet over whether Mr. Romney had changed his position on health care between editions of his book.
''I'm not in the betting business,'' Mr. Perry said.
Democrats quickly leapt on the size of Mr. Romney's proposed wager to portray him as out of touch with the economic strains on the middle class.
The debate was the first opportunity for Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich to stand side by side since their rivalry has intensified and turned increasingly bitter. While Mr. Gingrich had pledged to take the high road, urging Republicans not to tear one another down, he called Mr. Romney out for presenting himself as a businessman aloof from politics.
''The only reason you didn't become a career politician is that you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994,'' Mr. Gingrich said, referring to Mr. Romney's failed campaign for the United States Senate in Massachusetts.
But Mr. Gingrich turned red-faced when Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who is gaining ground in polls here, accused him of being an inconsistent conservative.
''He received a lot of money from Freddie Mac,'' Mr. Paul said, referring to a recent report in Bloomberg News that Mr. Gingrich had received up to $1.8 million in consulting fees from the government-sponsored mortgage lender. ''By the way, Newt, you probably got some of our taxpayer money.'' He added, ''You were a spokesman for them and you received money from them.''
Mr. Gingrich repeated his defense that he never acted as a lobbyist for Freddie Mac, adding, ''I offered strategic advice -- I was in the private sector.''
At that point, Mr. Romney chimed in, laughing loudly, ''K Street is not the private sector!''
For his part, Mr. Gingrich seemed to withstand the barrage of criticism that he faced during much of the debate, often using humor or a smile to deflect the attacks. His strong debate performances have contributed to his rapid rise, and his campaign is now trying to build an organization to match his popularity as the campaign moves rapidly toward the start of the voting in Iowa and then New Hampshire.
On one of the sharpest exchanges of the night, on the Middle East, Mr. Gingrich stood his ground and said he was describing the Palestinian liberation movement as a historian, and that as a ''Reaganite,'' he was proud to speak his mind. Mr. Gingrich had told a Jewish television channel last week that Palestinians historically were an ''invented'' people and that the Palestinian leadership sought to destroy Israel.
''This is a propaganda war in which our side refuses to engage,'' he said. ''You're not going to win in the long run if you're afraid to -- unless you stand firm and stand for the truth.''
Mr. Romney, however, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Gingrich, said, ''I'm not a bomb thrower -- rhetorically or literally.''
The Republican contenders arrived here on Saturday night -- 24 days before the first voting begins at the Iowa caucuses -- with Mr. Gingrich firmly planted as the leading Republican candidate in national polls and in surveys of Iowa. Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul were locked in a virtual tie in Iowa in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll last week. Yet two-thirds of Republican voters who say they plan to attend the Iowa caucuses said they could still change their minds.
Mrs. Bachmann urged voters again and again to consider her candidacy. She delivered a sharp and relentlessly focused argument against Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich, suggesting their previous support for a health care mandate would keep them from being able to take on Mr. Obama as forcefully as necessary.
The debate was marked by a tart tone. At one point, Mr. Perry, taking a hard line against Mr. Gingrich for his three marriages, said, ''If you will cheat on your wife, if you will cheat on your spouse, then why wouldn't you cheat on your business partner.''
The candidates took the stage in Sheslow Auditorium on the campus of Drake University for their 12th debate. It was the first time in the primary campaign when only six Republicans appeared on stage, with Herman Cain out of the race and former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah not invited to participate because he did not meet the minimum standing in polls.
The debate was sponsored by ABC News, The Des Moines Register, Yahoo News and the Republican Party of Iowa. The forum was moderated by the ABC News anchors Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos.
Near the end of the debate, the candidates were asked what financial sacrifices they had made in their lives.
Mr. Romney, the son of an automobile executive, acknowledged that ''I didn't grow up poor. And if somebody is looking for somebody who's grown up with that background, I'm not the person.'' But he said that his father had been poor and ''wanted to make sure I understood the lessons of hard work.''
Mr. Perry said he had grown up in a house that did not have running water until he was 6.
Mr. Gingrich recalled living in an apartment above a gas station on the town square, describing his youth as ''fairly frugal, but we didn't feel desperate.'' He said that several of his relatives were out of work and had had to go ''through very difficult times.''

HEADLINE: Euro Crisis Pits Germany And U.S. in Tactical Fight

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Even as European leaders put together their latest response to the euro crisis last week, a German-American clash over how best to manage a vast financial crisis and put the world economy back on a sound footing was set in stark relief.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany defied skeptics and laid the groundwork for a deeper union that she said rights the mistakes of the euro's birth and puts integration on a stable path for the long term. In the process, she forced German fiscal discipline on Europe as the prescription for the ills that afflict the region.
Yet even as the cogs of the European agreement were being fitted into place, President Obama issued his sharpest warning yet about the German-led solution. He said the focus on long-term political and economic change was well and good, but emphasized that failure to react quickly and strongly enough to market forces threatened the euro's survival in the coming months. 
At the heart of the debate is the question of how far governments must bend to the power of markets. Mr. Obama sees retaining the stability of markets and the confidence of investors as a primary goal of government and a prerequisite for achieving any major changes in public policy. Mrs. Merkel views the financial industry with profound skepticism and argues, in almost moralistic fashion, that real change is impossible unless lenders and borrowers pay a high price for their mistakes.
''It's a battle of ideas,'' said Almut Moller, a European Union expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. ''There is a different understanding of how to set up a sustainable economy in a globalizing world. Here there is a major rift.''
It will be difficult to know for weeks, or maybe even months, which approach is right. But it is clear that the stakes are high, with the health of the world economy, the European Union and perhaps Mr. Obama's presidential hopes hanging in the balance. Economists have fretted for months that forcing austerity plans on Europe's troubled economies -- while a good long-term solution -- could lead to deep recessions in the short term, compromising any chance for effective change.
On a political level, Mrs. Merkel could look back on last week's meeting of leaders in Brussels and declare, ''We have succeeded.'' Where her mentor, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, failed, Mrs. Merkel managed to push through more easily enforceable oversight of government spending that would allow the European Commission the right to review national budgets and object to those that violate agreed-upon debt limits.
Initial market reaction to the Brussels meeting was positive, but that has happened before as deal after deal has been struck between European leaders. Skeptics say that, economically, Mrs. Merkel, the hard-line austerity queen of Europe, has won a hollow victory, one that will fall apart like every other solution that was proclaimed as lasting but proved to be fleeting.
''If the new arrangement turns out to be too toothless to enforce the rules, we'll be back to square one,'' said Thomas Klau, a political analyst and head of the Paris office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Just ahead of Mrs. Merkel's unexpectedly robust success, Mr. Obama issued his unheeded warning from across the Atlantic. ''There's a short-term crisis that has to be resolved,'' he said, ''to make sure that markets have confidence that Europe stands behind the euro.''
Mr. Obama is fiercely proud of the record he achieved in keeping not just the United States but also the entire world out of an acute financial meltdown after 2008, presiding over enormous stimulus spending in tandem with unrestrained support from the Federal Reserve. The president and his allies now say that in doing so, they may well have prevented the world from falling into another Great Depression.
By ignoring the short-term threat, American officials say, Mrs. Merkel is unwittingly courting the very threat they so narrowly managed to keep at bay. Strong governments can borrow cheaply, mainstream economists on both sides of the Atlantic argue, and have an obligation to intervene more aggressively than they would normally to make up for the slump in private demand.
Germans are staunchly opposed to any solution that involves greater debt, but even more so to policies that might court inflation, their historic obsession. Policy makers in Berlin and at the Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt have urged restraint on the part of the European Central Bank, insisting it should not buy up too many bonds from heavily indebted euro zone countries.
''We will save the euro. We have to save the euro. We have the biggest resources and the biggest interest. But we will hearken fiscal probity,'' said Josef Joffe, publisher of the German weekly Die Zeit, describing the German position. ''We will not sacrifice our memories.''
The Obama team argues that with recession on the horizon for Europe, the threat of inflation is low and the real threat is a great depression. Administration officials, and many economists, argue that Germany is remembering the wrong crisis -- it should be focused on a repeat of the deflation and contraction of the 1930s, not a repeat of the hyperinflation of the '20s.
Americans take a far more accommodating approach to the problem of moral hazard than Germans do. The time for a reckoning is after financial stability has been restored, Americans say; otherwise, it is ordinary people, not the rich, who suffer most in a downturn.
President Obama, of course, faces re-election and sees the crisis in Europe as one of the biggest threats to his chances, as it could tip the American economy back into recession if austerity worsens the slump there. German officials are well aware of that and complain privately that electoral results are Mr. Obama's chief concern.
The Germans, for their part, seem almost to welcome the collapse of market confidence: without the rising pressure from markets, Silvio Berlusconi would not have resigned as prime minister of Italy. And without the incentive of fear, most European partners would have been more reluctant to give Brussels oversight authority over national budgets -- and the right to impose sanctions for violators.
''The Germans had a strategic insight or advantage to let the crisis get to the threshold within the European Union necessary for France to be willing to hand over the kind of sovereignty the country has always resisted,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''You could say that the crisis has either been the wake-up call or the tool that Germany has used to beat them into submission.''
Many Germans also view the Anglo-American infatuation with the financial industry as the root of the West's decline in competitiveness with the rising East. Big banks create and exploit bubbles, requiring huge bailouts, they say, without creating sustainable growth. Meanwhile, German exports will set a record this year, breaching the 1 trillion euro mark, or roughly $1.3 trillion, for the first time.
But Mrs. Merkel's strategy remains highly risky. A year ago she had miscalculated when she insisted that any bailout had to include the private sector's chipping in with the public sector, a requirement included in the Greek rescue. The markets punished Italy and Spain for that stance, and it was dropped last week at the Brussels gathering.
Mr. Obama was worried enough to send his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to ring the alarm bells all over the Continent ahead of the summit. But the other members of the euro zone swallowed their reservations and moved ahead with Friday's agreement because their rising financing costs left them little choice but to follow Germany's lead.
''The countries that had resisted these kinds of moves in the past are under so much pressure currently that they see it's necessary to regain credibility,'' said Jurgen Matthes, senior economist at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research.
In the end, Mrs. Merkel's view clearly won out over Mr. Obama's. ''Merkel is calling the tune and writing the notes,'' said Mr. Joffe, the publisher of Die Zeit.
Whether Mrs. Merkel's strategy works is a question that markets will begin to ask on Monday, whether she likes it or not.

BACK TO WORK
Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy
By Bill Clinton
196 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $23.95.
Bill Clinton's new book, ''Back to Work,'' is less a bold plan to create jobs than it is a passionate rebuttal of ''our 30-year antigovernment obsession.'' That obsession, he insists, is public enemy No. 1. He also seems to be sending a barely disguised message to Barack Obama to join him in confronting the anti/government chorus.
But coming from a former president who contributed to that very antigovernment narrative in the 1990s, it is unsurprising that the substance of the case he makes is weaker than it should be. In his State of the Union address in 1996, Clinton told us with a sense of triumph that the ''era of big government is over.'' By absorbing the new American distaste for government after the Republican Congressional victory of 1994, he assured his re-election two years later. And in his second term Clinton was more concerned about restraining government spending and paying down the debt than investing in America. 
Clinton now seems to believe the orthodoxy has finally gone too far. He argues that antigovernment zeal led to President Bush's deep tax cuts in the early 2000s. Those cuts, he tells us, are a major cause of today's budget deficits, while the stubborn reluctance of Republicans to agree to any tax increases at all has brought the political process to a near halt.
For all the Republican arguments, Clinton says, America did not get a better economy with the Bush tax cuts. According to the Economic Cycle Research Institute, growth in personal income even before the Great Recession was slower under Bush than in any equivalent period since World War II. In the years he was president, Clinton proudly notes, America produced more than 22 million jobs. George Bush's America created only 2.5 million jobs. The Great Recession, which ended six months after Obama took office, cost America roughly eight million jobs.
As Clinton says, President Obama inherited not only the Great Recession but a trillion-dollar deficit thanks in good part to those tax cuts. And now the nation is in the grips of a torpid economy laden with debt and a high rate of both unemployment and underemployment -- those who want and cannot get full-time jobs -- that appears intransigent. Despite the recent boom in corporate profits, the typical family's income is below its level in the late 1990s.
Clinton traces the antigovernment attitudes to Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. But in fact, the turn in America's attitudes goes back to the economic wreckage of the mid-1970s, when inflation and unemployment simultaneously soared and budget deficits were first starting to raise alarms. America was still a moderately progressive country in the early '70s: citizens supported social programs and voted down efforts to cut taxes. But by the end of the decade, a full-fledged tax revolt had gotten under way, led by the overwhelming passage in 1978 of Proposition 13 in California, which cut property taxes sharply, and the growing Congressional support for the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which proposed cutting federal income taxes by 30 percent. Even before Reagan's victory, no institution, it seemed, was distrusted more than government.
Yet Clinton concentrates only on the damage done since 2001. He believes that he bequeathed a healthy economy to Bush and that the tax cuts undid it. After all, Clinton's major legislative achievement was to raise income taxes on the well-off in 1993. The higher taxes relieved the long-exaggerated concerns about the inflationary consequences of a growing deficit. Interest rates started to recede and the economy took off, the unemployment rate ultimately falling to 4 percent by the year 2000. Many conservatives predicted a weakening economy and they were dead wrong.
But there were other contributing factors besides Clinton's tax increases. Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve sharply raised interest rates in 1994, which was a main source of falling inflationary expectations. Meantime, government spending was dampened because health care costs grew slowly as a result of the rise of H.M.O.'s. Because the cold war had ended, military spending fell as a percent of G.D.P. Perhaps most important, the Internet boom began and sparked a stock market bubble that stimulated spending by consumers, who felt ever richer.
Along the way, Clinton did pass important social legislation, like the expansion of the earned income tax credit and a family leave act, but his administration's investments in education and infrastructure were modest compared with the growth in the economy -- and so were the results. In 1998, for example, the Society of Civil Engineers gave a grade to America's infrastructure of D. In 2001, after the Clinton investments, the grade assigned was D+. Clinton writes in ''Back to Work'' that the nation could have eliminated debt completely by 2013 if the Bush administration stuck to his deficit reduction plan. But why was this ever his plan? Should a C.E.O. brag that he can eliminate all his company's debt, or should he be investing in the future?
Clinton sidesteps his role in financial deregulation. He admits he should have taken steps to control derivatives, the highly leveraged securities that were at the heart of the 2008 crisis, though he says his decision to end the Glass-Steagall Act, the New Deal legislation that separated commercial and investment banks, did not create the crisis. But in fact repeal led directly to the rise of huge financial institutions whose managers believed they could take on both highly risky investments and enormous debt as well. And his administration, along with many Congressional Democrats, was consistently soft on Wall Street in other areas at a time when there were numerous accounting frauds, scams to sell high-technology new issues and hot money racing around the world to find easy profits, destabilizing foreign economies in the process.
It is no surprise, then, that there is no Roosevelt moment in ''Back to Work'' -- nothing equivalent to a new New Deal. Clinton's jobs plan is largely a repetition of Obama's recent recommendations, which include a temporary cut in payroll taxes and a reversal of the Bush tax cuts for the well-off. He also calls for an aggressive program to relieve mortgage debt. All this is a decent start, but not very likely to be enough.
Without explanation, Clinton backs proposals to balance the budget that seem to depend significantly more on spending reductions than tax increases (he never makes the calculation). He would make some cuts in Social Security and Medicare to reduce the deficit. He would cut military spending, but only cautiously. Always a good policy wonk, he knows that America's true fiscal problems are the rising costs of health care, not Medicare and Medicaid themselves, but he continues to propose cutting entitlements spending. The 1990s Clinton is still talking.
MOst disappointing, for a man who warns us that America is falling behind other rich nations for lack of public investment, he makes no major proposal to raise taxes significantly once the economy is back on track. He tantalizingly points out that reversing all of the Bush tax cuts, including for the middle class, would come close to restoring an adequately balanced budget over the next 10 years. But he doesn't advocate this. He mentions the possible need for a value-added tax -- a national sales tax -- while he is at best ambivalent about a financial transactions tax. His recommendations on transportation investment are merely to doff his cap to an infrastructure bank and a few well-worn energy initiatives. These are the big-issue problems America must ultimately face but, like most of Washington, he pushes them down the road.
Many inside the Beltway welcome Clinton's modest pragmatism. They think it politically realistic. But if those few people who have a national megaphone -- like a former president -- don't use it to influence and change America's thinking, who will? The nation badly needs a counternarrative to the antigovernment orthodoxy Clinton describes. His is welcome. But even if we adopted all of his suggestions, America would still have a long way to go.

HEADLINE: Let's Do Something About Privilege, Donors, Corporations and the Constitution

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for The Chicago News Cooperative.
Larry Lessig was a perfectly unplanned warm-up act for Rod Blagojevich last week, especially if you wonder just what to make of the whole Blago saga.
Mr. Lessig, the provocative Harvard professor, lectured on his new book, ''Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress and a Plan to Stop It'' at the DePaul University College of Law, a few blocks from the courthouse.
But even speaking in Chicago about political corruption the night before the sentencing hearing for Mr. Blagojevich started, Mr. Lessig didn't find his high-profile crimes instructive. ''The Blagojevich corruption is irrelevant and beside the point,'' he told me later. ''It's a complete distraction to think the political system was weakened by him.'' 
Richard Posner, the most influential federal judge outside the Supreme Court, was in the audience. Mr. Lessig clerked for Mr. Posner, the appellate court judge, as well as for the United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia during a career that included teaching at the University of Chicago.
Mr. Lessig, 50, is an original and dynamic legal scholar, best known for arguing that our digital world necessitates much-reduced copyright and trademark restrictions.
But he was naive to think writing books would change opinions. Congress didn't budge for the same reason the Blago case is immaterial: the nexus of big donors, corporations and government is too pervasive.
It's also why ''Wall Street can blackmail both parties'' from enacting regulatory reform in the wake of the financial crisis, he told me. We need a second Constitutional Convention, especially given Supreme Court decisions eliminating most limits on campaign contributions.
In wondering what lessons are to be drawn from Mr. Blagojevich's fall, I'm drawn to two points: Mr. Lessig's notion of its irrelevance and technical realities involving the administration of justice.
Some of the latter were suggested by Alison Siegler, a defense lawyer who runs the federal criminal justice clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.
Early this year, District Judge James Zagel, who sentenced Mr. Blagojevich to 14 years in prison, sentenced Brian Brown, a South Side drug addict Ms. Siegler represented, to 10 years and 8 months. He had pleaded guilty to selling two ounces of crack cocaine to a government informant for $200.
In the Blagojevich case, the sentencing guidelines meant he should get from 30 years to life. The prosecution conceded those were onerous and urged a 15-to-20 year range, with the judge ultimately lowering the low end and giving him 14 years.
The guidelines for Mr. Brown's drug offense, even after he accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty, were 22 to 27 years. The government stuck to that range but Ms. Siegler and her students persuaded Mr. Zagel to go lower.
She showed me other cases of hers in which the government insisted on holding to stiff parameters of federal sentencing guidelines that many concede are harsh and inconsistent, especially when drugs are involved.
Her clients included an 18-year-old drug courier who got a no-mercy sentence for importing heroin from Nigeria to Chicago in his stomach and a Mexican landscaper who pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry to this country. The landscaper was raised here illegally by his parents and, after his deportation, returned for 12 years during which he bought a home, raised three children and even paid taxes.
The pattern she outlined is clear: a certain type of defendant, whose case probably won't elicit public attention, isn't cut the same slack as Mr. Blagojevich and other white-collar defendants. Several federal judges privately agreed with her.
''Blagojevich highlights the way in which the prosecution creates sentencing disparities based on privilege,'' Ms. Siegler said.
As for Mr. Lessig, he also met with Scott Turow, the lawyer and author, to discuss a Constitutional Convention. Mr. Turow sees risks but believes it may be the only alternative, given campaign money's undermining of the one-man-one-vote rationale of American democracy.
The Blagojevich saga won't make an impact on that problem, said Mr. Turow, a former prosecutor, on a day Chicago's trading exchanges cut a Springfield deal for tax breaks. Its wiretapped lesson is as hollow as the protagonist.
''Instead of a wink and a nod, he was dumb enough to say out loud, 'This is exactly what I will do for you in exchange for money.' ''

HEADLINE: The 1 Percent Club's Misguided Protectors

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The Republican right is pushing back hard against the 99 percent movement and its focus on the widening chasm between the fortunes of the few at the summit of the income scale and everybody else. Newt Gingrich, who led the field of Republican presidential candidates last week, argued that the concept of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent is ''un-American.'' His rival Rick Perry, who led the Republican pack in September, answered a question about taxes and inequality by saying ''I don't care about that.''
This indifference is grounded in a proposition that has for decades dominated American debate over redistributive policies like steeper taxes for the rich: that inequality is an expected outcome of economic growth, and that efforts to tamp down inequality would slow growth down. As President Obama said in his speech in Kansas last week, this strain of thought goes back to at least the turn of the last century when ''there were people who thought massive inequality and exploitation of people was just the price you pay for progress.'' 
Why, conservatives ask, would people exert themselves, study more and work harder if they could not reap extra rewards from the effort? Trying to fix inequities would only blunt incentives to work and invest. As Mr. Gingrich put it, ''You are not going to get job creation when you engage in class warfare because you have to attack the very people you hope will create jobs.''
This argument is -- at best -- incomplete. Some inequality may be necessary to encourage investment for growth. But as recent research shows, intense inequality actually stunts growth, making it more difficult for countries to sustain the sort of long economic expansions that have characterized the more prosperous nations of the world.
The first chart, based on research by Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry, economists at the International Monetary Fund, reveals the link between inequality and the sustainability of economic growth. Igniting growth is easier than maintaining it. They found that in high-inequality nations spurts of growth ended more quickly, and often in painful contractions.
The chart reports inequality with the so-called Gini index, which is 0 when all households have the same income and 100 when all the income goes to only one household. It shows that regions with high inequality, like sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, have recorded shorter periods of sustained economic growth since 1950 than regions with lower inequality like East Asia. The average stretch of robust growth among relatively equitable industrial countries lasted more than 24 years. In Africa the average was less than 14 years.
The economists found that income distribution contributes more to the sustainability of economic growth than does the quality of a country's political institutions, its foreign debt and openness to trade, the level of foreign investment in the economy and whether its exchange rate is competitive.
It's not too hard to see why. Extreme inequality blocks opportunity for the poor. It can breed resentment and political instability -- discouraging investment -- and lead to political polarization and gridlock, splitting the political system into haves and have-nots. And it can make it harder for governments to address economic imbalances and brewing crises.
Republicans might be tempted to dismiss such analysis as irrelevant to the United States, which is already highly developed. But as the second chart shows, inequality in America has soared over the last 30 years, approaching and even surpassing that in many poor countries. Today, America is an outlier among industrial nations. Its distribution of income looks closer to that of Argentina than, say, Germany.
So it is perhaps unsurprising that our recent economic crisis had some characteristics of boom-and-busts in less developed nations. It was triggered, in part, by 1 percenters on Wall Street persuading regulators to remove restrictions on their casino. It led workers to pile on debt to supplement falling incomes. It ended with a vast deployment of tax dollars to bail out fallen plutocrats. And our political system seems unable to deal with the aftermath.

HEADLINE: The Fattest Or The Fittest?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ELIMINATING the benefits reaped by institutions that are too politically powerful and interconnected to fail has been an elusive goal in the aftermath of the credit crisis. Institutions most likely to receive assistance from the federal government if they become troubled -- behemoths like Bank of America or Wells Fargo -- have grown only larger in recent years. Efforts to pare down these banks have met well-financed resistance among policy makers.
Happily, though, reducing the perils of gargantuan institutions -- and the threat to taxpayers -- is an idea that seems to be taking hold in Washington. To be sure, the army arguing for change is far outgunned by the battalions of bankers and lobbyists working to maintain the status quo. But some combatants seeking reform believe they are making headway. 
Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is one. In a speech last month he described, quite colorfully, the problems of these unwieldy institutions and the regulatory ethic ''that coddles survival of the fattest rather than promoting survival of the fittest.'' Bank regulators should follow the lead of the health authorities battling obesity rates among our population, he said, adding that he favored ''an international accord that would break up these institutions into more manageable size.''
This is a banker talking, not a member of the Occupy Wall Street drum circle.
And yet, some have criticized Mr. Fisher for voicing these sensible views -- a sign to him that the issue is gaining traction. In an interview last week, he said: ''Judging from the anguished calls I received from lobbyists for the megabanks, the 'attaboy' calls I am getting from regional and community bankers and the requests for copies of the speech from senators on both sides of the aisle, it appears this is a hot topic.''
That Mr. Fisher has received encouragement from both conservatives and liberals on his views leads him to conclude that ''this is an issue that can transcend bipartisan politics.''
Last week, Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who leads the Senate Banking subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, held a hearing on how to shield Main Street from what he calls megabank risk. In April 2010, he was a co-sponsor of the Safe Banking Act of 2010 with Ted Kaufman, the former Democratic senator from Delaware. The bill, which would break up some of the largest banks by requiring caps on institution size and leverage, ran into a buzz saw of opposition from the usual suspects.
But Mr. Brown soldiers on; he said in an interview on Thursday that he, too, believes the debate is changing. ''We're seeing sentiment grow on the Brown-Kaufman idea,'' he said. ''We are seeing some people who are pretty conservative here understanding the implicit subsidies these megabanks receive. Our goal is that senators understand this to the point of wanting to take action.''
He said he hoped his hearing would educate colleagues on the significant financial bounties received by big banks that are not allowed to fail, especially their lower borrowing costs -- a result of investor belief that taxpayers will rescue them. This places these banks at an unfair advantage over their smaller competitors.
''Why should the Bank of America enjoy an advantage the Peoples Bank in Coldwater, Ohio, doesn't get?'' Mr. Brown asked. ''The government's got to pull away from this and level the playing field.''
Providing testimony at Mr. Brown's hearing were Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T.; Philip L. Swagel, a professor of international economic policy at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy; and Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
Ms. Bair, one of the few regulators to have fought the anything-goes bailouts during the crisis, espoused her usual no-nonsense perspective on a variety of important topics. ''I know that many members of this subcommittee heard the same arguments that I heard during the crisis -- that bailouts were necessary or the 'entire system' would come down,'' she said. ''But we never really had good, detailed information about the derivatives counterparties, bond holders and others who we were ultimately benefiting from the bailouts and why they needed protecting.''
Such details are still kept under wraps. Ms. Bair urged the Fed and the F.D.I.C. to write rules requiring banks to report on their interrelationships. That way, distress at one institution can be recognized before it causes crippling losses at another.
In her testimony, Ms. Bair also urged regulators to write rules requiring executives and boards to be ''personally accountable for monitoring and compliance'' of the institutions they oversee.
When I asked her how this could be done, she said: ''There should be personal certifications and, at a minimum, civil penalties assessed by the banking regulators against the boards and management, as well as compensation clawbacks if there are losses to the organization because of proprietary trading. Regulators can't run these financial institutions for the management.
''What in the world are they being paid for?''
At the moment, they are being paid for taking risks that generate lush bonuses when things go well but that require taxpayer bailouts when the tide turns. Main Street understands that this is wrong and that allowing it to continue is dangerous. It's past time that Washington did something about it.
Correction: December 18, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Fair Game column last Sunday, about proposals to reduce the size of big financial institutions, referred incorrectly to the financial status of Citigroup. Its total assets are flat when compared with the level at the end of 2008; it is not among big banks that have grown in recent years.

HEADLINE: On TV, Nice Guys Finish First

BYLINE: By JIM WINDOLF

 BODY:
THIS season's highest-rated reality show was not some sleazefest of pixeled images and bleeped-out words, but a piece of soothing, neo-vaudevillian family entertainment: ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars.''
Twice a week the show presented a spectacle that would not have been out of place on ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' circa 1954. Even the losers left the ballroom grateful to have given their careers a lift.
Before the Iraq war veteran J. R. Martinez beat out Rob Kardashian in the finale, David Arquette made use of the show to change his image from tabloid bad boy to giggly leading man, and Nancy Grace revealed the vulnerable kitten hidden beneath her accusatory cable persona.
The success of the relentlessly feel-good ''Dancing'' is very much in keeping with a new-again TV spirit, a balm perhaps for the blow suffered to the blinged-out optimism of the 1990s and early 2000s. 
Hard times have been made all the more vivid by the Occupy movement, which rendered 2011 a cousin to the revolutionary years 1848 and 1968. So when those of us not actively positioning ourselves on either side of the barricades find ourselves navigating TV offerings, we may be a little more inclined to settle on shows that provide civility and escape, no matter how Jell-O-like they render our brains.
Consider ''American Idol.'' After roughly a decade of stellar ratings, ''Idol'' had a falloff in its 2009 season, which, perhaps not so coincidentally, was the last with the asp-tongued Simon Cowell as its dominant presence.
Viewers who relished his casually sadistic turns of phrase figured the show would lose not only its zing but also its very reason for being when it returned, in 2010, with the friendly Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler filling the time once gleefully devoured by the man in the snug black T-shirt. But improved ratings suggested such worries were unfounded. On TV, these days, nice guys finish first.
It's a shift that hasn't been lost on the shrewd Mr. Cowell himself, who has made a fortune gauging the masses' ever-changing moods. On a recent edition of his new Fox show, ''The X Factor,'' the onetime meanie offered not only high praise for a contestant named Stacy Fisher, but also something more concrete: ''I think you want to give me a kiss, don't you?'' he said, before stepping away from his product-placement Pepsi and planting a smooch. Unaccustomed to this reformed Mr. Cowell, Ms. Fisher was as stunned as Bob Cratchit on the morning after Christmas when Scrooge gave him a raise.
The game-show genre, once a space where it was acceptable to leap and whoop in spasms of childish want, is also moving toward goodness and light. The contestants on ''You Deserve It'' on ABC play not for themselves but for someone else in need. All that jumping for joy is altruistic rather than self-interest.
The niceness has also melted the once-icy environs of NBC's Thursday night sitcom block. This is where ''Seinfeld'' held sway in better times, with an amusing nihilism that stuck a pin in the chubby, happy Clinton days. The dictum laid down for ''Seinfeld'' by its main writer, Larry David, was ''no hugging, no learning,'' a rule flouted this season by its increasingly sentimental descendants, ''Parks and Recreation'' and ''The Office.''
As its doodle-dee-doo theme song suggests, ''Parks and Recreation'' ranks high on the niceness scale, even as it pokes fun at the notion of Midwestern politesse.
The show's anchor is the chipper Leslie Knope, played by Amy Poehler, who seems really nice in real life. Her character is so unjaded that she keeps a framed photo of Madeleine Albright in her office.
Leslie Knope's foil on the show, a mustachioed Libertarian loon named Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), keeps turning out to be not much of a foil at all. His curmudgeonliness never proves much of a match for Leslie Knope's charms; beneath his crusty exterior lurks a cuddly panda. The show's writers lack the courage of his stated convictions.
''The Office'' has lately shaken off the comedy of discomfort it had inherited from its mischievous creator, Ricky Gervais. The warmer mood reflects its changing of the guard, now that the needy Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has replaced the lunkheaded Michael Scott (Steve Carell) as protagonist.
Last decade, as the economy deflated, ''The Office'' gave expression to a national anxiety. Now that we're mired in the aftermath of a bust, it has tiptoed into fantasy land, presenting its misfit characters as members of a relatively happy family. Perhaps ''The Office'' has turned sappy in an effort to make a new bond with an audience accustomed to its combination of anti-punch lines and awkward pauses, which was a staple of its Carell years.
The shows that grab all the attention, like ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Boardwalk Empire,'' tend to wear their TV-MA ratings like a badge, but blander fare has always been this comforting medium's main course. So it makes sense that the TV performers with major longevity have been easy to be around.
Regis Philbin, the all-time champ of inconsequential chitchat, logged more camera hours than anyone else before his recent departure from the airwaves, according to Guinness. Pat Sajak's unthreatening quality has allowed him to rule over his ''Wheel of Fortune'' kingdom since 1981, and it is now the second-highest-rated syndicated show. Johnny Carson relied on an even-keeled stage manner to mask a sneaky brilliance that kept him aloft through 30 years at ''The Tonight Show.''
CNN had one of these guys in the companionable Larry King, but last year his bosses traded him in for a younger model, a slick Englishman named Piers Morgan, in the hopes that the numbers would rise. Guess what? At the time CNN announced Mr. King's departure, the suspendered one was averaging more viewers than Mr. Morgan draws these days, which may show that a down-on-its-luck nation would rather have a bowl of chicken soup prepared by its Uncle Lar than a cold cucumber sandwich served up by some sleazily debonair man of the world.
And then there is Oprah Winfrey. From the start of her eponymous show in 1985, no one on TV has matched her for niceness. She was giving Pontiacs to screeching studio-audience mothers when Donald Trump was firing average Joes on ''The Apprentice'' on NBC (before the show morphed into ''The Celebrity Apprentice'').
Just when you thought she couldn't get any nicer, she has taken it to the level of near-saintliness with the advent of her own network. OWN's signature show, ''Oprah's Lifeclass,'' marches its viewers straight past ephemeral joy, all the way to enlightenment.
In a recent episode, which took on the subject of ego gone wrong, Ms. Winfrey mentioned the time she pulled a wagon full of lard onto her stage. This was in 1988, when she had a less didactic and more show-business-oriented approach. The hunks of wrapped fat transported in the red Radio Flyer represented the 67 pounds she had lost on a diet that allowed her to slip into a pair of size 10 jeans, and her fans greeted the spectacle with gleeful applause.
But nowadays there she is, seated across from the spiritualist Eckhart Tolle as she confesses her ego-driven shame. He is nodding, the studio audience sits mute, and it makes you think all this niceness is oh so much better than all the trashy stuff that preceded it.
Right?

HEADLINE: The 1 Percent Club's Misguided Protectors

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The Republican right is pushing back hard against the 99 percent movement and its focus on the widening chasm between the fortunes of the few at the summit of the income scale and everybody else. Newt Gingrich, who led the field of Republican presidential candidates last week, argued that the concept of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent is ''un-American.'' His rival Rick Perry, who led the Republican pack in September, answered a question about taxes and inequality by saying ''I don't care about that.''
This indifference is grounded in a proposition that has for decades dominated American debate over redistributive policies like steeper taxes for the rich: that inequality is an expected outcome of economic growth, and that efforts to tamp down inequality would slow growth down. As President Obama said in his speech in Kansas last week, this strain of thought goes back to at least the turn of the last century when ''there were people who thought massive inequality and exploitation of people was just the price you pay for progress.'' 
Why, conservatives ask, would people exert themselves, study more and work harder if they could not reap extra rewards from the effort? Trying to fix inequities would only blunt incentives to work and invest. As Mr. Gingrich put it, ''You are not going to get job creation when you engage in class warfare because you have to attack the very people you hope will create jobs.''
This argument is -- at best -- incomplete. Some inequality may be necessary to encourage investment for growth. But as recent research shows, intense inequality actually stunts growth, making it more difficult for countries to sustain the sort of long economic expansions that have characterized the more prosperous nations of the world.
The first chart, based on research by Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry, economists at the International Monetary Fund, reveals the link between inequality and the sustainability of economic growth. Igniting growth is easier than maintaining it. They found that in high-inequality nations spurts of growth ended more quickly, and often in painful contractions.
The chart reports inequality with the so-called Gini index, which is 0 when all households have the same income and 100 when all the income goes to only one household. It shows that regions with high inequality, like sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, have recorded shorter periods of sustained economic growth since 1950 than regions with lower inequality like East Asia. The average stretch of robust growth among relatively equitable industrial countries lasted more than 24 years. In Africa the average was less than 14 years.
The economists found that income distribution contributes more to the sustainability of economic growth than does the quality of a country's political institutions, its foreign debt and openness to trade, the level of foreign investment in the economy and whether its exchange rate is competitive.
It's not too hard to see why. Extreme inequality blocks opportunity for the poor. It can breed resentment and political instability -- discouraging investment -- and lead to political polarization and gridlock, splitting the political system into haves and have-nots. And it can make it harder for governments to address economic imbalances and brewing crises.
Republicans might be tempted to dismiss such analysis as irrelevant to the United States, which is already highly developed. But as the second chart shows, inequality in America has soared over the last 30 years, approaching and even surpassing that in many poor countries. Today, America is an outlier among industrial nations. Its distribution of income looks closer to that of Argentina than, say, Germany.
So it is perhaps unsurprising that our recent economic crisis had some characteristics of boom-and-busts in less developed nations. It was triggered, in part, by 1 percenters on Wall Street persuading regulators to remove restrictions on their casino. It led workers to pile on debt to supplement falling incomes. It ended with a vast deployment of tax dollars to bail out fallen plutocrats. And our political system seems unable to deal with the aftermath.

HEADLINE: Skating Rink Spurs Residents' Latest Fight With Management

BYLINE: ALEXIS OKEOWO


HIGHLIGHT: An ice-skating rink becomes the latest flash point between longtime residents of a historic Manhattan apartment complex and the complex's management. 

 BODY:
Updated with correction, Dec. 13 | In the eyes of some longtime residents of Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, the ruin of their apartment complex has come in stages. First, the development's former managers, Tishman Speyer, opened a green market in 2008, which drew large crowds of nonresidents, and they scheduled noisy music concerts afterward. 
They allowed vendor carts onto the property: neon-colored trucks that sell tacos, Greek food and desserts on the tree-shaded paths. 
And in August, Stuyvesant Town's new managers, Rose Associates sent notice that all residents who kept property in the free storage spaces in the basements of the buildings would have 30 days to remove their belongings, a decision that provoked so much ire it was soon reversed.
Now, a seasonal ice-skating rink that Rose opened at the end of November has again put management and many residents on a collision course. 
A number of residents view the rink as another amenity that Rose Associates is using to try to lure new tenants who are willing to pay higher rents and who have no sense of the role the complex has played in providing low-cost housing to middle-class residents.
Some who live near the rink, which also has a cafe, complain about noise and music and the $7 fee to skate. (Renting skates is another $7.)
"When the rink started to take shape, people became concerned," Alvin Doyle, the president of the Stuyvesant Town tenants' association, said as he walked around the rink on a recent windy morning.
Rose Associates, which manages the apartments for CW Capital, a group of lenders that took over Stuyvesant Town and the neighboring Peter Cooper Village in 2010, said it would provide residents free use of the rink for a few hours on Wednesday afternoons and Sunday mornings. The rink, which was erected over a playground, is open 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and school holidays.
"The quiet enjoyment of our homes has just become collateral damage, and we resent it," said Arlynne Miller, 61, a professional organizer who has lived in Stuyvesant Town for 35 years. "All of these things are marketing schemes to bring in new tenants, who will not stay here very long, who have no vested interest in the community."
The tenants' association has enlisted Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village, in the campaign to halt the rink's operation.
"They wanted me to find out the legality of having an ice rink that you need to pay for in a playground that is ordinarily free for resident use,'' Mr. Garodnick said. "They also asked me to investigate the many other commercial activities that have been taking place in Stuyvesant Town."
Mr. Garodnick has sent several letters to the city's Department of Buildings, Department of City Planning and Department of Environmental Protection to find out if a pay-for-use rink can be placed within a residential zone and if the electrical wires and noise comply with city codes. The Department of Buildings found that the rink was legal but cited noise concerns. In response, Rose Associates put sound buffers on the machinery and agreed to end the music by 7 p.m.
Mr. Garodnick also exchanged letters with Adam Rose, co-president of Rose Associates, to alert him to residents' worries. Mr. Rose assured him that the music coming from the rink would not be overly loud.
Despite the contention, some residents welcome the rink. On a recent Monday night, a cluster of children and a few parents skated in the rink or gathered around tables in the cafe. 
"The rink is right outside of my apartment door, so I've been coming and skating for an hour or so every day," said Mary Sue Lundy, 50, who works for a company that provides business news. She said she had no noise complaints.
Kamini Darson, 41, a financial analyst who has lived in Stuyvesant Town for 11 years, said: "No other community has this, where you can come home after work and then go and skate with the children and it's safe and not crowded. In New York, you rarely get to do outdoor things."
Her daughter, Nadia, 8, a student at the Immaculate Conception School, summed up the sentiment of the young skaters: "The rink is awesome; I wish it could stay here longer."
In the rink's first two weeks, Rose Associates said, about 4,000 people used it.
While rents at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village are still relatively affordable compared with the prices at newer rentals in Manhattan, efforts by successive managers to raise them to market rates have been an uphill battle. The city opened Stuyvesant Town as moderate-income housing in 1947, and several of its original families still live there.
"Residents have been working hard to preserve housing that's affordable, and there has been an effort made by management, right or wrong, to improve the property and to raise the rents," said John McIlwain, a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute. "We're at a time now when incomes, for most people, are pretty flat, and people are very sensitive to costs going up. Residents are perhaps understandably suspicious."
Jim Roth, a retired government worker who has lived in Stuyvesant Town since it opened, has his own hunch about the property manager's agenda. "The new tenants will probably be charged illegal rents," he said. "And then what will they do here next?"
The City Room column on Monday, about the concerns of some residents of Stuyvesant Town that changes at the Manhattan apartment complex are meant to lure new tenants willing to pay higher rents misidentified the management organization that introduced a green market, concerts and food trucks. The changes were made by the development's prior manager, Tishman Speyer - not by the current management firm, Rose Associates.

HEADLINE: Debate Reverberates Going Into Final Stretch

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The rapidly closing window for campaigning puts new pressure on the candidates and their campaigns to respond quickly and aggressively to moments from the debate. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has 23 days to confront any political damage from what may become the most memorable moment of Saturday night's debate -- the image of him offering to wager $10,000 to settle a bet with Rick Perry over the contents of Mr. Romney's latest book.
Mr. Romney heads to New Hampshire Sunday evening and will campaign there, in Iowa and in South Carolina in the coming week as he battles Newt Gingrich and his other rivals before voting begins on Jan. 3. The seven remaining candidates will face each other one more time before then during a debate in western Iowa on Thursday night.
The rapidly closing window for campaigning puts new pressure on the candidates and their campaigns to respond quickly and aggressively to offer defenses against bad debate moments -- or to take maximum advantage of good ones.
Mr. Gingrich faces the challenge of building on his lead in the polls and capitalizing on what early reviews suggested was another strong debate performance on Saturday night. His campaign quickly posted video of Mr. Gingrich vowing to tell the truth like Ronald Reagan did.
For the other Republican candidates, like Michele Bachmann, the trick will be to use the memorable debate moments to try and generate a new buzz around their candidacies. That may be increasingly difficult to do as the media increasingly focuses on the new rivalry between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney.
On Monday, the one candidate who didn't participate in Saturday's debate, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., will face off againt Mr. Gingrich in a two-person, Lincoln-Douglass style debate in New Hampshire, where Mr. Huntsman is hoping to make a last stand in his bid for the nomination.
But until the next debate, much of the political conversation in the country -- and among the candidates fighting for the Republican nomination -- will revolve around what was said at Drake University in Des Moines last night.
Here are five of the key moments that will fuel that conversation.
1. $10,000 bucks? 
It looked like a scripted moment; one of those overly practiced lines that politicians love to have in their back pocket, ready to whip out at just the right time. As soon as Rick Perry started his attack on a passage about health care in Mr. Romney's book, Mr. Romney lunged out his hand, offering a bet on whether he had changed his position.
"10,000 bucks? $10,000 bet?" Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Perry demurred, saying that "I'm not in the bettin' business."
The danger for Mr. Romney is that the size of the bet was so large and so out of reach for many Americans, for whom $10,000 amounts to a huge chunk of their annual salary. The Democratic National Committee pounced, tweeting repeatedly on Saturday night with the hashtag #What10kBuys.
Republicans seized on it too. Mr. Huntsman's campaign promised to launch the website www.10kbet.com soon. And Representative Michele Bachmann's spokeswoman told reporters that $10,000 was "three or four months salary" for many voters in Iowa.
The moment was similar to one earlier this year, when Mr. Romney answered a heckler at the Iowa state fair by saying that "corporations are people, my friend." Democrats seized on the clip as evidence that Mr. Romney was no friend of average Americans.
Like the corporations incident, the $10,000 bet may be most dangerous for Mr. Romney if he becomes the nominee and has to explain it to a broader electorate.
Aides to Mr. Romney conceded it wasn't his best moment, but insisted that it does not fundamentally change the dynamic in the race. People know that Mr. Romney is rich, they said, and his opponents were always going to try and use that against him.
But the economic unease in the country could make the moment particularly dangerous for Mr. Romney if his rivals are able to successfully paint him as out of touch with middle America. It's particularly problematic given Mr. Romney's recent attempts at populism by tailoring some of his economic proposals directly at the middle class instead of the wealthy.
In the debate, Mr. Romney confronted the issue head-on: " I didn't grow up poor," he said. "And if somebody is looking for someone who's grown up with that background, I'm -- I'm not the person. But I -- but I grew up with a dad who'd been poor, and my dad wanted to make sure I understood the lessons of hard work."
Now, the question is whether that argument will win out over the political noise from his $10,000 bet.
2. Newt's Humility?
If there's anything that's whispered about in Washington, it's how vulnerable Mr. Gingrich might be because of his personal life -- three marriages, one of them broken up because of his own infidelity with his current wife.
But Mr. Gingrich -- now in the lead in most polls -- created one of the more memorable moments in the debate Saturday night by handling the issue deftly when it was raised by the moderators.
He didn't object to the question or call it stupid, as he has so many times about other subjects in previous debates. He waited patiently as the other candidates took their turns talking about their successful marriages. And then he humbly accepted responsibility for the mistakes he has made.
"In my case, I said up-front openly I've made mistakes at times," Mr. Gingrich said. "I've had to go to God for forgiveness. I've had to seek reconciliation. But I'm also a 68-year-old grandfather. And I think people have to measure who I am now and whether I'm a person they can trust."
It was an un-Gingrich-like answer to what began as a pretty direct assault on his character from Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas. Asked about the importance of marital vows and faith, Mr. Perry took a barely veiled swipe at Mr. Gingrich's marriages.
"I think the voters are wise enough to figure that one out," he said. "I've always kind of been of the opinion that -- if you cheat on your wife, you'll cheat on your business partner."
3. Mr. Newt Romney.
If Mrs. Bachmann was looking for a moment that could help her regain the spotlight in the days that are left, she may have found it.
By creating a new opponent -- Newt Romney -- Mrs. Bachmann offered a catchy new slogan for conservatives who think that both men are not true believers in their causes.
"If you look at Newt Romney, they were for ObamaCare principles," she said. "If you look at Newt Romney, they were for cap and trade. If you look at Newt Romney, they-- for the illegal immigration problem. And if you look at New Romney, they were for the $700 billion bailout. And you just heard Newt/Romney is also with Obama on the issue of the payroll extension."
The phrase recalls the success that Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, briefly had by combining Mr. Romney's name with "Obamacare" and coming up with "Obamneycare." His refusal to use the phrase during a debate made him look afraid to attack and contributed to his early departure from the race.
The question may be whether Mrs. Bachmann can sustain the criticism of both Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney during the days ahead in ways that capture the imagination of voters and the attention of the media.
4. Ted Kennedy? 
If Mr. Romney flubbed his prepared line, Mr. Gingrich did not. As soon as Mr. Romney contrasted his experience in the business sector with Mr. Gingrich's years of Washington work, he was ready.
"Let's be candid," Mr. Gingrich said to Mr. Romney. "The only reason you didn't become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994."
The audience booed -- but not at either man on the stage; Republicans just boo at the mention of the late Mr. Kennedy, a liberal icon. Mr. Romney ran against Mr. Kennedy in 1994, but lost the race and did not make another attempt to get back into politics until 2002.
"I'm a citizen, I've served the country in many ways, you're a citizen, you served the country in many ways," Mr. Gingrich added. "But it's a bit much. You would have been a 17-year career politician by now, if you'd won. That's, that's all I'm saying on that one."
Mr. Romney had a good comeback when it was his turn, noting that "if I would've been able to get in the NFL liked I hope when I was a kid, why, I would have been a football star all my life too."
Taken together, the back-and-forth is likely to remain one of the most memorable moments, in part because it gets at the central question between the two leading candidates for the Republican nomination: what kind of experience is better?
Mr. Romney and groups working on his behalf are already pressing that question with voters in appearances and television ads. And Mr. Gingrich is not shy about saying whenever he can that his experience as the Speaker for four years is part of what he is selling to voters.
Mr. Gingrich is trying to undermine Mr. Romney's claim to have spent most of his adult life as a businessman. There's very little time left for Mr. Gingrich to get that message across to voters.
A debate moment like that can't hurt his cause.
5. Palestine and Israel
Perhaps the only foreign policy moment to emerge from Saturday's debate was the exchange over Palestine, and especially Mr. Gingrich's heated refusal to back down on his characterization that Palestinians are an "invented" group of people.
Mr. Gingrich sought to portray himself as a truth-teller who was willing to stand up on behalf of Israel.
"Somebody oughta have the courage to tell the truth: These people are terrorists. They teach terrorism in their schools," he said. "It's fundamentally time for somebody to have the guts to stand up and say, 'Enough lying about the Middle East.'"
A few minutes later, Mr. Gingrich summoned the memory of Ronald Reagan, saying that "sometimes it is helpful to have a president of the United States with the courage to tell the truth, just as was Ronald Reagan who went around his entire national security apparatus to call the Soviet Union an evil empire and who overruled his entire State Department in order to say, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'"
But his rivals are just as certain to characterize his statements as the rantings of a hothead who does not have the temperament to be the commander-in-chief. Mr. Romney began to make that argument during the debate, and it's likely he will continue on the trail.
"I will exercise sobriety, care, stability," Mr. Romney said, seeming to suggest that Mr. Gingrich has none of those attributes. "And make sure that in a setting like this, anything I say that can affect a place with-- with rockets going in, with people dying, I don't do anything that would harm that-- that process."
Rick Santorum echoed Mr. Romney, saying that "I think you have to speak the truth, but you have to do so with prudence. I mean, it's, it's a combination."
The question going forward, however, is whether Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum and others can effectively raise serious doubts about how Mr. Gingrich might handle foreign policy -- especially during a time when most voters are more concerned about their economic situation.

HEADLINE: A Romance With Risk That Brought On a Panic

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED, BEN PROTESS and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Corzine's $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign debt turned out to be profitable, but the fear it induced brought down MF Global. In the meantime, the search is on for $1 billion in customer money that has gone missing. 

 BODY:
Soon after taking the reins of MF Global in 2010, Jon S. Corzine visited the Wall Street firm's Chicago offices for the first time, greeting the brokers, analysts and sales staff there.
One broker, Cy Monley, caught Mr. Corzine's eye. Unknown to MF Global's top management in New York, the employee, whose job was to match buyers and sellers in energy derivatives, was also trading a small account on the side, using the firm's capital.
"How are you making money on side bets? What else are you guys doing to make money here?" Mr. Corzine asked enthusiastically, his eyes widening, the broker recalled. The new chief executive grabbed a seat and spent an hour questioning Mr. Monley as other top executives from New York hovered impatiently nearby.
Although Mr. Corzine had been a United States senator, governor of New Jersey, co-head of Goldman Sachs and a confidant of leaders in Washington and Wall Street, he was at heart a trader, willing to gamble for a rich payoff.
Dozens of interviews reveal that Mr. Corzine played a much larger, hands-on role in the firm's high-stakes risk-taking than has previously been known.
An examination of company documents and interviews with regulators, former employees and others close to MF Global portray a chief executive convinced that he could quickly turn the money-losing firm into a miniature Goldman Sachs.
He pushed through a $6.3 billion bet on European debt - a wager big enough to wipe out the firm five times over if it went bad - despite concerns from other executives and board members. And it is now clear that he personally lobbied regulators and auditors about the strategy.
His obsession with trading was apparent to MF Global insiders over his 19-month tenure. Mr. Corzine compulsively traded for the firm on his BlackBerry during meetings, sometimes dashing out to check on the markets. And unusually for a chief executive, he became a core member of the group that traded using the firm's money. His profits and losses appeared on a separate line in documents with his initials: JSC.
Yet few appeared willing to check Mr. Corzine's trading ambitions.
The review of his tenure also sheds new light on the lack of controls at the firm and the failure of its watchdogs to curb outsize risk-taking. The board, according to former employees, signed off on the European bet multiple times. And for the first time it is now clear that ratings agencies knew the risks for months but, as they did with subprime mortgages, looked the other way until it was too late, underscoring how three years after the financial crisis, little has changed on Wall Street.
MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31. As the firm spun out of control, it improperly transferred some customer money on Oct. 21 - days sooner than previously thought, said people briefed on the matter. And investigators are now examining whether MF Global was getting away with such illicit transfers as early as August, one person said, a revelation that would point to wrongdoing even before the firm was struggling to survive.
The consequences of the firm's collapse have been severe: Some $1 billion in customer money remains missing and thousands of clients, including small farmers in Kansas or hedge funds in Connecticut, still do not have nearly a third of their funds.
Some of that money may never be recovered if, as some regulators now fear, MF Global used it to cover trading losses and replenish overdrawn bank accounts.
The bet on European sovereign debt is not thought to be directly connected to the missing money. But the fears about the firm's exposure to Europe tipped an anxious market, causing a run on MF Global that regulators suspect led the firm to fight for its life using customer money.
Mr. Corzine has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment for this article.
While Mr. Corzine apologized for the firm's collapse when he appeared before the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday, he has continued to defend the European trade, calling it "prudent" at the time.
The European trade was initiated by Mr. Corzine late in the summer of 2010. The new chief executive explained the bet to a small group of top traders, arguing that Europe would not let its brethren default. In just a few months, the trade swelled to $6.3 billion, from $1.5 billion.
Europe's debt crisis, meanwhile, continued to flare, raising questions about whether some of the Continent's bigger economies, Spain and Italy, might be ensnared in the maelstrom.
In August, some directors questioned the chief executive, asking him to reduce the size of the position. Mr. Corzine calmly assured them they had little to fear.
"If you want a smaller or different position, maybe you don't have the right guy here," he told them, according to a person familiar with the matter. He also told one senior board member that he would "be willing to step down" if they "had lost confidence in me," Mr. Corzine told Congress on Thursday, although he said he had not intended to make a threat.
The board relented.
A Curious Career Move
Few would have guessed that Mr. Corzine, having led Goldman Sachs before serving in the Senate and as a governor of New Jersey, would wind up the chief executive of a little-known brokerage house.
At Goldman, which he joined in 1975, the young bond trader quickly gained a reputation as someone able to take big risks and generate big profits. Even after ascending to the top of the firm, he kept his own trading account to make bets with the firm's capital. In 1999, Mr. Corzine was ousted from Goldman amid a power struggle.
By 2010, having suffered a stinging defeat in his bid for re-election as the Democratic governor of New Jersey, Mr. Corzine hoped to resume his career on Wall Street.
A friend, J. Christopher Flowers, one of MF Global's largest investors, helped him get there. Mr. Corzine and Mr. Flowers worked at Goldman decades ago, and at one point, Mr. Flowers helped manage Mr. Corzine's vast wealth while he was a senator, according to Congressional records.
Mr. Corzine's arrival was a coup. MF Global had hired an executive search firm, Westwood Partners, to hunt for a new leader. But some members of the board, including David I. Schamis, who worked for Mr. Flowers, were recruiting Mr. Corzine.
He was a popular manager, former employees say. An avuncular presence with a beard and sweater vest, he had a knack for remembering names. Even in the firm's final hours, they recall that Mr. Corzine never lost his temper. His work ethic also impressed colleagues. He often started his day with a five-mile run, landing in the office by 6 a.m. and was regularly the last person to leave the office.
His intense routine was on par with his ambitions for the firm. With 15 top executives in the firm's boardroom on his first day, March 23, 2010, he said, "I think this firm has tremendous potential and I can't wait to get started," one person who attended said.
Mr. Corzine faced a steep challenge.
For years, MF Global aligned buyers and sellers of futures contracts for commodities like wheat or metals, and took a small commission along the way. But over the last decade, that business had become endangered. By the time Mr. Corzine arrived, near zero-percent interest rates and paper-thin commissions had led to five consecutive quarters of losses.
Soon after taking the helm, Mr. Corzine oversaw a wave of job cuts and overhauled compensation, moving from steady commissions to salary and discretionary bonuses like the rest of Wall Street.
At the same time, Mr. Corzine filled the ranks with employees from Goldman Sachs and hedge funds like the Soros Fund Management. He recruited Bradley Abelow, a fellow Goldman alumnus and a top aide when he was governor, to be chief operating officer.
Mr. Corzine arrived just as Washington was pressing the big banks to curb their lucrative yet risky businesses. Spotting an opening, he fashioned new trading desks, including one just for mortgage securities and a separate unit to trade using the firm's own capital, a business known as proprietary trading.
Not to be outdone, Mr. Corzine was the most profitable trader in that team, known as the Principal Strategies Group, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Corzine traded oil, Treasury securities and currencies and earned in excess of $10 million for the firm in 2011, the person said.
Some inside MF Global worried that the expansion of the profitable trading business in New York came at the expense of its futures clearing operation, which was centered in Chicago. To drum up sales, Chicago brokers were pushed to introduce longtime clients to their counterparts in New York, a move that raised tensions.
At times, Mr. Corzine seemed unfamiliar with some aspects of the futures division. In June, speaking at the Sandler O'Neill Financial Services Conference at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Corzine stumbled. "Right now, if you thought about MF Global's retail business, you probably could only think of - ," he said, then paused to recall the name of the division at MF Global that catered to individual investors.
He leaned over to an aide, who told him it was Lind-Waldock.
'Chief Risk Officer'
"I consider one of my most important jobs to be chief risk officer of our firm," Mr. Corzine told that conference.
Yet soon after joining MF Global, Mr. Corzine torpedoed an effort to build a new risk system, a much-needed overhaul, according to former employees. (A person familiar with Mr. Corzine's thinking said that he saw the need to upgrade, but that the system being proposed was "unduly expensive" and was focused in part on things the firm didn't trade.)
While risk at the firm had been sharply increased with the bet on European sovereign debt, there was a compelling argument for Mr. Corzine's strategy.
MF Global had obtained loans to buy debt of Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations, while simultaneously pledging the bonds as collateral to support the loans. The loans would come due when the bonds matured, which would happen no later than the end of 2012. MF Global, Mr. Corzine reckoned, would profit on the spread between the interest paid on the loans and the coupons earned from the bonds.
But the size of the European position was making the firm's top risk officers, Michael Roseman and Talha Chaudhry, increasingly uncomfortable by late 2010, according to people familiar with the situation. They pushed Mr. Corzine to seek approval from the board if he wanted to expand it.
Mr. Roseman then gave a PowerPoint presentation for board members, explaining the sovereign debt trade as Mr. Corzine sat a few feet away. The presentation made clear the risks, which hinged on the nations not defaulting or the bonds losing so much value they caused a cash squeeze. The directors approved the increase. Mr. Roseman eventually left the firm.
Within MF Global, Mr. Corzine welcomed discussion about his bet and his reasons for it, though some senior managers said they feared confronting such a prominent figure. Those who did challenge him recall making little progress. One senior trader said that each time he addressed his concerns, the chief executive would nod with understanding but do nothing.
These concerns were only internal at first because, while MF Global had disclosed the existence of the transactions in at least one filing in 2010, it never mentioned the extent to which they were used to finance the purchase of European debt.
The firm bought its European sovereign bonds making use of an arcane transaction known as repurchase-to-maturity. Repo-to-maturity allowed the company to classify the purchase of the bonds as a sale, rather than a risky bet subject to the whims of the market. That called to mind an earlier era of trading when firms used repo-to-maturity to finance the purchase of risk-free assets like United States Treasury securities, Mr. Corzine's specialty at Goldman many years earlier.
"It's like a bond trader from 15 years ago went to sleep and suddenly awoke to make these trades," one regulator who later reviewed the transactions remarked to a colleague.
Eventually, MF Global's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked Mr. Corzine to report the European debt exposure to his investors. He personally met with the accounting firm in December 2010, two people said, and it was agreed that the transactions would be mentioned in a footnote in the firm's annual report, which was filed on May 20, 2011.
Earlier, one of MF Global's many regulators noticed something curious. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which helped watch over MF Global's securities business, noticed a sharp swing in profits in a monthly report the firm filed to regulators. Finra asked MF Global executives about the volatile accounting line but did not get a satisfactory answer, say people familiar with the matter, until the annual report came out weeks later.
When Finra realized what MF Global was doing, it grew concerned. The Wall Street self-regulator told MF Global to set aside enough money in case the trades went bad. But Finra didn't have the authority to force the firm to do so - that power was in the hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose rule Finra was citing.
Mr. Corzine then personally took the firm's case to the S.E.C. in mid-August, taking the Delta Shuttle to Washington for a meeting with a top agency official.
The S.E.C. indicated it would side with Finra, but needed a few weeks to make a final determination. In the meantime, MF Global and Finra haggled over the size of the capital cushion: the regulator wanted $200 million set aside, while the firm pushed for a figure closer to $50 million. In late August, Finra won out.
It would be the beginning of the end for MF Global.
The Unwinding
MF Global's investors may not have been fully informed about the European bet, but the firm's executives had been explaining the strategy to the ratings agencies for months, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations. Indeed, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's had applauded Mr. Corzine's effort to overhaul the firm, a move that included ratcheting up risk.
"We consider the most recent strategic plan of the new C.E.O. Jon Corzine to be sound," S.& P. said in 2010, while acknowledging the plan "will incrementally increase the firm's risk profile."
But the move by Finra to force the extra capital cushion appeared to only unnerve the ratings agencies when news reports about it emerged in October. A week later, Moody's cut its rating on MF Global to a notch above junk, pointing to the European debt holdings.
The reversal angered some executives at MF Global, who felt it was disingenuous for the agency to change its mind so suddenly. A spokesman for the ratings agency said, "Moody's does not refrain from taking rating action when its opinion on the credit risk of an issuer has changed."
The downgrade sent MF Global into free fall on Oct. 25. Its stock price plunged and trading partners and lenders demanded more capital to continue doing business with the company. At day's end, rattled employees dialed into a conference call with Mr. Corzine, who tried to be encouraging.
"The sun will come out tomorrow," he told them, according to one employee.
In truth, the company had just two options: sell itself or unload assets. Mr. Corzine organized two teams. Mr. Abelow, his deputy, began hunting for a buyer and decamped to the 40th floor of the firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters. On the 39th floor, where his office was next to the trading floor, Mr. Corzine took charge of selling the assets.
On Friday evening, Oct. 28, regulators and top executives trooped into Mr. Corzine's office, joining a phone conference with Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C. Pictures of Mr. Corzine with Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton sat on shelves near his desk. Towering stacks of paper lined the walls and windowsills of his modest office, partly obscuring the window view.
Dressed in his trademark sweater vest, Mr. Corzine expressed confidence a deal would be reached with one of the potential buyers, which included Interactive Brokers, JPMorgan Chase, the Jefferies Group and the Macquarie Group, according to people briefed on the call.
A deal became crucial as trading partners and lenders circled the firm. LCH.Clearnet, the firm responsible for clearing the vast majority of MF Global's European sovereign debt trades, was also demanding $200 million to maintain the positions, atop $100 million it had claimed from MF Global earlier in the week, one person briefed on the situation said.
Other people close to the investigation, led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division, have said that as the firm rushed to pay off creditors, MF Global dipped again and again into customer funds to meet the demands.
The bidders dropped out one by one, leaving just Interactive Brokers on Sunday, Oct. 30. Mr. Corzine and his team briefed regulators at 2 p.m. saying a sale looked likely to go through. About nine hours later, he got word that more than $950 million in customer funds was missing, making a merger impossible. The day after the bankruptcy, Mr. Corzine sifted through transactions in the hope of locating the missing money, one person said.
Ultimately, the bets Corzine placed wound up better than the firm itself. The European debt trades were profitable, though too late for MF Global.
Before Congress on Thursday, Mr. Corzine continued to emphasize how well his trades held up. "As of today, none of the foreign debt securities that MF Global used," he said, "has defaulted or been restructured."
"There actually were no losses."

HIGHLIGHT: In this edition: Newt Gingrich on the rise, fashionably late Republican candidates and brokered convention conversations. 

 BODY:
Reactions
Newt Gingrich's rise in polls has led to much speculation about whether any of the current Republican presidential aspirants can marry support from both rank and file conservatives and the G.O.P. establishment. Mitt Romney, judging by his lead in endorsements, seems to have the support of Republican elites, while Mr. Gingrich, at the moment, has the advantage in popular support: a healthy advantage in national polls.
Given this, FiveThirtyEight laid out why a brokered Republican convention or a dark horse entrant into the nomination contest are plausible, although not exceptionally probable. The Washington Post's Ezra Klein, however, sees a dark horse nominee or a brokered convention as not only possible, but -- as long as Mr. Gingrich sits atop the polls -- pretty likely. Mr. Klein wrote, "There's just no way the Republican establishment lets Gingrich become their nominee."
James Joyner at Outside the Beltway was skeptical, particularly of the late entrant possibility, noting that the filing deadlines for candidates to enter state primaries are a significant, if not prohibitive obstacle to any late arriving G.O.P. candidate.
At A Plain Blog About Politics, Jonathan Bernstein, too, thought that even if public opinion might leave an opening for another Republican candidate, the nominating process does not, we're too far along. Business Insider's Michael Brendan Dougherty was another dark horse doubter. Mr. Dougherty called discussion of even the possibility of a brokered convention "crazy talk," and wrote, "almost every election season pundits and commentators predict the possibility of brokered conventions. Why? Because they are very exciting for pundits and commentators."

Then, assuming there is a navigable path to the nomination available for a late entrant, there's the question, who exactly would this savior candidate be? The Hill's Christian Heinze wrote, "Except for Chris Christie, I can't see one of the names floated as being plausible or a significantly better candidate." Mr. Heinze followed with the flaws he sees in a Jeb Bush, Mitch Daniels or Paul Ryan candidacy.
Weekly Standard Editor William Kristol mused that if the Romney and Gingrich campaigns stumble during January, a Republican white knight could ride to the rescue in the gap between the Iowa and New Hampshire contests and Super Tuesday (March 8). Mr. Kristol's preferred knight: a Ryan-Marco Rubio ticket.
Mr. Gingrich's new front(ish)-runner status was explored smartly by Liz Halloran at NPR, who pointed to FiveThirtyEight's post, "How Safe Is Gingrich's Lead in Iowa?" (kind of safe, as it turns out). The New Republic's Jonathan Cohn also wrote an interesting analysis of the campaigns of Mr. Gingrich and Mitt Romney, concluding that, "I'll be surprised if Gingrich isn't the clear Romney alternative when Iowans trudge to their caucuses on January 5 - and for some time afterwards."
A few days after Thanksgiving, The Union Leader, New Hampshire's largest newspaper, endorsed Newt Gingrich for president (Mr. Gingrich will have to wait till next year's Turkey Day to give thanks). FiveThirtyEight found that candidates endorsed by the paper have generally outperformed their polling. Amy Bingham, at ABC News, looked at the role of newspaper endorsements in elections more generally and observed that "newspaper endorsements aren't what they used to be."
Finally, our comment-of-the-half-month goes to Dan from Cambridge, Mass. Writing in response to "Does Romney Have a Moderate Problem?" which highlighted Mr. Romney's surprisingly weak support among Republican moderates, Dan wrote, "I also think his inevitability strategy is hurting him. He's been playing prevent defense and that doesn't make him appear as a strong candidate. He hasn't done anything to take down the other GOP candidates, they have exposed their own flaws and fallen apart in the spotlight. Sitting back and hoping Obama falls apart is not a winning strategy." Read the whole comment here. Dan's comment was pretty prophetic actually, and Mr. Romney's campaign must have agreed with him. A few days later the Romney campaign "opened a new, more aggressive phase to capture the Republican nomination,"wrote our colleagueMichael D. Shear.

It's another data visualization edition of Reads, but with a British tinge this time:
The BBC took some grisly data and put together an arresting graphic showing deaths and injuries on the roads of Great Britain from 1999 to 2010 (make sure you watch the video below the graphic).
The Economist plotted the correlation between public-sector graft and the U.N.'s Human Development Index.
On The Guardian's DataBlog, a graphic by Information is Beautiful shows the scale of various disasters.

HEADLINE: Class Matters. Why Won't We Admit It?

BYLINE: By HELEN F. LADD and EDWARD B. FISKE. 
Helen F. Ladd is a professor of public policy and economics at Duke. Edward B. Fiske, a former education editor of The New York Times, is the author of the ''Fiske Guide to Colleges.''

 BODY:
Durham, N.C.
NO one seriously disputes the fact that students from disadvantaged households perform less well in school, on average, than their peers from more advantaged backgrounds. But rather than confront this fact of life head-on, our policy makers mistakenly continue to reason that, since they cannot change the backgrounds of students, they should focus on things they can control.
No Child Left Behind, President George W. Bush's signature education law, did this by setting unrealistically high -- and ultimately self-defeating -- expectations for all schools. President Obama's policies have concentrated on trying to make schools more ''efficient'' through means like judging teachers by their students' test scores or encouraging competition by promoting the creation of charter schools. The proverbial story of the drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost comes to mind.
The Occupy movement has catalyzed rising anxiety over income inequality; we desperately need a similar reminder of the relationship between economic advantage and student performance. 
The correlation has been abundantly documented, notably by the famous Coleman Report in 1966. New research by Sean F. Reardon of Stanford University traces the achievement gap between children from high- and low-income families over the last 50 years and finds that it now far exceeds the gap between white and black students.
Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress show that more than 40 percent of the variation in average reading scores and 46 percent of the variation in average math scores across states is associated with variation in child poverty rates.
International research tells the same story. Results of the 2009 reading tests conducted by the Program for International Student Assessment show that, among 15-year-olds in the United States and the 13 countries whose students outperformed ours, students with lower economic and social status had far lower test scores than their more advantaged counterparts within every country. Can anyone credibly believe that the mediocre overall performance of American students on international tests is unrelated to the fact that one-fifth of American children live in poverty?
Yet federal education policy seems blind to all this. No Child Left Behind required all schools to bring all students to high levels of achievement but took no note of the challenges that disadvantaged students face. The legislation did, to be sure, specify that subgroups -- defined by income, minority status and proficiency in English -- must meet the same achievement standard. But it did so only to make sure that schools did not ignore their disadvantaged students -- not to help them address the challenges they carry with them into the classroom.
So why do presumably well-intentioned policy makers ignore, or deny, the correlations of family background and student achievement?
Some honestly believe that schools are capable of offsetting the effects of poverty. Others want to avoid the impression that they set lower expectations for some groups of students for fear that those expectations will be self-fulfilling. In both cases, simply wanting something to be true does not make it so.
Another rationale for denial is to note that some schools, like the Knowledge Is Power Program charter schools, have managed to ''beat the odds.'' If some schools can succeed, the argument goes, then it is reasonable to expect all schools to. But close scrutiny of charter school performance has shown that many of the success stories have been limited to particular grades or subjects and may be attributable to substantial outside financing or extraordinarily long working hours on the part of teachers. The evidence does not support the view that the few success stories can be scaled up to address the needs of large populations of disadvantaged students.
A final rationale for denying the correlation is more nefarious. As we are now seeing, requiring all schools to meet the same high standards for all students, regardless of family background, will inevitably lead either to large numbers of failing schools or to a dramatic lowering of state standards. Both serve to discredit the public education system and lend support to arguments that the system is failing and needs fundamental change, like privatization.
Given the budget crises at the national and state levels, and the strong political power of conservative groups, a significant effort to reduce poverty or deal with the closely related issue of racial segregation is not in the political cards, at least for now.
So what can be done?
Large bodies of research have shown how poor health and nutrition inhibit child development and learning and, conversely, how high-quality early childhood and preschool education programs can enhance them. We understand the importance of early exposure to rich language on future cognitive development. We know that low-income students experience greater learning loss during the summer when their more privileged peers are enjoying travel and other enriching activities.
Since they can't take on poverty itself, education policy makers should try to provide poor students with the social support and experiences that middle-class students enjoy as a matter of course.
It can be done. In North Carolina, the two-year-old East Durham Children's Initiative is one of many efforts around the country to replicate Geoffrey Canada's well-known successes with the Harlem Children's Zone.
Say Yes to Education in Syracuse, N.Y., supports access to afterschool programs and summer camps and places social workers in schools. In Omaha, Building Bright Futures sponsors school-based health centers and offers mentoring and enrichment services. Citizen Schools, based in Boston, recruits volunteers in seven states to share their interests and skills with middle-school students.
Promise Neighborhoods, an Obama administration effort that gives grants to programs like these, is a welcome first step, but it has been under-financed.
Other countries already pursue such strategies. In Finland, with its famously high-performing schools, schools provide food and free health care for students. Developmental needs are addressed early. Counseling services are abundant.
But in the United States over the past decade, it became fashionable among supporters of the ''no excuses'' approach to school improvement to accuse anyone raising the poverty issue of letting schools off the hook -- or what Mr. Bush famously called ''the soft bigotry of low expectations.''
Such accusations may afford the illusion of a moral high ground, but they stand in the way of serious efforts to improve education and, for that matter, go a long way toward explaining why No Child Left Behind has not worked.
Yes, we need to make sure that all children, and particularly disadvantaged children, have access to good schools, as defined by the quality of teachers and principals and of internal policies and practices.
But let's not pretend that family background does not matter and can be overlooked. Let's agree that we know a lot about how to address the ways in which poverty undermines student learning. Whether we choose to face up to that reality is ultimately a moral question.

HEADLINE: Noriega Is Sent to Prison Back in Panama, Where the Terror Has Turned to Shrugs

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
PANAMA -- Nearly 22 years ago an American military plane whisked the de facto leader of this nation, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, off to Florida to face trial, and ultimately a prison sentence, for drug trafficking.
On Sunday evening, a commercial airliner landed here with much less fanfare, carrying him back. After flying more than 15 hours from Paris, where he had served additional time for money laundering, Mr. Noriega arrived at El Renacer Prison, a former American facility, to complete a 20-year sentence for three convictions stemming from several deaths and await possible further judgment in Panama's courts.
As the plane descended, a doctor checked Mr. Noriega, 77, who appeared to react to seeing the capital city from the air for the first time in years, a correspondent on the plane said. 
Mr. Noriega was kept out of public view after he landed at 6:08 p.m. aboard Iberia Airlines Flight 6345. A photo released by the Panamanian government showed him at the prison in a wheelchair, with a thin smile and wearing a dark suit, a red tie and a dark windbreaker slung partly over him.
Later, prison officials, responding to rumors that Mr. Noriega was not really in Panama, wheeled him to a doorway and Mr. Noriega, now in a red long-sleeve shirt and white sweatpants, gestured to reporters kept far away. The prison director, Angel Calderon, said Mr. Noriega was declining interviews and close-up pictures, as his right.
The limited glimpse just added to many Panamanians' sense of Mr. Noriega as a cipher. Three-quarters of the citizens were young children when he was seized, so he often comes across as someone parents may talk about but one who arouses little passion either way.
Panama has clearly moved on. It has held four presidential elections declared clean by international observers. An economic boom has altered the skyline with gleaming skyscrapers. Even longtime opponents concede that public rancor has faded, although many who lost loved ones or were tortured under the Noriega dictatorship, from 1983 to 1989, said they would fight for him to face additional trials here and demand his accomplices pay, too.
Relatives of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a popular opponent whose decapitated body was found in 1985, recently demanded that Mr. Noriega disclose the location of Dr. Spadafora's skull. Others believe Mr. Noriega can shed light on dozens of murders and disappearances, and there is speculation he harbors political secrets that can damage the elite.
Still, he is largely the obsession of longtime Noriega watchers, not Panamanians in general.
''There is no hatred among the public,'' said Guillermo Sanchez Borbon, a co-author of the Noriega biography ''In the Time of the Tyrants.'' ''We Panamanians are the kind of people to make a fuss for a couple of days and then move on.''
Demonstrations leading up to his return were small, and on Sunday people flocked instead to the annual holiday children's parade on Calle 50, a major thoroughfare here that was a hotbed of protest when he ruled.
Renata Flores, 52, said she had waved white flags and banged pots in protests in the months before Mr. Noriega's departure but shrugged off his return now.
''He has been in prison and is probably not going to have a big impact now,'' she said, holding the hand of her niece, Florencia, 12.
Florencia said she knew little about Mr. Noriega.
''The truth is,'' she said, ''I only know they used to call him Pineapple Face,'' a reference to his severe acne and resulting scars.
It was, then, a somewhat anticlimactic end to an extraordinary odyssey.
Mr. Noriega rose through the ranks of the military during the 1970s and 1980s, eventually assuming command and essentially running the country through threats, intimidation and force.
He was an informant for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration, historians have written, but also took payments from Colombian drug traffickers to allow cocaine to pass through Panama to the United States, American prosecutors said.
As tensions grew, President George Bush ordered an invasion on Dec. 20, 1989, of more than 27,000 troops, then the largest American military action since the Vietnam War.
Mr. Noriega, exhausted and tormented by deafening heavy metal music that troops played outside the Vatican Embassy, where he had taken refuge, surrendered on Jan. 4, 1990. He was convicted on drug and racketeering charges in 1992 and, at the conclusion of his prison sentence in Miami, was extradited to France in 2010.
With his French sentence completed, Mr. Noriega could have walked free had Panama not requested his extradition, Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez has said, batting away suggestions from critics of Panama's president, Ricardo Martinelli, that he orchestrated Mr. Noriega's return to distract attention from political scandals at home.
Those who had fought his regime said they hoped his arrival reminded people that democracy should not be taken for granted.
''Society should remember again that the military cannot return to power,'' said Roberto Arosemena, a former opposition party leader repeatedly beaten by Mr. Noriega's police in 1987.

HEADLINE: State Takeovers of Other Districts Have Had Mixed Results

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
A state takeover can bring additional resources and expertise to a troubled district, allow for more radical changes, and help deter nepotism, bickering and personal agendas among school board members. But it is usually a last resort because of staunch local opposition. 
''Schools districts are best served by members of the local community who know their unique needs,'' said Reginald Felton, assistant executive director of the National School Board Association. ''We believe that operating from a federal or state level is too far removed from where the action needs to take place.''
Moreover, state takeovers have produced mixed results: Emery, Calif., ended a decade of state control in September after repaying a $1.3 million state emergency loan, but Roosevelt, N.Y., on Long Island, has had persistently poor test scores in the nine years since a state takeover.
Jonathan A. Supovitz, an education professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said research showed that state takeovers were more likely to improve a district's central administration and support services than classroom instruction.
''The real question is, where is the source of the problem?'' he said. ''If the problem lies deeper in socioeconomic issues or local school issues, my sense is a takeover would be less effective.''
Here is a look at what has happened in a few cases around the country:
PHILADELPHIA After years of poor achievement and budget crises, the state replaced the school board in 2001 with a school reform commission consisting of three members appointed by the governor and two by the mayor. The district adopted a common curriculum and new accountability measures, among other changes, that resulted in higher achievement. However, it continues to face budget problems and turmoil over a controversial schools leader who departed in August.
OAKLAND, CALIF. The takeover in 2003 was set off by a financial crisis that eventually necessitated $100 million in state emergency money that the district is still paying back, though it regained local control in 2009. While there have been improvements in school financing and test scores, many residents say state control drove families out of the district.
BRIDGEPORT, CONN. The state dissolved the elected school board for the 20,000-student district in July at the request of the board's president and others who blamed division and dysfunction among its members for holding up progress. Since then, the state has appointed a new board, spurring some parents, former board members and others to sue.
ROOSEVELT, N.Y. The 2,600-student district was taken over by the State Education Department in 2002 amid mismanagement and weak student progress. Since then, slight academic gains have come at a cost of more than $200 million to the state for improvements like new buildings. In 2008, the district's continuing financial problems required an $8 million bailout.

HEADLINE: Climate Talks Yield Limited Agreement to Work Toward Replacing Kyoto Protocol

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
DURBAN, South Africa -- After 72 hours of continuous wrangling, the 17th conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change wrapped up early Sunday with modest accomplishments: the promise to work toward a new global treaty in coming years and the establishment of a new climate fund.
The deal on a future treaty renews the Kyoto Protocol, the fraying 1997 emissions agreement that sets different terms for advanced and developing countries, for several more years. But it also begins a process for replacing the Kyoto agreement with something that treats all countries -- including the economic powerhouses China, India and Brazil -- equally. 
The deal on a future treaty was the most highly contested element of a package of agreements that emerged from the extended talks among 200 nations here.
The expiration date of the protocol -- 2017 or 2020 -- and the terms of any agreement that replaces it will be negotiated at future sessions.
The delegates also agreed on the creation of a fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change -- though the precise sources of the money have yet to be determined -- and to measures involving the preservation of tropical forests and the development of clean-energy technology. The reserve, called the Green Climate Fund, would help mobilize a promised $100 billion a year in public and private financing by 2020 to assist developing countries in adapting to climate change and converting to clean energy sources.
The conclusion of the meeting was marked by exhaustion and explosions of temper, and the result was muddled and unsatisfying to many. Observers and delegates said that the actions taken at the meeting, while sufficient to keep the negotiating process alive, would not have a significant impact on climate change.
''While governments avoided disaster in Durban, they by no means responded adequately to the mounting threat of climate change,'' said Alden Meyer, director of policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''The decisions adopted here fall well short of what is needed.''
The European Union had pushed hard for what it called a ''road map'' to a legally binding treaty, against fierce resistance from China and India, whose delegates argued passionately against it. They said that mandatory cuts would slow their growth and condemn millions to poverty.
''Am I to write a blank check and sign away the livelihoods and sustainability of 1.2 billion Indians, without even knowing what the E.U. 'road map' contains?'' said India's environment minister, Jayanthi Natarajan. ''Please do not hold us hostage.'' The head of the Chinese delegation, Xie Zhenhua, accused developed countries of hypocrisy. ''What qualifies you to tell us what to do?'' he said. ''We are taking action. We want to see your action.''
The United States never ratified the Kyoto treaty because of objections to its division between developed and developing countries. Todd D. Stern, the chief American climate negotiator, said he was hopeful that talks in coming years would produce a more equitable arrangement.
Some analysts argued that the Europeans were required to compromise on their core position, accepting a vague promise of a legal treaty without assurances it would ever be ratified.
''It is difficult to avoid concluding that the Europeans ultimately blinked,'' said Michael A. Levi, a climate change and energy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
''The reality is that there is no more agreement on the future of the climate talks than there was when negotiators first convened two weeks ago,'' he said. ''Europe will continue to insist on a full-blown legally binding agreement; China and India will continue to oppose one; and the United States, while leaving the door open to an agreement that is binding for all, will continue to be unenthusiastic as well. These positions are largely rooted in incompatible views of the future, and there is no reason to believe that more talking will change them.''

HEADLINE: Getting Gas Drilling Right

 BODY:
After several crowded and often raucous hearings, Gov. Andrew Cuomo agreed to give the public until Jan. 11 to comment on 2,000 pages of environmental analysis and proposed regulations designed to govern natural gas drilling in deep shale formations in New York State. The extension makes sense. The drilling decision is a momentous one, for the environment and the economy, and it is vitally important to get it right.
The issue is not the fuel. There is little doubt in our minds that natural gas, which is cheap, plentiful and cleaner than coal, could help greatly with the country's energy and climate problems. 
The question is whether it can be safely extracted by a technique called hydraulic fracturing, which involves blasting water, sand and chemicals deep into rock formations to dislodge the gas. Done carelessly, the technique poses threats to water quality, local landscapes and the atmosphere that other states, including Pennsylvania, have failed to address adequately.
That's where the rules from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation come in. They must establish detailed safeguards for hydraulic fracturing and ensure regulatory oversight. The proposed rules have been months in the making but still need to be improved to better protect the environment and public health. Here are several concerns:
URBAN WATER SUPPLIES The rules rightly forbid drilling inside the two major unfiltered watersheds serving New York City and Syracuse. But New York City officials warn that hydrofracturing outside the watershed boundaries could set off tiny subsurface shocks, cracking the aging tunnels that bring water to the city and allowing water to leak out of the tunnels and gas to seep in. The proposed rules would limit drilling within 1,000 feet of the tunnels; some experts believe that a setback of several miles will be necessary.
HAZARDOUS WASTEWATER A federal panel found recently that the biggest risks arise from ''flowback'' -- the huge volumes of water laced with naturally occurring toxic pollutants that drilling brings to the surface along with the natural gas. In Western states, these and other wastes are sometimes safely stored underground, but this may not be possible in New York's geological formations. Sewage treatment plants are not equipped to handle these wastes, open pits are out of the question, and surface storage -- even in airtight steel tanks -- may be no more than a temporary solution. State officials concede that they don't have an answer, but until they do, not a single well should be drilled.
OVERSIGHT When fully operational in a decade, the industry could be drilling hundreds of wells a year. Two questions arise, neither addressed in the proposed regulations: First, who's going to police all this activity? The minerals division of the Department of Environmental Conservation has fewer than 20 employees. Joe Martens, the commissioner, says he wants 140 more, but even that doesn't sound like enough. Second, who's going to pay for the regulatory machinery? The obvious answer is the industry, which is growing rapidly and can easily afford permit fees or a volumetric tax on the gas or both. The state needs to ensure an adequate financing stream dedicated to monitoring and enforcement.
There are other issues that need meticulous examination. One is the danger of underground leaks of chemicals or methane gas. The Environmental Protection Agency reported on Thursday that wells in a remote valley in Wyoming may have been contaminated this way. Another issue is above-ground gas leaks that would add to global warming (methane is a potent greenhouse gas). Still another is what industry should be required to do to restore the landscape to its original condition after wells go dry.
There is no reason to hurry the rule-making or the drilling. The only way New York can safely move ahead with hydrofracturing is by designing and executing a tough regulatory program that could also serve as a model for the rest of the nation.
Online Correction: December 12, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this editorial gave the wrong date for the end of the comment period for proposed drilling regulations. It is Jan. 11, not Jan. 9.

HEADLINE: Putting a Price On Michael Kors

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
The fashion designer Michael Kors is seeking a luxury price tag on his stock. His company's initial public offering, expected this week, would value it at up to $3.6 billion. The metrics are in line with Prada, which listed earlier this year. But Michael Kors Holdings may struggle to sustain the growth needed to stay in style with investors.
Revenue for the company, which is based in Hong Kong, has been growing of late at about 60 percent, with profit roughly doubling annually. The heady trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 40, using the most recent 12 months of results and the midpoint of the indicated I.P.O. price range, drops to a more palatable 20 times future earnings, assuming similar growth continues. 
Prada, with a market value over $12 billion, is priced at roughly the same forward price-to-earnings ratio, using estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. But Prada looked expensive when it floated in June and the 5 percent slide in its shares since then does not meaningfully change that.
So consider another measure, the PEG ratio: the price-to-earnings ratio divided by expected earnings growth. Extrapolating recent supercharged expansion at Kors, the company's PEG ratio comes in at a cheap 0.3. But that is not realistic. Looked at another way, profit would need to increase on average about 40 percent for at least, say, five more years to support a PEG ratio of one, a typical proxy for fair value.
Kors may be right that there is still room for significant expansion in the United States. But familiar territory will eventually offer diminishing returns. And abroad, different customer tastes might mean lower profitability.
Just as the Italy-based Prada capitalized on Asian market interest by listing in Hong Kong, American investors may be eager to buy into an all-American, fast-growing brand. But insiders are selling, and the supermodel Heidi Klum, host of ''Project Runway,'' has some advice that might suit investors in Michael Kors, whose namesake is a judge on the show. Each week she reminds competing designers that ''in fashion, one day you're in, and the next day you're out.''
The I.P.O. filing cites research that the global luxury goods market will expand at 7 percent a year through 2014. If the company's growth slackens to anything approaching that mundane level, investors might relegate Kors shares to the discount bin.
A Broader Warning
Two companies projecting fourth-quarter earnings could be signaling economic worries. DuPont and Texas Instruments said last week that their results would be weaker than they previously thought. Earnings at American multinational companies have been surprisingly robust up to now, but these bellwethers suggest that may be changing.
Chemicals and computer chips are two necessities for other industries around the world. When business slackens for the likes of DuPont and T.I., it can be a sign of things to come for others. If manufacturers think fewer automobiles, computers or televisions will be sold in the coming months, they will cut orders for supplies today.
That said, rather than pointing to a drop in end-user demand, both companies pinned much of the blame for their shortfalls on conservative manufacturers wanting to hold onto as much cash as possible. Cutting inventories to the bone achieves this. It is not sustainable over the long run, but it helps companies keep the lights on should financial markets seize up or demand plunge. While both companies said the slowdown occurred globally, it is telling that the biggest hit was in Europe.
The two profit warnings could be false signals of an economic slowdown. If consumers keep buying cars, toys and televisions, supply chains will have to be restocked. The same could happen if continuing concerns about the stability and liquidity of the financial system abate.
Yet financial imbalances have been building for years, so they are unlikely to be resolved overnight. And when corporate treasurers are worried about their cash positions, they are not making big investments or hiring. Even if the alerts from DuPont and T.I. are a result of inventory reductions rather than falling demand, they suggest a trend that could feed on itself and hit other companies' profits.
For the third quarter, earnings in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed almost 18 percent year-on-year growth, Standard & Poor's says. For the fourth quarter, though, more than twice as many companies have indicated earnings will be below expectations than above. Estimates of yearly earnings growth for the quarter, meanwhile, have been declining and now stand below 10 percent. If DuPont and T.I. are any indication, that downward trend has further to go.

HEADLINE: Depression And Democracy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It's time to start calling the current situation what it is: a depression. True, it's not a full replay of the Great Depression, but that's cold comfort. Unemployment in both America and Europe remains disastrously high. Leaders and institutions are increasingly discredited. And democratic values are under siege.
On that last point, I am not being alarmist. On the political as on the economic front it's important not to fall into the ''not as bad as'' trap. High unemployment isn't O.K. just because it hasn't hit 1933 levels; ominous political trends shouldn't be dismissed just because there's no Hitler in sight. 
Let's talk, in particular, about what's happening in Europe -- not because all is well with America, but because the gravity of European political developments isn't widely understood.
First of all, the crisis of the euro is killing the European dream. The shared currency, which was supposed to bind nations together, has instead created an atmosphere of bitter acrimony.
Specifically, demands for ever-harsher austerity, with no offsetting effort to foster growth, have done double damage. They have failed as economic policy, worsening unemployment without restoring confidence; a Europe-wide recession now looks likely even if the immediate threat of financial crisis is contained. And they have created immense anger, with many Europeans furious at what is perceived, fairly or unfairly (or actually a bit of both), as a heavy-handed exercise of German power.
Nobody familiar with Europe's history can look at this resurgence of hostility without feeling a shiver. Yet there may be worse things happening.
Right-wing populists are on the rise from Austria, where the Freedom Party (whose leader used to have neo-Nazi connections) runs neck-and-neck in the polls with established parties, to Finland, where the anti-immigrant True Finns party had a strong electoral showing last April. And these are rich countries whose economies have held up fairly well. Matters look even more ominous in the poorer nations of Central and Eastern Europe.
Last month the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development documented a sharp drop in public support for democracy in the ''new E.U.'' countries, the nations that joined the European Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Not surprisingly, the loss of faith in democracy has been greatest in the countries that suffered the deepest economic slumps.
And in at least one nation, Hungary, democratic institutions are being undermined as we speak.
One of Hungary's major parties, Jobbik, is a nightmare out of the 1930s: it's anti-Roma (Gypsy), it's anti-Semitic, and it even had a paramilitary arm. But the immediate threat comes from Fidesz, the governing center-right party.
Fidesz won an overwhelming Parliamentary majority last year, at least partly for economic reasons; Hungary isn't on the euro, but it suffered severely because of large-scale borrowing in foreign currencies and also, to be frank, thanks to mismanagement and corruption on the part of the then-governing left-liberal parties. Now Fidesz, which rammed through a new Constitution last spring on a party-line vote, seems bent on establishing a permanent hold on power.
The details are complex. Kim Lane Scheppele, who is the director of Princeton's Law and Public Affairs program -- and has been following the Hungarian situation closely -- tells me that Fidesz is relying on overlapping measures to suppress opposition. A proposed election law creates gerrymandered districts designed to make it almost impossible for other parties to form a government; judicial independence has been compromised, and the courts packed with party loyalists; state-run media have been converted into party organs, and there's a crackdown on independent media; and a proposed constitutional addendum would effectively criminalize the leading leftist party.
Taken together, all this amounts to the re-establishment of authoritarian rule, under a paper-thin veneer of democracy, in the heart of Europe. And it's a sample of what may happen much more widely if this depression continues.
It's not clear what can be done about Hungary's authoritarian slide. The U.S. State Department, to its credit, has been very much on the case, but this is essentially a European matter. The European Union missed the chance to head off the power grab at the start -- in part because the new Constitution was rammed through while Hungary held the Union's rotating presidency. It will be much harder to reverse the slide now. Yet Europe's leaders had better try, or risk losing everything they stand for.
And they also need to rethink their failing economic policies. If they don't, there will be more backsliding on democracy -- and the breakup of the euro may be the least of their worries.

HEADLINE: Military Children Stay a Step Ahead of Public School Students

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. -- The results are now public from the 2011 federal testing program known as NAEP, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. And once again, schools on the nation's military bases have outperformed public schools on both reading and math tests for fourth and eighth graders.
At the military base schools, 39 percent of fourth graders were scored as proficient in reading, compared with 32 percent of all public school students.
Even more impressive, the achievement gap between black and white students continues to be much smaller at military base schools and is shrinking faster than at public schools. 
On the NAEP reading test, black fourth graders in public schools scored an average of 205 out of 500, compared with a 231 score for white public school students, a 26-point gap. Black fourth graders at the military base schools averaged 222 in reading, compared with 233 for whites, an 11-point gap.
In fact, the black fourth graders at the military base schools scored better in reading than public school students as a whole, whose average score was 221.
How to explain the difference?
It has become fashionable for American educators to fly off to Helsinki to investigate how schools there produce such high-achieving Finns. But for just $69.95 a night, they can stay at the Days Inn in Jacksonville, N.C., and investigate how the schools here on the Camp Lejeune Marine base produce such high-achieving Americans -- both black and white.
They would find that the schools on base are not subject to former President George W. Bush's signature education program, No Child Left Behind, or to President Obama's Race to the Top. They would find that standardized tests do not dominate and are not used to rate teachers, principals or schools.
They would find Leigh Anne Kapiko, the principal at Tarawa Terrace Elementary, one of seven schools here.
Test preparation? ''No,'' Ms. Kapiko said. ''That's not done in Department of Defense schools. We don't even have test prep materials.''
At schools here, standardized tests are used as originally intended, to identify a child's academic weaknesses and assess the effectiveness of the curriculum.
Ms. Kapiko has been a principal both inside and outside the gates and believes that military base schools are more nurturing than public schools. ''We don't have to be so regimented, since we're not worried about a child's ability to bubble on a test,'' she said.
Military children are not put through test prep drills. ''For us,'' Ms. Kapiko said, ''children are children; they're not little Marines.''
Under Mr. Obama's education agenda, state governments can now dictate to principals how to run their schools. In Tennessee -- which is ranked 41st in NAEP scores and has made no significant progress in closing the black-white achievement gap on those tests in 20 years -- the state now requires four formal observations a year for all teachers, regardless of whether the principal thinks they are excellent or weak. The state has declared that half of a teacher's rating must be based on student test scores.
Ms. Kapiko, on the other hand, has discretion in how to evaluate her teachers. For the most effective, she does one observation a year. That gives her and her assistant principal time for walk-through visits in every classroom every day.
''We don't micromanage,'' said Marilee Fitzgerald, director of the Department of Defense Education Activity, the agency that supervises the military base schools and their 87,000 students. ''Individual schools decide what to focus on.''
The average class in New York City in kindergarten through the third grade has 24 students. At military base schools, the average is 18, which is almost as good as it is in the private schools where leaders of the education reform movement -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York; the former education chancellor in New York City, Joel I. Klein; and Bill Gates of Microsoft -- have sent their children.
A 2001 study on the success of the military base schools by researchers at Vanderbilt University cites the importance of the smooth relations between the teachers' union and management, and Ms. Fitzgerald said that continued to be true.
Helping children succeed academically is about a lot more than what goes on inside the schools. Military parents do not have to worry about securing health care coverage for their children or adequate housing. At least one parent in the family has a job.
The military command also puts a priority on education. Bryant Anderson, a petty officer who is stationed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va., is given time off from work to serve as president of the base's school board and coach middle school basketball and track teams.
Parents with children at the civilian schools where Ms. Kapiko has been the principal have not received that kind of support from their employers. ''If Dad works in a factory, he gets three absences and he's fired,'' she said.
A family's economic well-being has considerable impact on how students score on standardized tests, and it is hard to make exact comparisons between military and public school families. But by one indicator, families at military base schools and public schools have similar earnings: the percentage of students who qualify for federally subsidized lunches is virtually identical at both, about 46 percent.
What is clear is that the base schools have made impressive progress in narrowing the achievement gap.
In the last decade, the gap in reading between black and white fourth graders at base schools has decreased to 11 points this year (233 compared with 222), down from a 16-point difference in 2003 (230 compared with 214), a 31 percent reduction. In public schools, there has been a much smaller decrease, to a 26-point gap this year (231 compared with 205) from 30 points in 2002 (227 compared with 197), a 13 percent reduction.
The military has a far better record of integration than most institutions. Almost all of the 69 base schools are in the South. They were opened in the 1950s and '60s because the military was racially integrated and did not want the children of black soldiers to attend racially segregated schools off base.
Nevin Joplin, a sergeant in the Air Force, has a son in the sixth grade at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Sergeant Joplin, who is black and a single father, said both he and his son, Quinn, had been given ample opportunities to succeed. Quinn has been placed in a gifted program, and Sergeant Joplin said he had been treated fairly in the military promotion system. ''My records go to the board, my name is blacked out, anything that would identify me is blacked out; they only see what I've done and decide on the merits,'' he said.
Capt. Derrick Bennett Jr. of the Army is also black and has a 7-year-old son attending school at Fort Benning, Ga. He says race rarely, if ever, comes into play on the post. But when he visits family in Birmingham, it is not the same. There is still a tendency in Alabama to look at a black man differently, he said.

HEADLINE: Fed to Weigh Publishing A Forecast On Rates

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's decision three years ago to reduce short-term interest rates to nearly zero made a splash, both because the Fed had never pushed rates so low and because it said that it planned to keep rates near zero ''for some time.''
Predicting its own future actions was a new step, an experiment in a time of crisis that the Fed has since repeated several times, most recently in August, when it said that it planned to keep interest rates near zero until at least the summer of 2013.
Now the technique looks increasingly likely to become a permanent method for influencing economic growth. When the Fed's policy-making committee convenes on Tuesday, it will consider the idea of publishing a regular forecast of its future decisions on interest rates. Any such plan would most likely be announced no sooner than its next meeting, in January, when it is already scheduled to publish economic projections. 
Forecasting policy is part of a broader set of changes that the Fed is considering to improve public understanding of its methods and goals. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other officials say that improved communications could deliver a modest boost to the economy with relatively little risk. None of their other options for additional action are nearly so appealing.
''We are actively considering methods that we could use to provide greater clarity,'' Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, said after a recent speech in San Francisco. ''Is it a game-changer? I feel that it could have some favorable impact. I don't want to exaggerate how large that is.''
The meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee on Tuesday comes at a moment of unusual uncertainty about the plans of other economic policy makers.
Congress is debating the extension of a payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits, which some forecasters estimate could lift economic growth next year by more than one percentage point. Europe is convulsing, and Mr. Bernanke is among the economists who have warned that the United States could slip back into recession if the euro collapsed.
Recent federal data suggest that the United States economy is improving somewhat, reducing the pressure on the Fed to expand its aid programs. Even though unemployment remains at a level that Fed officials regard as unacceptable, most analysts who follow the central bank say they do not expect major changes in policy at this meeting.
Another round of asset purchases remains a possibility -- including a specific investment in mortgage-backed securities -- but officials are concerned that the benefits diminish with each new round, while the risks, both economic and political, have increased.
Monetary economists had long agreed that central banks should avoid making predictions or commitments. They worried that deviations from the predicted path would create costly turbulence in financial markets as investors corrected their misconceptions.
In recent years, however, more policy makers have concluded that the power to shape expectations should be embraced. Some central banks have come to regard speaking about the future as a primary policy tool. For example, the central banks of Britain, Canada and Australia, among others, have adopted explicit goals for inflation and the rate of increase in prices and wages. The central banks of Sweden and Norway publish forecasts of the level of interest rates. New Zealand announces goals and forecasts.
Mr. Bernanke is a longtime advocate of setting an inflation objective. But Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate to manage inflation and unemployment, and past proposals to formalize an inflation goal have foundered on the question of how to communicate an equal concern about the health of the labor market. This remains the subject of lively debate within the Fed.
Predicting the future is less controversial. The minutes of the committee's most recent meeting, in November, said that ''participants generally expressed interest in providing additional information to the public about the likely future path of the target federal funds rate.''
Such a forecast likely would cover the expected path of policy over the next three years, including information about the range of predictions. The Fed already publishes similar predictions about economic growth, inflation and unemployment four times a year.
Introducing a forecast in the near future could reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers if it shows that the committee expects rates to remain near zero beyond mid-2013. Investors demand compensation for long-term investments based in large part on their expectations about the future level of short-term rates.
Even some members of the committee who oppose additional stimulus, however, want to start publishing the forecast. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, who has voted repeatedly against expansion of the Fed's aid programs, said he favored the proposal irrespective of whether the immediate effect was to stimulate the economy.
''I think what we want to do is to communicate to the public as clearly as we can,'' Mr. Plosser said in a recent interview. ''I'm not doing this to manipulate policy. I'm doing this to be as transparent about policy as possible.''
Some analysts, however, warn that increased clarity could have negative consequences.
''My concern is that the Fed might place itself in a self-induced bind'' if it predicts a policy path that later seems unwise, said Dana Saporta, a United States economist at Credit Suisse. ''They would feel some pressure to stick to the implicit promise in the forward guidance, lest they incur the wrath of the markets and Congress.''
Ms. Saporta also noted that the 2007 decision to publish economic projections had focused some unflattering attention on the Fed's inability to predict the future.
''We have this public loss of innocence, in a sense,'' she said. ''The more clear the Fed becomes, the more we realize that the central bank does not have all the answers.''
The Fed decided against publishing policy forecasts in 2007, citing concerns about the public misunderstanding the predictions as commitments.
''Over time, market participants might learn how little weight they should give any published average of 'appropriate' policies,'' Donald L. Kohn, then the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech explaining the decision. ''But the learning process could take time and be costly, and we would not be assured of a successful outcome.''
Mr. Kohn, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a policy research group in Washington, said that remained a concern. But he also noted a new reason to reconsider. Having reduced rates to almost zero, the Fed has limited its ability to control expectations by adjusting rates. And he said that he believed transparency tended to enhance the central bank's credibility.
''Ultimately the credibility of the forecast doesn't derive from whether it's a point wrong one year or another,'' he said. ''It derives from whether, over the long run, they basically see the emerging trends correctly'' -- and on the quality of the methodology.

HEADLINE: A Romance With Risk That Brought On a Panic

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED, BEN PROTESS and SUSANNE CRAIG; Kevin Roose and Lisa Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Soon after taking the reins of MF Global in 2010, Jon S. Corzine visited the Wall Street firm's Chicago offices for the first time, greeting the brokers, analysts and sales staff there.
One broker, Cy Monley, caught Mr. Corzine's eye. Unknown to MF Global's top management in New York, the employee, whose job was to match buyers and sellers in energy derivatives, was also trading a small account on the side, using the firm's capital.
''How are you making money on side bets? What else are you guys doing to make money here?'' Mr. Corzine asked enthusiastically, his eyes widening, the broker recalled. The new chief executive grabbed a seat and spent an hour questioning Mr. Monley as other top executives from New York hovered impatiently nearby.
Although Mr. Corzine had been a United States senator, governor of New Jersey, co-head of Goldman Sachs and a confidant of leaders in Washington and Wall Street, he was at heart a trader, willing to gamble for a rich payoff. 
Dozens of interviews reveal that Mr. Corzine played a much larger, hands-on role in the firm's high-stakes risk-taking than has previously been known.
An examination of company documents and interviews with regulators, former employees and others close to MF Global portray a chief executive convinced that he could quickly turn the money-losing firm into a miniature Goldman Sachs.
He pushed through a $6.3 billion bet on European debt - a wager big enough to wipe out the firm five times over if it went bad - despite concerns from other executives and board members. And it is now clear that he personally lobbied regulators and auditors about the strategy.
His obsession with trading was apparent to MF Global insiders over his 19-month tenure. Mr. Corzine compulsively traded for the firm on his BlackBerry during meetings, sometimes dashing out to check on the markets. And unusually for a chief executive, he became a core member of the group that traded using the firm's money. His profits and losses appeared on a separate line in documents with his initials: JSC.
Yet few appeared willing to check Mr. Corzine's trading ambitions.
The review of his tenure also sheds new light on the lack of controls at the firm and the failure of its watchdogs to curb outsize risk-taking. The board, according to former employees, signed off on the European bet multiple times. And for the first time it is now clear that ratings agencies knew the risks for months but, as they did with subprime mortgages, looked the other way until it was too late, underscoring how three years after the financial crisis, little has changed on Wall Street.
MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31. As the firm spun out of control, it improperly transferred some customer money on Oct. 21 - days sooner than previously thought, said people briefed on the matter. And investigators are now examining whether MF Global was getting away with such illicit transfers as early as August, one person said, a revelation that would point to wrongdoing even before the firm was struggling to survive.
The consequences of the firm's collapse have been severe: Some $1 billion in customer money remains missing and thousands of clients, including small farmers in Kansas or hedge funds in Connecticut, still do not have nearly a third of their funds.
Some of that money may never be recovered if, as some regulators now fear, MF Global used it to cover trading losses and replenish overdrawn bank accounts.
The bet on European sovereign debt is not thought to be directly connected to the missing money. But the fears about the firm's exposure to Europe tipped an anxious market, causing a run on MF Global that regulators suspect led the firm to fight for its life using customer money.
Mr. Corzine has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment for this article.
While Mr. Corzine apologized for the firm's collapse when he appeared before the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday, he has continued to defend the European trade, calling it ''prudent'' at the time.
The European trade was initiated by Mr. Corzine late in the summer of 2010. The new chief executive explained the bet to a small group of top traders, arguing that Europe would not let its brethren default. In just a few months, the trade swelled to $6.3 billion, from $1.5 billion.
Europe's debt crisis, meanwhile, continued to flare, raising questions about whether some of the Continent's bigger economies, Spain and Italy, might be ensnared in the maelstrom.
In August, some directors questioned the chief executive, asking him to reduce the size of the position. Mr. Corzine calmly assured them they had little to fear.
''If you want a smaller or different position, maybe you don't have the right guy here,'' he told them, according to a person familiar with the matter. He also told one senior board member that he would ''be willing to step down'' if they ''had lost confidence in me,'' Mr. Corzine told Congress on Thursday, although he said he had not intended to make a threat.
The board relented.
A Curious Career Move
Few would have guessed that Mr. Corzine, having led Goldman Sachs before serving in the Senate and as a governor of New Jersey, would wind up the chief executive of a little-known brokerage house.
At Goldman, which he joined in 1975, the young bond trader quickly gained a reputation as someone able to take big risks and generate big profits. Even after ascending to the top of the firm, he kept his own trading account to make bets with the firm's capital. In 1999, Mr. Corzine was ousted from Goldman amid a power struggle.
By 2010, having suffered a stinging defeat in his bid for re-election as the Democratic governor of New Jersey, Mr. Corzine hoped to resume his career on Wall Street.
A friend, J. Christopher Flowers, one of MF Global's largest investors, helped him get there. Mr. Corzine and Mr. Flowers worked at Goldman decades ago, and at one point, Mr. Flowers helped manage Mr. Corzine's vast wealth while he was a senator, according to Congressional records.
Mr. Corzine's arrival was a coup. MF Global had hired an executive search firm, Westwood Partners, to hunt for a new leader. But some members of the board, including David I. Schamis, who worked for Mr. Flowers, were recruiting Mr. Corzine.
He was a popular manager, former employees say. An avuncular presence with a beard and sweater vest, he had a knack for remembering names. Even in the firm's final hours, they recall that Mr. Corzine never lost his temper. His work ethic also impressed colleagues. He often started his day with a five-mile run, landing in the office by 6 a.m. and was regularly the last person to leave the office.
His intense routine was on par with his ambitions for the firm. With 15 top executives in the firm's boardroom on his first day, March 23, 2010, he said, ''I think this firm has tremendous potential and I can't wait to get started,'' one person who attended said.
Mr. Corzine faced a steep challenge.
For years, MF Global aligned buyers and sellers of futures contracts for commodities like wheat or metals, and took a small commission along the way. But over the last decade, that business had become endangered. By the time Mr. Corzine arrived, near zero-percent interest rates and paper-thin commissions had led to five consecutive quarters of losses.
Soon after taking the helm, Mr. Corzine oversaw a wave of job cuts and overhauled compensation, moving from steady commissions to salary and discretionary bonuses like the rest of Wall Street.
At the same time, Mr. Corzine filled the ranks with employees from Goldman Sachs and hedge funds like the Soros Fund Management. He recruited Bradley Abelow, a fellow Goldman alumnus and a top aide when he was governor, to be chief operating officer.
Mr. Corzine arrived just as Washington was pressing the big banks to curb their lucrative yet risky businesses. Spotting an opening, he fashioned new trading desks, including one just for mortgage securities and a separate unit to trade using the firm's own capital, a business known as proprietary trading.
Not to be outdone, Mr. Corzine was the most profitable trader in that team, known as the Principal Strategies Group, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Corzine traded oil, Treasury securities and currencies and earned in excess of $10 million for the firm in 2011, the person said.
Some inside MF Global worried that the expansion of the profitable trading business in New York came at the expense of its futures clearing operation, which was centered in Chicago. To drum up sales, Chicago brokers were pushed to introduce longtime clients to their counterparts in New York, a move that raised tensions.
At times, Mr. Corzine seemed unfamiliar with some aspects of the futures division. In June, speaking at the Sandler O'Neill Financial Services Conference at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Corzine stumbled. ''Right now, if you thought about MF Global's retail business, you probably could only think of - ,'' he said, then paused to recall the name of the division at MF Global that catered to individual investors.
He leaned over to an aide, who told him it was Lind-Waldock.
'Chief Risk Officer'
''I consider one of my most important jobs to be chief risk officer of our firm,'' Mr. Corzine told that conference.
Yet soon after joining MF Global, Mr. Corzine torpedoed an effort to build a new risk system, a much-needed overhaul, according to former employees. (A person familiar with Mr. Corzine's thinking said that he saw the need to upgrade, but that the system being proposed was ''unduly expensive'' and was focused in part on things the firm didn't trade.)
While risk at the firm had been sharply increased with the bet on European sovereign debt, there was a compelling argument for Mr. Corzine's strategy.
MF Global had obtained loans to buy debt of Italy, Ireland and other troubled European nations, while simultaneously pledging the bonds as collateral to support the loans. The loans would come due when the bonds matured, which would happen no later than the end of 2012. MF Global, Mr. Corzine reckoned, would profit on the spread between the interest paid on the loans and the coupons earned from the bonds.
But the size of the European position was making the firm's top risk officers, Michael Roseman and Talha Chaudhry, increasingly uncomfortable by late 2010, according to people familiar with the situation. They pushed Mr. Corzine to seek approval from the board if he wanted to expand it.
Mr. Roseman then gave a PowerPoint presentation for board members, explaining the sovereign debt trade as Mr. Corzine sat a few feet away. The presentation made clear the risks, which hinged on the nations not defaulting or the bonds losing so much value they caused a cash squeeze. The directors approved the increase. Mr. Roseman eventually left the firm.
Within MF Global, Mr. Corzine welcomed discussion about his bet and his reasons for it, though some senior managers said they feared confronting such a prominent figure. Those who did challenge him recall making little progress. One senior trader said that each time he addressed his concerns, the chief executive would nod with understanding but do nothing.
These concerns were only internal at first because, while MF Global had disclosed the existence of the transactions in at least one filing in 2010, it never mentioned the extent to which they were used to finance the purchase of European debt.
The firm bought its European sovereign bonds making use of an arcane transaction known as repurchase-to-maturity. Repo-to-maturity allowed the company to classify the purchase of the bonds as a sale, rather than a risky bet subject to the whims of the market. That called to mind an earlier era of trading when firms used repo-to-maturity to finance the purchase of risk-free assets like United States Treasury securities, Mr. Corzine's specialty at Goldman many years earlier.
''It's like a bond trader from 15 years ago went to sleep and suddenly awoke to make these trades,'' one regulator who later reviewed the transactions remarked to a colleague.
Eventually, MF Global's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked Mr. Corzine to report the European debt exposure to his investors. He personally met with the accounting firm in December 2010, two people said, and it was agreed that the transactions would be mentioned in a footnote in the firm's annual report, which was filed on May 20, 2011.
Earlier, one of MF Global's many regulators noticed something curious. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which helped watch over MF Global's securities business, noticed a sharp swing in profits in a monthly report the firm filed to regulators. Finra asked MF Global executives about the volatile accounting line but did not get a satisfactory answer, say people familiar with the matter, until the annual report came out weeks later.
When Finra realized what MF Global was doing, it grew concerned. The Wall Street self-regulator told MF Global to set aside enough money in case the trades went bad. But Finra didn't have the authority to force the firm to do so - that power was in the hands of the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose rule Finra was citing.
Mr. Corzine then personally took the firm's case to the S.E.C. in mid-August, taking the Delta Shuttle to Washington for a meeting with a top agency official.
The S.E.C. indicated it would side with Finra, but needed a few weeks to make a final determination. In the meantime, MF Global and Finra haggled over the size of the capital cushion: the regulator wanted $200 million set aside, while the firm pushed for a figure closer to $50 million. In late August, Finra won out.
It would be the beginning of the end for MF Global.
The Unwinding
MF Global's investors may not have been fully informed about the European bet, but the firm's executives had been explaining the strategy to the ratings agencies for months, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conservations. Indeed, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's had applauded Mr. Corzine's effort to overhaul the firm, a move that included ratcheting up risk.
''We consider the most recent strategic plan of the new C.E.O. Jon Corzine to be sound,'' S.& P. said in 2010, while acknowledging the plan ''will incrementally increase the firm's risk profile.''
But the move by Finra to force the extra capital cushion appeared to only unnerve the ratings agencies when news reports about it emerged in October. A week later, Moody's cut its rating on MF Global to a notch above junk, pointing to the European debt holdings.
The reversal angered some executives at MF Global, who felt it was disingenuous for the agency to change its mind so suddenly. A spokesman for the ratings agency said, ''Moody's does not refrain from taking rating action when its opinion on the credit risk of an issuer has changed.''
The downgrade sent MF Global into free fall on Oct. 25. Its stock price plunged and trading partners and lenders demanded more capital to continue doing business with the company. At day's end, rattled employees dialed into a conference call with Mr. Corzine, who tried to be encouraging.
''The sun will come out tomorrow,'' he told them, according to one employee.
In truth, the company had just two options: sell itself or unload assets. Mr. Corzine organized two teams. Mr. Abelow, his deputy, began hunting for a buyer and decamped to the 40th floor of the firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters. On the 39th floor, where his office was next to the trading floor, Mr. Corzine took charge of selling the assets.
On Friday evening, Oct. 28, regulators and top executives trooped into Mr. Corzine's office, joining a phone conference with Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C. Pictures of Mr. Corzine with Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton sat on shelves near his desk. Towering stacks of paper lined the walls and windowsills of his modest office, partly obscuring the window view.
Dressed in his trademark sweater vest, Mr. Corzine expressed confidence a deal would be reached with one of the potential buyers, which included Interactive Brokers, JPMorgan Chase, the Jefferies Group and the Macquarie Group, according to people briefed on the call.
A deal became crucial as trading partners and lenders circled the firm. LCH.Clearnet, the firm responsible for clearing the vast majority of MF Global's European sovereign debt trades, was also demanding $200 million to maintain the positions, atop $100 million it had claimed from MF Global earlier in the week, one person briefed on the situation said.
Other people close to the investigation, led by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement division, have said that as the firm rushed to pay off creditors, MF Global dipped again and again into customer funds to meet the demands.
The bidders dropped out one by one, leaving just Interactive Brokers on Sunday, Oct. 30. Mr. Corzine and his team briefed regulators at 2 p.m. saying a sale looked likely to go through. About nine hours later, he got word that more than $950 million in customer funds was missing, making a merger impossible. The day after the bankruptcy, Mr. Corzine sifted through transactions in the hope of locating the missing money, one person said.
Ultimately, the bets Corzine placed wound up better than the firm itself. The European debt trades were profitable, though too late for MF Global.
Before Congress on Thursday, Mr. Corzine continued to emphasize how well his trades held up. ''As of today, none of the foreign debt securities that MF Global used,'' he said, ''has defaulted or been restructured.''
''There actually were no losses.''

HEADLINE: Hefty Price Tag Is Hindering Congress in Its Struggle to Pass Year-End Legislation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The costs of last-minute items pending before Congress are formidable, and lawmakers say that is a major reason they have had so much difficulty reaching a year-end agreement on payroll taxes and other issues.
Politics and ideology play a big role in the debate, but the sheer cost of the items -- which could easily top $350 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office -- is also a factor. 
No agreement between the House and the Senate is in sight. President Obama and Senate Democratic leaders say Congress must not leave town for the holidays unless it extends unemployment benefits and prevents a tax increase for the middle class by extending a payroll tax break that expires Dec. 31.
An employee's share of the payroll tax, now 4.2 percent of wages, is scheduled to rise to 6.2 percent in January, adding $1,000 to the taxes paid by a typical working family with income of $50,000. Keeping the tax rate at its current level for another year would cost the government $120 billion, the budget office says.
To put more money in consumers' pockets and revive the economy, Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats want to lower the payroll tax rate further, to 3.1 percent, through 2012. Setting the rate at that level, rather than 6.2 percent, would cost at least $180 billion, the budget office says.
Leaders from both parties and both chambers of Congress want to extend the payroll tax cut. Many lawmakers also want to extend jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, who will begin to lose assistance early next year unless Congress acts. The cost would range from $34 billion to $55 billion or more, depending on specifics of the legislation.
Democrats see an urgent need for extending the benefits. The average duration of unemployment, now 40.9 weeks, is the longest in more than 60 years, the Labor Department says.
On a separate track, House and Senate negotiators have nearly finished work on an omnibus spending bill to finance most of the government through the remainder of the current fiscal year, which began in October. A stopgap spending bill, adopted last month, runs through Friday.
In addition, Congress is facing a deadline for action on Medicare. Unless lawmakers step in, doctors treating Medicare patients will see a 27 percent cut in reimbursements in January.
House Republicans would block the cut and replace it with increases of 1 percent a year in 2012 and 2013. That would cost $39 billion, the budget office estimates. The cost of a 10-year fix, $300 billion or more, is so high that Congress is not seriously considering it.
A statutory formula sets annual goals for Medicare spending on doctors' services. When actual spending exceeds the goals, payments to doctors are supposed to be reduced. If Congress intervenes to block a cut -- as it often does -- Medicare is supposed to recoup the money by making deeper cuts in future years.
Medicare payments to doctors have a direct impact on beneficiaries. AARP and other advocates for older Americans say they fear that some beneficiaries would lose access to their doctors and that fewer doctors would see Medicare patients if payments were reduced.
Congress also hopes to grant a reprieve to millions of middle-income Americans facing the alternative minimum tax, originally aimed at high earners. The cost of providing such tax relief for a year could be more than $135 billion, the budget office has said. Without a change in the law, more than 30 million Americans could be hit by the tax in 2012, up from fewer than 5 million taxpayers this year.
A fierce fight has broken out in Congress over how to pay for these big-ticket items and whether to use the savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, known as overseas contingency operations, or OCO.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, refers to Uncle OCO -- a rich uncle who may hold the key to breaking the deadlock in Congress over taxes and spending. ''OCO is the perfect place to go'' for money needed to deal with the payroll tax cut and Medicare payments to doctors, Ms. Pelosi said.
Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, said that war savings could be used ''not just for the payroll tax extension but for unemployment insurance as well,'' and for doctors' payments under Medicare.
Many Republicans say this would amount to an accounting gimmick, because it claims to save money that was never going to be spent.
''Only in Washington can you increase spending and call it a cut,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. ''This is the kind of fraudulent accounting that has caused Americans to lose faith in Washington.''
Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he was so concerned about cuts in Medicare payments to doctors that he was willing to use war cost savings to wipe out the debt that Congress has accumulated by repeatedly overriding scheduled reductions in payments for doctors' services.
''What I'm proposing is using one budgetary gimmick to pay for another -- specifically, using funds budgeted for the wars and wiping clean the bad debt accumulated'' under the Medicare formula, Mr. Kyl said. Congress can then devise a new system to pay doctors, and any increases in fees should be ''fully offset with real savings,'' he said.
Money for the wars is not sitting idle in a Treasury account that can be tapped for other purposes. The anticipated savings reflect the difference between what the Pentagon will actually spend and projections made by the Congressional Budget Office. The projections were based on an assumption that war spending would continue at the current level, $159 billion in 2011, and total $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years, with an allowance for inflation.
Critics, including Speaker John A. Boehner, say those savings are phony because no one expects the wars to go on for a decade.
''I have made it pretty clear that those savings that are coming to us as a result of the wind-down of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan should be banked, should not be used to offset other spending,'' Mr. Boehner said.

HEADLINE: The Good Newt

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Immigration is a subject that brings out the best and the worst in Americans.
As taught to my fourth-grade daughter this semester, the story of the peopling of America encourages us to celebrate our identity as the land of e pluribus unum. It reminds us of the tolerance required to coexist in a culture of many cultures. It honors the courage to uproot your life so your children can have a better one.
As it is practiced in our politics, the subject often dredges up darker feelings: tribalism, xenophobia, envy, a pull-up-the-ladder stinginess. This is not new. The English and Dutch colonists resented the immigrant waves of Irish and Germans, who resented the later waves of Italians and Poles and Jews. Polls show that Americans only halfheartedly support immigration, and less than halfheartedly in hard times.
Nowhere is our national ambivalence on this issue more grotesquely displayed than in the current Republican campaign. Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich each, in turn, tripped over the issue -- Perry by letting illegals in Texas pay lower, in-state college tuition; Romney for failing to fire a lawn care service that employed undocumented workers; and Gingrich for saying that not every family lacking legal status should be put in a boxcar and shipped to Mexico. 
To make rhetorical amends for these errors of compassion, each candidate has tapped his inner demagogue. Perry went barnstorming with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the Arizona bully famous for his primitive and crowd-pleasing immigrant roundups. Both Gingrich and Romney talk about fortifying the border as if we were under siege and use the word ''amnesty'' in the same tone of voice most people use for ''Al Qaeda.''
It's a tricky act. The candidates are trying to compete for the votes of the electrified-fence crowd without completely alienating Latino voters or important business constituents -- in construction, agriculture, meatpacking, hospitality -- who hunger for cheap, dependable labor. Thus the campaign has generated more obfuscation than lucid argument. The classic is Mitt Romney's painfully evasive interview with Bret Baier of Fox News, in which Romney accused Gingrich of favoring ''amnesty'' but couldn't explain where their positions really differed.
But wait. Why are we even talking about this? I hate to distract you with actual facts, but here are a few that have been overlooked in the din of alarm: illegal immigration is falling, sharply, a result of tougher enforcement in the decade since the 9/11 attacks and an anemic American job market. Border policing is at an all-time high. Deportations are way up under Obama. The estimated population of illegal residents has fallen by about one million from its peak of 12 million in 2007.
More facts: The most scrupulous study I've seen of the economic impact of illegal immigration -- by Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California, San Diego -- weighed the costs to society (schools, health care, etc.) against the benefits (tax revenues, labor productivity, etc.) and concluded that the difference was ''close enough to zero to be essentially a wash.'' The idea that illegal immigrants are dragging down the economy is just wrong.
Now, what is true for the nation as a whole is not equally true of every community or every class. The impact of illegal labor on native employment may be marginal, but it hits hardest at the bottom, displacing those with a high school education or less, who are already the victims of recession and diminishing wages. This is a fearful and energized portion of the electorate. As Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, points out, ''If it's your job, a marginal effect is a big one.''
The impact is felt more intensely in states -- Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, Nevada, Iowa and others -- where the arrival of Hispanic immigrants is relatively new. Rick Perry's comparatively sympathetic view of illegals is the bipartisan norm in a state like Texas that has long absorbed Mexicans. But it does not play so well in Iowa, which has only recently seen classrooms filling with brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking children. These tend to be the states passing punitive laws to deputize traffic cops, E.R. nurses and utility workers as immigration enforcers. Wanting to enforce the law, or protect your job, does not make you a bigot. But these laws tend to be self-defeating. They drive illegals deeper underground, lock them into an underclass, pit states against Washington and each other, and sunder communities.
Therein lies the real crisis -- not that the country is being overrun, but that the country is at war with itself.
Comprehensive immigration reform used to be a bipartisan issue that drew prominent Republicans like George W. Bush and John McCain and Orrin Hatch, but in our toxic hyperpartisan political climate Republicans have simply fled. ''The left and right both politicized it,'' said Tamar Jacoby, president of the small-business federation ImmigrationWorks USA, and a Republican. ''Now the sense is that the Democrats own it, so no Republican can touch it.''
That is why it matters so much that Gingrich has staked a serious claim.
Rather than parse his debate sound bites, go to Newt.org and read his proposed solutions. You have to get past a certain amount of red-meat rhetoric and brush aside some half-baked notions that are typical Newt, more smart-alecky than smart. (His plan for local citizen boards to pass judgment on which immigrants get deported sounds to me like the Neighborhood Watch from hell.) But you will find that on major points Gingrich is consistent with the best proposals compiled by serious students of this subject, who aim to build a reform based not on what makes you feel good but on what's best for the country.
Here's what Newt gets:
First, immigration is a rejuvenation of our economy, a source of invention and investment at the high end and of tax-paying, productive labor at the low end. So the foundation of a new policy should be the opening of more, and more-efficient, legal channels for the newcomers who will refresh our ingenuity and replenish our aging work force (and, by the way, pay to keep the Social Security funds filled for boomers like me).
Second, you can't sell reform unless it begins with enforcement. Restrictionists rightly point out that the last major reform bill in 1986 promised not only legalization but tougher employer sanctions and beefed-up border controls. In a booming, labor-hungry economy, those things did not come to pass. Critics of legalization are justified in saying we won't be fooled again.
Today the big hole in our enforcement is not the border; it's the failure to hold employers accountable. The best enforcement tool available is not an alligator-filled moat. (At least a third of illegals bypass the border altogether and just overstay temporary visitor visas.) The best tool is a national identity card, including some biometric evidence, such as a fingerprint. Gingrich braves the wrath of libertarians and privacy campaigners to endorse it. In today's living-online, GPS-tracked world, I think a national identity card would find wide acceptance.
Third, there is no easy solution to the 11 million already here. We are not going to legalize 11 million lawbreakers; that's politically untenable. Neither are we going to uproot and expel the equivalent of the population of Ohio -- severing families, spending billions and creating a shamefully cruel spectacle. So we set some rules. The recently arrived, the unattached and, obviously, the gangbangers and criminals go home. The deeply rooted, productive families pay a price to stay. The details -- who decides? what price? -- are not easy, but, as my daughter learned on her field trip to Ellis Island, it's never been simple inventing a new nation. (And after all, Newt, aren't we, like the Palestinians, an invented people?)
There are plenty of reasons the thought of President Newt Gingrich makes me shudder. But on this hard, defining American issue, he's shown a combination of brains, heart and guts that puts the rest of his party to shame.

HEADLINE: As Google Preens in Paris, France Briefly Becomes the Focus of Digital Optimism

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Eric E. Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France acted like old friends. Karl Lagerfeld, the head designer at Chanel, introduced a new online-only fashion brand. The Ting Tings gave a private concert at the Louvre for a gathering of the global digerati at the LeWeb technology conference here.
For a few days last week it seemed that France had stopped worrying and learned to love the Internet. 
Mr. Schmidt demonstrated Silicon Valley's proficiency for multitasking, shuttling between Brussels, where he met with European Commission antitrust regulators, and Paris, where he opened the Internet giant's new headquarters for southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Google's move from a plain office building into a palatial, 107,640-square-foot building that once served as the headquarters of a French railroad is the most visible sign of the company's campaign to woo Mr. Sarkozy and other French politicians, who have often complained about the disruptive effects of the company's technology.
All that, Mr. Sarkozy said last week, is ''the past.''
''Why am I here?'' he said during a talk with Mr. Schmidt, to celebrate the opening of the site. ''Why, as president, have I come to Google? It's a big deal. It wasn't easy. But I greatly admire American vitality. I have been criticized enough.''
The good feelings, at least as they were expressed publicly, seemed to be mutual, with a beaming Mr. Schmidt declaring at one Paris appearance: ''We love France.''
According to Mr. Schmidt, the bonhomie extended to Brussels, where he met with Joaquin Almunia, vice president of the European Commission, who is leading an antitrust investigation of Google concerning complaints that the company has abused its dominant position in the Internet search market. Far from being adversarial, Mr. Schmidt said, the tone of the talks was ''very pleasant.''
Since the investigation was opened last year, Google has stepped up its efforts to demonstrate its contributions to the French -- and European -- economy. The new Paris headquarters, acquired at a reported cost of 100 million euros ($133 million), will house a new international cultural institute and a research and development center.
Mr. Schmidt wasted few opportunities to point out that, at a time when the European economy was being dragged down by a debt crisis, the technology industry was one of the few potential sources of growth. Google has said it is in the process of hiring dozens of people in France, where it already has more than 300 employees, and hundreds more across Europe.
Mr. Schmidt also found time to drop in on LeWeb, a technology conference held Wednesday to Friday in a suburb of Paris, where the atmosphere was similarly upbeat.
At various times the stage was taken over by dancers, a magician and even a man who had run the Tokyo marathon with a Rube Goldberg-style device that helped him carry four iPhones, a laptop computer and other technology, all of which enabled him to stream the entire race, from multiple angles, live over the Internet.
Mr. Lagerfeld also disclosed a love for technology -- or, at least, for the accessorizing potential of certain kinds of gadgets. In an appearance at LeWeb, he said he had no time for e-mail, but added that he owned dozens of iPhones, iPads and iPods.
Natalie Massenet, founder of the online retailer Net-A-Porter, said her company planned to introduce a new fashion brand in partnership with Mr. Lagerfeld. The brand, Karl, will become available in January, she said.
Much of LeWeb seemed to be devoted to extolling the potential of ''social local mobile'' technology, also known as SoLoMo to the initiated. This is a reference to services like Foursquare, a mobile application that helps people round up their friends.
George F. Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, went so far as to declare that the World Wide Web, as used on a PC running a browser, was a ''dying technology.'' Mobile applications, running on smartphones and other devices, are the future, he said.
If there was a familiar ring to this idea, it may have been because many of the presenters at LeWeb -- and a not-insignificant portion of the audience -- had flown in from Silicon Valley, where the ''death of the Web'' is already an old chestnut.
Many of the presenters made no secret of their purpose at LeWeb: to try to raise funds. While venture capitalists in Silicon Valley might have heard their pitches before, there were at least a few European moneybags in attendance, too.
Niklas Zennstrom, a co-founder of the Internet telephony company Skype, picked up on a comment by Mr. Schmidt, who had said at LeWeb that he thought it would be good if a rival to Silicon Valley might emerge elsewhere. Mr. Zennstrom, a Swede, said more than half of the investments by the venture capital firm he runs, Atomico, were in Europe, though he added that he was looking elsewhere, too.
''Every day, the likelihood of great companies coming from other places around the world is increasing,'' he said. ''If you look ahead five years, the growth won't be in Europe or the United States but in emerging markets.''

HEADLINE: Week 14 Quick Hits: Tebow Wins, and Logic Loses

BYLINE: ANDY BENOIT


HIGHLIGHT: Logic still says that unlikely mistakes by opponents and clutch field goals from Matt Prater are not a formula for sustainable success. 

 BODY:
Broncos 13, Bears 10 (OT)
Admittedly, it's getting harder to keep pooh-poohing what Tim Tebow and the Broncos are doing. Once again, Denver's stingy defense carried the day - it was the fourth time in five games that it held an opponent under 14 points. But it can't be overlooked that Tebow, who completed just 3 of 16 passes in the first three quarters (four if you count the one to Bears corner Charles Tillman), was 15/20 for 191 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter and overtime. There's still buzz-killing analysis to offer here: Tebow's touchdown drive was aided by Chicago's cautious zone coverages; the fourth-quarter field-goal drive doesn't happen without Marion Barber's out-of-bounds blunder (as bad as a mistake gets); and the overtime field-goal drive probably doesn't happen without Barber's fumble.
True, we've been saying these "yeah buts" for eight weeks. All that means is it's too late for the "nonbelievers" to throw up our hands and see the light now. We're better off sticking with logic, which says that unlikely mistakes by opponents and clutch field goals from Matt Prater are not a formula for sustainable success. We can cynically state that Denver's stellar defense won't have faced a true test until Tom Brady & Company come to town next week, or that this offense will have trouble against more complex, attacking defenses like, say, those of the Ravens or the Steelers. We'll retreat to our film labs to further explain it. Of course, as we continue to sermonize about logic, fewer and fewer people seem to be listening.
Chargers 37, Bills 10
Philip Rivers's woes seem to have abated. He has thrown seven touchdown passes and zero interceptions in his last three outings (playing the injury-riddled Bills and Jaguars defenses hasn't hurt). The Chargers are 6-7 and would be in perfect position for one of their procrastinated A.F.C. West-clinching runs if not for the Broncos' writing of the best holiday miracle story since "It's a Wonderful Life."
Lately, the term "smoke and mirrors" has come up when looking back on Buffalo's 4-1 start. This semi-talented offense is averaging 12.8 points per outing during their six-game losing streak. What's often forgotten is that nearly 50 percent of that offense went away when Fred Jackson broke his lower right leg.
Cardinals 21, 49ers 19
Quietly, Arizona's first-year defensive coordinator, Ray Horton, has built one of the better young units in the league. Horton's D has held its last six opponents to under 20 points. What's changed since the start of the season has been the stability of Arizona's secondary - Patrick Peterson's near-shutdown cornerbacking offers critical support for Horton's frequent all-out blitzes - and the continued emergence of front seven stars Daryl Washington and Calais Campbell. They, along with tireless Darnell Dockett, give the Cardinals three potent forces up front. Of the three, Campbell has shone brightest in recent weeks. He penetrates consistently against the run and, with his Pterodactyl-like wingspan, crowds passing lanes at the line of scrimmage (he made yet another critical pass bat-down to force fourth down on San Francisco's final drive Sunday).
Ravens 24, Colts 10
As hard as it is to argue against Darrelle Revis as this season's Defensive Player of the Year, there needs to be serious consideration for Terrell Suggs. The ninth-year veteran posted three sacks and three forced fumbles against the hapless Colts, just two weeks after posting three sacks against the 49ers. Last week, Suggs ruined Cleveland's quick-slanting passing game (which is Cleveland's entire passing game) by dropping into coverage from his defensive end spot. He's as versatile as they come. His career-high 13 sacks have been impressive, but more impressive is his run defense, which is ruthless.
Texans 20, Bengals 19
Carol Yates, mother of Texans rookie quarterback T.J. Yates, may want to just bite down hard and slay those dragons of motherly worry that often prevented her from looking on while her son shredded the Bengal defense with a game-winning 13-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. After a few jittery high throws early, Carol's son finished 26/44 for 300 yards. Judging by his quick release, decisiveness in the pocket and respect commanded by coaches and teammates, it's possible she could spend the next decade dealing with those dragons of worry (if they remain unattended, that is).
At the very least, she'll spend the next month dealing with them. The Texans have three regular-season games remaining and, at 10-3 and champs of the A.F.C. South, they've clinched their first ever postseason appearance.
After giving up 90 yards to Cedric Benson in the first half, Wade Phillips's crew held Benson to minus-one yard in the second half (or, more accurately, "forced Benson to minus-one yard," as we can assume Benson did not run for lost yardage on purpose).
Lions 34, Vikings 28
The nice thing about turnovers is they can always masquerade as analysis whenever a writer feels like copping out and not breaking down a game between two teams that seemingly play each other every other week. All the writer has to do is bust out the old studio analyst line about how winning the turnover battle is the key in the N.F.L. In this game, Minnesota had six turnovers; Detroit had zero. There you go.
The bulk of Minnesota's turnovers - including two that resulted in defensive touchdowns - came from rookie quarterback Christian Ponder, who, playing with a painful hip pointer, simply had One of Those Days. Ponder has shown a hint of recklessness in recent weeks. Leslie Frazier is hoping that a second-half benching will help steady his young quarterback.
Saints 22, Titans 17
Drew Brees tied a single-season record with his tenth 300-yard passing game and extended his touchdown pass streak to 40 games. And this opening sentence could have been written last Friday. The Saints' offense versus the Titans zone defense was a matchup seemingly ripe for lopsidedness. It's actually to the Titans' credit that they held the Saints to just 6 first-half points (and 22 altogether). However, the Titans' bend-but-don't-break approach allowed the Saints to control the flow, especially early. The Saints ran 22 of the 27 plays in the first quarter and finished the game with 37:33 in time of possession. They may not have ever fully found their rhythm, but they definitely prevented the Titans from finding . (Need proof? Chris Johnson had 23 yards on 11 carries.) We highlight the vulnerability of a bend-but-don't-break defense against elite offenses as a segue to the Patriots.
Patriots 34, Redskins 27
You can give up 463 yards to a team like the Redskins because they have a quarterback who throws red-zone interceptions (Rex Grossman is tied for the league lead with four), a running back who lacks lateral explosiveness (Roy Helu had an admirable 126 yards Sunday, but Bill Belichick's game plan did not exactly center on stopping the fourth-round rookie) and wide receivers who, other than maybe Santana Moss, concern no one. But against an elite offense, a pass defense as shabby as New England's will be torn apart.
If the Patriots are to convert their record-tying ninth straight double-digit-win season into a fourth Lombardi Trophy, they'll have to outscore opponents. That's never been their M.O. - not even in 2007 when they often outscored opponents by 20. (The '07 defense ranked fourth in yards and points.) This '11 offense, however, which is built not around the downfield prowess of Randy Moss, but rather, the versatility of tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez, might be more sustainable than the '07 bunch. That bodes well for keeping the porous defense off the field.
Eagles 26, Dolphins 10
Hopefully you treated yourself to a break from the disappointing Eagles by simply reviewing the box score from this game (judging by the ubiquitous orange seats Sunday, that's what most Dolphin fans did). If you saw the box score, then you saw one of the most interesting stat lines this season: LeSean McCoy, maybe the best runner in the N.F.C. in 2011, had 27 carries for 38 yards. Take out his longest rush and he finished with 26 carries for 27 yards. The Eagles could have gotten that production much easier by just running 26 quarterback sneaks. McCoy's bizarrely ineffective day will probably go unnoticed because two of his carries ended up in the end zone, meaning his fantasy owners won't gripe about how he killed their postseason run.
Jets 37, Chiefs 10
So which is the more impressive "unimpressive Chiefs factoid" from this game? a.) that the Chiefs netted 4 yards of offense in the first half or b.) that this season they're now minus-120 in point differential against the A.F.C. East (which, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, is an N.F.L. record for one team against a division).
With the Tyler Palko train wreck occurring on such grand stages - his first two losses both came in prime time; this loss was in the not-so-small New York market - it's a little surprising that more talking heads have not trumpeted the value of a backup quarterback. (To the Chiefs' credit, they recently traded for Kyle Orton but he hurt his finger on his first snap against the Bears last week.) Preaching the value of a good backup seems like an obvious knee-jerk reaction for on-air "experts", no?
Falcons 31, Panthers 23
This could turn out to be one of those season-defining wins for the Falcons. After giving up a 74-yard touchdown to DeAngelo Williams and a 44-yard score to Jeremy Shockey, the Falcons found themselves down, 23-7, on the road. They were able to jump on Matt Ryan's back, as the somewhat maligned fourth-year quarterback completed 22/28, with four touchdowns and no interceptions to lead a methodical second-half comeback. The Falcons have leaned on Ryan more than ever this season, increasing his audible powers at the line of scrimmage, operating out of more three-receiver sets and making him a large part of Julio Jones's development. As Ryan goes, so go the Falcons. They're 21-0 when he posts a triple-digit passer rating.
Jaguars 41, Bucs 14
The easy reaction here is to say that Bucs Coach Raheem Morris should be booted from the hot seat to the unemployment line. His Bucs have lost seven straight after being blown out by a restructuring organization. But the Bucs had seven turnovers in this game. Preston Parker, Josh Freeman and LeGarrette Blount each fumbled twice (four of their combined six fumbles were recovered by the Jaguars). Is that really the head coach's fault? You might try to say that the turnovers are a reflection of Morris's team being ill-prepared. Perhaps. But a coach can't draw up plays or watch more film or deliver emotional speeches to make his players hold onto the football. He can, however, hold his players accountable.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: The Clock is Ticking

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: What's driving you crazy? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Will Congress Extend the Cuts?
The clock is ticking on whether Congress will extend payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits. David Mielach asks if these extensions would really help businesses. Republicans say the plan would hurt. First-time jobless claims drop to the lowest in nine months. But Mike Shedlock says, "Those who think the economy is improving based on the falling unemployment rate are looking at a statistical mirage based on an extremely atypical and prolonged drop in the labor force." President Obama makes a major speech on economic inequality. Bloomberg News and Ben S. Bernanke battle over the Fed's handling of the financial crisis.
The Economy: Just Spend It!
A lot of small businesses believe the economy has worsened over the past six months. A new report says that our economic problems would be solved if banks and corporations would start spending the $3.6 trillion they are hoarding. The airline industry, even with the problems in Europe, is still on track to make $6.9 billion. Citigroup cuts 4,500 jobs. The United States Postal Service will slow deliveries, and Mike Sunnucks explains why the changes could have a big impact. The Guardian Life Small Business Research Institute identifies the top trends for small-business owners in 2012. The ISM nonmanufacturing composite index (pdf) falls. The Federal Reserve warms to the idea of forecasting rates. American medical school applications hit an all-time high. New orders for manufactured goods (pdf) fell in October. NASA comes closer to finding life out there.
Ideas: Why Megabus Is a Hit 
A comedian wants to help entrepreneurs. Barry Moltz suggests 10 business gifts for under $20. Here's how to keep a relationship going while on the road. Mark Perry explains why Megabus is a hit. The Frugal Dad lists the top 35 frugality blogs. The founder of a make-your-own-cheese kit has some wise words about running a small business. Hoyt Mann describes two customer-relationship management trends that will help businesses in 2012: "Keep mobility in the front of your mind. Be able to connect and interact with your customers via video, phone, e-mail, social media, etc." These 15 retro revivals made a comeback this year. A mugger picks the wrong guy to mug.
Red Tape: Ominous Words From the Treasury Department
Say it ain't so, Kermit! A report says that 68 of the Fortune 500 (pdf) paid no state income taxes in at least one year from 2008 to 2010. The Treasury Department is concerned that small-company tax returns are not being challenged enough and offers guidance for performing better audits (pdf). Coincidentally, the Internal Revenue Service updates Publication 4591 (pdf): Small-Business Federal Tax Responsibilities. A report shows how big corporations pay more for lobbyists (pdf) than they do in taxes. Pennsylvanians will soon have more time to buy beer on Sundays. Kevin Drum ponders whether the health care overhaul will spell the end of employer insurance (Paul Downs wouldn't mind). George Will says small-business owners are caught in a regulatory barrage. Peter Orszag says defined-contribution plans are the future of health care. Anaheim, Calif., moves to cut regulations and reduce the cost of doing business. A brewer says that her company's growth was aided by smart government regulations. And Robert Reich still wants more taxes and more government spending.
Start-Up: The Top 20 Start-Ups for 2011
Startup America steps it up, and President Obama contributes. ZINK (short for 'zero ink') raises $35 million. A couple of "hotshots" are hired to mentor start-ups. American battery start-ups are facing strong headwinds. An education start-up receives $11 million from a couple of well-known venture capitalists. Jeffrey Bezos and others sink $32 million into a private car service. A chip start-up takes on Intel. This start-up has to keep a 700-name spreadsheet to manage all the investors who want to finance it. A health question-and-answer start-up raises $11.5 million. Goldman Sachs picks its hottest public offeringprospects. David Hood has thoughts on the marketing of a start-up. Here are Business Insider's top 20 start-ups of 2011. Alec Baldwin may help a small app maker raise $900 million (but gets thrown off a plane).
Marketing 1: Too Much Christmas?
Harvey MacKay reminds us that all employees are in sales. A report says we expect measurable marketing campaigns but most of us don't actually measure. Kendra Lee offers the 20 worst voice mail mistakes prospecting salespeople make, including: "Using a tone of voice that suggests you don't expect a call back." Big search companies are wooing small businesses. Intuit offers a new way for small businesses to increase sales using Facebook. A researcher says too much Christmas can turn away shoppers. Joe Cordo lists his top marketing trends for 2012, including: "Just as the cellphone revolutionized telecommunications with anytime, anyplace communications, the application of customer intelligence to the customer life cycle now creates marketing opportunities that have never been realized before."
Marketing 2: The Year in Tweets
Twitter redesigns itself, and Casey Chan says we're going to hate it. Mark Schaefer explains the 15 business benefits of Twitter and asks this about customer service: "When people 'call' your company on Twitter, do you pick up the phone?" Steve Campbell gives us some practical tips for using Twitter. Here are 2011's top Twitter hashtags and searches and the 40 most memorable tweets of the year. The Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra sings some tweets for the season. Alec Baldwin deactivates his Twitter account.
Finance: Where Entrepreneurs Get Money
Export-Import Bank and the New York Fed join forces to help increase New York small-business exports and create local jobs.

This Week's Bests
Reasons to Shop at Malls. Rebecca Greenfield explains, "People still like the in-store experience. As with most things digital, critics have said that Internet buying lacks a certain, important physicality, like touching fabrics and trying on clothing. And those skeptics aren't alone. People really do still like going into a store - even if they shop online."
Advice for Building a Patent Portfolio. Nitin Gupta and Eric Hutchins offer five tips for entrepreneurs building a patent portfolio, such as: "Create a 'patent team' to quickly review new inventions": "It's best to include a diverse set of people in this discussion - a person from management (it can be a founder/C.E.O. but just as often is a C.F.O.), engineering, and marketing/sales, at a minimum. It's important to keep the marketing and sales folks in the loop on patents because they often are the first to disclose new inventions outside the company."
Rant. Whitney Hoffman lists five things that drive her crazy, including: "Everybody's an Expert": "Google exists and we can have information at our fingertips at all times. But information is not experience, or knowledge or wisdom. Just because you went to school once, does not make you an education expert. ... Likewise, just because I can go to Home Depot and buy cool tools does not make me a general contractor. ... Let people with experience and expertise do what they do best."

HEADLINE: Samurai Shopper | Give Greece a Chance

BYLINE: S.S. FAIR


HIGHLIGHT: As the greatest Greek Socrates once said: Beauty is a short-lived tyranny. So get it while you can. 

 BODY:
Much as I long to live in a blinkered bubble of my own devising, the Samurai Shopper cannot ignore the endless news loops of Mitts and Newts, unemployment statistics, and the imminent collapse of the Eurozone due to fiscal laxity and mounting sovereign debt that will topple the civilized world -- and also America.
I'd love to say it's all Greek to me, but it isn't. It's Italian and Spanish too. The satirist Juvenal dismissed his Roman countrymen as being overly fond of bread and circuses -- that sounds like modern-day Americans and Eurozonians too. A pile of McRibs and a klown kar krammed with Kardashians makes global apocalypse seem so fifty years from now. This impending world crumble started, ironically, in democracy's birthplace --
Greece. But all I am saying (with apologies to John Lennon) is give Greece a chance.
The Greeks gave us Epicurus, the first philosopher foodie. They gave us drama and comedy and a pantheon of fascinatingly neurotic gods like Chaos, Eros and Hermes -- the latter is still ruling the world of luxe accessories. True, Greeks peaked in 776 B.C. with the Olympic games, and what have they done for us lately? Well, they brought us Jennifer Aniston and Tina Fey. Greek yogurt? Fantastic. And some Greek skin-care lines are as fine as the lines creeping up your face.
Korres, born in the oldest pharmacy in Athens, has a prodigious selection of makeup and skin-care products at their-free standing stores, all based on homeopathy. I like their Wild Rose Illuminating Powder and Wild Rose Mineral Foundation, SPF 30. Sponge, available at Barney's, cranks up the organic factor with Ladi Avocanto, an avocado/olive oil that works wonders on dry skin. Sponge's aromatherapy mists are soothing and sniffy in sweet basil, jasmine and more of that wild rose.
Apivita does a wide range of products for men, babies and Greek goddesses. Their Queen Bee line (fittingly at Patricia Field) incorporates royal jelly and honey in serums and moisturizers that are aromatic freshness for dry dull dehydrated skin. Apivita's Express Beauty line of pocket-sized, one-time use masks and eye patches let you sample the wares with a budgetary discipline that the Greeks apparently lack. Apivita also does a medicinal line based on propolis -- an old fangled, newly rediscovered resin -- that accumulates in honeycombs and acts like a natural antifungal and antiseptic.
As the greatest Greek Socrates once said: Beauty is a short-lived tyranny. So get it while you can.

HEADLINE: Want Unemployment Benefits? We'll Need a Urine Sample

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A new bill would enable states to require drug-testing for anyone seeking unemployment benefits. 

 BODY:
If you follow Congress (and who could blame you if you gave up on that years ago) it's important to look out for normal-seeming bills that are, in fact, filled with poisonous little bits of legislative mischief making.
There's been a lot written already about Congressional Republicans attaching fast-track approval of the Keystone XL pipeline to the payroll tax bill. If you can't see the connection, don't worry, there is none. It's all about pushing a terrible idea through Congress under the cover of a needed bill.
And speaking of, there's the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a bunch of really dangerous changes to the legal system, like taking the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors and courts largely out of the anti-terrorism business. I've already vented about that one today, so I'll leave it alone. For now.

Here's another good one. Last Friday, the House Republican leadership published their version of a law to extend unemployment benefits - which Congress must do or risk making the recovery even slower for ordinary Americans than it already is.
Think Progress, a liberal political site, pointed out an interesting passage on page 39. It seems the authors of this legislation thought it might be a good moment to amend the Social Security Act. Not to make the program more effective, or to ensure benefits for future generations of Americans, mind you, but to enable states to require drug-testing for anyone seeking unemployment benefits.
Sadly, it's not really a new idea. Governors have tried it before in a few states, and the courts so far have resisted. Because, among other things, it's unconstitutional. Florida's law requiring drug testing for welfare recipients has been put on hold by a federal judge.
Not to be outdone, Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, has introduced an even more extreme bill that would make drug testing to receive unemployment benefits (instead of enabling states to make the decision on their own). Representative George Miller of California rightly called the bill "just another attempt to demonize the unemployed, most of whom have no job for no fault of their own."
He added: "Why doesn't he propose to drug test executives at Wall Street banks? It was their actions that have been documented to have directly contributed to the recession and high unemployment rate in the first place."
I'm not calling for that, but it's fun to think about.

HEADLINE: Unwanted Homes, Unwanted Workers

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Today's housing problems are not terribly dissimilar from the last time one of pillars of the economy faced sudden devaluation: its labor force, in the several years after World War II. 

 BODY:
Once upon a time, housing looked like a rare, highly valued asset; now, the market has been flooded with unwanted homes. And as I wrote in an articleSunday, economic forces have helped reallocate those excess houses to more productive (and non-residential) uses, like a park, work of art or marijuana garden.
In the course of reporting for this article, I realized that today's housing problems are not terribly dissimilar from the last time one of pillars of the economy faced sudden devaluation: its labor force, right after World War II.
During the war, able-bodied workers were in short supply relative to the output required to keep the country functioning and pumping out tanks and munitions. To lure more women into the labor market, employers raised wages and the government popularized "Rosie the Riveter."
Then the war ended. Millions of soldiers flooded back into an economy that had been restructured to operate almost entirely without them. Politicians feared that the markets would again be overwhelmed with excess labor and the Great Depression would resume.
But just as governments are bulldozing away excess housing today, after World War II the government removed some of the surplus labor from the market then as well. It did so through two channels -- one for women, and one for men.
"First there was propaganda to get women out of the home, and then came the propaganda to get women back in the home," said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard who has written about postwar labor markets. Many employers also laid off their female employees to make room for the returning troops, he said.
If the women were re-domesticated, the men were instead educated.
Returning soldiers were offered a free college or technical education by the G.I. Bill - an offer that also happened to delay their entry into the labor force.
"It was a payment for their service, but it was also to keep them from going out and looking for jobs," said Professor Katz.
There was indeed a brief recession in 1945 as war production unwound, but unemployment managed to stay astoundingly low in the postwar years. Reducing the supply of labor wasn't the only reason workers escaped devaluation on the scale seen in the recent housing bust; there was also a major postwar increase in demand for workers.
Pent-up demand for products that were rationed during the war and construction for newly forming families also created a lot of new jobs for returning soldiers. (It helped that the United States was the only major developed country whose capital stock hadn't been bombed out, of course.)
The government bolstered demand for workers too, by creating lots of labor-intensive post-war infrastructure projects.
So what lessons do those policies offer for today's housing market?
Now, as then, the government has two main ways to stabilize the market (assuming politicians want price declines to stop, and they may not). Government policy can either reduce supply or increase demand -- or do both at once, as it did after World War II.
Reducing supply in the housing market means bulldozing more homes or otherwise assigning them to other uses (or at least rezoning houses so that the private sector can assign the buildings to other uses). State and local governments across the country have already begun this strategy.
Increasing demand for homes, on the other hand, is a bit trickier.
One possibility is to increase the population of the United States. Accordingly, Senators Chuck Schumer and Mike Lee have introduced a bill offering residential visas to any immigrants who buy housing in the United States.
There are many opponents to this idea, thanks to fears that bringing in more foreign homeowners means also expanding the oversupply of workers that we have today. (Many economists disagree with this assessment, but that's a whole other can of worms.)
The United States may not even need more people to move here to absorb excess homes. Maybe all it needs is for its existing population to change its family arrangements.
Household formation has slowed dramatically since the recession began. Over a million homes that should have been formed in the last few years - at least, given demographics -- weren't, according to Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. That's approximately equal to the country's current surplus of vacant homes.
Household formation is slowing not because the population is shrinking, but because cash-strapped families are doubling up and unemployed recent college graduates remain tethered to their parents' couches.
An implication is that to fix the housing market, the government should be promoting job growth, which will enable crammed families to peel off from one another. Now, as in the postwar decade, employment and housing remain inextricably linked.

HEADLINE: Tax Policy Blowing in the Wind

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A report commissioned by the wind energy industry projects steep job losses in the sector in 2013 if a tax credit for production is not extended. 

 BODY:
If you want something from Congress, there are probably only about four shopping days left until Christmas, because most members of the House and Senate seem likely to go home on Friday. One big item on the green list is an extension of the production tax credit for wind energy, and the industry's trade association, the American Wind Energy Association, released a dire study on Monday about what will happen without it. 
The association commissioned a study from Navigant Consulting, which found that next year there will be 78,000 jobs supported by wind, but that this would fall to 41,000 in 2013 without an extension of the tax credit, which is 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour.
(That credit is rather large, considering that the average sale price of a kilowatt-hour is about 11 cents.) 
 Extending the tax credit to 2016 would create another 17,000 jobs, the consulting firm predicted.
 Wind is in a different boat from solar, which has its own frantic lobbying effort now under way to get Congress to act before the lawmakers go home. As I wrote last week, the solar industry has a credit that is good until 2016 but is seeking wants an extension of a separate program that converts the credit to a cash grant.

The wind industry has given up on getting that provision extended for itself and is focused on its underlying credit, which expires at the end of next year.
But in practice, the credit has already expired, according to the industry. The reason is that to get the credit, a company has to have the wind farm in service by Dec. 31, 2012, and it is probably too late now to break ground on a new project and be sure of having it in service by then. 
 "The planning cycle for our industry is in excess of a year,'' said Kevin Hazel, vice president of supply chain management for Siemens Wind Power, in a conference call with reporters. "if the production tax credit isn't extended soon, the uncertainty for our customers will tend to have them hold back.''
The credit has expired before, but at this point, according to the industry, wind has a substantial American industrial base, so more is at risk.
At companies that supply components for wind farms, executives say they have fat order books. But some of those orders are likely to be canceled if the tax credit is not extended, they say.
 Wind installations will continue to grow for as long as states maintain standards for including renewables in their energy portfolios." But some of those standards could be trimmed, especially if there is a large after-tax price gap between wind and conventional energy. The industry has something else in mind; a technology that would be cost-effective without the credit, based on economies of scale.
 But building momentum towards a full-size, independent industry won't be helped by a start-and-stop tax credit, the industry contends.
 The effort to extend the production tax credit has a broad variety of backers, including some that are not traditionally thought of as green, like Midwestern steel manufacturers. But with Congress deadlocked on bigger issues like the payroll tax, this one seems likely to slip into early 2012 at least.

HEADLINE: For Bridge Built Long Ago, No End to Repairs

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The Henry Hudson Bridge, which is 75 years old and crosses the Harlem River, seems to be in a constant state of construction. 

 BODY:
On Monday, the Henry Hudson Bridge - that triumphalist crossing over the Harlem River, a steel archway slicing through a verdant vista of water, trees and cliffs - celebrates its diamond anniversary, the 75th. And like many older citizens of New York City, the bridge has had its share of wear-and-tear.
It is one of the least-used bridges in the region's arsenal, but its operations have piled up over the years, closing lanes and upsetting commuters bound for the many gilded Westchester County suburbs it serves. 
One Manhattan-bound lane was shut down for a 43-month period that ended in June 2010, during which the entire Depression-era lower deck was replaced. Eleven months later, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began a new rehabilitation, this time to replace the steel support ropes, which will require a round-the-clock shutdown of a Bronx-bound lane for the next three years.
In fact, the bridge has been, more or less, continually under construction since 2000, at a cost of around $160 million, twice the inflation-adjusted price tag of the original bridge.
"As you would expect, a 75-year-old span needs to be maintained," said Judie Glave, a spokeswoman at the transportation authority. The reality is that much of New York's crucial infrastructure is increasingly in need of expensive upkeep. The Henry Hudson Parkway was created as a picturesque thoroughfare for weekend riders (and a few Riverdale commuters), and, at the time, about 9,000 cars traversed the crossing daily. This year, that number reached 63,000.
No tolls were charged for the bridge's first two days of operation, and at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 14, 1936, when a small white truck became the first vehicle to pay for the privilege of enjoying the bridge's sweeping views, the charge was a mere dime. But the bridge's health care costs, and a lack of infrastructure financing from state legislators, can add up: the toll has risen from a dime to the $2.20 charge levied on E-ZPass users today. (The bridge is also the crossing where the transportation authority started using gateless tolls.)
A lodestar of the era of automobile expansionism, and only the second of Robert Moses' major crossings to be completed, the Henry Hudson Bridge was nevertheless unveiled without pomp, in a quiet ceremony on the foggy afternoon of Dec. 11, 1936.
In an uncharacteristically selfless statement, Moses doffed his hat to the "scores of citizens, distinguished and nameless" who had helped plan the redevelopment of Manhattan's then-moribund West Side, an inhospitable stretch of shipyards, train tracks and swampland, which he hoped would be revitalized by its new link to the Bronx and Westchester County. 
But the master planner did not skimp on taking credit. 
"If we make any claim," Moses said, "it is that we have had the gumption to translate plan into reality. It cannot be said too often that what New York needs today is not vision, with which we have always been plentifully endowed in the past, but elbow grease."
What Moses omitted in his brief remarks were the fraught origins of a bridge that cut through the previously isolated and untouched parkland of northern Manhattan and the western Bronx. Inwood Hill Park, with its pastoral overlooks onto the Hudson River, was considered "virgin forest," as one report put it at the time, a last bastion of "wild Manhattan."
Moses, of course, was rarely known to let sentiment stand in the way of cold pragmatism. Earlier plans for a bridge at the site had been nixed by environmental groups, and one proposal in the 1930s called for the route to curve east, around Fort Tryon and Inwood Hill Parks, and cross the Harlem River at grade level, bypassing the forested area. 
But building directly through the park had a distinct advantage in Moses' eyes: it would allow him access to the vast federal subsidies available at the time for "park access roads." The government would pay for a significant portion of the project, as long as it bisected Inwood Hill. If the highway remained on the city's streets, the plan would cost far more and require an onerous process of eminent domain. 
As he would time and again, Moses had his way. The New York Times, in its coverage at the time, did not ignore the autocratic tendencies of the man who brought the bridge to fruition: it noted archly that Moses "is also the one-man Henry Hudson Parkway Authority."
But The Times's editorial writers also offered a measured endorsement of Moses' controversial methods. One man, the paper wrote, had been handed "the job of creating a unified park, parkway and arterial highway system for the entire city."
"In this instance," the paper continued, "the end has gloriously justified the means."
News of the new link to the Bronx was overshadowed by a surprising announcement from England: King Edward VIII had decided to abdicate. A radio set was wheeled into the Fort Tryon Park restaurant where dignitaries, including Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, were enjoying a buffet dinner in honor of the bridge. 
"The mayor nodded in agreement when Edward declared that he could not continue 'without the help and support of the woman I love,' and applauded loudly at the end of the speech," The Times wrote. "It was a beautiful speech, a beautiful speech," La Guardia said.

HEADLINE: Zombie Borders

BYLINE: FRANK JACOBS


HIGHLIGHT: The former border between East and West Germany is older and more complicated than you think. 

 BODY:
June 13th, 1990, was a historic day for weather forecasting in Germany. For the very first time, the weather map on the Tagesschau [1] showed the newly reunited country's international borders. 
Before, German meteorologists made do with merely topographical maps of a borderless Europe. This was to keep ideology out of meteorology: showing (or not showing) the border between East and West Germany would have meant acknowledging (or denying) that this too was an international border. 
Now defunct by just over two decades, the border between the two Germanys already seems like a surreal relic from a much more distant past. Was there ever a 540-mile Strip of Death separating the two halves, from the Czech border to the Bay of Lubeck? There was - and it was quite hermetical, and very deadly [2] - but today a visitor might be forgiven for thinking otherwise. 
These days, the so-called innerdeutsche Grenze is almost completely erased from the landscape, marked only by the occasional memorial placard along the Autobahn. The fences, the spotlights, the guard dogs and the tanks have all been withdrawn. But that doesn't mean it's gone. The line that separated the Federal Republic of (West) Germany from the (East) German Democratic Republic is a zombie border: it's been dead a few times in the past, and that hasn't stopped it coming back. The line between east and west existed long before the postwar split. 
The German part of what was called the Iron Curtain started on the Czech border at an old tripoint between the ancient kingdoms of Saxony, Bavaria and Bohemia [3]. On its northward course it largely followed the borders of German princely states as they had existed since the Middle Ages. 
Admittedly, the view is complicated by the proliferation of small states so typical for pre-unification Germany, but squint at a map of the Holy Roman Empire [4] in its latter centuries, and you'll see the 20th-century intra-German border prefigured. It's right there, at the western edge of Thuringia, Magdeburg, the Altmark and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. 
But why? After flattening much of Germany, why would the Allies pay any heed to medieval demarcations when occupying it? The border between FRG and GDR started out as the line where the Soviet zone of occupation in the east met the British and American zones. Not only did the Soviets have a bone to pick with Germany, but communism itself seems antithetical to the feudalism that shaped those borders. 
The answer is, most likely: convenience. Many if not most "new" international borders, which we take to be the result of recent politics, are in fact older, subnational ones. Drawing completely new borders means having to negotiate and compromise, exchanging territorial tit-for-tats. Plus, by taking over old administrative units in their entirety, you're inheriting an established capital with a centralized administration that has a reach covering the entire territory. Relying on old borders, already familiar to the locals, saves the occupier a lot of bother. 
But there is an even deeper historical layer to Germany's East-West divide. If the 20th-century border was ideological, and the 18th-century one dynastic, the separation in the Early Middle Ages was ethnic. Almost exactly a millennium before Stalin staked his claim to East Germany, a weirdly similar border divided the East Francian kingdom of Henry I the Fowler, first king of all Germans (919-936) from the Slavic lands in the east. 
Around that time, most of what became the German Democratic Republic was settled by Slavs. Indeed, the Slavic history of what is now eastern Germany has been caught in the amber of its toponymy: Any town name ending in -ow (Treptow), -au (Spandau) or -itz (Chemnitz) most likely has a Slavic root. Even Berlin refers back to "berl," ancient Slavonic for "swamp" (near which the original settlement was built), and not to Bar, German for the bear that really has no business gracing the city flag [5]. 
Henry founded the powerful Ottonian dynasty - his son Otto would be the first German emperor - and started the tradition of German eastward expansion. In the centuries up to the world wars of the 20th century, German conquest, settlement and acculturation had pushed back the Slavosphere hundreds of miles. Even today, pockets of ethnic Slavs still exist within German borders, most notably the Sorbs, who live in and around the Spreewald marshlands southeast of Berlin and speak a language closely related to Polish. Hitler explicitly placed his quest for more Lebensraum in the east in the tradition of that Drang nach Osten [6]; he even sent German anthropologists into Poland and Russia to find evidence that ethnic Germans had once occupied those territories. 
Stalin, too, saw the contemporary conflict with Germany in a millennial context. In his victory speech to the people on May 9, 1945, he said: "The age-long struggle of the Slavonic peoples for their existence and independence has ended in victory over the German aggressors and German tyranny." 
This might explain why the Soviets were the first of the Allied quartet to propose the borders of their occupation zone [7] - they had studied their historical atlases beforehand, and were determined to roll back German eastward expansion from its high-water mark at the gates of Moscow to its earliest beginnings, on the banks of the Elbe. As the Swiss historian Walther Hofer wrote, "The Third Reich did not turn out to be a thousand-year empire, but in the twelve years of its existence, it managed to undo the historical achievement of a thousand years" [8]. 
But this was hardly the end of things: the Red Army's advance to the Elbe, once indeed the border between Germanic and Slavic tribes, turned out to be the Soviet Union's own high-water mark. By 1990, state communism had retreated from Central Europe. In a dramatic reversal of fortune, the Soviet Union was about to collapse as Germany's two halves re-unified [9]. 
The Iron Curtain that divided Europe (and Germany) is gone. The European Union now includes much of Eastern Europe, and indeed some bits of the former Soviet Union. In Angela Merkel, Germany has its first chancellor raised in the former East Germany. Although many socio-economic indicators for the ex-GDR are still not up to par with the western half of Germany, the border itself has been thoroughly erased from the landscape. 
So is that the end of Henry the Fowler's thousand-year-old border? Maybe not. Erased borders are like phantom limbs - sometimes it feels like they're still there, even when they're manifestly not. 
For one of the most remarkable examples of this revenant quality of former borders, we need only hop across the Oder-Neisse line to Poland. On the map of post-communist Poland's election results, one curious division keeps cropping up: the old imperial border between Russia and Prussia/Germany, as it existed when Poland did not, from 1848 to 1918. 
In the electoral districts west of that border, it's usually the more liberal candidates and parties that win a majority. To the east, with the notable exception of Warsaw, the more conservative ones mostly carry the day. This map shows the geographic distribution of majorities in the first round of the most recent presidential elections, in 2010, pitting Bronislaw Komorowski (candidate for the liberal Civic Platform party) against Jaroslaw Kaczynski (candidate of the conservative Law and Justice party). Mr. Komorowski, who defeated his opponent 53 percent to 47 percent, won majorities mainly in the formerly Prussian part of the country, with Mr. Kaczynski winning mainly in the formerly Russian part. 
The fit between modern election result and ancient border is almost perfect. But how can this be? The ethnic composition of the region has been shaken up thoroughly since the border last was in effect: following the Second World War, Germans were expelled from areas east of the Oder-Neisse line, and Poles moved in from former Polish areas to the east, now annexed by the Soviet Union. 
Yet in spite of these completely different demographics, the former border keeps resurfacing at Polish national elections - a zombie border indeed. Earlier treatment of this question [10] has offered up a few intriguing hypotheses: The resettled Poles haven't had the time yet to "get conservative"; the newer Polish areas have richer farmland (or a denser rail network), are thus more likely to have liberal politics. But an answer that fits the question as snugly as the old border fits contemporary election results remains elusive. 
It may seem overly deterministic to link modern election results to ancient borders that no longer exist; but similar claims have been made about election outcomes in France, Ukraine and the United States, to name but a few countries. 
The Web site Electoral Geography is an excellent place to lose a few hours looking for evidence of old borders, or any other social patterns, in election result maps. And when all those shifting boundaries get a bit too much for you, maybe it's finally time for the Tagesschau's soothing weather map, where the only lines moving across Europe are the cold fronts. 
 The daily news show on Germany's first public TV channel ARD (Das Erste, as opposed to the second public TV channel ZDF, das Zweite). 
 At its height, the border (not counting Berlin) was secured by an overlapping system of 273 miles of spring-gun installations, 143 miles of minefields, 374 miles of ditches (to prevent vehicular evasion) and 434 observation towers. Bordering the 30-foot-wide Strip of Death ("Todesstreifen") was a 1,500-foot-wide Control Strip ("Kontrollstreifen") and a nearly three-mile-wide Exclusion Zone ("Sperrzone") with limited access for non-residents. Between 1948 and 1989, 560 people were killed while attempting to cross this border without permission (in Berlin, the total body count was around 250). 
 Before 1989, that would have been East Germany, West Germany and Czechoslovakia, respectively. The tripoint is located at the very tip of the so-called As Panhandle. 
 A long-lived (962-1806) but weak union of mainly German states, presided over by an emperor chosen by a college of prince-electors ("Kurfurste"). Voltaire famously dubbed it "neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire."

HEADLINE: Whom Do You Trust?

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: People don't trust Congress, that's for sure. Which professions keep people honest? 

 BODY:
People's faith in Congress continues to sink like a rock. 
According to a Gallup poll released on Monday:
Sixty-four percent of Americans rate the honesty and ethical standards of members of Congress as "low" or "very low," tying the record "low"/"very low" rating Gallup has measured for any profession historically.
The report adds:
In general, Congress members' honesty and ethics ratings have never been that positive, averaging 15% very high or high and peaking at 25% in 2001. What has changed in recent years is the growing proportion of Americans rating their honesty and ethics as very low or low, rising from 22% in 2001 to 64% today.
Part of this no doubt has to do with the staggering economy and Congress's lack of action or efficacy when dealing with it. But it is probably also a rebuke of the endless brinksmanship and partisan intransigence that has crippled the Capitol.
Seven is a lucky number, but not when that's the percentage of Americans who rate your honesty and ethical standards as high. On this measure, Congress now ties lobbyists.
That said, the report also looked at other fields and found some positive trends and surprises.
For instance, the report found that:
Americans are as positive as they have ever been about those in medical professions, though the public has always held doctors, nurses and pharmacists in high esteem.
Despite the recent emergence of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the percentage of Americans who trust the country's business interests - bankers, business executives, stockholders and accountants - has continued to tick upward.
Look over the chart and let us know which parts of it you agree with (or don't), and tell us: whom do you still trust?

HEADLINE: Report Casts Doubt on Bond-Buying Effort by Britain

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The Bank of England's initial bond-buying program was less effective in lowering yields than the central bank had thought, a report by the Bank for International Settlements suggests. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Bank of England's initial bond-buying program was less effective in lowering yields than the central bank had thought, a report by the Bank for International Settlements suggested on Monday.
The central bank's decisions to buy 200 billion ($313 billion) of government bonds and other assets in 2009 and 2010 to increase liquidity in the credit markets pushed yields down by as much as 75 basis points, the Bank for International Settlements said in its quarterly review. The Bank of England said previously that the program would lower yields by 100 basis points, or one percentage point.
The Bank for International Settlements also said that while the early asset purchasing programs in the United States and Britain "had a significant impact on the financial markets," the "effects became smaller for the later extensions of the programs." That was partly because yields were already lower and because the novelty factor of the programs waned, it said in the review.
While questions remained about the effectiveness of the Bank of England asset-purchasing program, a decision to expand it by 75 billion, to 275 billion, in October was widely welcomed by the financial markets. Some economists expect the Bank of England to expand the program in the first quarter of 2012 amid fears that Britain could fall back into a recession.
Mervyn A. King, the Bank of England governor, praised the effect the asset-purchasing program had had on the economy in a speech in October. 
"Our program of gilt purchases has helped large companies to reduce their reliance on the banking system and obtain finance directly from equity and corporate bond markets," he said.

HEADLINE: House Democrats Bullish on 2012 Prospects

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Steve Israel, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, expects to come close to recapturing the majority if not deposing the Republicans altogether. 

 BODY:
Representative Steve Israel remembers how low House Democrats were after getting clobbered in the 2010 elections.
His colleagues were badly dispirited, and saw no hope of returning to power any time soon. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which he now heads, was $20 million in debt. The decennial redistricting loomed and most predictions were that Republican legislatures around the country were going to stick it to Democrats in drawing new maps. Defeated lawmakers would hang up on him or give him a tongue-lashing when he called to encourage them to consider running again. Donors hid their wallets.
"A lot of our colleagues had this psychology that we had to pick up 60 seats to take the House back, that is what we faced the day after," recalled Mr. Israel, who represents New York's Second Congressional District. "The first thing we had to is reverse the psychology and say, 'We can do this. It is 25 seats.'"
One year later, Mr. Israel and his colleagues are feeling a little better. The debt is nearly gone and redistricting has worked out about evenly for the two parties, though the Supreme Court's decision to intervene in Texas could cost Democrats. He has assembled what he considers a strong group of contenders. And Democrats think Republican management of the House and the running fiscal drama has turned off voters.
Even so, Mr. Israel is not ready to declare that Democrats will gain the 25 seats needed to take back the House. But he insists they have a real shot.
"I cannot guarantee anybody that we are going to win 25 or more seats at this point," Mr. Israel said in an interview with New York Times reporters and editors. "I will sign an affidavit that it is going to be razor close - razor close. And the razor is going to be sharpened or dulled based on the resources, the recruits and the message we have. The House is absolutely, clearly, unequivocally in play, which is a quantum leap from where we were a year ago." 
Mr. Israel and other Democrats say they have benefitted less from anything Democrats have done and more from Republican stewardship of the House in the ongoing conflict with the Democratic Senate and President Obama. He believes that the fight that almost led to a government shutdown in the spring, the extended debt limit standoff and now the payroll tax dispute have produced buyer's remorse among independent voters and caused Republican poll numbers to plummet.
But while Democrats are eager to run against the House Republican majority, the terms of the election will in many cases be dictated by the presidential race and the state of the economy - a fact that Mr. Israel acknowledges.
"I know full well that the national message, the environment we are going to be running in is going to be shaped by the presidential campaign," he said. "I would be foolish to say that we can shape our own message against that."
Given the dominance of the presidential contest and stubborn high unemployment with a Democrat in the White House, Republicans say that Democrats are guilty of having outsize expectations. They intend to hold on to the House.
"Voters have buyer's remorse because of the job-killing policies this president continues to pursue despite unacceptably high unemployment," said Paul Lindsay, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "Steve Israel knows he will be spending time and resources defending House Democrats from the albatross of President Obama, which is why he also knows his party has zero chance of returning Nancy Pelosi to the speaker's chair." 
Like the Democrats in 2010 after knocking off so many Republicans in the previous election, Mr. Israel said, Republicans are too deep in Democratic territory and are going to give back many of those seats in a presidential year, when the electorate is much different from the midterm voters who handed Republicans the majority.
He counts nearly 20 districts held by Republicans that were won by John Kerry in the 2004 elections and slightly more than 40 that were won by President Obama in 2008. Mr. Israel said he doesn't expect to take all of those back. But even winning a substantial number of them would put Democrats within reach of the majority given the likelihood that some current Democratic incumbents will fall.
After losing the Medicare issue to Republicans in the 2010 elections due to attacks on the new health care law, Democrats say they plan to turn the tables on Republicans. They intend to strike often on the opposition's support for the budget drafted by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin that would fundamentally change the way Medicare is provided. 
Democrats came under intense fire on Medicare from outside advocacy groups in the closing days of the 2010 election and were not able to adequately respond, Mr. Israel said. He predicted that won't be repeated this cycle because groups allied with Democrats have created their own independent advertising entities.
"Those attacks went unanswered," he said. "Now we have allies. This is a new world."
With new friends, Republicans in Democratic territory and a Republican record to run against, Mr. Israel is looking to come close to recapturing the House majority if not deposing the Republicans altogether.

HEADLINE: Modern Warfare 3 Passes $1 Billion in Sales in 16 Days

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Modern Warfare 3, the first-person shooter video game, reached $1 billion much more rapidly than Modern Warfare 2, an earlier installment of the game, which took took 60 days. 

 BODY:
Modern Warfare 3, the first-person shooter video game, passed $1 billion in sales in just 16 days, according to Activision Blizzard, the game's distributor. Modern Warfare 2, an earlier installment of the game, took 60 days to reach the same milestone.
The sales did not just shatter previous video game records, but also surpassed benchmarks for movie sales. The popular 3-D movie "Avatar" took 17 days to reach $1 billion in sales.
Robert Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said the increase in sales was a testament to the broader appeal of Modern Warfare as an entertainment experience that was not just for gamers.
"Modern Warfare 3, and other games by us, have a much broader appeal than they have had in the past, with the social nature of the game offering a different type of interactive experience that has not existed before," he said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. "As the number of new game consoles has expanded, along with the audience, it's capturing a new audience that in the past has not considered playing video games."
Modern Warfare is the ninth game in the Call of Duty series, which first appeared in 2003. It is available on a number of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii.
Mr. Kotick said he believed the Call of Duty series had been so successful because the video game creators continually focus on creating a better storytelling experience with each new game.
"Really knowing the taste of your customers is something we do really well; we've had so much sustained success with this franchise because we continue to look at what the audience is interested in," he said. "We continually make sure we are delivering products that have audience appeal."
In a press release, Activision noted that movie box office revenues were down 4 percent in 2011, to $9.4 billion, while "the number of people purchasing and participating in gaming is on the rise, with no sign of slowing."
"With more than 30 million gamers, the Call of Duty community now exceeds the combined populations of the cities of New York, London, Tokyo, Paris and Madrid," the company boasted in the release.
It hasn't been all good news for video games over the past few years. In June, the NPD Group, which tracks domestic sales performance of video games, said video game sales had fallen again in May from the same time a year earlier. The drop in game sales in recent years has partially been attributed to the recession.

HEADLINE: Bentley's New V-8 Will Growl With a German Accent

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The English ultraluxury marque based much of its new 4-liter twin-turbo V-8 on a 4.2-liter unit from Audi, its corporate cousin under the Volkswagen Group. 

 BODY:
Bentley Motors announced Monday that it would introduce a 500-horsepower twin-turbo V-8 engine for its Continental GT coupe and GTC convertible models at the Detroit auto show in January. Both automobiles will retain the W-12 engine as a higher-priced option.
The company's new 4-liter V-8 may be out-muscled by its 6-liter W-12, which generates 631 horsepower at its top end, but the V-8 is a more advanced package. The new engine features technologies found in the most contemporary power plants, including direct fuel injection, efficient thermal management and friction-reduction strategies. Twin turbos are packaged between the cylinder banks to reduce lag time. A variable displacement system shuts down four engine cylinders under light load.
These are also engineering hallmarks of the 4.2-liter V-8 developed by Audi, Bentley's corporate cousin under the Volkswagen Group. The similarities are not coincidental.
In an interview with the British publication Autocar, Brian Gush, a Bentley powertrain engineer, said that producing the V-8 was a collaborative effort between the two brands, but that when it came to a final configuration, Bentley "put the power and torque where we believed they should be to suit our cars."
In Bentley guise, the V-8 tops out at 487 pound-feet of torque, much of which is available all the way from 1,700 r.p.m. A new close-ratio 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive help to effectively manage all that torque.
Bentley said that the new powertrain delivered a 40 percent improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions compared with the W-12. Final fuel economy numbers are not yet available, but Bentley asserts that the automobiles can travel more than 500 miles on a single tank of what would certainly be premium fuel.
Most drivers probably won't miss the extra muscle of the W-12, as the Continental GT and GTC can, according to the automaker, reach 60 m.p.h. in less than 5 seconds, while topping out at 180 m.p.h.
The V-8 models will also get subtle yet distinctive trim, including a black matrix grille, conjoined -- or what Bentley calls figure-eight -- exhaust pipes and interior touches like a special wood veneer.
As for whether the V-8 models would represent a significant cost savings over the W-12 Continental, Bentley did not disclose. Pricing and availability should be announced closer to the Detroit show next month.

HEADLINE: A Post-Pollution Path to Global Climate and Energy Progress

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Continued failure in talks over emission limits prompts a new wave of calls for advancing smart energy choices. 

 BODY:
Some hard realities are being acknowledged as diplomats, scientists, scholars and others ponder next steps following the indeterminate Durban climate negotiations -- the latest failed attempt to limit climate risk using pollution-style restrictions on carbon dioxide under a global treaty.
The real-time demand for energy and economic vigor continues to trump long-term climate concerns as has been clear in the climate talks for years*. So a focus on finding ways to boost energy access in places that lack it, while working to cut energy waste and the costs of non-polluting energy choices, is spreading. You can see this in the grudging Tweets from green-energy proponents acknowledging some of the merits of Bjorn Lomborg's reaction to the climate talks, as with Tom Randhere and Lisa Vickers here.
You can also see a shift toward energy action in the latest thinking from William R. Moomaw, a scholar and professor at Tufts University who for decades has assessed international environmental diplomacy. Moomaw and Mihaela Papa, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Law School, sent me a short piece proposing ways to invigorate the faltering climate treaty process by shifting the focus from confrontations over emissions to collaborative work encouraging access to modern energy choices while limiting environmental harms.
Here's an excerpt and link to the Moomaw-Papa essay, which I encourage you to read in full: 
The current pollution control treaty on heat trapping emissions is doomed because it fails to recognize that the underlying problem is unsustainable development that produces vast emissions of heat trapping gases from the energy, industry, transportation, agricultural and forestry sectors.
Two decades of debate over assigning blame for emissions, legal responsibility for reducing them and allocating per capita rights to use the atmosphere for disposing of heat trapping gases have created a zero-sum game without opportunities for solving problems by creating mutual gains. In fact no one needs these emissions or even energy. What creates sustainable development are clean energy services that improve wellbeing and do not disrupt the climate system. What people need is clean energy services for cooking, lighting, space comfort, hot water, heat for industrial processes, and electrical energy services like motors, pumps, computing and communications. [Read the rest.]
This shift away from CO2-centric emissions debates is also evident in a group blog post by analysts at the Center for American Progress, who propose a "multiple multilateralism" approach on climate that, among other things, seeks quick steps on sources of warming other than carbon dioxide - particularly sooty Arctic pollution and gases already considered under the existing ozone-protection treaty. As with President Obama's efforts outside the treaty, this prescription echoes policies pursued in President George W. Bush's second term.
Finally, I like how an approach focused on energy and ingenuity is described in a Green Law blog post filed from the Durban climate talks by Pace University law professor Elizabeth Burleson:
While we still struggle to agree on what constitutes a timely and robust response to climate destabilization, the topic of innovation is providing common ground upon which to build multilateral trust. [Read the rest.]
I couldn't agree more. Considering the "super wicked" nature of the entwined climate and energy challenges, it's clear that the innovations necessary to build an energy menu that works for the long haul need to happen not merely in the laboratory, but also in education, communication and policy.
To some extent, the positions above reflect or build on themes articulated by David G. Victor of the University of California, San Diego, in "Global Warming Gridlock," Roger A. Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado in "The Climate Fix, and the authors (including Pielke) of "The Hartwell Paper -- a New Direction for Climate Policy."
There's much more on addressing the global energy challenge, and opportunity, from Scientific American, The Economist, National Geographic, the United Nations Development Program, and both Michael Wines and Elisabeth Rosenthal of The Times.
In an e-mail exchange this morning, William Moomaw noted the growing energy focus in development circles:
As you probably know, 2012 is the year of initiating "Universal Energy Access Towards 2030." A fairly cumbersome title. It is not seen as complimentary to climate negotiations, but is at least on the agenda. Still most people talk about it as simply more energy. According to the UN Foundation, the goals are:
 Ensuring universal access to modern energy services.
 Doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
 Doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
For one snapshot of what these bullet points can look like in the real world, watch this video report from Elisabeth Rosenthal and Times photographer Ed Ou:

HEADLINE: In CBS Interview, Obama Makes Case for Second Term

BYLINE: ANDREW MARTIN


HIGHLIGHT: During an appearance on "60 Minutes," President Obama kept to populist themes and contrasted himself with presidential candidates in the Republican field. 

 BODY:
President Obama on Sunday continued his populist fusillade, asserting during an appearance on "60 Minutes" on CBS that Republicans in Congress were protecting the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
In an interview with the reporter Steve Kroft, taped on Tuesday and Friday, Mr. Obama said it didn't matter who his Republican challenger would be in next year's presidential election, because, he said, comparing Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, "the core philosophy that they are expressing is the same."
But he added: "The contrast in visions between where I want to take the country and where they say they want to take the country is stark. The American people are going to have a good choice. And it's going to be a good debate."
Asked about Mr. Gingrich's surging campaign, Mr. Obama offered a tepid compliment, "He's somebody that has been around a long time and is good on TV, is good in debates."
As for Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama said he had "shown himself to be somebody who is good at politics as well. He's had a lot of practice at it." 
"I think they will be going at it a while," he said.
Confronted with a new CBS poll that showed 75 percent of Americans believed the country was headed in the wrong direction and 54 percent believed Mr. Obama did not deserve to be re-elected, the president said: "I would be surprised if the American people felt satisfied right now. They shouldn't feel satisfied. We have a lot more work to do in order to get this country and the economy moving in a way that benefits everybody, as opposed to just a few."
Mr. Obama batted away the idea that he was engaging in class warfare, saying his critics simply won't allow for "honest conversation" about income inequality and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
He said he had hoped in 2008 that both parties would set aside "old ideological baggage." But instead, he said, "Republicans made a different calculation, which was, 'You know what, we really screwed up the economy. Obama seems popular. Our best bet is to stand on the sidelines because we think the economy is going to get worse and at some point just blame him."
Mr. Obama also made his case for a second term, noting that his administration helped stave off another Depression, passed health care and financial reform, got rid of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy toward gays in the military, killed Osama Bin Laden and returned the economy to growth.
Mr. Obama likened himself to a sea captain navigating a ship through a bad storm. He said it was inevitable that people on the ship wouldn't enjoy the ride and would blame the captain.
As such, he said the question in next year's election is whether the Republicans present a more compelling vision that includes "cutting taxes further, including on the wealthy, cutting taxes on corporations, gutting regulations."
He added, "If the American people think that is a recipe for success, and a majority is persuaded by that, then I am going to lose."

HEADLINE: Let's Not Talk About Inequality

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican candidates would rather argue about debts and deficits. 

 BODY:
Conservatism's strength, its stress on the value of individual responsibility, is also its central weakness.
The right's claim that liberalism creates a deterrent to personal initiative and generates an ethos of dependency has resonated powerfully among white swing voters crucial to the ascendance of the Republican Party over the last four decades.
As the aftereffects of the financial collapse of 2008 continue to batter the nation with high unemployment and low growth, however, the conservative message has run into headwinds.
How does the laid-off 55-year-old factory employee "who worked hard and played by the rules," looking for a job in a market where there are 4.2 applicants for every opening, find comfort when he turns on the TV to see Newt Gingrich declare that "you've got to become more employable" or Mitt Romney arguing that 
the American people, edified by American principles, will rise to the occasion again, securing our safety, our prosperity and our peace. 
One of these principles is a merit-based society. In a merit-based society, people achieve success and rewards through hard work, education, risk taking and even a little luck.
The conservative response to crisis offered by Gingrich and Romney fails to address the anxiety and anger of those millions of Americans who suddenly find themselves with no job, no health insurance and no money to pay the mortgage.
This question will set the terms of the debate for the 2012 election.
With just over three weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3, the narrative of the right is under challenge from a competing narrative originating on the left, a narrative that describes an American economy sharply skewed towards the affluent, with rising inequality, a dwindling middle class and the persistence of long-term unemployment.
Describing the influence of the Occupy Wall Street movement on the electorate, Frank Luntz, a conservative consultant who specializes in framing political messages, told the Republican Governors Association meeting in Orlando on Nov. 30, "I'm so scared of this anti-Wall Street effort" because "they're having an impact on what the American people think of capitalism."
Luntz contended that shifting voter attitudes require Republican officials to carefully monitor and change their language. The public is now favorable to raising taxes on the rich, he said, but "if you talk about government taking the money from hardworking Americans, the public says no."
On the other side of the aisle, Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said in an interview that "2012 is going to be about two fundamentally different theories of the economy." In a Nov. 21 memo to Senator Charles Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Center, Garin wrote:
The success of the Republican Party in the 2010 midterm elections was based to a large extent on the ability of the Republicans, aided by the activism of the Tea Party movement, to focus voters' attention on an anti-government narrative that blamed the country's economic problems on excessive federal spending, the size of the national debt, and increased government involvement in the private economy. Recent polling, however, indicates that the Republican/Tea Party narrative about the economy has been superseded by a different narrative - one that emphasizes the need to address the growing gap between those at the very top of the economic ladder and the rest of the country.
Garin cited the findings of

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
A Romance With Risk That Brought On a Panic | Soon after taking the reins of MF Global in 2010, Jon S. Corzine visited the Wall Street firm's Chicago offices for the first time, and spent an hour questioning a broker about his bets, as other top executives from New York hovered impatiently nearby.
Although Mr. Corzine had been a United States senator, governor of New Jersey, co-head of Goldman Sachs and a confidant of leaders in Washington and Wall Street, he was at heart a trader, willing to gamble for a rich payoff.
Dozens of interviews reveal that Mr. Corzine played a much larger, hands-on role in the firm's high-stakes risk-taking than has previously been known.
An examination of company documents and interviews with regulators, former employees and others close to MF Global portray a chief executive convinced that he could quickly turn the money-losing firm into a miniature Goldman Sachs.
He pushed through a $6.3 billion bet on European debt - a wager big enough to wipe out the firm five times over if it went bad - despite concerns from other executives and board members. And it is now clear that he personally lobbied regulators and auditors about the strategy.

Trades Are Linked to Missing MF Global Funds | The trustee liquidating MF Global's brokerage unit has spotted suspicious trades in customer accounts that appear connected to a $1.2 billion shortfall, the trustee's lawyer said Friday.The lawyer, James Kobak, said at a hearing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that most of the transactions appeared to have taken place close to the weekend before MF Global filed for bankruptcy.Separately, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, Martin Glenn, approved a request by the trustee to pay out up to $2.2 billion to MF Global brokerage customers. The move by the trustee, James W. Giddens, would represent the return of about 72 percent of the fallen firm's customer accounts.

HEADLINE: Romney vs. Gingrich, Round II

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney throws the first jab, and Newt Gingrich swings back. 

 BODY:
LONDONDERRY, N.H. -- Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney both campaigned hard in New Hampshire on Monday, and the two Republican leaders in the polls looked like they could go 15 rounds before the day was finished. 
Mr. Romney threw the first jab, suggesting on Fox News in the morning that Mr. Gingrich return the nearly $2 million in consulting fees he earned from Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giant that some believe played a central role in the financial crisis. 
Asked about the comment by reporters during a visit to a defense contractor here, Mr. Gingrich counterpunched. "I love the way he and his consultants do these things,'' he said, a dig at Mr. Romney's more professional, well-organized operation. "I would just say that if Governor Romney would like to give back all the money he earned from bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years at Bain, that I would be glad to then listen to him.'' 
"And I'll bet you $10, not 10,000, that he won't take the offer,'' Mr. Gingrich added, a reference to the wager Mr. Romney offered Gov. Rick Perry in a debate Saturday night.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Debates

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Has the unprecedented number of debates might the Republican primary campaign less serious? 

 BODY:
Since my Sunday column takes on the idea that the Republican Party needs a candidate (i.e. Newt Gingrich) who can out-orate and out-debate the president, I should highlight Fred Barnes' piece making the case that the unprecedented number of G.O.P. debates has contributed to the policy unseriousness of the campaign to date:
With debates so frequent, peripheral candidates have no incentive to drop out. Fundraising, building an organization, developing policy papers-these aren't needed to qualify for debates. The willingness to show up is sufficient. For also-rans, availability is their strong suit.
Lining up the also-rans gives debate sponsors the leverage to persuade the more serious candidates to participate. Who would want to be represented by an empty chair in a debate watched by five or six million likely voters? Not Gingrich or Mitt Romney.
The debates have distracted the media from policy positions advanced by the candidates. Romney put out a 59-point economic plan. It got minimal attention. When he took a surprisingly bold position on entitlement reform, it too was mostly ignored. Attempting to outline his positions in 30 seconds or one minute would be a futile exercise.
Jon Huntsman brought up his impressive tax reform plan in the debates, but his media interrogators didn't bite. What did work was Herman Cain's catchy "9-9-9" tax scheme. It may not have stood up to scrutiny, but examination of a plan for reforming the tax code is impossible in a debate broken into 30-second or one-minute interventions.
There's truth to this, but I wouldn't want to push the argument too far. For all the limits of the "8 candidates on a stage" debate format, there is something to be said for having a forum in which the "also-rans" and "peripheral candidates" get a chance to confront the frontrunners without having to raise a fortune to buy TV time. In the 2008 Republican primaries, the debates served a valuable purpose in this regard: They helped both Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul break through, and in doing so helped make the primary debate more serious - mostly because Huckabee and Paul were willing to actually critique the record of the Bush administration (on the economy for Huckabee, on foreign policy for Paul), rather than dance around it as the leading candidates all tried to do. The fact that the the 2012 debates elevated Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, both of whom brought rather less to the table, suggests that the fault this time around lies as much in the candidates (and what G.O.P. voters seem to be looking for them) as it does in the debates and their moderators.
That said, Barnes is obviously right about the way that months and months of 3-minute replies and 30-second rebuttals tends to foreclose substantive discussion. The obvious way to operationalize that insight without losing the opportunity that a lengthy debate schedule offers to dark horses would be to hold more four-, three-, and even two-candidate forums (along the lines of the Lincoln-Douglas-style debates that Gingrich held with Herman Cain and is holding today with Jon Huntsman) in the months leading up to the primaries, and only put all the plausible contenders together in the last month or so, after some winnowing has taken place. This might mean debates, not fewer, but it would give candidates room to genuinely prove themselves, or else to be exposed. (I suspect that Rick Perry would have cratered sooner, rather than later, if he'd spent two hours isolated on stage with, say, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum.)
But this is probably a pipe dream, because the organizers want their debates to air on major networks, the networks want to invite many candidates as possible (for the same reason that movies like having as many big-name stars as possible), and nobody wants to get stuck airing a debate without all of the frontrunners on stage. Today's Gingrich-Huntsman debate will probably have more substance than Saturday's six-candidate free-for-all, but there's a reason that the latter is only airing on C-SPAN (and, yes, Jon2012.com).

HEADLINE: More 'Good Newt'

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Responding to flak from the left and right about my column praising Newt Gingrich's stance on immigration reform. 

 BODY:
In response to my column, "The Good Newt,"the incoming missiles are divided so far between readers on the right upset that I support a comprehensive reform of our immigration laws, and those on the left, appalled that I would say anything nice about Newt Gingrich. Also, some flak from readers who see a national ID card - which Gingrich and I consider a prerequisite for seriously enforcing our immigration laws - as the first step toward a police state.
First, Newt. I wrote that the idea of President Gingrich made me shudder, but that his willingness to take a serious stab at immigration reform put the rest of his party to shame. My favorite response came from an old friend in Virginia.
"I more than shudder at the thought of President Newt," he emailed. "It might make me move to Canada. I know. I've made that threat pretty much every four years since 1960, but this time I really mean it .Newt's a classic case of if you could buy him for what he's worth and sell him for what he thinks he's worth, you'd have more money than God. He's an intellectual in the same sense that singing along with Dylan, alone in my truck at 60 mph with the windows rolled down, makes me a musician." 
I assured my friend that praising Newt on the heathen-leftist NYT Op-Ed page was actually part of a sly plan to discredit the candidate among the Republican base. Shhh. Don't tell Iowa.
On immigration reform, though, Gingrich has done a brave thing by trying to come up with a solution that is not about bigger fences or massive deportations. He recognizes that the fundamentals of serious immigration reform include: more rigorous enforcement, which means a system for policing employment of those with no legal right to work here; forgiveness for some more rooted illegal immigrants if they pay a penalty; and a more open, better designed program of legal immigration, which fuels productivity, innovation and investment.
The details - especially of sorting out who among the 11 million undocumented immigrants already here gets to stay and under what conditions - are not easy. Smarter people than I have supplied lots of working material. (Those interested in what a humane but pragmatic reform might look like should read "Beside the Golden Door," a 2010 book by Pia M. Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny. Sadly, it's only in hard cover, and not cheap.)
Some of the criticism focused on my assertion that we are not being overrun, or dragged down, by illegal immigrants. Although the best available data show border enforcement is more rigorous than ever, illegal immigration flows are sharply down, and the total number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. has fallen since its peak in 2007, some people still view illegal immigration with alarm. As I wrote, that's an understandable perception if you are living in a community experiencing a recent spurt of illegal settlement. But the numbers from census counts and independent surveys are generally consistent: we are not under siege.
Others say the problem has only abated because we are in recession, and we face a new flood of illegal immigration when our economy recovers. It is true that fewer immigrants are coming because it's harder to find work here. (Also it is easier to find work in Mexico these days, as The Times has reported.
And we have doubled the size of the Border Patrol and reinforced it with National Guard.) And it is true that the American economy will not be forever in the depths of recession. The day will come when the U.S. job market again looks appealing to people from elsewhere. That's all the more reason to get a sensible policy in place, including a real (not just an aspirational) system for holding employers accountable.
By the way, it's possible that when our economy is generating jobs, there won't be quite as many foreign takers - at least not from Mexico, which is by far the largest source of illegal labor in the U.S. Not only is Mexico doing better at generating more jobs on its side of the border, as noted above, there has been a startling, steady decline in Mexican fertility rates since about 1970, meaning fewer young people looking for work, here or there. 
Finally, there are those who say there can be no legalization of those already here, because the law is the law. But in our system, we tend to separate the question of guilt from the question of punishment. We try to come up with punishments that fit the crime. It would be entirely consistent with our respect for the law to conclude that, at least in some cases, the proper punishment for coming here illegally was something less draconian than being uprooted, separated from family and community, and deported.
The question of a national ID is worth another column or two, and perhaps I will return to it at some point. If we want to control immigration, which most Americans believe is a right and an obligation, the best control is at the workplace, and that is virtually impossible unless we can reliably identify employees.
I understand the fears, some of them rooted in the Nazi Holocaust roundups or Stalin's purges, others associated with the keep-and-bear-arms movement: If the government knows who you are and where you live, they can come and get you. They can take your gun! If you have a number, (whether tattooed on your wrist or in a firearm registration database), you are vulnerable. The fact that many of the enlightened democracies of Europe issue internal passports has not entirely allayed these fears.
But these days, unless you make a conscious decision to live off the grid, the government already knows who you are and where you are - and so, curse it, does every retailer, political consultant and spam merchant. We live in a world of cookies and GPS and cell-phone towers and street-corner cameras. We buy apps to tell the world where we are on purpose. (Here's an interesting riff on living in the age of geo-location. )
You may feel disturbed by this or blase about it, but that's reality. Of course, if you work and pay taxes, you have a number - your Social Security number - which, being insecure against theft and forgery, is the cornerstone of identity theft. A biometric ID card does not significantly add to your exposure, and because it is forgery-proof (or as close as you can get) it means you can prove you are who you say you are.
Ironically, in the world's largest democracy, India, there is a project underway to create a biometric database as a boon to the disenfranchised poor - a universal identity document that will allow every Indian to have a bank account, access welfare benefits or get a cell phone. Here's a fascinating story about that debate.
They (capital T) already know where you are. What keeps us from being a police state is not that we can successfully hide from the police, but that as citizens we control them. Most of the time.

HEADLINE: Huntsman and Gingrich Square Off in Unmoderated Debate

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: In New Hampshire, Newt Gingrich and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. participated in a two-man unmoderated debate devoted to foreign policy and national security. 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - If Newt Gingrich is the Republican nominee and President Obama accepts his famous challenge to seven three-hour Lincoln-Douglas-style debates, viewers might find them only on C-SPAN and should plan to have plenty of black coffee on hand.
At least that was one take away from a two-man, unmoderated debate of a mere 90 minutes between Mr. Gingrich and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who at one point, when asked if he had more to add, said, "I see my daughter nodding off, so let's move on.''
Devoted to foreign policy and national security, the debate on Monday was set to include 10 topics. In true graduate-seminar style, the candidates covered only half the ground. 
It was an unusual hiatus from the Republican nominating race that has reached a phase of high drama with much at stake for the fractured field. But none of that urgency or competition seeped into the auditorium at St. Anselm's College, where Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Huntsman were unfailingly collegial, seeming to agree on almost all points. 
Mr. Huntsman, the former Utah governor who is so far behind the rest of the field in national polls that he was excluded from an ABC debate on Saturday in Iowa, missed a chance to sharply define himself thanks to the high profile foil of Mr. Gingrich, who drew a large news media contingent. 
Mr. Huntsman even seemed to make a joke at his own expense. "If the good speaker becomes the nominee, he'll have to overcome our very formidable operation on the ground here in New Hampshire,'' he said. 
Both men displayed wide knowledge of world events. Speaking on China, where he recently was American ambassador, Mr. Huntsman spoke in Mandarin while citing what officials used to tell him, then translated it as, "In China, we have politics too.''
"They used to say that to me too,'' Mr. Gingrich said. "I never knew what it meant.''
Both candidates agreed that terrorism was a long-term threat. Mr. Gingrich compared it to the decades-long Cold War. Mr. Huntsman said, "As far as the eye can see in the 21st century we have a terror problem.''
The subject that generated the most intense discussion was a nuclear Iran. "All options need to be on the table and mullahs need to know,'' Mr. Huntsman said. 
Mr. Gingrich: "The idea you'll wage a bombing campaign to take out all of Iran's nuclear program is a fantasy.'' 
"You have to say to the Iranians you dismantle your program or we start to takes steps that will stop you,'' Mr. Gingrich said. "Serious economic steps, serious political and psychological and diplomatic steps.'' He suggested a gasoline embargo because the country, despite oil reserves, has only one refinery and imports 40 percent of its gasoline. 
There was discussion of Israel, but Mr. Gingrich did not repeat recent controversial remarks about the legitimacy of the Palestinian cause.
Other topics covered included debt and defense spending, the Arab Spring and Pakistan. After an hour and a half, when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined, the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief. 
But both candidates pronounced themselves pleased with the format. "This is what we should have a lot more of,'' Mr. Gingrich said, "because this is very substantive.'' 
Mr. Huntsman got in the subtlest of jabs by referring to a year-end debate that Donald Trump plans to moderate. Mr. Gingrich has agreed to attend, but Mr. Huntsman has turned it down, saying recently that he would not "kiss the ring" of Mr. Trump.
"I can't wait to compare and contrast this format with the Donald Trump debate with the speaker,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Reid Vows to Keep Republicans in Town

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate majority leader says he will block votes on bill to finance the government until Democrats get a bill they like on extending payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance, 

 BODY:
In league with President Obama, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, served notice to Congressional Republicans late Monday that he will prevent final votes on a must-pass bill to finance government operations until Congress approves a measure to Democrats' liking that extends a payroll tax cut and unemployment assistance.
With the Republican-controlled House expected to pass an alternative payroll-tax measure on Tuesday that Democrats oppose, Democratic leaders fear that Republican lawmakers will leave town for the year as soon as Congress approves a fiscal year 2012 spending package that is nearing bipartisan agreement. That would leave Democrats with the choice of accepting Republicans' version of the payroll tax-cut bill or else taking the blame when the current tax cut for 160 million American workers lapses after Dec. 31.
To check any such Republican power play by the House, Mr. Obama phoned Mr. Reid on Sunday, aides said. By late Monday, Democrats had hatched their move to exploit their control of the other two legislative power centers, the Senate and the White House. Mr. Reid called Speaker John A. Boehner and said he would not hold a vote this week on the government-spending package -- assuming the parties complete negotiations on it -- until there was a resolution of the payroll tax and unemployment compensation issues.
Mr. Reid is expected to seek a weeklong stopgap spending bill to keep the government running past Friday, when the current spending measure expires, raising the prospect of partisan brinkmanship right up to the Christmas holiday.
"When the president said Congressional Republicans weren't going on vacation until they passed this middle class tax cut, he meant it," a senior administration official wrote in an e-mail. "They don't get to finish their business until the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance are extended."
At issue is Mr. Obama's proposal to offset the cost of another year of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment aid with a multiyear surtax on annual income above $1 million. While Republicans are divided over extending the tax cut and jobless aid, they are nearly united in opposing the so-called millionaires' surtax, prompting Mr. Obama and Democrats to accuse them of favoring the rich over everyone else.
House Republican leaders have proposed paying for the roughly $120 billion cost of the payroll tax cut in 2012 mainly with spending cuts affecting federal workers and with higher out-of-pocket costs for affluent Medicare beneficiaries. But their bill also would require Mr. Obama to decide whether to authorize the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast, a project that splits unions eager for jobs from environmentalists fearful of pollution. Mr. Obama shelved the application until after the election and has suggested he would veto a bill that includes the unrelated pipeline provision.
A Senate Democratic aide who, like the White House official, declined to be identified discussing political strategy, emphasized that the parties remained apart on a number of issues in the government spending bill - mostly issues not of money but of policy riders that Republicans want to attach to secure conservatives' votes, like curbs on women's health care and environmental programs. But a House Republican aide late Monday said the two sides had shaken hands on a deal.

HEADLINE: Romney's Run Puts a Spotlight on Private Equity

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's experience at Bain Capital is being searched by his critics for ammunition in the presidential campaign, and by others for clues as to how he would perform as president. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, will attend fund-raisers in Manhattan given by his former private equity peers and Wall Street bankers, putting the spotlight on the private equity industry and Mr. Romney's role in it.
Mr. Romney, a co-founder of Bain Capital, will spend time at the sprawling Park Avenue apartment of his former rival and sometime deal partner, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group. He will also be toasted at the Waldorf Astoria by James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who helped orchestrate many of the private equity industry's biggest deals, along with a smattering of other senior executives from the bank.
(Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive and a longtime Democrat, will not be among them; as a board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he is prohibited from raising money for political candidates, and it is still unclear which candidate he will support.)
While the fund-raisers are likely to generate many thousands of dollars and galvanize support among Mr. Romney's former peers, they may also give an opening to critics like the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Already, Americans United for Change, a pro-union Democratic group, has begun a campaign comparing Mr. Romney to Gordon Gekko, the Michael Douglas character in "Wall Street." It has even started a Web site, RomneyGekko.com.
The private equity industry's titans have long been worried this moment would come - and about the effect Mr. Romney's presidential campaign will have on the industry.
"If he is a nominee, well, hold your seats," Henry Kravis, the co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, told a room of executives at a dinner in Hong Kong last month, according to Reuters.
"They're going to describe us all as asset strippers; we're flippers of assets, we just put on a lot of debt, fire a lot of people and that's how we make money," he added. "You know that's not the case. That's absolutely not what we do."
"There is no doubt that the Obama administration will clearly come out after Mitt Romney and the whole private equity industry," Mr. Kravis said. "Mitt Romney may become the single source of all U.S. unemployment by the time the election happens."
A looming issue for the private equity industry is the tax treatment of what is known as carried interest. Private equity executives pay only the capital gains rate - 15 percent - on most of their income instead of the ordinary income rate, which in their case would typically be 35 percent.
So far, however, Mr. Romney has managed to dodge most efforts to brand him as a true Gordon Gekko. And the private equity industry has managed to avoid becoming the focal point of criticism, which instead has been directed at the Wall Street banks.
The crucial question is whether that will change as the campaign becomes more heated. Already, Republican rivals like Newt Gingrich are seizing on his track record at Bain Capital. On Monday, Mr. Gingrich suggested that Mr. Romney "give back all the money he earned from bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years at Bain."
But Mr. Romney appears to have kept a studied distance from the most current Gilded Age. A profile of Mr. Romney in The New York Times on Sunday about his relationship with money described a penny-pinching cheapskate who enjoyed flying on JetBlue and frowned upon ostentatious displays of wealth - hardly the lavish spending habits of some of private equity's current kingpins. (Mr. Romney does, however, have a soft spot for real estate.)
In truth, while Mr. Romney may be worth several hundred million dollars, he is a pauper next to the founders of the biggest firms since he left the industry in 1999, well before the bubble of the next decade that produced billion-dollar riches.
Mr. Romney's opponents, of course, have combed through his former deals at Bain looking for tales of excesses and failure. Perhaps the worst deal he worked on - which has been highlighted by several news organizations - was the buyout of Dade International, a medical company, which filed for bankruptcy after Bain had cashed out with $242 million.
But criticism about the Dade deal has not stuck as a true talking point, in part because the details painted a complicated story.
Dade was on the verge of bankruptcy when Bain originally bought the company. While Mr. Romney made cuts at the company, he also invested heavily, turning it into the industry leader. At one point, he pushed back against colleagues who wanted to flip the business for a quick profit and instead directed them to make an acquisition to bolster it.
It was only after Dade had been turned around that Bain and the company's other investors leveraged the company up even more and paid themselves a huge dividend, saddling the company with too much debt.
Some critics contend that private equity firms are skilled at cutting costs at businesses but can choke off growth with large amounts of debt. In the context of the government's budget, Mr. Romney's embrace of streamlining may just be what's in order, but it still poses political challenges.
Mr. Romney's former colleagues are quietly waiting to see whether he will try to leverage - pun very much intended - his role at Bain in his campaign or will continue to shy away from it.
While Mr. Romney often invokes his broad experience at Bain, he has typically avoided getting into the details of the private equity business, seemingly to avoid the negative connotation that the industry has for some Americans.
But given the clear bipartisan sense that the United States government is marred by inefficiency and is in need of a turnaround, it will be interesting to see whether he tries to highlight the details of his private equity work as a way to demonstrate how he would run the country.
In 2007, Mr. Romney famously said of his private equity work that "sometimes the medicine is a little bitter, but it is necessary to save the life of the patient."
Some critics have taken that quotation to suggest he is a heartless mercenary. Others have said that the nation may need a dose of the same kind of medicine.
How well Mr. Romney manages those perceptions may determine whether private equity makes it into the White House.

HEADLINE: Rating Agency Warnings Bring Down the Markets

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Christine Hauser from New York. Reporting was contributed by Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Stephen Castle from Brussels, and David Jolly from Paris.

 BODY:
PARIS -- The market euphoria over last week's deal by European leaders to shore up the euro currency union succumbed to a darker mood Monday.
In European trading and on Wall Street, stocks fell sharply after Moody's Investors Service and the Fitch Ratings agency warned that political efforts to protect the euro had not resolved the immediate dangers of a significant economic downturn in the region and troubles in the banking system.
And the yield, or interest rate, on the 10-year Italian government bond -- perhaps the most crucial barometer of the euro crisis -- rose to 6.5 percent, heading back into a range that could make it hard for Italy to pay off its staggering debts.
Also pulling down stocks, the chip maker Intel said before trading began in New York that its fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected because of supply shortages of hard disk drives, as a result of flood damage to factories in Thailand. Intel now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $13.4 billion to $14 billion, down from a previous forecast of $14.2 billion to $15.2 billion. 
Shares of Intel, a component of the Dow, lost 4 percent, to close at $24.
Hank Smith, the chief investment officer for Haverford Trust, said the combination of the Intel announcement and downbeat reassessments of the European summit meeting were too much for investors to digest.
''All of that just breeds uncertainty and I think you are just seeing that reflected in the market,'' he said.
Fitch warned Monday that European politicians were taking a ''gradualist'' approach to creating a true fiscal union among the 17 euro zone member nations -- a protracted effort that Fitch said would impose additional economic and financial burdens on the region. ''It means the crisis will continue at varying levels of intensity throughout 2012 and probably beyond,'' the agency said.
Moody's said it was putting the sovereign ratings of European Union countries on review for a possible downgrade in the coming months. Standard & Poor's issued a similar warning last week, saying it could lower the sterling credit ratings of Germany and France and cut other countries' credit scores as Europe headed into a probable recession next year.
Cuts in credit ratings for crucial euro zone countries could play havoc with financing European bailout plans.
In United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.49 percent, or 18.72 points, to 1,236.47. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.34 percent, or 162.87 points, to 12,021.39. The Nasdaq composite index lost 1.31 percent, or 34.59 points, to 2,612.26.
American financial stocks as a group were off more than 3 percent, dragged down by Morgan Stanley's 6 percent plunge, to $15.38, and Citigroup's 5 percent drop, to $27.22.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 99 27/32, and the yield fell to 2.02 percent from 2.06 percent late Friday.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed down 3.1 percent, while the FTSE 100 in London fell 1.8 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt lost 3.4 percent and the CAC in Paris fell 2.6 percent.
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France acknowledged Monday that a loss of the nation's triple-A rating could come soon, but said it would not pose an ''insurmountable'' difficulty. Mr. Sarkozy has made it a priority of his coming presidential campaign to keep the country's top credit rating, and repeated a pledge to reduce the nation's debt and deficit without cutting wages and pensions.
Mr. Sarkozy's rival, the Socialist candidate Francois Hollande, said Monday that he would try to renegotiate the terms of the European deal struck Friday if he were elected president in May, saying the pact would stifle growth.
With markets and rating agencies expressing disappointment with last week's Brussels deal, the spotlight returned to the European Central Bank, the only institution with overall responsibility for maintaining the health and integrity of the euro.
Amid last week's political theater, the central bank took a crucial step to help the biggest European commercial banks by agreeing to provide them with unlimited funds for up to three years.
While that may ease the pressure on the financial system, any further downgrade in the credit rating of European governments could escalate the crisis by making it more expensive for the weakest countries to service their debts. It could also make it more difficult for banks in Italy, Spain and even France to get credit from other banks, causing a potential pullback in lending to consumers and businesses at a time when economic growth is already being squeezed.
''No one has talked about what the euro zone's growth strategy is, but economic growth is what does most of the eroding of debt,'' said Richard Batty, an investment strategist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.
Carl B. Weinberg, the chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said some European banks, which had already been selling assets to keep enough money on hand, were now also cutting back on lending. ''A contraction of credit has already begun and will get worse,'' he said.
Many governments and investors still cling to hope that the central bank will ride to the rescue by buying the bonds of troubled governments in Italy and Spain, in an effort to keep their borrowing costs from rising to levels that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to take international bailouts.
But Germany has opposed the move as being outside the bank's mandate. Mario Draghi, the central bank president, made clear last week that the central bank was loath to take such steps.
Keeping the heat on Italy, Spain and Portugal to limit their borrowing, the central bank last week reduced its bond purchases of government debt, according to data disclosed Monday. The bank spent 635 million euros ($850 million) buying bonds on the open market, down from 3.7 billion euros the previous week.
Bond trading is typically thin in December, so the central bank probably saw less need to intervene.
Still, the total since the European Central Bank began buying government bonds last year stands at 207.5 billion euros -- only about a tenth of what the United States Federal Reserve has spent as part of its effort to bolster American growth by adding to the money supply.
Moody's warned Monday that the longer policy makers took an incremental approach to the crisis, ''the greater the likelihood of more severe scenarios, including those involving multiple defaults by euro area countries and those additionally involving exits from the euro area.''
In Brussels, one potential legal snag arose Monday with the fiscal compact that most European Union members agreed to last week. The agreement calls for tightening the enforcement rules against countries that exceed budget deficit limits of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Fully initiating that plan, however, might require changes to the European Union's governing treaty, which would require parliamentary approvals beyond the scope of the deal reached in Brussels last week, according to European officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.
But Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said that most of the changes could be enforced.
''The results of this summit are better than first meets the eye,'' he said, adding that people ''should not underestimate its potential to fundamentally change the landscape of fiscal and economic policy making in Europe.''

HEADLINE: On a Long Train Trip, Rare Pleasures Return

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I TRAVELED from Tampa, Fla., to Manhattan over the weekend. What a pleasure! Nobody hollered at me to sit down or turn off my electronic devices. Nobody warned me to obey all instructions from crew members.
''I didn't get treated like a terrorist,'' a man sipping a beer told me en route.
''Nobody patted me down,'' added a woman, who joined the conversation. 
O.K., the trip did take 26 hours, because it was by train -- as opposed to more than two hours by air. I was experimenting with taking a long-distance train rather than flying. Would I do it again as a business traveler?
It depends. Clearly, a train on shorter-haul routes, like Amtrak's Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, makes great sense. But 26 hours to travel is a lot of time. I did rationalize it partly, though, by noting that I have to sleep anyway, and arriving at Penn Station in the heart of Manhattan is itself a significant convenience compared with arriving at the airport.
Given the length of the trip, I reserved a sleeper compartment. The private sleeper had two comfortable seats that could fold down into a bunk bed and a second bunk that ratcheted toward the ceiling when not in use. It also had a toilet, sink, a work table and an electrical outlet.
The fare was $480.80, which included four meals in the adjacent dining car. By comparison, one-way nonstop airline fares on that route ranged from $248 to $301 this week.
''We're seeing more business travelers, usually on trips of about 500 miles but sometimes even all the way to New York,'' said Dennis M. Lyons, an Amtrak product development officer. I ran into him at Union Station in Tampa as I was boarding the Silver Star, which travels about 1,500 miles from Miami to New York, with brief stops at about 20 cities along the way.
The Silver Star, one of more than a dozen of Amtrak's long-haul trains, carried about 393,000 passengers in 2010, up 6 percent from 2009, Amtrak says.
Before boarding, I was skeptical about this adventure, but I have to report that the trip was more civilized than air travel and worth it this one time. The dining car menus offer a good range of selections. Communal dining -- that is, you're seated at a small table with strangers -- was a nice change from the general social alienation of air travel.
Early the next morning, incidentally, I was astonished when the sleeper car's affable porter, Thomas Clemo, tapped on my door to deliver The New York Times, one in a bundle that had been picked up at a stop in North Carolina.
Train travel has been much in the news lately, and the news is not good. For one thing, a consensus has developed, driven both by politics and simple economic reality, that America is probably not ready anytime soon to follow the lead of Europe and Asia in developing high-speed rail.
Congressional Republicans and others have been attacking various proposed rail projects as expensive boondoggles. In Florida, for example, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, rejected federal financing and scuttled a proposed $2 billion high-speed rail line between Orlando and Tampa, saying its costs were unrealistic.
In California, public support is declining for a proposed 520-mile high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco that would cost an estimated $98 billion to build. And about a year ago, New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie, canceled a project to build a rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would have cost an estimated $8.7 billion.
Opponents of the huge spending required to achieve networks of high-speed trains argue that costs aside, none of the proposed projects, including one between Chicago and Detroit, would yield true high-speed trains, which travel at speeds above 150 miles an hour.
The one location where there is bipartisan support for at least an attempt at better-speed rail (if not true high-speed) is the Northeast Corridor, where trains on the 437-mile route from Washington to Boston attract more than a third of Amtrak's national ridership. On that route, however, even Amtrak's sleek Acela trains average speeds of a mere 75 miles an hour.
Because of population density and extensive urban transportation connections, the Northeast corridor is the ''one region of the United States where high-speed rail makes the most sense,'' Representative John L. Mica, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said in hearings last week. Still, given shrinking Amtrak subsidies, it isn't clear even on the Northeast Corridor if track and other improvements can be made to speed things up.
Meanwhile, the heavily subsidized long-haul trains have passionate supporters. From a single trip on a long-haul train, I don't know whether I'd call myself passionate, but I was certainly a happy customer, given that I was in no rush.
''You all have a good night now,'' Kathy Raines, the helpful Amtrak employee who worked the lounge car said as a small group of us headed back to our compartments for the night.
I slept well in my bunk with the gentle sway of the car. My ear never heard the mournful wail that the sad ballads claim for a train whistle. Instead, I heard soft chords that reminded me more of Duke Ellington's rhythms as the Silver Star sped up the coast through the dark.

HEADLINE: For Crossing Built Long Ago, No End to the Repairs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
On Monday, the Henry Hudson Bridge - that triumphalist crossing over the Harlem River, a steel archway slicing through a verdant vista of water, trees and cliffs - celebrates its diamond anniversary, the 75th. And like many older citizens of New York City, the bridge has had its share of wear-and-tear.
It is one of the least-used bridges in the region's arsenal, but its operations have piled up over the years, closing lanes and upsetting commuters bound for the many gilded Westchester County suburbs it serves. 
One Manhattan-bound lane was shut down for a 43-month period that ended in June 2010, during which the entire Depression-era lower deck was replaced. Eleven months later, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began a new rehabilitation, this time to replace the steel support ropes, which will require a round-the-clock shutdown of a Bronx-bound lane for the next three years.
In fact, the bridge has been, more or less, continually under construction since 2000, at a cost of around $160 million, twice the inflation-adjusted price tag of the original bridge.
''As you would expect, a 75-year-old span needs to be maintained,'' said Judie Glave, a spokeswoman at the transportation authority. The reality is that much of New York's crucial infrastructure is increasingly in need of expensive upkeep. The Henry Hudson Parkway was created as a picturesque thoroughfare for weekend riders (and a few Riverdale commuters), and, at the time, about 9,000 cars traversed the crossing daily. This year, that number reached 63,000.
No tolls were charged for the bridge's first two days of operation, and at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 14, 1936, when a small white truck became the first vehicle to pay for the privilege of enjoying the bridge's sweeping views, the charge was a mere dime. But the bridge's health care costs, and a lack of infrastructure financing from state legislators, can add up: the toll has risen from a dime to the $2.20 charge levied on E-ZPass users today. (The bridge is also the crossing where the transportation authority started using gateless tolls.)
A lodestar of the era of automobile expansionism, and only the second of Robert Moses' major crossings to be completed, the Henry Hudson Bridge was nevertheless unveiled without pomp, in a quiet ceremony on the foggy afternoon of Dec. 11, 1936.
In an uncharacteristically selfless statement, Moses doffed his hat to the ''scores of citizens, distinguished and nameless'' who had helped plan the redevelopment of Manhattan's then-moribund West Side, an inhospitable stretch of shipyards, train tracks and swampland, which he hoped would be revitalized by its new link to the Bronx and Westchester County.
But the master planner did not skimp on taking credit.
''If we make any claim,'' Moses said, ''it is that we have had the gumption to translate plan into reality. It cannot be said too often that what New York needs today is not vision, with which we have always been plentifully endowed in the past, but elbow grease.''
What Moses omitted in his brief remarks were the fraught origins of a bridge that cut through the previously isolated and untouched parkland of northern Manhattan and the western Bronx. Inwood Hill Park, with its pastoral overlooks onto the Hudson River, was considered ''virgin forest,'' as one report put it at the time, a last bastion of ''wild Manhattan.''
Moses, of course, was rarely known to let sentiment stand in the way of cold pragmatism. Earlier plans for a bridge at the site had been nixed by environmental groups, and one proposal in the 1930s called for the route to curve east, around Fort Tryon and Inwood Hill Parks, and cross the Harlem River at grade level, bypassing the forested area.
But building directly through the park had a distinct advantage in Moses' eyes: it would allow him access to the vast federal subsidies available at the time for ''park access roads.'' The government would pay for a significant portion of the project, as long as it bisected Inwood Hill. If the highway remained on the city's streets, the plan would cost far more and require an onerous process of eminent domain.
As he would time and again, Moses had his way. The New York Times, in its coverage at the time, did not ignore the autocratic tendencies of the man who brought the bridge to fruition: it noted archly that Moses ''is also the one-man Henry Hudson Parkway Authority.''
But The Times's editorial writers also offered a measured endorsement of Moses' controversial methods. One man, the paper wrote, had been handed ''the job of creating a unified park, parkway and arterial highway system for the entire city.''
''In this instance,'' the paper continued, ''the end has gloriously justified the means.''
News of the new link to the Bronx was overshadowed by a surprising announcement from England: King Edward VIII had decided to abdicate. A radio set was wheeled into the Fort Tryon Park restaurant where dignitaries, including Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, were enjoying a buffet dinner in honor of the bridge.
''The mayor nodded in agreement when Edward declared that he could not continue 'without the help and support of the woman I love,' and applauded loudly at the end of the speech,'' The Times wrote. ''It was a beautiful speech, a beautiful speech,'' La Guardia said.
Our transit reporter, Michael M. Grynbaum, advises you on the latest chatter from the city's roads and rails. Check back every Monday. Got a tip? He can be reached at OffTheRails@nytimes.com

HEADLINE: Profits and Questions at Online Charter Schools

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
By almost every educational measure, the Agora Cyber Charter School is failing.
Nearly 60 percent of its students are behind grade level in math. Nearly 50 percent trail in reading. A third do not graduate on time. And hundreds of children, from kindergartners to seniors, withdraw within months after they enroll.
By Wall Street standards, though, Agora is a remarkable success that has helped enrich K12 Inc., the publicly traded company that manages the school. And the entire enterprise is paid for by taxpayers.
Agora is one of the largest in a portfolio of similar public schools across the country run by K12. Eight other for-profit companies also run online public elementary and high schools, enrolling a large chunk of the more than 200,000 full-time cyberpupils in the United States. 
The pupils work from their homes, in some cases hundreds of miles from their teachers. There is no cafeteria, no gym and no playground. Teachers communicate with students by phone or in simulated classrooms on the Web. But while the notion of an online school evokes cutting-edge methods, much of the work is completed the old-fashioned way, with a pencil and paper while seated at a desk.
Kids mean money. Agora is expecting income of $72 million this school year, accounting for more than 10 percent of the total anticipated revenues of K12, the biggest player in the online-school business. The second-largest, Connections Education, with revenues estimated at $190 million, was bought this year by the education and publishing giant Pearson for $400 million.
The business taps into a formidable coalition of private groups and officials promoting nontraditional forms of public education. The growth of for-profit online schools, one of the more overtly commercial segments of the school choice movement, is rooted in the theory that corporate efficiencies combined with the Internet can revolutionize public education, offering high quality at reduced cost.
The New York Times has spent several months examining this idea, focusing on K12 Inc. A look at the company's operations, based on interviews and a review of school finances and performance records, raises serious questions about whether K12 schools -- and full-time online schools in general -- benefit children or taxpayers, particularly as state education budgets are being slashed.
Instead, a portrait emerges of a company that tries to squeeze profits from public school dollars by raising enrollment, increasing teacher workload and lowering standards.
Current and former staff members of K12 Inc. schools say problems begin with intense recruitment efforts that fail to filter out students who are not suited for the program, which requires strong parental commitment and self-motivated students. Online schools typically are characterized by high rates of withdrawal.
Teachers have had to take on more and more students, relaxing rigor and achievement along the way, according to interviews. While teachers do not have the burden of a full day of classes, they field questions from families, monitor students' progress and review and grade schoolwork. Complaints about low pay and high class loads -- with some high school teachers managing more than 250 students -- have prompted a unionization battle at Agora, which has offices in Wayne, Pa.
A look at a forthcoming study by researchers at Western Michigan University and the National Education Policy Center shows that only a third of K12's schools achieved adequate yearly progress, the measurement mandated by federal No Child Left Behind legislation.
Some teachers at K12 schools said they felt pressured to pass students who did little work. Teachers have also questioned why some students who did no class work were allowed to remain on school rosters, potentially allowing the company to continue receiving public money for them. State auditors found that the K12-run Colorado Virtual Academy counted about 120 students for state reimbursement whose enrollment could not be verified or who did not meet Colorado residency requirements. Some had never logged in.
''What we're talking about here is the financialization of public education,'' said Alex Molnar, a research professor at the University of Colorado Boulder School of Education who is affiliated with the education policy center. ''These folks are fundamentally trying to do to public education what the banks did with home mortgages.''
The online companies can tailor their programs by reducing curriculum and teachers. During a presentation at the Virginia legislature this year, a representative of Connections explained that its services were available at three price points per student:
Option A: $7,500, a student-teacher ratio of 35-40 to 1, and an average teacher salary of $45,000.
Option B: $6,500, a student-teacher ratio of 50 to 1, with less experienced teachers paid $40,000.
Option C: $4,800 and a student-teacher ratio of 60 to 1, as well as a narrower curriculum.
Despite lower operating costs, the online companies collect nearly as much taxpayer money in some states as brick-and-mortar charter schools. In Pennsylvania, about 30,000 students are enrolled in online schools at an average cost of about $10,000 per student. The state auditor general, Jack Wagner, said that is double or more what it costs the companies to educate those children online.
''It's extremely unfair for the taxpayer to be paying for additional expenses, such as advertising,'' Mr. Wagner said. Much of the public money also goes toward lobbying state officials, an activity that Ronald J. Packard, chief executive of K12, has called a ''core competency'' of the company.
In all, for-profit educational management companies run 79 online schools around the country, according to the study by researchers at Western Michigan University.
Many educators believe there is a place for full-time virtual learning for children whose pace is extremely accelerated or those with behavioral or other issues, like teenage mothers who need to stay home with their babies. But for most children, particularly in the elementary grades, the school experience should not be replaced with online learning, they say.
''The early development of children requires lots of interaction with other children for purposes of socialization, developing collaboration and teamwork, and self-definition,'' said Irving Hamer Jr., deputy superintendent of Memphis city schools.
In an interview at K12's headquarters in Herndon, Va., Mr. Packard said, ''We're here to help children, and that is our overriding purpose and we want to do it as well and efficiently as possible.''
He acknowledged what he called a ''degradation'' in K12's test scores, but he argued that they are an inaccurate measure because many students are already behind when they arrive. ''The type of child now coming to an online school, 75 percent of those kids coming in are behind more than one grade level,'' Mr. Packard said.
He said K12 continues to invest in its curriculum and has developed interventions, like a remedial math program, to help struggling students.
''Kids have been shackled to their brick-and-mortar school down the block for too long,'' Mr. Packard has said repeatedly, adding that for the first time, every child, regardless of where he or she lives, has a choice.
Some educators are questioning its value. ''It's choice,'' said Thomas L. Seidenberger, superintendent of the East Penn School District in Pennsylvania, which is outperforming Agora and other online schools its students attend. ''What about a bad choice?'''
The Cost
The original pitchman for K12 was William J. Bennett, the former education secretary who helped found the company in 2000. At the time, Mr. Bennett said he viewed online schools as a haven for shy children, those worried about being exposed to drugs and even those with ''terrible acne.''
The company planned to sell an education package directly to parents who wanted to home-school their children. But within months, K12 had decided to tap into public education dollars.
As the company's product has become more popular, the cost has soared.
Mr. Bennett, who left the company in 2005, originally said a home-schooling package would cost about $1,000 per student per year. Parents who wanted teacher support would pay more.
Today, K12 receives an average of $5,500 to $6,000 per student from state and local governments. The schools also receive money for federal programs.
Because online schools do not collect every type of financing that goes to traditional public schools, Mr. Packard contends that his company's schools, on a national average, cost taxpayers 40 percent less per student.
But online schools have negligible building costs and cheaper labor costs, partly because they pay teachers low wages, records and interviews show. Parents, called ''learning coaches,'' do much of the teaching, prompting critics to argue that states are essentially subsidizing home schooling.
''Any high school student taking economics could immediately recognize the fundamental flaws in their pricing structure,'' said John E. Freund III, a Pennsylvania lawyer who represents a number of districts who are losing students to the online schools and the public financing that goes with them.
Because many states prohibit for-profit public education, the management companies for virtual schools run schools under contract with public districts or nonprofit charter schools, which also receive public money. But companies like K12 are almost fully in charge -- devising curriculum, hiring teachers and principals and evaluating student performance.
Another way K12 maximizes its income is to establish schools in poor districts, which receive larger subsidies in some states. The company administers one of K12's newest schools from Union County, Tenn., a mountainous Appalachian enclave where nearly a quarter of the residents live in poverty.
The Tennessee Virtual Academy is technically part of the local school district, which receives more per pupil from the state than most other districts in Tennessee. But of the school's 1,800 pupils, few are actually from Union County.
Out of the state money, the Union County schools will get an administrative fee of about $400,000. K12 stands to collect almost $10 million to staff and manage the school. Dozens of other Tennessee counties, however, lost state financing when some of their students elected to go to the virtual school.
The online schools have enabled entrepreneurs like Michael R. Milken, whose company Knowledge Universe started K12 a decade ago and who remains an investor, to use education as a source of government-financed business, much as military contractors have capitalized on Pentagon spending.
Mr. Packard reports to investors every year with higher enrollment numbers and sales. On Nov. 15, he announced that the company's online schools had enrolled more than 94,000 students. ''I think online schools are becoming more mainstream,'' said Mr. Packard, who was paid $5 million this year.
A sizable portion of the public money collected by K12 is rolled back into generating more business, a common practice by for-profit companies that nevertheless raises questions when the money is intended to educate schoolchildren. K12 spent $26.5 million on advertising in 2010, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by Kantar Media.
''Some of the cyber charter schools have fairly aggressive recruitment campaigns,'' said Jim Buckheit, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. ''They have vans, billboards, TV and radio ads. They set up recruitment meetings in area hotels and invite parents to come.''
K12 has run thousands of the sessions, where part of the pitch is supplying computers and subsidized Internet connections for qualifying families. Dr. Seidenberger said he was surprised to see ads for online schools in the outfield at Coca-Cola Park, the stadium of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs minor league baseball team.
The Churn
Parents who become interested in K12's schools can follow up by calling 866 numbers, which connect them to a call center in Herndon.
School employees who have visited the center have described a high-pressured sales environment aimed at one thing: enrollment.
Some workers, called ''enrollment pals,'' are paid bonuses based on the number of students they sign up, according to former employees knowledgeable of the operations. Mr. Packard's annual bonus is also partly tied to enrollment.
Because the online schools are public, students cannot legally be denied enrollment. But former K12 employees said the aggressive and impersonal enrollment process lures students who are not a good fit.
''When you have the television and the Xbox and no parental figure at home, sometimes it's hard to do your schoolwork,'' said one Agora teacher, who asked not to be identified because of concerns over job safety.
The constant cycle of enrollment and withdrawal, called the churn rate, appears to be a problem at many schools. Records Agora filed with Pennsylvania reveal that 2,688 students withdrew during the 2009-10 school year. At the same time, K12 continued to sign up new students. Enrollment at the end of the year -- 4,890 -- was 170 students more than at the beginning, obscuring the high number of withdrawals.
Gary Miron, a professor of education at Western Michigan University who researches for-profit school management companies, called the turnover troubling. ''The kids enroll. You get the money, the kids disappear,'' he said.
A review of K12 management contracts reveals that the company may still benefit from students who end up leaving. Under its contracts with some charter schools, K12 charges ''upfront'' fees for books and other supplies.
According to an Agora price list for the 2009-10 school year, K12's upfront billings for elementary and middle school students were $60 a course for online services, $75 a course for materials and $75 per student for computers. With students frequently enrolled in six courses, the fees could surpass $800.
Under some of K12's contracts, only a portion of the fees would be returned if students withdrew quickly. Mr. Packard has said the company does not make money if students leave because of the cost of the materials and shipping.
The state audit of the Colorado Virtual Academy, which found that the state paid for students who were not attending the school, ordered the reimbursement of more than $800,000.
With retention a problem, some teachers said they were under pressure to pass students with marginal performance and attendance.
Students need simply to log in to be marked present for the day, according to Agora teachers and administrators.
For most students, attendance is recommended but not mandatory at what are called synchronous sessions -- when they can interact online with the teacher. A new grading policy states that students who do not turn in work will be given a ''50'' rather than a zero. Several teachers said assignments were frequently open for unlimited retakes.
Agora records from last year show that failing students were told they could make up their work. ''All students with a course average of 40 to 59 percent were called and told all assignments past due could be made up without penalty,'' according to minutes from a school board meeting. Similar calls were going out to students with averages of 0 to 39 percent.
Theresa Henderson, an Agora teacher until June 2010 and the mother of four of its students, said she was among faculty members who requested a stronger policy to dismiss students who were not doing their work.
Several current and former staff members said that a lax policy had allowed students to remain on the rolls even when they failed to log in for days. Officials of the Elizabeth Forward School District in western Pennsylvania complained that Agora had billed the district for students who were not attending.
One of them was a girl who had missed 55 days but was still on the school's roster, according to Margaret Boucher, assistant business manager at Elizabeth Forward.
The school has cracked down on disengaged students, according to a statement by its director, Sharon Williams, who said a policy adopted last December mandates attendance at online classes for those students who do not log in, repeatedly fail to complete lessons or are failing three courses. She said the school follows state law by removing students who are absent for 10 consecutive days.
Poor attendance and disengaged students have been such a problem that Agora dismissed 600 students last year for nonattendance, 149 of them just before state tests were administered, according to school board minutes.
The Students and Parents
With K12 estimating the market for its schools as high as $15 billion, the company's manifest destiny is to expand across the United States. Its newest conquest is Tennessee, where the company got legislative approval last May and began holding information sessions in July.
By fall, 1,800 students had enrolled in the Tennessee Virtual Academy.
About 75 of them came from the struggling Memphis city school system, including the children of Denita Alhammadi.
In a neighborhood teetering on the edge of middle class, Ms. Alhammadi has converted her living room into a classroom. Two desks are for her children, Romeo, 13, and Yasmine, 8. Another is for Ms. Alhammadi, a former Army supply officer who is also studying online, through Kaplan University.
Within weeks of attending a K12 information session, Ms. Alhammadi had become parent and teacher, wrapped into one. She spends as much as six hours a day as the official ''learning coach'' for her children.
Like many parents who move their children to online schools, she had worried about violence. But no single reason leads families to make the switch. The students are a broadly diverse group, ranging from entertainers and athletes in training to children with cancer, seizure disorders, peanut allergies or behavioral problems. Some have been expelled from regular schools. In many cases their parents are simply dissatisfied.
Kathryn Ubiarco, whose son and daughter are also enrolled in Tennessee, said that her daughter's school in Memphis had not been teaching her to read. ''There's no way to come up with the B that she got in reading last year,'' Ms. Ubiarco said. ''The child can't read.'' She believes the virtual school curriculum is more rigorous.
A lesson from a middle school world history class focuses on the history of the calendar and the recording of time. Intended to take one hour, the lesson opens online with an illustrated introduction. A video explains how time zones vary around the globe. After reading from a textbook, students define terms in a written journal. Then, the parent helps chart a timeline of the student's own life.
The student can click on other online resources -- flashcards, three timelines, two games and links to more than 20 other Web sites.
Students say the games are fun. They may encounter problems, though, when navigating the links. Of more than 20 links in the history lesson, five were not working on a recent day. Several linked to commercial sites including the History Channel and Yahoo Kids.
Students must score an 80 on an online assessment to move to the next lesson.
Some teachers have complained that it can be difficult to determine whether students are actually doing the work, or getting help from their parents or others. ''Virtual schools offer much greater opportunity for students to obtain credit for work they did not do themselves,'' said a report in October from the National Education Policy Center, which receives financing from the National Education Association.
Ms. Alhammadi, who runs her tiny school like boot camp, has hidden Romeo's computer login so she has control. Otherwise, he would skip the lessons and move straight to the online test -- a habit cited by critics of K12's curriculum.
As two frisky cats run back and forth, Romeo raises his hand -- a formality required by his mother -- and asks to leave the room. He returns with headphones and plugs them into his computer. As he lip syncs Rihanna's hit ''Umbrella'' it becomes clear that Romeo is not listening to any lesson. ''I concentrate better with my music,'' he says.
On his computer screen, a series of multiple choice questions ask him to select the correct answer to algebraic equations using negative numbers. Romeo scores a 67 percent.
When Romeo moves to science, he misses a question on the definition of matter.
''Romeo, Romeo,'' his mother says. ''If you had been studying appropriately, you would have found out that there are lots of properties of matter. And you got to take all those elements to build matter. Because elements are gas, solids, liquid.''
Romeo is scheduled for a virtual session with his assigned teacher and class at 1 p.m. But when he signs into the class, no one else is there. ''Wow, the room is completely empty,'' he says. He types, ''Anyone here?'' There is no response.
The Teachers
The monthly meeting of the Agora Cyber Charter School board of trustees is live on Blackboard, the same platform students and teachers use for class. During the November meeting, an elementary teacher, Jessica Long, placed a checkmark by her name, indicating she wanted to speak. Then she challenged school figures showing its student-to-teacher ratio is 49 to 1.
''I know on the elementary level we have anywhere from 70 to 100,'' Ms. Long said. ''I don't know anyone who has 50 students.''
Some teachers said they were initially attracted to K12 by the flexibility of working from home, in some cases allowing them to take care of their own children while teaching.
Gwen Schwartz, an Indiana University graduate who teaches for the Tennessee Virtual Academy, works from her home in a remote area of eastern Tennessee while her children are next door with their grandparents. In addition to saving on child care, Ms. Schwartz can save on commuting costs and clothing.
But many teachers said the job had become less desirable as the company increased enrollment, particularly because pay at many K12 schools starts in the low 30s -- low even for online schools. Some class sizes have become unwieldy, they said, requiring 60-hour weeks and compromising instruction.
At Agora, enrollment has reached 8,836, up from 6,323 in May, according to figures released by the school. As of late November, the total number of staff members -- 408 -- was lower than last year. Some high school teachers said they were managing as many as 270 students, even though they had been told they would have 150. Agora officials said last week that they hired 25 teachers in the past couple of weeks.
Some Agora teachers have been asked to take on extra students at the rate of $1 per student, per day, according to a newsletter from the Pennsylvania State Education Association.
In interviews, former teachers at Ohio Virtual Academy and Colorado Virtual Academy also complained of bigger class loads, with elementary teachers who once handled 40 to 50 pupils now supervising 75. A teacher with an elementary class that size and a 40-hour workweek could devote little more than 30 minutes a week to each student.
Mary Ravanelli, a former teacher at Ohio Virtual Academy, said she oversaw more than 70 students at a time, answering calls from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., updating parents on students' progress and attending various school outings. ''We'd actually meet our students several times a year,'' she said.
With teacher salaries and benefits the biggest cost to K12, increasing student-to-teacher ratios is an easy way for the company to increase profits. Ms. Henderson, the former Agora teacher and mother of four students, said the ultimate losers are the children.
''What has happened now in honors literature courses, the teachers are not able to keep up with 300 students, so they'll just cut curriculum. The kids are losing out,'' she said. ''This past week my son was exempted from 'The Great Gatsby' because of the workload of the teacher.''
Politics
''Choice'' is a mantra of the charter school movement, which promotes competition as a way of compelling traditional public schools to improve. The for-profit companies that operate some charter and online schools take the idea a step further by arguing that private business models are more efficient than public school systems.
Together, the groups have formed a lobbying juggernaut in state capitals.
In Pennsylvania, where K12 Inc. collects about 10 percent of its revenues, the company has spent $681,000 on lobbying since 2007. The company also has friends in high places. Charles Zogby, the state's budget secretary, had been senior vice president of education and policy for K12. In a statement, Mr. Zogby said he still owned a small number of K12 shares, but did not make decisions specifically affecting online schools.
An analysis by the National Institute on Money in State Politics concluded that K12 and its employees had also contributed nearly $500,000 to state political candidates across the country from 2004 to 2010.
One of the industry's most persuasive promotional tools has been the young children who show up en masse at hearings to support online-school legislation. They are mobilized by groups tied to online schools. Records show that at least some receive industry funding.
When Karen Beyer, then a Pennsylvania state representative, sponsored a bill in 2007 to cut financing to online schools, about 700 people turned out for one hearing. Mr. Freund, the Pennsylvania education lawyer, said the room was ''packed with kids.''
''They had on different colored T-shirts representing their cyber schools,'' he added.
One of the organizers of such turnouts has been the Pennsylvania Families for Public Cyber Schools. Records show that the group, which gets money both from K12 and Connections Education, has spent about $250,000 on lobbying in the past five years.
Similar family organizations have cropped up across the country.
Former State Representative Stephen Dyer became suspicious when members of the benignly named organization My School, My Choice paraded through his northeastern Ohio district carrying signs attacking him: ''Why Won't Rep. Stephen Dyer let parents choose the best education for their kids?''
The protest was prompted by questions Mr. Dyer had raised over the state's financing formula for charter and online schools. The group describes itself as a coalition of parents, teachers and employees of the schools. But Mr. Dyer said that his wife questioned the people carrying the signs and found out they were paid temp agency workers.
A telephone call to a toll-free number on the Web site for My School, My Choice was returned by Mark Weaver, a Columbus lawyer and political consultant with Republican ties dating back to the Reagan administration.
Mr. Weaver said the group's crowning achievement was a 2009 rally against legislation in Ohio that would limit school choice. ''We put 4,500 people on the statehouse lawn,'' he said. But he declined to answer questions about the group's leadership and financing.
Documents incorporating the organization provide clues. The forms name one of the group's founders as Tim Dirrim, a Huntington National Bank employee who serves as board president of the Ohio Virtual Academy, which is managed by K-12 and receives more than $60 million a year from the state. Mr. Dirrim said he knew little about My School, My Choice and was not aware of the campaign against Mr. Dyer.
Much of the Ohio Virtual Academy's money goes through an account at Huntington National, according to the Ohio auditor's office. Mr. Dirrim said the banking arrangement was made before he joined the board and that he did not make decisions relating to the bank's account with the school.
The Results
Mr. Packard has repeatedly delivered upbeat assessments to Wall Street about the progress of K12 Inc. students, even as many schools were performing poorly on state tests.
In a conference in March sponsored by the investment firm Morgan Stanley, Mr. Packard said that ''our kids are doing as well or better than the average child in a brick-and-mortar school.''
During an investment analysts call in October, Mr. Packard boasted about results at Agora, calling them ''significantly higher than a typical school on state administered tests for growth.'' Weeks earlier, data had been released showing that 42 percent of Agora students tested on grade level or better in math, compared with 75 percent of students statewide. And 52 percent of Agora students had hit the mark in reading, compared with 72 percent statewide. The school was losing ground, not gaining it.
Mr. Packard said in a recent interview that he was not aware of the data at the time he made the comments. A spokesman said Mr. Packard was relying on older data.
A Stanford University group, the Center for Research on Education Outcomes, tracked students in eight virtual schools in Pennsylvania, including Agora, comparing them with similar students in regular schools. The study found that ''in every subgroup, with significant effects, cyber charter performance is lower.''
Devora Davis, the center's research manager, said the group's analysis of Pennsylvania online schools showed that students were slipping. ''If they were paired with a traditional public schools student, the public school student kept their place in line, and the cyberstudent moved back five spots,'' she said.
An analysis by the Carroll County Public School District in Virginia shows that the 400 students in the virtual program there performed worse than the regular students in 19 of 26 categories on the state assessment test.
The Carroll County superintendent, James Greg Smith, said he was particularly concerned about scores in middle school math, history and social sciences. In seventh-grade math, for example, only 35 percent of the online students passed a state assessment; 68 percent of the traditional students did.
It will be a while before test results are available for students at the new virtual school in Tennessee. Back in Memphis, Ms. Alhammadi is worried that her daughter, Yasmine, is moving too quickly. A computerized analysis shows that, at the rate she is going, Yasmine will be finished with all but one of her classes by March.
Red flags go up if a student is ''zapping through like a rocket, lesson by lesson,'' according to Tom DiGiovanni, K12's senior director of product planning. ''The teachers are instructed to drop in (by phone) and do a little quiz to kind of test students'' to make sure they understand the concepts.
Five miles from Ms. Alhammadi's home, Ms. Ubiarco has also turned her living room into a classroom. Her daughter Sabrina, 10, is in the fifth grade and her son, K.C., 6, is in kindergarten at the Tennessee Virtual Academy.
Ms. Ubiarco is giving Sabrina a math lesson -- about the distributive property -- on a white board in the family's living room.
While his mother focuses on his sister, K.C. is doing his own thing -- lying on the carpet crashing cars into Spider-Man and Batman action figures.
For the most part, Mrs. Ubiarco said the switch to online had gone smoothly, although she was initially stumped when she first got the K12 curriculum.
''I called the teacher the other day to find out what a simple predicate is,'' she said. ''She said it's the verb. I said why don't they just say that?''

HEADLINE: From Finland, a Story Of Educational Success In Going Against the Tide

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish educator and author, had a simple question for the high school seniors he was speaking to one morning last week in Manhattan: ''Who here wants to be a teacher?''
Out of a class of 15, two hands went up -- one a little reluctantly.
''In my country, that would be 25 percent of people,'' Dr. Sahlberg said. ''And,'' he added, thrusting his hand in the air with enthusiasm, ''it would be more like this.''
In his country, Dr. Sahlberg said later in an interview, teachers typically spend about four hours a day in the classroom, and are paid to spend two hours a week on professional development. At the University of Helsinki, where he teaches, 2,400 people competed last year for 120 slots in the (fully subsidized) master's program for schoolteachers. ''It's more difficult getting into teacher education than law or medicine,'' he said. 
Dr. Sahlberg puts high-quality teachers at the heart of Finland's education success story -- which, as it happens, has become a personal success story of sorts, part of an American obsession with all things Finnish when it comes to schools.
Take last week. On Monday, Dr. Sahlberg was the keynote speaker at an education conference in Chicago. On Tuesday, he had to return to Helsinki for an Independence Day party held by Finland's president -- a coveted invitation to an event that much of the country watches on television.
On Wednesday, it was Washington, for a party for the release of his latest book, ''Finnish Lessons: What Can the World Learn From Educational Change in Finland?,'' that drew staff members from the White House and Congress.
And Thursday brought him to the Upper West Side, for a daylong visit to the Dwight School, a for-profit school that prides itself on internationalism, where he talked to those seniors.
Ever since Finland, a nation of about 5.5 million that does not start formal education until age 7 and scorns homework and testing until well into the teenage years, scored at the top of a well-respected international test in 2001 in math, science and reading, it has been an object of fascination among American educators and policy makers.
Finlandophilia only picked up when the nation placed close to the top again in 2009, while the United States ranked 15th in reading, 19th in math and 27th in science.
The Finnish Embassy in Washington hosts brunch seminars with titles like ''Why Are Finnish Kids So Smart?'' and organizes trips to Finland for education journalists eager to see for themselves. In Helsinki, the Education Ministry has had 100 official delegations from 40 to 45 countries visit each year since 2005. Schools there used to love the attention, making cakes and doing folk dances for the foreigners, Dr. Sahlberg said, but now the crush of observers is considered a national distraction.
Critics say that Finland is an irrelevant laboratory for the United States. It has a tiny economy, a low poverty rate, a homogenous population -- 5 percent are foreign-born -- and socialist underpinnings (speeding tickets are calculated according to income).
Its school system has roughly the same number of teachers as New York City's but far fewer students, 600,000 compared with New York's 1.1 million. Finnish students speak Finnish and Swedish and usually English. (Patrick F. Bassett, head of the Washington-based National Association of Independent Schools, a fan of what Finland has been doing, said one of the things he learned on his own pilgrimage to Finland was that the average resident checks out 17 books a year from the library.)
''There are things they do right,'' said Mark S. Schneider, vice president of the American Institutes for Research, ''but I'm not sure how many lessons we get are portable.'' Frederick M. Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said Finlandophilia was ''totally deified'' and ''blown out of proportion.''
But Linda Darling-Hammond, an education professor at Stanford, said Finland could be an excellent model for individual states, noting that it is about the size of Kentucky.
''The fact that we have more race, ethnicity and economic heterogeneity, and we have this huge problem of poverty, should not mean we don't want qualified teachers -- the strategies become even more important,'' Dr. Darling-Hammond said. ''Thirty years ago, Finland's education system was a mess. It was quite mediocre, very inequitable. It had a lot of features our system has: very top-down testing, extensive tracking, highly variable teachers, and they managed to reboot the whole system.''
Both Dr. Darling-Hammond and Dr. Sahlberg said a turning point was a government decision in the 1970s to require all teachers to have master's degrees -- and to pay for their acquisition. The starting salary for school teachers in Finland, 96 percent of whom are unionized, was about $29,000 in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with about $36,000 in the United States.
More bear than tiger, Finland scorns almost all standardized testing before age 16 and discourages homework, and it is seen as a violation of children's right to be children for them to start school any sooner than 7, Dr. Sahlberg said during his day at Dwight. He spoke to seniors taking a ''Theory of Knowledge'' class, then met with administrators and faculty members.
''The first six years of education are not about academic success,'' he said. ''We don't measure children at all. It's about being ready to learn and finding your passion.''
Dr. Sahlberg, 52, an Education Ministry official and a former math teacher, is the author of 15 books. He said he wrote the latest one, which sold out its first printing in a week, in response to the overwhelming interest in his country's educational system. It was not meant to claim that Finland's way was the best way, he said, and he was quick to caution against countries' trying to import ideas a la carte and then expecting results.
''Don't try to apply anything,'' he told the Dwight teachers. ''It won't work because education is a very complex system.''
Besides high-quality teachers, Dr. Sahlberg pointed to Finland's Lutheran leanings, almost religious belief in equality of opportunity, and a decision in 1957 to require subtitles on foreign television as key ingredients to the success story.
He emphasized that Finland's success is one of basic education, from age 7 until 16, at which point 95 percent of the country goes on to vocational or academic high schools. ''The primary aim of education is to serve as an equalizing instrument for society,'' he said.
Dr. Sahlberg said another reason the system had succeeded was that ''only dead fish follow the stream'' -- a Finnish expression.
Finland is going against the tide of the ''global education reform movement,'' which is based on core subjects, competition, standardization, test-based accountability, control.
''Education policies here are always written to be 'the best' or 'the top this or that,' '' he said. ''We're not like that. We want to be better than the Swedes. That's enough for us.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a visiting Finnish educator and author who spoke to Upper West Side students about his country's educational system misstated the surname of a vice president at the American Institutes for Research who was critical of the widespread admiration for Finnish methods. He is Mark S. Schneider, not Schneiderman.

HEADLINE: No Hit Toy to Brighten Stores

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
With Christmas less than two weeks away, the toy industry has no runaway hit -- leaving many toy shoppers bored and complicating how stores sell holiday inventory.
''We are not seeing people clamor for any single item,'' Stephanie Lucy, vice president for toys at Target, said by e-mail.
The hitless season has retailers stocking less, leaning on classic items rather than new ones and possibly discounting less in the final days before Christmas. And with no Tickle Me Elmo or Zhu Zhu Pets to draw crushing crowds to the toy aisles, most retailers are being careful not to get stuck with unsold toys. 
''As retailers look at consumer confidence numbers, they are skeptical about consumers' willingness to spend this holiday season, and they are trying to avoid getting caught with too much inventory,'' said Josh Green, chief executive of Panjiva, a supply-chain data company.
LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer, Hot Wheels Wall Tracks, Lalaoopsy Silly Hair dolls and some Lego sets are sold out or hard to find in many parts of the country, but that is mainly because of consistent demand rather than growing waves of frenzied shoppers.
In fact, more than half of parents recently surveyed by UBS and America's Research Group said they felt there was no must-have toy this year, and more than one-third said it was hard to find toys and gifts because nothing was new. Both responses were higher than those in the survey last year, when Squinkies, Paper Jamz and Zoobles were among the most talked-about new toys.
Part of the doldrums this year stems from retailers' conservatism. After loading up on toys in 2010, major stores like Wal-Mart ''ended up with a pretty substantial toy overhang that had to be liquidated in the January time frame,'' said Eric Johnson, director of the center for digital strategies at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, who studies the toy industry.
Retailers have cut down on toys overall -- imports of toys in August and September, important months for building holiday inventory, dropped by 9.8 percent compared with last year, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Panjiva.
Yet not every product is being cut. Shipments of Legos into the United States in August, September, October and November rose about 155 percent from the same period last year, while those of Hot Wheels rose 43 percent and Barbie merchandise rose 17 percent, according to an analysis of Customs data by Panjiva.
Meanwhile, shipments of the heavily marketed new items such as Angry Birds toys or Lalaoopsy dolls -- none of which has amounted to a breakthrough hit, though they are hard to find -- came in at much lower levels than last year's hot toys.
''Couple that with the increase in shipments of the classics, and it's a sign that regardless of the talk, when retailers are actually placing orders, they're doing so with a very classic mind-set,'' Mr. Green said. ''One sign of caution is betting on products that people know and understand.''
The good news for many retailers is that the smaller supplies are leading to early sellouts, and, in some cases, higher prices. Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said his rough tally shows that in December Wal-Mart has had 12 of the most popular toys in stock less than 40 percent of the time, while Target had them on shelves 50 percent of the time, and Toys ''R'' Us had them in stock about 60 percent of the time. (Toys ''R'' Us said last week that it was bringing in new supplies of top sellers, like the LeapPad, in time for Christmas.)
With such low inventory levels, Mr. Johnson said, ''as we get closer to the holidays, you'll see less and less price promotion.''
Adding to the higher prices, Wal-Mart does not seem to be as aggressive about low prices on toys this year, said Eric Johnson of Dartmouth. ''Three or four years ago, Wal-Mart was coming out year after year with these jaw-dropping prices, and just pounding everyone,'' he said. But this year, Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, does not appear ''to be using toys as a loss leader,'' he said.
Tara Raddohl, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said by e-mail that it keeps ''a close eye on other retailers and adjust our prices proactively for customers so they don't have to do homework to get the best prices.'' However, she said, unlike last year, inflation on the manufacturing side has led to ''some price increases.''
Wal-Mart ''will do all we can to hold off on price increases as long as possible,'' she said, ''but there are times when, due to market conditions, we have to pass along price increases.''
Even without giant price cuts, Wal-Mart's toy sales have eaten into those of Target and other retailers because of another sign of the economic times: layaway.
In October, Wal-Mart brought back layaway, which it discontinued in 2006, saying that its shoppers were on such tight budgets that they needed to pay a bit at a time for gifts like toys and electronics. Company executives said the program has been more popular than expected, particularly in toys. Target acknowledged that its toy business had been affected by the Wal-Mart program.
''Wal-Mart's layaway program has certainly hurt us in November,'' said Kathryn A. Tesija, Target's executive vice president for merchandising, in a call with analysts last month. ''Toys is off to a slow start, and I think that's going to be a bit of an uphill climb for us this year, although we're still optimistic about the rest of the fourth quarter.''
Though some products are sold out, and some have higher prices Mr. Johnson of BMO Capital Markets said that over all, retailers had set their expectations so low that they had created a self-fulfilling prophecy.
''Even if consumers do show up and spend, we think there's little opportunity to capture upside, as both retailers and manufacturers have been quite cautious in terms of procurement of toy inventory,'' he said. He predicted toy sales would be about flat this year compared with last, adding, ''that's about as weak as it gets for the toy category.''

HEADLINE: To Reorganize Debt, Publisher Of Papers Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Lee Enterprises, which publishes 48 daily newspapers, including The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday to refinance nearly $1 billion in debt.
Lee is the third-largest newspaper publisher to file for bankruptcy, behind the MediaNews Group in 2010 and the Tribune Company in 2008, as readership and advertising revenue continue to dwindle across the industry. 
Lee was founded in 1890 in Ottumwa, Iowa, by A.W. Lee. Most of the company's newspapers trace their beginnings to the mid-1800s. The luminaries who have worked for the company's papers include Mark Twain, Willa Cather and Thornton Wilder.
The company plans to repay its creditors in full and will use the bankruptcy to essentially extend the maturity of about $1 billion in debt that was coming due in April.
Under its plan, the company will push out that repayment to 2015 and 2017, although with higher interest rates, according to court documents.
The company's creditors already have voted to back the plan. Lee expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the coming months.
The company's shareholders will not be wiped out, as is typical in bankruptcy. However, Lee will issue new shares to creditors that will dilute the stock value held by current shareholders by around 13 percent.
Lee employs 6,200 people, according to Dirks, Van Essen & Murray, a firm that assists in the sales of daily newspapers. The company's papers have a daily readership of 1.3 million, according to court documents.
In 2005, Lee acquired the Pulitzer newspaper publisher in a deal financed primarily through debt.
In the year to Sept. 25, Lee had an operating loss of $103.3 million on revenue of $756.1 million, according to court documents.
The bankruptcy comes two months after the company had reached an agreement with most its lenders to refinance $769.5 million of its distressed loans.
However, Lee was forced to file for bankruptcy because 6 percent of its lenders did not consent to the out-of-court plan, which required unanimous approval.

HEADLINE: Millionaires on Food Stamps And Jobless Pay? G.O.P. Is on It

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It's an image many Americans would find rather upsetting: a recently laid-off millionaire, luxuriating next to the pool eating grapes bought with food stamps while waiting for an unemployment check to roll in.
Under the Republican bill to extend a payroll tax holiday scheduled to be voted on in the House as early as Tuesday, those Americans with gross adjusted income over $1 million would no longer be eligible for food stamps or jobless pay, producing $20 million in savings to help pay for the tax cut for American workers. The idea is also embraced by many Democrats, who had a similar version of the savings in a Senate bill to extend the payroll tax cut, as did a failed Republican Senate bill. 
Yet as it turns out, millionaires on food stamps are about as rare as petunias in January, even if you count a lottery winner in Michigan who managed to collect the benefit until chagrined officials in the state put an end to it.
But the idea of ending unemployment insurance for very high earners -- which would be achieved essentially through taxing benefits up to 100 percent with a phase-in beginning for those with gross adjusted income over $750,000 -- demonstrates an increasing desire among members of Congress to find some way to make sure that the wealthiest Americans contribute more to reducing the deficit and paying for middle-class tax relief.
Democrats have sought a surtax on income over $1 million to pay for an extension of a tax break for the middle class, a surtax that Republicans have rejected. Employees' share of the payroll tax, now 4.2 percent of wages, is scheduled to rise to 6.2 percent in January unless Congress takes action. The Senate is expected to come back this week with another version of its bill to extend the tax holiday. On Monday night, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, served notice to Congressional Republicans that he would prevent final votes on a must-pass bill to finance government operations until the Democrats get what they want on the payroll tax.
While tycoons on food stamps might be hard to find, some millionaires do indeed pursue unemployment pay when they find themselves out of job.
From 2005 to 2009, millionaires collected over $74 million in unemployment benefits, according to an estimate by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, who has paired with Senator Mark Udall, Democrat of Colorado, to push to end the practice.
According to Mr. Coburn's office, the Internal Revenue Service reported that 2,362 millionaires collected a total of $20,799,000 in unemployment benefits in 2009; 18 people with an adjusted gross income of $10,000,000 or more received an average of $12,333 in jobless benefits for a total of $222,000.
''Making Coloradans pay for unemployment insurance for millionaires is frankly irresponsible, especially at a time when money is tight and our debt is out of control,'' Mr. Udall said in an e-mail.
Unemployment benefits are essentially an insurance program financed through the state and federal governments. States charge employers taxes dedicated to cover the first 26 weeks of unemployment benefits paid to those Americans who lose their jobs, with the federal government paying for extensions.
Currently, unemployment benefits have stretched out to 99 weeks, through a series of nine extensions that began in 2008, reflecting the high levels of extended unemployment that have dogged the country, at a cost of roughly $180 billion to the federal government. (While there are also federal taxes charged to employers, those monies tend to be used for administrative costs and not benefits.) Roughly 3.5 million people are now receiving extended benefits. Some states have already begun to reduce the number of extended weeks unemployment offered.
The Republican legislation seeks to shorten the number of weeks that will be extended to the jobless, and offer states more flexibility with how they use their own unemployment taxes, including starting programs that train people for work while they accept benefits.
''It's a water drop in a hurricane,'' said Wayne Vroman, an economist at the Urban Institute. ''I can see the PR appeal, but unemployment insurance collected by millionaires is not one of the major problems with the program. This is a way of trying to put an income test on the unemployment system that has never existed in the past.''
Food stamps are another matter, as recipients must demonstrate low income levels to receive them. Household income must not exceed 130 percent of poverty; for a family of three that would be a gross monthly income of $2,008.
However, of the 53 states and territories, 40 have no asset tests, which means that in some situations it would be possible for someone with, for instance, a large house or a luxury car -- or in the case of Michigan, current lottery winnings not yet delivered in full -- to receive food stamps.
Department of Agriculture officials dismissed the notion of millionaire food stamp recipients. ''Federal law is clear,'' said Aaron Lavallee, a spokesman for the department. ''The program is intended for households with income not exceeding 130 percent of poverty.''
Among the 46 million Americans who receive the assistance -- roughly one in seven Americans -- few seem to be millionaires. As such, the $200 million in savings from this cut would be largely achieved through the cuts to the unemployment insurance for high earners.

HEADLINE: Top Earners Not So Lofty In the Days Of Recession

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Hold the condolence cards, but the recession cost the rich.
The share of income received by the top 1 percent -- that potent symbol of inequality -- dropped to 17 percent in 2009 from 23 percent in 2007, according to federal tax data. Within the group, average income fell to $957,000 in 2009 from $1.4 million in 2007.
Analysts say the drop largely reflects the stock market plunge, and most think top incomes recovered somewhat in 2010, as Wall Street rebounded and corporate profits grew. Still, the drop alters a figure often emphasized by inequality critics, and it has gone largely unnoticed outside the blogosphere. 
By focusing on the top 1 percent, the Occupy Wall Street movement has made economic fairness a subject of street protest and political debate.
''It's very interesting that this has become such a big topic now when the numbers are back to where they were in the 1990s,'' said Steven Kaplan, an economist at the University of Chicago's business school. ''People didn't seem to be complaining about it then.''
In 2009 the average income of the top 1 percent, adjusted for inflation, fell below its 1998 level, but remained well above where it was in 1990: $662,000. While the protests follow the worst downturn since the Great Depression, inequality has been growing for three decades, driven by economic and political forces. Globalization created larger markets for those with scarce talents but hurt less educated workers by pitting them against cheap foreign labor. New technology also hurt unskilled workers, by replacing many with machines.
Unions declined, eroding blue-collar bargaining power. The financial industry grew, with paydays heavily weighted toward the top. Corporate culture accepted the growing gap between the executive suite and the factory floor.
Falling tax rates on the highest earners added to the net income divide, by allowing top earners to keep more of their pay and increasing their incentive to maximize it.
In the decades after World War II, by contrast, the average income of the top 1 percent grew only marginally faster than inflation and significantly slower than middle-class incomes. That combination caused inequality to decline throughout much of the 1950, '60s and early '70s.
As recently as 1980, only about one-tenth of the nation's pretax income went to the top 1 percent. By 2000, that share had grown to about 22 percent. It slumped to about 18 percent in 2003, after a market crash, only to rebound by 2007 to levels not achieved since the Roaring '20s.
Pointing to the recent declines at the top, Mr. Kaplan argues the Occupy protesters have accused the wrong villain by focusing on inequality, which he called an inevitable byproduct of growth. ''If you want to reduce inequality, all you need to do is put the economy in a recession,'' he said. ''If you want the economy to do well, as all of us do, then you'll get more inequality.''
But Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University, argues much of the recent growth at the top reflects insider privilege instead of real productivity. ''The notion that the really high earners are earning it has become very questionable,'' he said. ''Look at outrageousness of the damage they imposed on the rest of the economy and the cost being born by middle-income Americans.''
''There's been rising income inequality all over the world, but nowhere as much as in the United States,'' he said.
Critics of the Occupy Wall Street movement say the falling incomes at the top show that concerns about inequality are outdated.
''We don't want to spend years focused on income inequality, only to learn that the financial crisis fixed it for us,'' wrote Megan McArdle in a blog post for The Atlantic.
''Get a time machine, Occupy Wall Street,'' wrote James Pethokoukis, a blogger at the American Enterprise Institute.
But Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration official, said that after previous market-related dips, income inequality only soared to new highs. ''If you believed the inequality problem had been solved in the early 2000s, you would have been proven terribly wrong,'' said Mr. Bernstein, now of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
While top incomes probably rose in 2010, most analysts doubt they returned to their 2007 peak, since stocks remain about 20 percent lower. Mr. Kaplan argues that new restraints on Wall Street will keep the income shares of the rich below those earlier levels, a view Mr. Bernstein disputes.
''The structural forces driving inequality remain very much in place,'' he said.
The income shares of the top 1 percent became a common metric of inequality after a 2003 study by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanel Saez, which traced trends back to 1913. It peaked at 24 percent in 1928, just above its 2007 level. Mr. Saez, of the University of California, Berkeley, sides with those who think the rich will soon get richer.
''Barring an economic cataclysm ahead, top earners will be recovering faster than the other 99 percent,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''The inequality problem is not going away and won't until drastic policy changes are made (as happened during the New Deal).''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Bill Would Benefit Doctor-Owned Hospitals

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House Republican bill to hold down payroll taxes and extend unemployment benefits, coming up for a vote on Tuesday, offers a special dispensation to doctors who invest in hospitals.
The bill would repeal and relax several provisions of the 2010 health care law that clamped down on doctor-owned hospitals. The bill would allow such hospitals to open if they were under construction at the end of last year, and it would allow them to expand if they were already in existence.
Congressional aides say dozens of hospitals and their physician owners could benefit. 
Numerous studies have found that when doctors have a financial stake in a hospital, they tend to order more tests and procedures, raising costs for Medicare and other insurers.
Many doctor-owned hospitals specialize in surgery, orthopedics or heart care. Proponents say they provide superior services.
The provision of the House bill allowing the spread and expansion of doctor-owned hospitals would increase federal spending by $300 million over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office said.
Dr. Michael E. Russell II, president of Physician Hospitals of America, a trade group for doctor-owned institutions, said the 2010 law ''limits access to care,'' at a time when the need for it will increase because of the expansion of coverage. More than 30 million Americans are expected to gain insurance under the 2010 health care law.
Dr. Russell said the House Republican bill would benefit 25 to 30 hospitals that were under construction but had not opened. In addition, he said, more than half of the 270 existing doctor-owned hospitals want to expand, and they too could benefit.
But Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said the provision dealing with doctor-owned hospitals was ''a special interest giveaway.''
''These facilities have caused patient deaths and are proven to increase unnecessary utilization, thus increasing costs,'' Mr. Stark said. ''Yet Republicans spend $300 million to allow more of these facilities to exist and enable all of them to easily continue to expand. That's bad for America's health, but good for special interests.''
Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, defended the provision.
''A number of hospitals broke ground with the expectation that they would be able to operate under Medicare,'' Mr. Pitts said. ''The health care law changed the rules midgame, jeopardizing potentially thousands of jobs to build and staff these facilities. This provision would allow these hospitals that were already under construction prior to Dec. 31 to operate under Medicare for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.''
Richard J. Umbdenstock, the president of the American Hospital Association, said his group could not support the House Republican bill because it would cut Medicare payments to hospitals, forcing some to ''limit services and limit access for patients.''
Mr. Umbdenstock also deplored the loosening of restrictions on doctor-owned hospitals.
''Research shows that there is more utilization of services when hospitals are owned by physicians,'' Mr. Umbdenstock said.
Doctor-owned hospitals, he said, tend to focus on the more profitable types of business, ''leaving community hospitals with the more acutely ill patients and those who are uninsured or have coverage through public programs.''
As Democrats examined the House Republican bill on Monday, they found much to criticize, ensuring a partisan battle in both houses. Many Senate Democrats oppose a provision intended to speed approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, running from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast.
Several Democratic senators said they hoped to see a deal under which Republicans would drop the pipeline if Democrats dropped their demand for a surtax on individual income in excess of $1 million a year.
Republicans oppose the surtax. President Obama has said he will reject a bill tying the payroll tax cut to the pipeline.

HEADLINE: Power Savings on Auto Pilot

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
Most hotel chains delayed significant energy conservation moves during the economic downturn, but now one, Marriott International, has signed a deal to reduce its hotels' energy use, particularly during times of peak demand.
Marriott will save on electric bills and also earn incentive payments from utilities as a reward for its efforts during peak periods, like heat waves, when utilities struggle to meet demand and often have to pay high prices for electricity.
But the success or failure of the program, the first involving a hotel chain, will be in how well it can make the cuts without affecting -- or, more important, annoying -- its customers.
''It's a very thin line -- you have to be careful not to alienate your customers'' when introducing cost-saving programs, said David Loeb, a senior analyst and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Company. 
Marriott signed the agreement with Constellation Energy last month and plans to adopt the energy-saving program at 264 of its hotels in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states and in Texas and California.
The cuts in electricity use will vary by hotel, depending on the size, climate, geographical location and other factors. In general, hotels may use less air-conditioning in the hallways, dim the lighting in certain common areas, shut water fountains, rearrange cooling cycles and even close certain elevator banks. Also, certain hotels will reduce energy use in individual rooms that have not been booked, with infrared sensors and motion detectors flagging the central system when rooms are vacant.
''We might move the room temperature to 78 degrees in an unrented room'' rather than 72 in a rented room, said Douglas Rath, energy director for Marriott International in the Americas.
In the past, Marriott has manually reduced power at certain times, but now specific cuts will be made automatically. The VirtuWatt energy management system from Constellation will work with the hotel's property management system to track power use and automatically activate the cuts when utilities are strained.
In some cases, the program will alter energy use in advance of an expected heat wave. ''They'd run the chillers overnight and make sure the common areas are cooled down to say 67 degrees when normally they'd keep it at 72,'' said Gary Fromer, senior vice president for demand response at Constellation Energy. ''Then they would allow the temperature to slowly rise to 72 or 73 degrees during the window of time where you want to control the usage.''
Constellation will cover about half the cost of installing the automated technology, but Mr. Rath said most hotels would break even on the investment within two years and generate at least 25 percent returns -- and as much as 100 percent returns -- by the end of the five-year agreement through the cost savings and the incentive payments.
''In effect, the hotels act like a generator in the market, and a reduction in consumption is roughly the same as the addition of a new generator to the system,'' Mr. Fromer said. ''And so we pay them roughly what we would have paid a generator to produce the same amount of energy.''
Utilities are willing to pay for this since building plants to meet demand is a difficult alternative. ''They can't build more plants -- they're not popular,'' Mr. Rath said. ''Nobody wants a nuclear plant or coal plant in their backyard.''
For Marriott, the pact expands its environmental efforts, which started in 2005 with a linen and bedding reuse program, where sheets and towels would no longer be replaced nightly during a guest's stay unless requested. The company's goal, set in 2007, is to decrease energy use at its hotels by 25 percent by 2017. Already, it has been trimmed by 20 percent, Mr. Rath said.
But reductions in power use can be tricky and, when poorly calculated, can alienate customers not only from the hotel, but from the brand.
The Travelocity site, for example, is filled with reviews from angry hotel patrons complaining that hotels failed to provide clean linens after they requested them under the linen reuse program.
So similar complaints could ensue if the changes from the program are too radical. Mr. Loeb recalled one hotel, not a Marriott, that adjusted room temperatures when infrared sensors indicated the room was vacant. ''It drove me crazy because you'd wake up in the middle of the night sweating because the air-conditioning had been turned off because you weren't moving,'' he said. ''Then, when you move around, all of a sudden it drops five degrees in 10 minutes.''
But Mr. Rath said guest room temperature adjustments would be made only to rooms that were not rented, not simply unoccupied. And he insisted that the cuts, in general, would not have a significant, or maybe even noticeable, effect on guests. ''The last thing we want to do is impact an area, such as a guest room, a meeting room or a restaurant, where a guest is,'' he said. ''To me, that would be the height of stupidity -- we'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.''
Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean at New York University's Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, warned that hotel managers would have to respond quickly if guests were upset and looked for alternatives. Rather than turning off a bank of lights, he said, the hotel might consider installing lower-energy lights.
But Mr. Hanson was bullish on the program. ''Corporate travel managers and convention planners recognize and respect these types of initiatives'' and often use green policies as a factor when booking hotels, he says.
But age often plays a role. Younger travelers are less likely to complain about inconveniences caused by conservation policies than older ones, who often prefer luxury over energy saving when booking expensive hotel rooms. ''The younger generation doesn't really think that way,'' Mr. Loeb said. ''Gen-Ys don't leave their values at home when they travel.''
The energy saving program is expected to generate about $9.9 million in revenue from lower energy costs and incentive payments over five years at the 264 Marriott hotels. Constellation will also cover about half the overall cost -- $1.3 million -- of installing the automated system. The hotel owners will split the revenue with Marriott International, which operates the hotels, through property management fees.
While the dollar savings may not sound like much, given Marriott's market value of $9.7 billion, analysts say it adds up. ''The success in the hotel business in many cases revolves around doing the small things right over and over again -- it's finding the nickels and dimes to save,'' Mr. Loeb said. ''Plus, it's green and it's good P.R.''

HEADLINE: Targeting the Unemployed

 BODY:
The House Republican leadership managed to get one thing right in its bill to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. The bill does, indeed, extend the payroll tax cut for another year, but, beyond that, there is a lot to dislike. To help pay for the package, for instance, the bill would cut social spending more deeply than is already anticipated under current budget caps without asking wealthy Americans to contribute a penny in new taxes.
It also holds the expiring provisions hostage to irrelevant but noxious proposals to undo existing environmental protections. Worse, it would make unemployment compensation considerably stingier than it is now. 
At last count, 13.3 million people were officially unemployed and 5.7 million of them had been out of work for more than six months. At no time in the last 60 years has long-term unemployment been so high for so long.
But Republican lawmakers would have you believe that the nation cannot afford jobless benefits and that many recipients are not so much needy, as lazy, disinclined to work as long as benefits are available. When was the last time any Republican lawmaker tried to live on $289 a week, the amount of the average benefit?
Under current policy, federal benefits kick in when state-provided benefits run out, typically after 26 weeks. The duration of the federal payouts depends on the level of unemployment in a given state. Currently, workers in 22 of the hardest-hit states -- including California, New Jersey and Connecticut -- qualify for up to 73 more weeks of aid. In five other states -- including New York -- up to 67 more weeks are available. In the remaining 23 states, maximum federal benefits range from 34 weeks to 60 weeks. The cost to continue the program for another year would be about $45 billion.
The Republican plan would cut $11 billion of that in 2012 by slashing up to 40 weeks from the program, reducing by more than half the maximum 73 weeks now available. Because of the way the program is structured, the biggest cuts would come in the states with the highest unemployment. Millions of jobless workers would be quickly left without subsistence, and the weak economy would be weakened further by the drop in consumer spending.
The bill would also impose onerous -- and gratuitous -- requirements on people who apply for jobless benefits. It would allow states to drug test applicants and would require recipients to be high-school graduates or working toward an equivalency degree.
Curtailing jobless benefits makes sense once hiring is clearly on the rebound, which is not yet the case. Joblessness remains high, not because the unemployed are lazy or on drugs, but because there are too many applicants for too few jobs. Labor statistics show that if all the job openings in America were filled tomorrow, nearly 10 million people would still be unemployed. That works out to about four jobless workers for every opening. In a normal job market, the expected ratio would be about one to one.
We need job creation, like the spending and infrastructure programs in President Obama's jobs bills, which Republicans scoffed at. Lawmakers could also take smaller steps to help the long-term jobless, like outlawing discrimination in hiring against unemployed job-seekers.
In the meantime, the only humane and economically sensible choice is to renew unemployment benefits at a level that is up to the scale of the crisis. The Republican plan is way too small for a very big problem.

HEADLINE: For Colleges, Success on the Track Is Not Translating to the Budget

BYLINE: By TIM WENDEL

 BODY:
COLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Lap splits and training programs are usually Andrew Valmon's daily concerns. But in recent weeks, fund-raising and the search for possible endowment money have been added to his to-do list as the University of Maryland track coach.
Maryland needs to raise nearly $4.2 million by July 1 to save its storied men's track program, which once won 24 consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference outdoor titles and produced stars like the hurdler Renaldo Nehemiah. Men's track and five other programs at Maryland will be eliminated unless more money can be found in the coming months. 
''We know we cannot do this with car washes and alike,'' said Valmon, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 4x400-meter relay and the coach of the United States Olympic men's team next summer in London. ''We've found ourselves in a serious situation where we're battling to see if we can move forward as a team.''
To that end, the university started a Web site Friday for donations. In addition, a Facebook page in support of the Maryland teams already has more than 13,500 members. The eventual fate of Maryland track could echo far beyond this suburban campus just outside Washington, raising concerns about the plight of nonrevenue sports at universities nationwide and perhaps the makeup of future United States Olympic track teams.
Division I Football Bowl Subdivision universities must offer a minimum of 16 intercollegiate sports, including eight for women. Joel Maxcy, an associate professor of sport and recreation management at Temple University, said that given the economic climate and the increasing pressure for success from the revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, he expected ''more universities to cut sports toward that minimum.''
Such moves are expected despite track's having high participation at the collegiate level. According to the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association, the sport ranks first among women and second among men in participants at Division I universities. Among minority athletes, women's track was No. 1 and men's track was second in participation.
''You put those numbers next to what's happening at Maryland, and it shows that we have to do a better job of selling ourselves,'' said Sam Seemes, the chief operating officer for the coaches association. ''Most university administrators aren't sure what to think of our sport. Most students don't know when the big meets are. Because of that, we have the potential for a lot more Marylands out there.''
Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, said Maryland was like a majority of F.B.S. programs in that it runs a large operating deficit. He calculates the median operating deficit nationwide to be about $10 million. In today's economic climate, retaining programs like Maryland track, no matter how successful, does not add up at most universities, he said.
At Maryland, Valmon acknowledged that as the coach of the men's and women's teams, he was expected to do more than train athletes these days. ''You have to be ready to fund-raise, to reach out to large donors, to keep your program running,'' he said.
Track's marquee event, the Summer Olympics, usually does little to spur interest or generate income at the collegiate level. Seemes said the Olympics, which will open in late July in London, were too infrequent to benefit most track programs.
But Valmon contends that the coming London Games could help Maryland's fund-raising. ''At least track and field will be more in the news as we build toward London,'' he said.
With the Millrose Games moving out of Madison Square Garden after a nearly 100-year run, the premier track events held annually in the United States that the casual fan knows about have dwindled to the Penn Relays, the N.C.A.A. championships and a handful of others.
''If collegiate track meets were attended even at 50 percent of what revenue sports are, we wouldn't be having this discussion,'' said Greg McMillan, an exercise physiologist and elite coach based in Flagstaff, Ariz. ''We have plenty of athletes entering the sport, and we even have a recession-resistant running boom going on, but those in charge can't seem to get the sport positioned for TV or gain a clear focus on how the sport of track and field should operate.''
If nonrevenue programs like Maryland men's track continue to be eliminated, it could eventually affect how the United States Olympic team is assembled. Although few college athletes go on to compete in the Olympics, their university programs have been top training sites in the past. Nehemiah, for example, once headlined the Terrapins' success; Steve Prefontaine was the face of Oregon track, with Marty Liquori serving the same role at Villanova and Jim Ryun at Kansas.
''In the U.S., the traditional route for most professional athletes is to attend a Division I school, then turn pro,'' Barbara MacLeod, an economics professor at Ohio Wesleyan University, said in an e-mail. ''In Europe, however, most sports competition occurs through clubs, not schools.''
MacLeod added: ''If many other colleges follow Maryland's lead to cut track, I believe we'll see a resurgence of club activity. The end result will be reconfiguring of competition, but not a detriment to U.S. Olympic prospects.''
If sufficient money is not raised, Maryland men's track will cease to exist by July 1, the last day of the United States Olympic track and field trials in Eugene, Ore. Such an occurrence would mean Valmon would be in charge of the United States men's squad but would not have a collegiate men's team to return home to.
''That's something I try not to think about,'' said Valmon, who had only two full scholarships for men's track when he took over at Maryland in 2003. ''Right now, we're determined to turn this thing around. We've gotten over the initial shock. We're moving forward to do the best we can to save our program.''

HEADLINE: Turkish Border Businesses Miss the Syrian Neighbors

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting from Istanbul.

 BODY:
GAZIANTEP, Turkey -- In the old bazaar of this ancient city, long entwined with Syria, the loud chatter of Syrians' bartering in Arabic has given way to unfamiliar silence.
There is no sign of the 40,000 Syrians who trekked each month to the gleaming Sanko Park shopping mall here to buy designer head scarves or discounted Gucci shoes. There is no more need for public announcements in both Turkish and Arabic. Many came from Syria's largest city, Aleppo, just 60 miles away.
''We miss the Syrians,'' said Ercan Nacaroglu, surveying his empty jewelry store, and adding, ''We hope the crisis will stop, because it is killing the local economy.'' 
Only a year ago, Turkey and Syria were close allies, as Turkey's governing Muslim-inspired Justice and Development Party sought to expand the country's economic influence and grow into a regional power. Their 500-mile border is Turkey's longest; during the Ottoman Empire, Gaziantep (pronounced gahz-ee-AHN-tep) was part of Aleppo Province. For its part, Syria remains suffused with Turkish influence, from Ottoman architecture to the continuing popularity of Turkish soap operas. Trade between the two countries had more than tripled since 2006, to $2.5 billion in 2010.
Turkish officials tried for months to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to halt the violent crackdown against a civilian uprising that began in March, but finally, and emphatically, turned against the Syrian government.
In combination with sanctions imposed by the Arab League, the European Union and the United States, Turkey's own tough measures -- including freezing the Syrian government's assets -- are slowly beginning to choke Mr. Assad's rule.
But businesspeople here complain that the rupture cuts both ways.
On Monday, more than 150 Turkish truck drivers protested after they were forced to leave their vehicles in Syria and walk to the Turkish border; Damascus had closed down its crossing near Urfa, in eastern Turkey. The drivers told Turkey's NTV news channel that Syrian looters had stolen their tires and batteries. Turkish companies, which relied on Syria as a transit route to the Middle East, have begun bypassing Syria, shipping goods via Iraq and the Mediterranean instead.
Syria last week unilaterally suspended its free trade agreement with Turkey, retaliating to the Turkish sanctions by introducing taxes of up to 30 cents on Turkish goods entering Syria. Turkey did the same.
Here in this large industrial center of 1.7 million people, everyone from olive vendors to owners of large textile conglomerates complained that the shifting geopolitics was proving bad for business, even if, as Turkey's economy minister, Zafer Caglayan, said last week, Syria suffers more than Turkey, which is its second-largest export market after China.
Turkish sellers are harder hit than buyers: imports from Syria amounted to just 0.3 percent of Turkey's total last year, while 10.6 percent of Syria's came from Turkey.
Turkey's decision to become the voice of regional outrage against the Assad government has also divided the identities of some in a city where Turkish and Arab culture have commingled for centuries.
Emre Hadimogullari, 22, an electrical engineering student in Gaziantep, is so irate at the Turkish government's policy in Syria that he has grown a long beard in protest. Mr. Hadimogullari is an Alawite whose grandparents found themselves Turkish citizens when his hometown, Samandag, formerly part of Syria, was ceded to Turkey in 1923. Mr. Hadimogullari expressed a kinship with Mr. Assad, also an Alawite, and said he believed that the reports of atrocities in Syria were exaggerated. Turkey, he insisted, should stop playing the part of regional police officer.
''Turkey should mind its own business and stop interfering in another country's affairs,'' he said.
Huseyin Qebed, a marketing analyst from Aleppo and one of few Syrians remaining in Gaziantep, said the crisis had not harmed his relationship with his Turkish friends, though these days he avoided talking about politics. The Turkish sanctions, he added, were harming all Syrians, including the demonstrators whom Turkey purported to support. ''The sanctions won't solve anything,'' he said. ''Costs are rising for everyone.''
Turkish businesspeople here also questioned the wisdom of sanctions, even as they acknowledged that Mr. Assad's brutality could not go unanswered.
Cengiz Akinal, vice president of Akinal Bella, a large shoe manufacturer that imports bows for its shoes from artisans in Syria, said that the Turkish tax increase on goods from Syria was forcing him to import bows from China. On the upside, he said, Arab League countries boycotting Syrian shoe companies were turning to his.
Mr. Akinal, whose ancestors imported leather from Syria during the Ottoman Empire and produced shoes for the sultans, said that Akinal Bella, which exports about 70 percent of its shoes to Middle Eastern countries, had benefited handsomely from Turkey's courtship of the Arab world. But he warned that Turkey's newly assertive stance could backfire.
''I want the rebellion in Syria to be over,'' he said. ''Bad relations with Middle East countries are bad for business.''
Some businesspeople said they expected to wait years before Syria and other countries upended in the Arab Spring, like Egypt and Libya, would stop being buffeted by unrest, rebuild their economies and become attractive markets.
Mehmet Ali Mutafoglu is vice president of the Akteks Group, a large textile company that has two factories in Syria making products such as synthetic yarn and cotton. He sells to the Syrian market as well as to Europe and the Middle East. Syria's unstable economy had depressed demand there by 40 percent since March, when the uprising began.
Mr. Mutafoglu, who still travels regularly to his Syrian factories, said he had noticed a conspicuous cooling of many Syrians' ardor for Turkey, which had been intense just months ago, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan presented a modern Muslim face to the world. ''Before the crisis, Syrians loved us,'' he said. ''If Erdogan had run for election in Syria, he would have won 99 percent of the vote. Now he would get 1 percent.''
Fetullah Askin, general manager of Altinoluk, a travel agency here that used to run four buses daily between Gaziantep and Aleppo, said that now there were none, due to security concerns. To offset the decline, Mr. Askin is promoting trips to Mecca.
Despite the economic sacrifices, Mr. Askin said that the repression of the Assad regime justified the Turkish government's taking action. ''Syrians are our brothers,'' he said. ''When one brother makes a mistake, we have to try and help him fix it.''

HEADLINE: E-Books, Shmee-Books: Readers Return to the Stores

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Facing economic gloom and competition from cheap e-readers, brick-and-mortar booksellers entered this holiday season with the humblest of expectations.
But the initial weeks of Christmas shopping, a boom time for the book business, have yielded surprisingly strong sales for many bookstores, which report that they have been lifted by an unusually vibrant selection; customers who seem undeterred by pricier titles; and new business from people who used to shop at Borders, the chain that went out of business this year.
Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, said that comparable store sales this Thanksgiving weekend increased 10.9 percent from that period last year. The American Booksellers Association, a trade group for independents, said last week that members saw a sales jump of 16 percent in the week including Thanksgiving, compared with the same period a year ago.
At the R. J. Julia bookstore in Madison, Conn., sales of adult trade books in November rose 30 percent over last year, said Roxanne J. Coady, the owner. 
''Last year was just depressing,'' Ms. Coady said by telephone. ''It was the beginning of the e-reader, and we didn't know what that meant. Somehow, this year, people are back to thinking of books as an appealing gift.'' Considering the economy, she added, ''Adult books being up right now feels crazy to me.''
Sales are up 15 percent from last year at Next Chapter Bookshop in Mequon, Wis., the store's owner, Lanora Hurley, said, speculating that she may have been helped by the closing of a Borders store about seven miles away.
''We're just going gangbusters and having a great time,'' Ms. Hurley said, adding cautiously that she was concerned that it would not last. ''I have to say, I'm worried about January. Everybody's going to open their electronic device for Christmas.''
Analysts are predicting enormous sales for new e-readers and tablets from Barnes & Noble and Amazon in the coming weeks (despite mixed reviews of Amazon's new color tablet), a factor that has many in the industry concerned about the future of retail stores. The closing of Borders, the second-largest book chain in the country, is also expected to hurt publishers' overall sales numbers.
Jamie Raab, the publisher of Grand Central Publishing, said there was ''no question'' that holiday sales would be hurt by the loss of Borders. ''That's like 650 stores that aren't here,'' she said. ''The best way to get gift ideas is by roaming around stores. I think it's a really dramatic loss.''
Nevertheless, booksellers and publishers said they were still hoping that there would be a healthy enough interest in print books that the two formats could coexist.
They have been closely watching the performance of print books this holiday season, which so far has not produced a monster surprise hit like last year's ''Autobiography of Mark Twain,'' the 500,000-word best seller from the University of California Press that was rushed back to press six times by mid-November.
But there has been a rich selection of nonfiction, some booksellers pointed out, praising publishers for the breadth of biographies, histories and quirky pop-economics titles released this fall.
Popular biographies include ''Steve Jobs'' by Walter Isaacson; the critically acclaimed ''Catherine the Great'' by the historian Robert K. Massie; and ''Spencer Tracy'' by James Curtis; as well as memoirs from Diane Keaton, Regis Philbin and Gabrielle Giffords, the Democratic congresswoman from Arizona who was shot in January.
Books by media pundits like Chris Matthews, Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck have pushed to the top five on the New York Times nonfiction hardcover best-seller list. ''Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination That Changed America Forever,'' by Mr. O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, reached the No. 2 spot on the list for the week ending Dec. 3.
''This year so far, it's been the year of nonfiction,'' said Peter Aaron, owner of the Elliott Bay Book Company in Seattle, citing ''The Beauty and the Sorrow,'' a history of World War I by Peter Englund, and ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' by the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, an exploration of thinking and intuition. ''What's extraordinary about the books that are out there is that they've been so well written and such a pleasure to read. Maybe people have an appetite for nonfiction right now, just for some sort of grounding in reality.''
In fiction, titles that have emerged as popular holiday gifts are ''The Dovekeepers '' by Alice Hoffman; ''The Marriage Plot'' by Jeffrey Eugenides; ''1Q84'' by Haruki Murakami; and ''The Angel Esmeralda,'' a story collection by Don DeLillo. Reliably bestselling authors like Michael Connelly, Stephen King, Janet Evanovich and John Grisham have all released novels in recent weeks, and Mr. King and Ms. Evanovich are second and third on the Times hardcover best-seller list for the week ending Dec. 3.
A handful of glossy, expensive hardcover books have emerged as sleeper successes. ''Harry Potter Page to Screen,'' a $75 book published by Harper Design, an imprint of HarperCollins, has been on best-seller lists for weeks, despite its intimidating price. Alberto Rojas, a spokesman for HarperCollins, said there were currently 140,000 copies of the book in print.
''Mountain,'' an $85 photography book subtitled ''Portraits of High Places,'' has been a popular item at the King's English Bookshop in Salt Lake City, said Anne Holman, the general manager, along with ''The Louvre,'' a dazzling art book with a picture of every painting on display from the permanent collection of that museum. The store has seen its sales rise at least 7 or 8 percent over last year's holiday season, Ms. Holman said.
''One thing that we noticed a lot of this year is that there are a lot more big, beautiful coffee-table books,'' she said. ''Expensive, $50 and $75 books that we're selling hand over fist.''
At the Tattered Cover bookstores in Denver, a surprise seller has been ''The Art Museum,'' a $200 survey of world art organized in ''rooms'' and ''galleries,'' said Cathy Langer, the lead buyer, who has reordered from the publisher several times.
''I'm not seeing the price resistance that usually occurs,'' Ms. Langer said. ''Maybe people are just tired of being afraid to spend money.''

HEADLINE: Amid Paeans to Cuomo, Some Less Lofty Notes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is enjoying his Emperor Hadrian moment. His many legislative victories come accompanied by festive celebrations and loud huzzahs.
So Maria Bartiromo, the CNBC anchor, travels to Albany to preside over a joyous allocation of money for regional economic development. So, in the wake of his income tax deal, senators and assemblymen rise and declaim on his greatness.
''Our friend, the great governor,'' Thomas W. Libous, a Republican state senator, hails the governor. ''The most popular governor in the world,'' proclaims Senator Kevin S. Parker, a Democrat. 
A Democratic assemblywoman, Earlene Hooper, peered 400 years back into history to King James I, saying this liege had united his kingdom as Mr. Cuomo had the state. (''When you read from the King James Bible, that is 'the' King James,'' she noted.) The governor, she said, ''is leaving a legacy greater than we could have possibly imagined.''
Where the assemblywoman was going is not precisely clear, but her enthusiasm was considerable.
The governor's legislative talent and his ability to purr and growl and reduce opponents and even friends to more incoherence than is typical are well known. But last week he offered a few notes that spoke to more eternal political values, like rewarding allies, even when they are a little unsightly.
Let's turn to the business of his regional economic development awards. Pledging to break with the bad old days of economic development grants wired for the powerful, the governor created regional councils, stocking each with civic leaders, unionists, business people and politicians who would learn to talk across geographic and psychic barriers.
Each council submitted a ''vision statement'' and a list of big projects. The Cuomo administration last week picked the winners and distributed $785 million.
There was an immediate oddity; New York City, by far the most populous region and which has the county with the state's highest unemployment rate, the Bronx, received just $66.2 million, or $37 million less than the North Country regional council, which has vastly fewer people.
Much of Mr. Cuomo's economic development money was not new so much as repurposed, a homely adjective best reserved for varieties of bologna. In years past, state agencies would have financed most of these projects out of their own budgets. The state housing agency would shoulder its share of a fine senior housing project in East New York; another state agency would kick in for volleyball, basketball and handball courts in Cooper Park, near Newtown Creek.
The state's single biggest award in the New York region was $29.5 million for the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx. That sounds terrific. But state officials had already pledged $50 million to match a similar amount put in by New York City. Seen in this light, last week's ballyhooed money drop was a down payment on a previous commitment.
Then there is the matter of the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council. The Brooklyn Democratic boss, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, has long treated this well-heeled nonprofit group as his principality, ensuring that city and state officials demonstrate their pleasure with him by showering money on it.
Of late, clouds gathered. The city's Department of Investigation discovered that Ridgewood Bushwick officials had overlooked fraud and that some salary increases had acquired a hallucinogenic quality. Christiana Fisher, the group's executive director, saw her pay rise to $782,000 in the 2009 fiscal year, from $336,000 the previous year.
How do I get on that pay elevator?
Several criminal investigations into Ridgewood Bushwick remain active. The social services agency, which has done some good work over the years, might walk clear of this. Or it might not.
That might argue for the Cuomo administration's giving it a pass in this most high-profile of grant allocations. Instead state officials gave not one, not two, but three allocations to Ridgewood Bushwick, totaling $845,000. And the state passed over many other strong competing applications. To cite one example, the West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing expected to receive more than $1 million to build senior housing in the Bronx and received nothing.
When I asked Josh Vlasto, the governor's press secretary, about this, he labored to make an absolutist of me. ''Your logic is that this group should not get any more money from city, state or federal,'' he said. The Ridgewood Bushwick proposal, he said, ''was reviewed independently, on the merits, through an open review process.'' I asked to see those state scoring sheets.
Mr. Vlasto said he'd get back to me.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Files Suit to Recoup Losses in Stanford Case

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday sued the Securities Investor Protection Corporation in an effort to help customers who lost money to the Stanford Financial Group file claims for reimbursement. 
The S.E.C. and SIPC have been sparring in recent months over whether Stanford customers are eligible for protection under its rules. SIPC backs customer accounts at brokerage firms against failure much like the F.D.I.C. insures bank deposits.
Unlike the F.D.I.C., however, SIPC does not regulate brokerage firms or conduct examinations of their businesses and accounts. The investor protection corporation is an industry-backed group financed by assessments on brokerage firms.
Stanford Financial, owned and operated by R. Allen Stanford, managed more than $7 billion of customer money that was supposed to be invested in safe, high-yielding certificates of deposit. In 2009, federal authorities seized the bank, and the S.E.C. described the company in a court filing as a ''massive Ponzi scheme'' in which Mr. Stanford used the proceeds from 21,500 customers in part to finance a lavish lifestyle.
SIPC has said that because the investments were certificates of deposit that were sold by a bank, they were not eligible for its coverage, which is restricted to accounts at brokerage firms. The S.E.C. has argued that Stanford Financial included a brokerage firm, and that many customers opened brokerage accounts in order to buy the C.D.'s. They were given papers upon purchase of their certificates that indicated that the transaction was covered by SIPC, the commission said.
In a filing in Federal District Court in Washington, the S.E.C. asked for a court order compelling the investor protection corporation to begin a liquidation of the Stanford Group, the brokerage firm.
Though there are thought to be few if any assets at the firm, the liquidation filing is a necessary step to allow customers to begin the quest to recover their losses. Investors are covered for losses of up to $500,000 if a brokerage firm fails.
''Stanford's financial advisers used the apparent legitimacy offered by U.S. regulation of Stanford's U.S. brokerage subsidiary in order to generate sales'' of the certificates of deposit, the S.E.C. said in its filing.
The Stanford scheme began coming apart when redemptions increased in 2008 and early 2009, in part because of the financial crisis, to the point where incoming funds were no longer sufficient to meet investor withdrawals.
Mr. Stanford is in jail awaiting trial on 14 criminal counts related to the investment business. The S.E.C. also has filed a civil suit against him.
SIPC officials could not be reached for comment Monday evening. In 2009, SIPC said that Stanford customers were not entitled to coverage under its policies. In June, the S.E.C. said it had decided that investors should be covered by the insurance; the investor protection corporation said it would issue a decision on whether to heed that ruling by mid-September.
Since then, the two sides have been in negotiations, but they were unable to reach a deal. The S.E.C. has been under pressure from several members of Congress to get SIPC to disburse funds to harmed customers.

HEADLINE: Trying to Shine In the Shadow Of a Neighbor

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AURORA, Colo. -- Second Banana. Tonto to the scene-stealing Lone Ranger. Name the pejorative of disrespect or neglect and this sprawling city, forever in Denver's shadow as the gawky suburb that outgrew its britches, has probably endured it.
No matter that in raw population count, Aurora is the third-largest urban area in Colorado, with 325,000 people, and the 55th biggest city in the nation, according to the census. In a state where consciousness of cool is a finely honed art -- from hippie-tinged Boulder to the snow-clad condo culture of the mountains -- Aurora is widely dismissed as a desert, entirely devoid of culture, cachet and clout. 
''Aurora is a place to stop for gas on your way to somewhere else,'' said Lamonte Purham, a construction worker who has lived here since coming to Colorado from St. Louis 12 years ago.
But powerful forces are now pushing Aurora to a new spot in the firmament, and challenging the hierarchy of power that for generations has long put Denver -- the state's capital and largest city, to Aurora's west -- at the center of everything.
Last week, the state's highest court approved a new political map that finally gave Aurora a Congressional district, the sixth, to anchor and call its own after 40 years of work by the city's elected officials through four census counts and remapping exercises. For the first time, candidates will have to pay court here and kiss the ring. Previously, the city was carved up by two districts, which compounded the divisions of three counties that touch boundaries within the city.
''We'll have a political base and be recognized as a political base,'' the city's mayor, Stephen D. Hogan, said in an interview in his office.
Economic ambition is also stirring.
A proposed huge new convention center and hotel complex near the Denver International Airport (Denver owns the airport, while Aurora was left, tellingly, with much of the empty land around it) is laying claim to some of what Denver has largely monopolized for decades in the business conference trade.
Mr. Hogan said he thought Denver would be better for a little challenge from the project, called Gaylord.
''Competition is good -- it's going to make the downtown Denver Convention Center people work harder,'' Mr. Hogan said. ''In the end, that will help the whole region.''
Some Denver City Council members are not so sure. A study in October, commissioned by a downtown business group, said Denver would lose $186 million over four years in reduced hotel, restaurant and convention traffic if Gaylord went forward.
''There is strong evidence that it would have a negative impact,'' said Robin Kniech, a Denver council member. ''And we are not through our economic difficulties.''
The 2012 presidential election is also likely to find a focus here in Aurora, raising the city's profile as Democrats and Republicans again try to sort out the battle lines in a once securely Republican state that is no longer predictable.
Arapahoe County, stretching east from here out onto the prairie, was, like most Denver suburbs, long safely Republican. But the county supported President Obama in 2008 and then went for a Democrat again in 2010 in the governor's race, in embracing Denver's mayor -- now governor -- John W. Hickenlooper. Whether two elections make for pattern or aberration is the new calculus.
''To the extent we have visitors back East wanting to know what's going on in Colorado politics, I will be sending them to Aurora and Arapahoe,'' said Floyd Ciruli, a political analyst and pollster.
Mr. Ciruli said he thought the new Sixth Congressional District centered on Aurora would probably be competitive for a Democrat, but that in contrast to Colorado's largest city, Denver (strongly Democratic) and second-largest, Colorado Springs, (strongly Republican), Aurora in third place is quirky and unpredictable.
The state legislators from the city are mostly Democrats, while the leadership at City Hall, including Mr. Hogan, is mostly Republican.
In some ways, Aurora has a feel not unlike Queens, N.Y. It is a polyglot place of minorities and strivers, like Queens, with Hispanics, blacks, Asians and other groups making up 53 percent of the population, and a big dominating neighbor next door.
Many residents here moved out of Denver, seeking homes and land during the housing boom, which left a mark here with acres of new homes but a high foreclosure rate when the boom ended.
At places like Teremok, a Russian restaurant that opened last April in a seen-better-days shopping strip, hope for Aurora's rising seems incorporated into the business plan.
''We're still waiting for better times,'' said Alex Baumstein, the manager, who is originally from Moscow but came to Aurora 19 years ago.
The restaurant, sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a storefront church, reflects the reality of a city with no real downtown or center: businesses cluster in islands, some better than others.
Mr. Hogan said the combination of economic ambitions like Teremok's and Gaylord's, combined with demographic and political realities, made for a train that would not be stopped. At some point in the future, he said, the biggest city in Colorado will be a suburb -- his suburb.
''Someday we're going to be bigger than Denver,'' he said. ''We have the land, we have the water, we have the opportunities.''
But for all his boosterism, when he travels and people ask where he is from, Mr. Hogan does not say Aurora, at least right away.
''I say metropolitan Denver -- I'll admit to it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Keystone Claptrap

 BODY:
The Keystone XL oil pipeline has become the House Republicans' weapon of choice in their fight with President Obama over jobs and taxes. Mr. Obama has said he will not make a decision on the pipeline until 2013. The Republicans are insisting that he approve it now and have attached an amendment to a bill extending the payroll tax cut in hopes of forcing his hand. 
This legislative booby trap seems unlikely to make it through the Senate, and the president has all but said he would reject it if it does. But this has not stopped the House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, from using the pipeline as a political cudgel -- or from wildly inflating its economic benefits.
The pipeline, known as Keystone XL, would be built by a Canadian company to carry heavy crude oil 1,700 miles from the tar sands in northern Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast. It is opposed by environmentalists because extracting the oil from Canada's boreal forests would generate more greenhouse gases than conventional oil drilling. It is opposed by politicians and voters from both parties in Great Plains states that the pipeline would cross.
Mr. Boehner calls Mr. Obama's delay ''theatrics'' and described the project as a ''no brainer'' that will create ''tens of thousands'' of jobs immediately. This is a fairy tale, implying not only short-term but permanent benefits. The pipeline company, TransCanada, says the project could create 6,500 construction jobs annually, most of them temporary.
The State Department, the lead federal agency on the project, also estimates 6,500 temporary jobs. And the only independent study, conducted by Cornell University's Global Labor Institute, concludes that it may generate no more than 50 permanent jobs when the work is done.
Contrary to another favorite Republican argument, the pipeline will also do little to reduce America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil. Though it would provide a steady source of crude for Gulf Coast refineries, existing contracts and business plans indicate that most of their output will be destined for export.
In the Senate, the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, calls the Keystone XL ''a shovel-ready project.'' He and Mr. Boehner should look again at the environmental downside and at the negative public reaction along the proposed route through sensitive terrain. They should also take a look at the job numbers. The only shovel this project is ready for is the one that will bury it for good.

HEADLINE: More Graduate Seminar Than Political Debate

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - If Newt Gingrich is the Republican nominee and President Obama accepts his famous challenge to seven three-hour Lincoln-Douglas-style debates, viewers might find them only on C-SPAN and should plan to have plenty of black coffee on hand.
At least that was one take away from a two-man, unmoderated debate of a mere 90 minutes between Mr. Gingrich and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who at one point, when asked if he had more to add, said, ''I see my daughter nodding off, so let's move on.'' 
Devoted to foreign policy and national security, the debate on Monday was set to include 10 topics. In true graduate-seminar style, the candidates covered only half the ground.
It was an unusual hiatus from the Republican nominating race that has reached a phase of high drama with much at stake for the fractured field. But none of that urgency or competition seeped into the auditorium at St. Anselm's College, where Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Huntsman were unfailingly collegial, seeming to agree on almost all points.
Mr. Huntsman, the former Utah governor who is so far behind the rest of the field in national polls that he was excluded from an ABC debate on Saturday in Iowa, missed a chance to sharply define himself thanks to the high profile foil of Mr. Gingrich, who drew a large news media contingent.
Mr. Huntsman even seemed to make a joke at his own expense. ''If the good speaker becomes the nominee, he'll have to overcome our very formidable operation on the ground here in New Hampshire,'' he said.
Both men displayed wide knowledge of world events. Speaking on China, where he recently was American ambassador, Mr. Huntsman spoke in Mandarin while citing what officials used to tell him, then translated it as, ''In China, we have politics too.''
''They used to say that to me too,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''I never knew what it meant.''
Both candidates agreed that terrorism was a long-term threat. Mr. Gingrich compared it to the decades-long Cold War. Mr. Huntsman said, ''As far as the eye can see in the 21st century we have a terror problem.''
The subject that generated the most intense discussion was a nuclear Iran. ''All options need to be on the table and mullahs need to know,'' Mr. Huntsman said.
Mr. Gingrich: ''The idea you'll wage a bombing campaign to take out all of Iran's nuclear program is a fantasy.''
''You have to say to the Iranians you dismantle your program or we start to takes steps that will stop you,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''Serious economic steps, serious political and psychological and diplomatic steps.'' He suggested a gasoline embargo because the country, despite oil reserves, has only one refinery and imports 40 percent of its gasoline.
There was discussion of Israel, but Mr. Gingrich did not repeat recent controversial remarks about the legitimacy of the Palestinian cause.
Other topics covered included debt and defense spending, the Arab Spring and Pakistan. After an hour and a half, when the moderator offered the candidates a chance to hit the remaining five topics in a lightning round and they declined, the audience seemed to collectively sigh with relief.
But both candidates pronounced themselves pleased with the format. ''This is what we should have a lot more of,'' Mr. Gingrich said, ''because this is very substantive.''
Mr. Huntsman got in the subtlest of jabs by referring to a year-end debate that Donald Trump plans to moderate. Mr. Gingrich has agreed to attend, but Mr. Huntsman has turned it down, saying recently that he would not ''kiss the ring'' of Mr. Trump.
''I can't wait to compare and contrast this format with the Donald Trump debate with the speaker,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Russian Mogul Joins the Race Against Putin

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY and ANDREW E. KRAMER; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- There were no balloons or streamers at the hastily arranged news conference on Monday where Mikhail D. Prokhorov announced that he would challenge Vladimir V. Putin in this spring's presidential elections: just Mr. Prokhorov on the podium, looking grave.
Mr. Prokhorov, the billionaire who is majority owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball franchise, became famous in Russia as a playboy, with the tabloid nickname ''the Holiday Man.'' He has long walked a fine line in his relationship with the Kremlin, maintaining a degree of independence while rebels among his fellow oligarchs ended up in exile or in prison.
Mr. Prokhorov's announcement, which prompted gasps from reporters in the room, was the latest wild card in a week that seemed to return real politics to Russia. Tens of thousands of middle-class urbanites gathered Saturday to vent their anger over tainted and noncompetitive elections. Aleksei L. Kudrin, a longtime Putin adviser and former finance minister, declared Monday that he plans to help found a party to represent reform-minded voters. 
Mr. Prokhorov, 46, has the resources to pose a real challenge to the Kremlin if he chooses. Over the years, he has sometimes made accommodations -- like firing the editor of a newspaper he co-owned that had obliquely criticized Mr. Putin. Other times he has pushed back, as in September, when he clashed with Kremlin political strategists and was unceremoniously kicked out of his pro-business party, Right Cause. He spent the next two and a half months in a kind of political exile, until Monday, when he said he would run for president.
''I think the society is waking up, whether we want it to or not,'' he said. ''That part of the government which does not establish dialogue with society, it will have to go in the near future. Serious changes are taking place in the world, and a new kind of man is emerging.''
All day, liberals buzzed over the question of whether Mr. Prokhorov was a candidate who could truly represent them. The columnist Anton Orekh, writing for the Web site of Ekho Moskvy radio, allowed that ''at the moment, he represents far from the worst option.
''Prokhorov is definitely not a Chekist,'' or K.G.B. officer, he wrote. ''Prokhorov will not try to build some parody of the Soviet Union. Prokhorov will not tell us antediluvian ghost stories about NATO and America and spend half the budget on the production of obsolete tanks.''
Others were distrustful, arguing that Mr. Prokhorov had entered politics with the Kremlin's blessing. The Kremlin strategist Vladislav Y. Surkov said in an interview published Tuesday that he supported the creation of ''a mass liberal party or, more precisely, a party for the annoyed urban communities.'' Some saw hallmarks of this strategy in Mr. Prokhorov's announcement.
''I hope it is his own wish, not a proposition to play the role of a spoiler,'' said Andrei Dunayev, a leader of Right Cause. ''If he wants it himself, then I will support him wholeheartedly. If he is taking the role of a spoiler because someone has proposed it to him, then it is disgusting.''
At his news conference on Monday, Mr. Prokhorov offered no political platform, saying he would publish it later. He showed a glint of cold anger toward Mr. Surkov, who was behind his removal as head of Right Cause in September. Asked how he would overcome the obstacle Mr. Surkov poses to his presidential hopes, Mr. Prokhorov smirked and said, ''I think I need to become his boss.''
He said his long period of seclusion had been spent doing the secret, meticulous work of preparing for a bid for the presidency. When he said entering the race was the most serious decision of his life, it sounded like the truth.
''We were not allowed to do what we wanted,'' he said. ''It is not in my nature to stop halfway.''
Mr. Prokhorov's relationship with the Kremlin has been a cipher for years. He became wealthy in his 20s, aided by warm ties with the government of President Boris N. Yeltsin, when he formed a fortuitous partnership with Vladimir O. Potanin, a deputy prime minister who oversaw privatization.
They bought shares in one of the assets being privatized, the Norilsk mine and smelter complex in the Siberian Arctic, a grim, polluting site first built by slave labor. It was also immensely valuable, the source of one-fifth of the world's nickel and half its palladium.
Those were the days when oligarchs seemed poised to rise to the highest levels of politics. Their position became strained when Mr. Putin came to power in 2000, vowing to eliminate the oligarchs ''as a class,'' instead surrounding himself with former security agents.
At a now-famous Kremlin meeting, Mr. Putin told the oligarchs they could keep their fortunes if they stayed out of politics.
Mr. Prokhorov and Mr. Potanin made accommodations. In 2004, the pair fired the editor of a newspaper they owned, Izvestia, for publishing criticisms of Mr. Putin's handling of the Beslan siege that year, in which militants took more than 1,000 hostages at a school. More than 300 people were killed when explosions rocked the school and Russian forces raided it.
A few years later, Mr. Prokhorov seemed to fall out of favor, amid reports he was declining to sell his shares in Norilsk back to the government during a wave of nationalizations championed by Mr. Putin.
He was compelled to sell after an embarrassing arrest in the French ski resort of Courchevel, when authorities investigated allegations he had made prostitutes available to his guests at a holiday party. Coverage of the episode contrasted his otherworldly wealth with the hardships of his Siberian miners. Mr. Prokhorov spent four days in jail, but was later cleared of all charges.
He has since embraced his playboy image with self-deprecating humor, founding a magazine called Snob.
In the end, he sold his Norilsk shares to another businessman, not the state, and serendipitously -- at the peak of the market. He entered the global recession mostly rich in cash, but with an uncertain future in Russia.
Though Mr. Prokhorov was formally endorsed by the Kremlin to lead a liberal party last spring, difficulties followed soon enough, leaving his true standing in the eyes of the leaders unclear.
When he was elected leader of the Right Cause party in June, pro-Putin youth activists parodied his arrest in France by yoking a line of leggy young models to a cart carrying a businessman. Days before his ouster from the party in September, police officers in masks raided one of his banks in Moscow in a ritual show of force sometimes inflicted on Russian businesses that fall from favor, called a masky show. The bank said the raid concerned a client's legal troubles.
His ouster from Right Cause culminated in a theatrical moment when Mr. Prokhorov denounced Mr. Surkov as a ''puppet master'' and dismissed the party system as a sham. In an interview the next day, he tempered his comments, casting himself as a participant in a behind-the-scenes struggle over political and economic policy.
''In Russia, all fights are on the inside,'' he said. ''You cannot look at the administration and the government as a monolith. There are lots of people with different ideas, and they are becoming more polarized as the situation in Russia and the world is changing.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Iraqi Premier Signify Shift to a Postwar Partnership

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Steven Lee Myers and Scott Shane contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, welcoming Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to the White House on Monday, said that after nearly nine years of war, Iraq had become a ''sovereign, self-reliant and democratic'' country that could serve as a model for aspiring democrats across the Middle East.
Mr. Obama, who as a young politician labeled Iraq a ''dumb war'' and campaigned on a pledge to end it, used language reminiscent of the Bush administration to justify the costly commitment of American lives and treasure. Thanks to these sacrifices, he said, ''what we have now achieved is an Iraq that is self-governing, that is inclusive and that has enormous potential.'' 
The two leaders appeared at a news conference after a morning of meetings, and a solemn wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, meant to mark a historic milestone in the relationship between the countries as the last American military convoy prepared to roll out of Iraq this month.
Yet the meetings also underscored the nations' continuing ties, with Mr. Obama making it clear that the United States would supply Iraq with military hardware and training for years to come. The administration announced it would sell 18 more F-16 fighter jets to Iraq, helping rebuild an air force destroyed by war, and Mr. Maliki said he was seeking other military equipment.
History will judge whether the decision to go to war was a mistake, Mr. Obama said. But he and Mr. Maliki both tried to keep their focus on the future, describing a partnership that they said would extend far beyond security to trade, energy investment and educational exchanges. Iraq's economy was projected to grow faster than that of China or India, Mr. Obama noted.
Still, the complexity of the relationship was also in plain view, particularly regarding a split over how to respond to the brutal crackdown in Syria. Mr. Obama has imposed sanctions and called for President Bashar al-Assad to step down, saying his ''capacity to retain legitimacy inside Syria, I think, is deeply eroded.'' Mr. Maliki, while affirming support for the Syrian people, said he did not have ''the right to ask a president to abdicate'' and did not favor a trade embargo.
Mr. Obama acknowledged there were ''some different tactical views in terms of how best to transition to an inclusive, representative government inside of Syria.'' But he added that he respected Mr. Maliki's decision.
The White House meetings, and the wreath-laying, were part of a choreographed series of events to draw the war to a close. On Wednesday, the president and his wife, Michelle, will travel to Fort Bragg, N.C., to thank the troops for their service. Next week, a ceremony in Iraq will include the furling of the military's colors, which signifies the end of the mission.
This will be a season of homecomings, Mr. Obama said, as military families around the country are ''reunited for the holidays.''
In a few weeks, the American military force that invaded almost nine years ago, and still numbered 150,000 when the president took office, will have shriveled to a vestigial presence of military liaison officers and embassy guards. Mr. Obama acknowledged that the embassy in Baghdad would maintain a larger-than-normal security force -- a decision that has aroused criticism among some Iraqis. He said that measure was necessary to protect diplomats or American civilians working in the oil sector who might be targeted by militant groups.
Mr. Maliki and Mr. Obama sent an indirect warning to Iran not to meddle in Iraq after the Americans leave. Iraq, the prime minister said, speaking through an interpreter, follows a foreign policy ''which does not intervene in the affairs of others and does not allow the others to intervene in its own affairs.''
Despite his assertion of Iraqi sovereignty, Mr. Maliki made it clear that Iraq would depend on the United States for military equipment and training. His most fervent answer of the news conference came when he made a pitch for Congressional approval of the 18 fighter jets.
''The military hardware creates a surrogate relationship with the American military,'' said Kenneth M. Pollack, director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. ''It also sends a message to Iran.''
Unresolved issues include the status of Camp Ashraf, where thousands of dissident Iranians have been labeled terrorists and detained, and what will happen to the last remaining prisoner being held by the American military in Iraq, Ali Musa Daqduq, a Lebanese suspected of being a Hezbollah operative and accused of involvement in a 2007 raid by Shiite militants in Karbala that resulted in the deaths of five American soldiers.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who joined Mr. Obama for his meeting with Mr. Maliki and met later with the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said Mr. Daqduq's fate was ''still a matter of discussion.''
Outside the White House, about a thousand supporters of the Iranian dissident group the Mujahedeen Khalq, known as M.E.K., rallied to demand that the group be removed from the State Department's list of terrorist groups, and that the residents of Camp Ashraf be protected. They waved yellow banners and were addressed by Tom Ridge, the former secretary of homeland security, and other former senior officials, who support their demands.

HEADLINE: Court To Weigh Arizona Statute On Immigration

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the space of a month, the Supreme Court has thrust itself into the center of American political life, agreeing to hear three major cases that could help determine which party controls the House of Representatives and whether President Obama wins a second term.
The court announced Monday that it would decide whether Arizona was entitled to impose tough anti-immigration measures over the Obama administration's objections. The case joined a crowded docket that already included challenges to Mr. Obama's signature legislative achievement, the 2010 health care overhaul law, and a momentous case on how Texas will conduct its elections.
The Texas case, which on Friday the court agreed to hear, could cause as many as four seats in the United States House of Representatives to change party control.
''It's not just that these are big cases, but these are big cases that echo in the political arena,'' said Nathaniel Persily, a professor of law and political science at Columbia University. ''There is now a judicial forum for airing these political disputes.'' 
Arizona enacted its immigration law last year, and the Obama administration promptly sued to block four parts of it, saying they could not be reconciled with federal laws and policies.
The challenged provisions include a requirement that state law enforcement officials determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if officials have reason to believe that the individual might be an illegal immigrant. That provision also requires that the immigration status of people who are arrested be determined before they are released.
The law also makes it a crime under state law for immigrants to fail to register under a federal law and for illegal immigrants to work or to try find work. In addition, it allows the police to arrest people without warrants if they have probable cause to believe that they have done things that would make them deportable under federal law.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked all four provisions.
Applauding the Supreme Court's decision to review that ruling, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, was harshly critical of the administration.
''I was stunned at the audacity of the Obama administration to file suit against an individual state seeking to safeguard its people,'' Ms. Brewer said in a statement. ''That shock turned to outrage as the federal government proceeded to file suit against three more states -- South Carolina, Alabama and now Utah -- that followed Arizona's lead.''
The health care and immigration decisions are likely to land in June, in the heat of the presidential campaign.
The court must act much faster in the Texas case, where its decision on Friday to stay the use of a set of election maps, created by federal judges, has thrown election planning there into disarray. Political observers believe that the new maps would increase the influence of Hispanic voters and thereby increase the number of Democrats in the House.
The court's precedents point both ways in the health care case, and it is hard to say what the outcome will be. In the Arizona and Texas cases, recent decisions suggest that a majority of justices may look favorably on the positions of state officials, which would entail upholding the Arizona immigration law and rejecting at least a part of the court-drawn maps in Texas.
In May, the court upheld a different Arizona law, one that imposed harsh penalties on businesses that employed illegal immigrants. In a 2009 decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, expressed skepticism about the continuing vitality of a part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the court in Texas relied on in substituting its own maps for ones drawn by the Legislature.
Legal scholars and court historians struggled to think of another recent Supreme Court term in a presidential election year with a similar pileup of cases with sharp political and societal consequences. The political impact of the term's rulings may, moreover, be amplified by the court's decision last year in Citizens United, which unleashed unlimited campaign spending by corporations and unions.
Some experts pointed to 1992, which featured a major abortion ruling and other big decisions. But the current term may be most reminiscent of the showdown between the Supreme Court and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, when the court struck down major pieces of New Deal legislation as well as a New York law establishing a minimum wage for women and children.
''There was a whole series of blockbuster cases, each with massive political implications and economic consequences for the country,'' said Jeff Shesol, the author of ''Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court.'' That description sounds rather like the current term.
There is a great deal of happenstance in the shaping of a Supreme Court docket, and the fact that several cases arrived at the court at once does not necessarily suggest an agenda. The last term was lackluster; this one is lively.
''In most of these cases, it's a coincidence of timing,'' said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Texas.
The justices had little choice, for instance, in agreeing to hear a challenge to the health care law, as federal appeals courts were divided over its constitutionality and the Obama administration joined its opponents in urging the court to act quickly. But the Supreme Court did not have to signal that the case was a once-in-a-generation blockbuster by scheduling an extraordinary five and half hours of arguments.
The court had more options in deciding how to act on a request from officials in Texas in the redistricting dispute. The court could have stayed out of the matter, effectively endorsing the maps that favored Democrats, which were drawn by a special three-judge court in San Antonio that ignored a separate set of maps drawn by the Republican-dominated Legislature.
The Supreme Court could have sent the case back to the special court, directing it to give more deference to the Legislature's maps. Or the justices could have jumped in feet first. They took the boldest route.
It was, similarly, not a sure thing that the justices would accept the Arizona case, which was one of several cases in the federal pipeline involving tough state anti-immigration laws. Lower courts had not issued a final ruling on the Arizona law, giving the justices plausible reasons to wait. Instead, they chose to weigh in on one of the most combustible issues in American politics.
Supreme Court decisions routinely have political consequences, of course, sometimes quite direct ones. In 2000, 11 years to the day before the court agreed to hear the Arizona case, the court effectively decided a presidential election, in Bush v. Gore.
Putting that case to one side (as the court has, never citing it), court watchers have to go back two decades, at least, to think of Supreme Court terms as politically consequential as the current one.
Eric J. Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, pointed to the term that ended in June 1992, which included major cases raising fundamental issues of abortion, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and school desegregation. The most important of those decisions was Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed the core of the right to abortion established by Roe v. Wade.
In the new crop of cases, too, the court may yet avoid creating political earthquakes.
''I would not be surprised at all if they are looking at Solomonic ways to avoid trouble in an election year,'' Barry Friedman, a law professor at New York University, said of the justices.

HEADLINE: An Italian Chocolatier Revives Its U.S. Campaign

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
PERUGINA, the Italian chocolate maker best known for its Baci line of foil-wrapped, bite-size hazelnut chocolates, once enjoyed prominence with American consumers, with the brand advertising nationally on television and in magazines from the 1960s through the mid-1980s.
When Nestle bought Perugina in 1988, however, the brand stopped advertising on television and scaled back print advertising, doing so only intermittently in the 1990s and ceasing altogether after that. 
''When Nestle bought Perugina in the 1980s, the United States was no longer a priority for Nestle, because they wanted to focus on Italy,'' said Federico Giorgio Marrano, the Perugina export manager for the United States for Nestle Italy.
But now Perugina is introducing its first major advertising and marketing campaign in America in decades, focusing specifically on Baci, which translates to ''kisses.''
The campaign, which features the slogan, ''Say I love you the Italian way,'' features couples sharing romantic moments and emphasizes Baci's ties to Italy, where it is the top-selling chocolate brand, with a 9.2 percent share of the $3.46 billion chocolate market, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.
''The consumer insight from where we start is that American people love the Italian lifestyle, and one of the most important parts of that lifestyle is romance and passion,'' said Mr. Marrano, who moved to Manhattan from Italy several months ago for this effort.
The ads, by Square Root Creative, an advertising and Web design agency in Manhattan, also give prominence to what Baci calls ''love notes'' -- quotations from literary or anonymous sources on a translucent slip of paper that comes wrapped in each candy.
Alysha Burch, chief executive of Square Root, said that reading the enclosed note is customary in Italy. But when the agency conducted consumer research it learned that many Americans who ate Baci were oblivious to the note, assuming perhaps that the slip of paper was just packaging.
''The love notes are such a big part of the brand essence, but what we found in America is that not many people realize that it's in the wrapper,'' Ms. Burch said.
While some of the photos in the ads show couples in Italian settings, the settings were not so emphasized that the ads look like a tourism bureau put them out.
''Perugina is looking to target a younger demographic to rejuvenate the brand, and more than just showing a rolling hillside in Italy, we really wanted to convey the love part of it and the emotional side of it,'' Ms. Burch said.
Some ads promote sweepstakes for a trip for two to Italy, which Perugina is giving away in a cross-promotion with Colavita, Sbarro and the airline Alitalia.
The ads began appearing in the December issue of Cooking Light, and in advance of Valentine's Day, will appear in the February issues of publications including Redbook, Good Housekeeping and Every Day With Rachael Ray.
Chocolate in heart-shaped boxes and other Valentine's Day packaging accounted for $297 million in sales in 2011, behind Easter chocolate, with $538 million, and Christmas chocolate, which is projected to reach about $400 million, according to Mintel, a market research firm.
In line with the notion that candy may not only be recession-proof but actually benefit from downturns as consumers seek simple comforts, sales of chocolate in the United States have risen every year since 2006, from $15.78 billion in 2006 to a projected $18.06 billion in 2011, an increase of 14.4 percent, according to Euromonitor.
Chocolate has been less robust in the struggling economy of Italy, with total sales dropping from $3.52 billion in 2008 to $3.37 billion in 2009, and dropping again to $3.28 billion in 2010 before rising slightly this year, according to Euromonitor.
''In Italy now the market is quite flat, so we're trying to develop the international market, and the first priority in the international market right now is America,'' said Mr. Marrano, from Nestle.
Because New York is the leading market for Perugina in the United States, with the city accounting for 20 percent of sales nationally, the brand is focusing on local promotions.
At Eataly, the Italian food hall in the Flatiron District, Vivien Reimbelli, the master chocolatier for Perugina, traveled from Italy to teach chocolate-making classes last Friday and Saturday.
New Yorkers browsing for other Italian brands may encounter Perugina, too. At Fiat of Manhattan on 11th Avenue at West 51st Street, for instance, a Fiat 500 in the showroom is fully wrapped in the Baci logo, as is a Vespa scooter at Vespa Soho. Both locations are handing out samples of the chocolate, too.
Nationally, meanwhile, the brand will be decidedly easier to find. Perugina recently expanded distribution to include Wal-Mart, as well as the supermarket chains Kroger and ShopRite.
Cybele May, the founder of the popular Web site Candy Blog, said Americans unacquainted with Baci should expect something quite different from the foil-wrapped morsel more common to these shores.
''It's a lot more decadent than a Hershey's Kiss,'' Ms. May said. ''Baci is more intense, with a dark chocolate coating, a combination of textures with a whole hazelnut and hazelnut pieces in a cream center.''
She welcomed the news that Perugina will be easier to find.
''I remember them being a lot more visible, especially during the holidays, and getting them for Christmas,'' said Ms. May, who grew up in Pennsylvania and now resides in Los Angeles. ''I think they deserve a wider visibility, and I would love to see Baci more available.''

HEADLINE: Romney Run Puts Spotlight On Past Job And Peers

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, will attend fund-raisers in Manhattan given by his former private equity peers and Wall Street bankers, putting the spotlight on the private equity industry and Mr. Romney's role in it.
Mr. Romney, a co-founder of Bain Capital, will spend time at the sprawling Park Avenue apartment of his former rival and sometime deal partner, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group. He will also be toasted at the Waldorf Astoria by James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who helped orchestrate many of the private equity industry's biggest deals, along with a smattering of other senior executives from the bank. 
(Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive and a longtime Democrat, will not be among them; as a board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he is prohibited from raising money for political candidates, and it is still unclear which candidate he will support.)
While the fund-raisers are likely to generate many thousands of dollars and galvanize support among Mr. Romney's former peers, they may also give an opening to critics like the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Already, Americans United for Change, a pro-union Democratic group, has begun a campaign comparing Mr. Romney to Gordon Gekko, the Michael Douglas character in ''Wall Street.'' It has even started a Web site, RomneyGekko.com.
The private equity industry's titans have long been worried this moment would come - and about the effect Mr. Romney's presidential campaign will have on the industry.
''If he is a nominee, well, hold your seats,'' Henry Kravis, the co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, told a room of executives at a dinner in Hong Kong last month, according to Reuters.
''They're going to describe us all as asset strippers; we're flippers of assets, we just put on a lot of debt, fire a lot of people and that's how we make money,'' he added. ''You know that's not the case. That's absolutely not what we do.''
''There is no doubt that the Obama administration will clearly come out after Mitt Romney and the whole private equity industry,'' Mr. Kravis said. ''Mitt Romney may become the single source of all U.S. unemployment by the time the election happens.''
A looming issue for the private equity industry is the tax treatment of what is known as carried interest. Private equity executives pay only the capital gains rate - 15 percent - on most of their income instead of the ordinary income rate, which in their case would typically be 35 percent.
So far, however, Mr. Romney has managed to dodge most efforts to brand him as a true Gordon Gekko. And the private equity industry has managed to avoid becoming the focal point of criticism, which instead has been directed at the Wall Street banks.
The crucial question is whether that will change as the campaign becomes more heated. Already, Republican rivals like Newt Gingrich are seizing on his track record at Bain Capital. On Monday, Mr. Gingrich suggested that Mr. Romney ''give back all the money he earned from bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years at Bain.''
But Mr. Romney appears to have kept a studied distance from the most current Gilded Age. A profile of Mr. Romney in The New York Times on Sunday about his relationship with money described a penny-pinching cheapskate who enjoyed flying on JetBlue and frowned upon ostentatious displays of wealth - hardly the lavish spending habits of some of private equity's current kingpins. (Mr. Romney does, however, have a soft spot for real estate.)
In truth, while Mr. Romney may be worth several hundred million dollars, he is a pauper next to the founders of the biggest firms since he left the industry in 1999, well before the bubble of the next decade that produced billion-dollar riches.
Mr. Romney's opponents, of course, have combed through his former deals at Bain looking for tales of excesses and failure. Perhaps the worst deal he worked on - which has been highlighted by several news organizations - was the buyout of Dade International, a medical company, which filed for bankruptcy after Bain had cashed out with $242 million.
But criticism about the Dade deal has not stuck as a true talking point, in part because the details painted a complicated story.
Dade was on the verge of bankruptcy when Bain originally bought the company. While Mr. Romney made cuts at the company, he also invested heavily, turning it into the industry leader. At one point, he pushed back against colleagues who wanted to flip the business for a quick profit and instead directed them to make an acquisition to bolster it.
It was only after Dade had been turned around that Bain and the company's other investors leveraged the company up even more and paid themselves a huge dividend, saddling the company with too much debt.
Some critics contend that private equity firms are skilled at cutting costs at businesses but can choke off growth with large amounts of debt. In the context of the government's budget, Mr. Romney's embrace of streamlining may just be what's in order, but it still poses political challenges.
Mr. Romney's former colleagues are quietly waiting to see whether he will try to leverage - pun very much intended - his role at Bain in his campaign or will continue to shy away from it.
While Mr. Romney often invokes his broad experience at Bain, he has typically avoided getting into the details of the private equity business, seemingly to avoid the negative connotation that the industry has for some Americans.
But given the clear bipartisan sense that the United States government is marred by inefficiency and is in need of a turnaround, it will be interesting to see whether he tries to highlight the details of his private equity work as a way to demonstrate how he would run the country.
In 2007, Mr. Romney famously said of his private equity work that ''sometimes the medicine is a little bitter, but it is necessary to save the life of the patient.''
Some critics have taken that quotation to suggest he is a heartless mercenary. Others have said that the nation may need a dose of the same kind of medicine.
How well Mr. Romney manages those perceptions may determine whether private equity makes it into the White House.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Fed's Message

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The commitment of the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to increase the Fed's transparency and improve its communications (''For a More Open Fed,'' Reuters Breakingviews, Business Day, Dec. 8) is a welcome move, given that the central bank performs such vital tasks on behalf of Americans and the global economy. For far too long, it has operated in an opaque and confusing manner. 
Beyond disclosing how and why its decisions are made, the Fed's revamped public relations strategy should help reduce the wild market swings that occur before and after Fed announcements, as investors try to guess what it will report and the effect of its actions.
We agree that Mr. Bernanke would get less criticism of his actions if he better managed the central bank's message. But in light of a near institutional collapse in Americans' faith in the financial sector after the Great Recession, the Fed has quite a challenge before it.
At a certain point, all businesses, government agencies and financial bodies must realize and accept that we are firmly in the digital age. A commitment to greater transparency should not be viewed as a nice-to-have strategy but as a foundational principle for how business and government operate and communicate with the public.

HEADLINE: Dec. 13, 1981 | Poland Cracks Down on Solidarity Movement

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Dec. 13, 1981, authorities in Poland imposed martial law in a crackdown on the pro-democracy Solidarity labor movement. 

 BODY:
On Dec. 13, 1981, authorities in Poland imposed martial law in a crackdown on the pro-democracy Solidarity labor movement, which had made numerous strikes since August 1980 that challenged the Communist Polish government. 
The New York Times wrote, "The military rule was announced in a broadcast at dawn by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the prime minister and Communist Party leader, who said a strict regime was necessary to save Poland from catastrophe and civil war. Hours before, Solidarity leaders meeting in Gdansk had proposed holding a national referendum on forming a non-Communist government."

The government brought thousands of Solidarity members into custody, including its leader, Lech Walesa, who would spend the next 11 months in prison. It suspended Solidarity, outlawed "All strikes, demonstrations, protests, meetings and public gatherings other than those for religious services," and imposed a 10 p.m. curfew, according to The Times. Tanks patrolled city streets to impose the orders. Martial law officially remained in place until 1983, though even then, many civil liberties were not restored.
The declaration did little to slow the Solidarity movement, which went underground and continued to organize pro-democracy demonstrations. Solidarity gained international support and Mr. Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. The Polish government was condemned internationally and the United States imposed economic sanctions against it.
The Polish government continued to lose support through the 1980s, especially as its economy collapsed. After a wave of strikes in 1988, the government agreed to negotiate with Mr. Walesa and Solidarity leaders. In 1989, the government agreed to legalize trade unions and introduce a democratically elected legislature and an office of the presidency. In June 1989, in Poland's first free elections since the 1920s, Solidarity won nearly all the seats in the two legislative houses. In 1990, Mr. Walesa was elected as Poland's president, holding the position until being defeated in 1995.
Connect to Today:
In May 2011, President Obama visited Warsaw, Poland. He met with Solidarity leaders as well as young democracy activists who had just returned from Tunisia, where they offered youth leaders of the revolution there advice based on the Polish experience. The president said that the success of Poland in overthrowing communism and transitioning to democracy could provide a model for the Arab countries that had revolutions this past year.
According to The New York Times, "The critical element, he said, was to put institutions in place, so that new democratic governments can legally guarantee the rights of minorities and a free press, and that are resilient enough to survive the ethnic conflicts sure to arise in some countries."
What are some similarities and differences between the social and political conditions surrounding Poland's shift to democracy in the late 1980s and those of the North African and Middle Eastern countries striving for change today? Do you believe the lessons of Poland and the Solidarity movement can effectively be applied to the Arab countries? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: Who Counts as 'Rich'? Continued

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: For all the debate over whether and how much to tax the rich, just who is "rich" is not completely clear, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Last week, Catherine Rampell posted a commentary on a new Gallup poll on the question of who is "rich" in America. The median threshold in the poll's responses was that rich is $150,000 a year of income or a net worth of $1 million. Because I have asserted that the rich need to pay more taxes if we are to get out of our fiscal mess, and even Republicans say that government benefits for the rich should be cut off, the question of who is rich is politically important.
The first thing to know is that there is no formal definition of who is rich, middle class or poor. Of course, there is an official definition for the poverty rate, but that figure is just a back of the envelope calculation that has simply been increased by the inflation rate since the 1960s. There are many other ways of calculating the poverty rate that could either raise the poverty threshold or reduce it.
Another problem is that one's social class is a function of both income and wealth. There are many among the elderly who have little income but may have fairly substantial wealth by, for example, owning a home free and clear. At the other end, there are those with high incomes who are, nevertheless, deeply in debt, perhaps even having a negative net worth.

Social class also involves self-identification. According to the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago, which has been asking people what social class they belong to since 1972, more than 90 percent of Americans put themselves squarely in the middle - belonging either to the working class or the middle class.
Historically, less than 6 percent of people identify with the lower class - well below the poverty rate, which was 15.1 percent in 2010 - and about 3 percent with the upper class. Not surprisingly, the economic crisis has increased the ranks of the lower class and working class and reduced the ranks of the middle class and upper class.
Of course, social class is also a question of perception. A family that has temporarily fallen on hard times might still view itself as belonging to a higher social class than its income justifies. Therefore, it is also useful to look at how people identify their income class. The results are not dissimilar to those above - the vast bulk of people see themselves as being broadly in the middle.
Another factor that might shape people's perceptions of their social class and what, if anything, the government ought to do to improve the distribution of wealth and income is the prevalence of mobility.
Republicans often oppose policies that would equalize incomes on the grounds that today's poor could be rich tomorrow and vice versa. Data from the General Social Survey show, by and large, that people believe they have a pretty good chance of improving their economic condition, but probably less so than Republicans believe.
These data are confirmed by various New York Times polls, the latest of which, in October, found that 67 percent of people believe it is still possible to start out poor in America and become rich. Only 32 percent said that it was not possible. The peak of optimism came in February 2000, when 84 percent of people said it was possible for average people to become rich. The stock market peaked a month later. The trough came in January 1983, when only 57 percent of people thought they could become rich. That was right on the brink of an economic boom.
Times polls also cast light on the issue of mobility. In a 2005 poll, people were asked about their social class when they were children compared with today. People generally saw themselves as better off today.
Since 1989, The Times has asked people whether they think future generations will be as well off as people today. In October, 26 percent said that future generations would be better off, 22 percent said they would be the same and 46 percent said they would be worse off.
The peak of optimism was also in February 2000, when 44 percent said future generations would be better off and 27 percent said they would be worse off. The trough came in March 1995, when 16 percent of people thought future generations would be better off and 58 percent said they would be worse off. This was also right on the brink of an economic boom.
When people are asked whether it is the responsibility of government to reduce income inequality, they mostly disagree, but not strongly. The data for 2010 show an increase in the percentage of people opposed to income redistribution that may reflect the influence of the Tea Party movement.
The Times poll in October, however, found that only 26 percent of people thought the distribution of money and wealth was fair, with 66 percent saying it should be more evenly distributed.
Obviously, the question of who is rich in America is extremely fluid. The commonly used threshold of $250,000 is certainly reasonable, but it is nevertheless questioned by those who have such an income but also have equally high expenses, such as children in expensive Ivy League schools.

HEADLINE: In Lower Manhattan, a Light Show Looms

BYLINE: MEREDITH HOFFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The city is now accepting bids for a lighting initiative that aims to "transform the experience of Lower Manhattan at night." 

 BODY:
It sounds like a scene straight out of Las Vegas or Orlando: streets magically illuminated by an interactive light show, complete with 3-D effects and lights that respond to kinetic pedestrian motion.
But this futuristic vision is being pitched for button-down Lower Manhattan; the city Economic Development Corporation is now accepting bids for a lighting initiative that, according to the request for proposals, "will transform the experience of Lower Manhattan at night."
"This is the sort of thing that's never been tried in N.Y.C.," said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, which will accept proposals until the end of February. He said the displays would serve locals and visitors alike in promoting a rapidly developing area that too many tourists overlook, especially after business hours.
The city hopes to complete two lighting installations by the end of 2012, possibly on the strip of South Street between Fletcher and Whitehall Street, and in the public plaza bordered by Broad Street, Wall Street and Exchange Place. Other suggestions in Lower Manhattan are welcome, however, and the criteria for proposals are broad. Ambitious artists, technologists and other creative minds can send in ideas on the corporation's Web site.
Julie Menin, the chairwoman of the area's Community Board 1, hopes the project will help the economy and foster safety in the neighborhood, where she said locals had complained of insufficiently illuminated streets.
"We don't want something that creates a circus-like atmosphere," she said. "We want something tasteful, to emphasize historical facades, but most importantly economic development, jobs - anything to create more revenue for small businesses."
Wall Street Rising, a nonprofit group that Ms. Menin helped lead after 9/11 to encourage the neighborhood's recovery, previously led a similar initiative called "the Corridor of Light," which lit 15 buildings in the area to draw people back to the neighborhood after the attacks.
But this project will have a minimum life span of three years, and the final product will be distinct for New York, said Mr. Pinsky, who envisions Shanghai's bold waterfront spectacle as a potential model for the new local project.
"We're being deliberately broad in terms of discretion given to respondents," he said. "We're anxious to see what New Yorkers come up with."
The economic corporation would provide the winning bidder with up to $1 million over the first three years, which would supplement other money - grants, commissions and corporate sponsorship, for example - that the bidder would be expected to obtain.
And although the city's guidelines explicitly say that using residential buildings for projections "should be avoided where possible," some residents said they were still concerned about the potential for intrusive displays.
Alexis Abbonozio, a Pace University student living in a Wall Street apartment, said she would rather see a project with no lighting.
"This place is already lit up too much," Ms. Abbonozio, 24, said of the block, which has been filled with more tourists than usual since Occupy Wall Street began.
"If it brings more tourists I'm going to throw up," said Daemon O'Neil, Ms. Abbonozio's neighbor, who lives in a rental property managed by TF Cornerstone. But when he weighed the costs and benefits of a light display, he conceded, "Why not?"
"It's growing as a residential neighborhood," he said about the financial district. "For us to have more is a great thing."
And as long as the installations do not resemble Times Square or detract from the nighttime quiet of his "neighborhoody" block, Yachtz Radcliff, 32, a Wall Street resident, said he was in favor of the project.
On his afternoon stroll, with a lit cigar held at his side, he tried to imagine the dazzle.
"It sounds fantastic, if it adds to the culture of the neighborhood," he said.

HEADLINE: They Don't Care About Deficits

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And they never did. 

 BODY:
Ezra Klein:
There are two very different tax-policy conversations playing out in the Republican Party right now. In Washington, House Republicans are arguing with each other over how small of a temporary tax cut to give the middle class. Out on the primary trail, the Republican presidential candidates are arguing over how huge of a permanent tax cut to give the wealthy.
...
All of which leaves the Republican Party in an odd place: skeptical of a temporary tax cut for the middle class that carries a price tag in the low hundreds of billions of dollars and is fully paid for but apparently enthused over permanent tax cuts for the rich that cost trillions of dollars and aren't paid for at all.
But it's not odd at all, once you realize that the GOP is not now, and never has been (at least not since the 1970s) concerned about the deficit. All the fiscal posturing of the last couple of years has been about using the deficit as a club to smash the welfare state, with the secondary goal of frustrating any efforts on the part of the Obama administration to help the struggling economy. 
The entire debate has been fake. If you don't understand that, or can't bring yourself to admit it, you're missing the whole story.

HEADLINE: An Officer Falls

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Death rarely pounces on police officers in the line of duty these days, but it remains an eternal possibility. Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
 Police Officer Peter J. Figoski never stood a chance. He didn't even have time, the Police Department said, to pull his gun before a man described as a career criminal killed him in Brooklyn Monday morning with a bullet to the face. 
 That's usually how it is with New York police officers: The gun almost always stays holstered, even when danger lurks. This is true despite the efforts of some New Yorkers who, driven by their own agendas, would have people believe otherwise. It is true despite a few monumental foul-ups seared in civic memory, like the police killings of the unarmed Amadou Diallo in 1999 and the similarly unarmed Sean Bell in 2006. 
 This is an annus horribilis for the New York police, with some of the troubles having been of their own making. 
 More than a dozen officers were arrested in a ticket-fixing scandal. Two others were sent to jail in the case of a young woman who said they had raped her in her apartment. Yet another was arrested and charged with grabbing a woman off the street and raping her at gunpoint. Just a few days ago, several officers were found to have posted offensive Facebook comments about the annual West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn. 
And the department as a whole has stood accused of being overly rough at times with Occupy Wall Street protesters. 
 But none of that alters the reality that policing can be a risky proposition, with death in the line of duty an eternal possibility. 
 Dozens of readers expressed appreciation of that inescapable fact as they reacted to the killing of Officer Figoski, 47, in comments to City Room. The officer, who had been on the force 22 years, was responding with his partner, Officer Glenn Estrada, to a report of a robbery in progress. Lamont Pride, a 27-year-old with a substantial criminal record, was arrested and identified as the shooter. 
 If there is a silver lining in this terrible episode, it is perhaps in a realization that while death may loom for police officers, it rarely pounces these days. Monday's horror was the first shooting death of a New York officer since 2007. 
 Over the last 13 years, starting in 1999, 10 officers have been fatally shot by suspects, Officer Figoski included. In eight of those 13 years, there were no such killings at all. Compare that with the previous 13 years, from 1986 to 1998. During that period, firearms claimed the lives of 37 officers. Police Department figures for officers wounded by gunfire show a similarly sharp decline. 
 Hand in hand with the reduction of violence against the police is a comparable reduction in the use of force by the police. That isn't surprising. With violent crime having greatly receded over the past decade, "criminals and police enter into conflict less often," the department said in its yearly firearms-discharge report, issued just before Thanksgiving. 
 The report showed that by almost any measure, officers are keeping their guns holstered more than ever before - certainly since records began to be kept in 1971. 
 In 2010, the number of shooting "incidents," to use the police language, reached a record low: 92. Contrast that with 332 incidents in 1991 or an eye-popping 994 in 1972, a much wilder and woolier era. Bear in mind, too, that only 33 of those 92 episodes involved officers' firing at a suspect intentionally. The rest included instances when guns went off accidentally, when officers killed themselves, or when the police felt they had to shoot animals.
 In the most important categories of all - deaths and injuries as a result of police fire - the department reached all-time lows: 8 people killed, 16 wounded. 
 Inevitably, there are self-anointed experts in police science who say there is never a time when an officer should use his gun. "That's what the proper use of pepper spray is for," one man wrote in reaction to a brief mention of these figures by me two weeks ago. 
 Tell that to the parents or to the brother or to the four daughters left behind by Officer Figoski, who never stood a chance.

HEADLINE: 'llegals'

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Addressing readers' objections to the word "illegals," as I used it in my last column. 

 BODY:
A number of readers have written or tweeted their objection to my use of the word "illegals" as shorthand for "illegal immigrants." A couple of samples from the in-box:

        
I am bothered by your use of the word "illegals" in your recent column ("The Good Newt"). I am writing to you personally because comments are already closed for your piece at nytimes.com.
        
"Illegal" is an adjective, not a noun.
        
This is not simply a matter of grammatical correctness. Shortening "illegal immigrants" to "illegals" reduces human beings to a status label, and a morally loaded one at that. It reduces the essence of a person to an act of violation, an offense. When you use "illegals" as the object of a sentence it literally erases the human beings who the sentence is about and makes the grammatical object of the sentence an abstraction, a label of condemnation.
        
This paper ran a thoughtful editorial several years back titled "What Part of 'Illegal' Don't You Understand?," which highlighted some of the problems with using the value-laden and over-determined adjective "illegal" rather than alternative words like "unauthorized" or "undocumented." I highly suggest reading it.
        
If you choose to refer to people who have immigrated to this country without the authorization of the U.S. Federal Government or those who stayed past the expiration of their visas as "illegal immigrants" that is your prerogative. It is a morally loaded rhetorical choice that reduces the essence of a person to a status label, and it is not a choice I agree with, but it is your choice to make and it is not technically an incorrect one.
And this:

        
I am wondering if you refer to rapists and murderers as "illegals." This is a made-up word with an agenda, which is why I had a difficult time reading your otherwise informative piece.
        
We can't have a civil conversation about immigration in this country with this derogatory, made-up word tossed around. As a Latina, who was born and raised in the United States, I find this deeply offensive.
        
 Also, it is important to note the complexity of simply labeling people "illegals." Many immigrant families, as I have seen here in California, have mixed status households. One spouse will lack documentation while another spouse is a U.S. citizen. (It isn't enough to marry a U.S. citizen to gain papers anymore.) Or, the parents are undocumented and the children are U.S. citizens.
Just to be clear, I used the word only to refer to people who are actually in this country illegally. I was careful not to apply it to families, which are often of mixed legal status. And I used it in a context where the subject was their legal status.
I checked the NYT style book, and found the guidance not terribly helpful. The entry is not explicit on "illegals." It says only this: "Illegal immigrant is the preferred term, rather than the sinister-sounding illegal alien. Do not use the euphemism undocumented." 
All labels are reductive. Liberals. Hispanics. Evangelicals. It's a curse of language that clarity (and word limits) means simplification. And it did not seem to me that "illegals" is more reductive than "illegal immigrants," or that either is offensive if it is accurate. On the other hand, it's generally a bad idea to use words that distract readers from the substance of what you are trying to say.
For further guidance I turned to Phil Corbett, The Times newsroom's arbiter of style and taste. His response was, as usual, a dose of good sense: 
I had a feeling you would be hearing from folks on this one.
Yes, while it's not explicit in the style book, our practice is to avoid "illegals" as well as "illegal aliens," and on the other hand, to also steer clear of the euphemistic "undocumented workers."
I do think "illegals" as a shorthand noun has an unnecessarily pejorative tone, and it is routinely used by the anti-immigration side. I think it's wise to steer clear. We also get push back over "illegal immigrant," but to me that's just factual and neutral. However, I also encourage people to follow the lead of Julia Preston [who covers immigration issues for The Times] and look for more explicit descriptions when appropriate in specific cases, both to avoid formulaic repetition and to provide more information: "who overstayed his visa," "working without a legal permit," "who entered the country illegally," etc., etc.
It might be worth cautioning against "illegals" in the style book entry, though if i do that, I will wait for a decent interval - otherwise some suspicious observer will assume the change is aimed at you.
It's treacherous ground, as Julia can attest.
Well, vigilant readers, the good news is, you seem to have gotten the style book updated. And I'll resist that particular shorthand in the future.

HEADLINE: To the City's Top 1%, a Third of the Income

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: The richest of the city's rich get about 34 percent of all income earned by New Yorkers. On the other hand, they pay more than 43 percent of the city's personal income taxes. 

 BODY:
The very rich are, well, very rich. A new study says the 34,000 or so New Yorkers who constitute the top 1 percent of earners collected more than one-third of all the income earned in the city in 2009. Their average income was $2.2 million, and they reaped 58.3 percent of dividends and interest, 84.6 percent of business income, and 84.7 percent of capital gains. 
And 2009 was a lousy year.
"Because the city's economy contracted and financial markets took a beating in 2009," according to the study by the city's Independent Budget Office, "estimates of the percentages of income received and tax liability borne by the most affluent city residents are likely to be lower than comparable estimates obtained from data of other recent years."
In 2007, when income from dividends and interest was substantially higher, the top 1 percent collected nearly half of the total adjusted gross income - 45.3 percent. They were also responsible for 57.8 percent of the city's personal income tax liability in 2007. 
In 2009, the 1 percent collected 33.8 percent of income and paid 43.2 percent of the income tax -- allowing the 1 percent to claim that they are bearing more than their share of the tax burden.
Still, mourn not for the 1 percenters of New York City: they are doing better than their counterparts across the country: In 2009, the richest 1 percent of Americans were paid a piddling 17 percent of the total national income.
The study was requested by Councilman James S. Oddo, a Staten Island Republican.
"I did it because I wanted to inject some facts into the rhetoric," Mr. Oddo said Tuesday. "You can earn $105,000 and be in the top 10 percent: a cop with seniority working a little overtime, a nurse, a principal, and I don't think anybody would consider those folks rich."
The study found that the 340,000 filers in the top 10 percent each made more than $105,400. They received 58.2 percent of total personal income and paid 71.2 percent of the city's personal income tax.
Average income for all city residents who filed tax returns was $66,580.
A third of all tax filers who reported incomes had no personal income tax liability because their incomes were too low or they received tax credits or both.

HEADLINE: The Life Report: James Opie

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS


HIGHLIGHT: The life reports are in. Meet James Opie. 

 BODY:
My father's small business was founded in November of 1929, a month after the stock market crashed, and my parents were both marked by the Great Depression. I remember well the respect my parents exercised toward older people, their church, and their bank. Sharing a life of continual hard work and thrift, my parents also shared lighter moments with many friends, who entertained each other in their homes, at little cost. Our family went out to restaurants two or three times a year, at most. My father was an extraordinarily hard working and versatile businessman who rolled up his sleeves to work on every piece of equipment in his small plant. I never met, and will surely never meet, anyone who worked harder to amass a million dollars than my father.
Just as young people now overestimate the ranges of possibilities open to them, my father underestimated the range of possibilities open to my generation. He saw a narrow gate at the same time the American gate was growing wider. Born in the late 1930s and early 1940s and taught to "buckle down" and "keep your nose clean," by the 1960s my generation had the winds of prosperity to its back. A young person could experiment, flounder, stray off-track, and still return to an orderly life. While many stuck to the straight-and the-narrow, that was but one option.
In 1962 I graduated from a state university in Ohio without any notion of what to do for a living. Having married just out of college---at that time a pregnant girlfriend spelled "marriage,"---I was surprised when a rural high school near my university was willing to hire me as a teacher. My young wife turned out to not be pregnant after all, and a walloping shock struck a year later when she left to visit her parents for a few days, never to return. Knowing I had failed dismally as a husband but not understanding how, this blow and responses to it gradually stirred new feelings and interests. Inner realignments began touching an inarticulate quality of
While teaching in the rural high school, I came to see that even the dullest students knew more than I did about life. Most could subsisted through a barren economy by growing and harvesting crops, fixing farm equipment with bailing wire, raising and slaughtering animals, and by being good neighbors. Although I liked the students and probably did relatively little harm, I was a terrible teacher. Moreover, next to most of the students, I knew nothing.
After two years in that high school, single again, restless and unwilling to pretend to "teach" for another year, I drove to California, to a place someone extolled once over a glass of beer: Big Sur. How appealing it sounded and how extraordinary it was. A summer there awakened me to the infinite depths of nature, and to pot.
The Vietnam war was in full swing by that time and, needing to avoid the draft, in the fall of 1964 I enrolled in graduate school in the same university in Ohio from which I had graduated. This began a period of great confusion---" A series of crises involving the law, a broken ethical yard-stick, and ongoing inner mayhem led to a siege of sleeping sixteen and eighteen hours a day---surely "clinical depression"---that only lifted with an inner experience proving beyond doubt that something inside us knows more than we do.* A week later, on the heels of this revelation, I took LSD for the first time, experiencing inner and outer dimensions beyond words and concepts. Even "God" was too small a word.
I managed to get through the spring term before returning to the place that made the most sense to me, Big Sur, where I participated in the memorable summer of 1965. What sublime, unearthly realizations, and earthly dissolutions, awaited me along the coast and among the redwoods. For months I stayed stoned on pot, sleeping in a sleeping bag in the forest, and trying to re-evoke my first experiences under LSD.
Also, I tried to
My stable upbringing provided unseen moorings to which I began to turn in 1966. Renting a thirty-five dollar per month one-room house in Sand City, California, just north of Monterey, I wrote, walked among sand dunes, and began reading the writings of P. D. Ouspensky and G. I. Gurdjieff. Called by my draft board for a physical exam and likely induction into the Army, once inside the induction center I handed leaflets I had written, questioning our engagement in this war, before being stopped. The commanding officer and I negotiated an agreement leading to a handwritten note of his, which I still possess: ""
(What an amazing nation, in which a young "nobody" can confront military power in this way.)
With nothing publishable to show for writing efforts, in 1967 I moved to the Bay Area and began substitute teaching in inner city schools in Oakland. For several weeks, I sat in a high school hallway, by my presence keeping students from breaking windows in classrooms facing the hallways. Soon I was hired full-time in a junior high school where, during off hours, I continued to read books by and about Gurdjieff. Influenced by his autobiography, Islamic architecture and Oriental rugs began to interest me and in the summer of 1970 my second wife and I traveled to Iran, attracted by the mosques of Tabriz, Isfahan and Shiraz.
Returning from that trip, weeks later all the rugs we had purchased were stolen from our apartment and I immediately wrote to a dealer in Shiraz, asking if he might help me replace them. He surprised me with bundles of rugs sent through the mails, trusting me to pay for the goods after they sold. This exceptional act of trust placed me on the fringes of the Oriental rug business and by 1973, with extremely little money, I was making annual buying trips to both Iran and Afghanistan.
By 1974, my second wife and I had a "family." with two wonderful children, but, we agreed, not a workable marriage. An amiable divorce was arranged.
In 1982 I published my first book, By that time a retail rug store in Portland, Oregon provided a bare living, along with opportunities to learn about the merchandise I bought and sold, and the cultures producing these objects. Slowly, funds needed to operate a business of this nature began to accumulate.
My father and I, having suffered a tense and distant relationship for many years, came together in a surprising way during the final weeks of his life, in 1984. His final words to me were amazing: "."
In the decades since my father's final breath I discovered that relationships do not end with death. Love for him grows in me still.
By 1980 a third failed marriage led to self-confrontations and the need to understand this pattern, with help from a therapist. Ongoing engagements with the Gurdjieff teaching aided this process, given Gurdjieff's emphasis on incrementally strengthening the capacity to face the truth about oneself. (There is so much we resist seeing.)
My business struggled through years of preoccupation with a line of study that, while fascinating, was never remunerative. I invested great amounts of time and travel money in tracing the origin of the oldest tribal rug motifs and---seeing this period from another perspective---trying to make myself "famous."
In 1991 a publisher in London and I co-published my second book, which shared conclusions from my study within broader thematic frameworks. (This book was translated into three other languages.) While years of research and writing nearly broke me, the book was an exceptional success. Within several years I invested several hundred thousand dollars earned from publishing profits in new qualities of hand-woven rug merchandise then coming onto the market. (Many younger rug dealers worked to encourage a return to the use of vegetable-dyed yarns in rug weaving. Renewed standards of quality in our field, and highly saleable merchandise, developed.)
How many fourth marriages thrive? In 1988 I met a wonderful woman and we married in 1991. Succeeding years have been prosperous, creative, and happy. A solid home life may not be absolutely essential for a rewarding life, but this marriage has made a tremendous difference for me. My fifth and sixths decades have been the most fruitful of my life, and the seventh begins well.
How could such an ordinary person, who toyed with ruining his life, be so very fortunate? Life is full of meaning, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. Inner doors that remained shut for decades now appear to be opening. My wife keeps me on an exercise routine and at 72 I am in good health, enjoying shared interests in a community of people who also respond to life's deepest inner challenges. Recently I began work on my first novel with a clearer goal than ever: to understand more as I encourage others to search for unexpected resources within their own natures.

HEADLINE: Quinn Attacked Over Council's Discretionary Funds

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: Tom Allon's salvo was the first candidate-on-candidate attack of the mayoral race, aimed at what is presumed to be one of Ms. Quinn's vulnerabilities. 

 BODY:
City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, widely viewed as a leading contender in New York's 2013 mayoral race, found herself on the defensive on Tuesday as another candidate attacked her over her management of the City Council's discretionary funds.
The attack, voiced in an op-ed article in The New York Post by Tom Allon, a newspaper publisher and political neophyte, demonstrated that although the election is still two years off, the race is already under way. And it suggested that Mr. Allon, while enjoying little name recognition, will nonetheless be a factor in the campaign.
Mr. Allon's salvo was the first candidate-on-candidate attack of the race so far, and targeted what is presumed to be one of Ms. Quinn's vulnerabilities - the revelation in 2008 of a longstanding practice in the Council of allocating discretionary funds to fictitious organizations to save the money for later disbursement. 
The controversy arose from a city-federal investigation into discretionary funding that ultimately led to corruption charges against two council members. One, Miguel Martinez, was sentenced in 2009 to five years in prison, partly for stealing from the discretionary funds, which are also called member item funds. Another councilman, Larry B. Seabrook, was charged with using nonprofit organizations he controlled to funnel discretionary funds to family members and friends, some of whom allegedly shared the money with him. The judge in his case declared a mistrial last week; prosecutors said they would retry him.
In his op-ed article, Mr. Allon laid the blame for these actions at Ms. Quinn's feet, saying that "this sordid litany of member-item abuses came on her watch," and asking, "Is this how a Mayor Quinn would manage economic development dollars?"
He also proposed changes, including setting up an independent system to review member-item proposals and instituting a system where no member item is financed without the sponsoring council member signing a statement attesting that neither he nor any member of his family or staff has a business relationship with, or has received any money from, the organization being financed.
Ms. Quinn's office responded by saying that she had already instituted changes to the financing system, including requiring that organizations seeking member-item financing go through a city-mandated qualification process and that council members must disclose any relevant relationships when they submit a request for financing.
Ms. Quinn's spokesman, Jamie McShane, said in a statement, "Chris Quinn put into place more than a year ago every single one of the reforms Tom Allon inexplicably called for today."
Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group, credited Ms. Quinn with making the funding process more transparent.
"The Larry Seabrook case would be almost impossible to happen now," he said. But he said there was still room for improvement, including instituting a more equitable system for distributing member item funding among council members.
Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who is not affiliated with any 2013 mayoral candidate, said that Mr. Allon's attack was an early sign both of Ms. Quinn's vulnerability as the front-runner and of Mr. Allon's potential, as an outsider, to have an impact on the race.
"It's easy to dismiss a guy like Tom Allon," he said, but "there is an important role to be played by a nontraditional candidate who can drive the tempo of the issues raised."

HEADLINE: California Creates Special Unit to Fight Computer Crimes

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: California is stepping up its crusade against cybercriminals. On Tuesday, Kamala D. Harris, California's attorney general, announced the creation of the nation's largest e-crime unit, a team of 20 investigators and prosecutors whose sole mission will be to thwart and prosecute cybercrimes like identity theft, Internet scams, computer theft, online child pornography and intellectual property theft across the state. 

 BODY:
California has long led the nation in technological innovation. A lesser-known fact: It also leads the country in cybercrime.
The state has the most identity theft complaints and the third-highest number per capita, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Over a million Californians are victims of identity theft every year. Taken together, the F.T.C. estimates that their losses exceeded $46 million last year.
The state is now accelerating its crusade against cybercriminals. On Tuesday, Kamala D. Harris, California's attorney general, announced the creation of the nation's largest e-crime unit, a group of 20 investigators and prosecutors whose sole mission will be to thwart and prosecute cybercrimes like identity theft, Internet scams, computer theft, online child pornography and intellectual property theft across the state. The unit, formed in August, has already filed 20 criminal cases and is investigating an additional 24 cases.
California joins Texas, Florida and Louisiana, which also have cybercrime units, though California's scope and mandate will be much broader. Texas's and Florida's cybercrime units focus almost exclusively on online child pornography. Louisiana's unit, which is broader in scope, is a three-person team: an investigator, a prosecutor and a forensics specialist.
Until now, cybercrimes in California were typically prosecuted at the local level -making any effort to prosecute multijurisdictional crimes difficult.
Take the case of George Bronk, a Sacramento-area man, who was sentenced to four years in prison in July for hacking into the e-mail and Facebook accounts of women and blackmailing them with indecent pictures and videos. His victims spanned at least 17 states. Initial attempts to report the blackmail to local law enforcement often proved futile because it could not be tied to any one jurisdiction.
"The unique aspect of technology is that it knows no jurisdictional boundary," Ms. Harris, said in an interview Tuesday. "We want to ensure Internet crimes don't drop off simply because it wasn't clear for local law enforcement, or the consumer, where to go because an incident occurred in the cloud."

HEADLINE: TaskRabbit Plans to Multiply

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: TaskRabbit, a San Francisco-based start-up which helps people run errands,plans to expand beyond the dozen cities in the United States where it now operates. The company, which raised about $18 million, says it plans to grow slowly in order to make sure that the quality of the service can be maintained. 

 BODY:
How many tasks can you perform with nearly $18 million dollars? TaskRabbit, a San Francisco-based start-up that helps people run errands, is about to find out. The company announced Wednesday that it had received $17.8 million in financing.
Leah Busque, founder of TaskRabbit, said in an interview at the company's headquarters in San Francisco that TaskRabbit would expand to more cities. "We're going to be expanding the product team quite a bit, hiring designers and engineers," she said. "We hope to grow the team and expand it by four times its current size."
TaskRabbit is currently available in five cities in the United States and the company hopes to be in 12 cities in the next year.
In recent months TaskRabbit has also hired Eric Grosse, the former president of Expedia Worldwide, the travel Web site. Mr. Grosse has taken over from Ms. Busque as the company's chief executive, and Ms. Busque moved into the role of chief product officer, focusing on building the company's platform and new products.
But don't expect TaskRabbit to come to a city near you just yet. Mr. Grosse said the company plans to move into new cities slowly and with caution.
"We want to make sure that the liquidity is the same in each place that we launch our service so customers can expect the same level of quality everywhere at once," he said. He wants to build a trusted network of TaskRabbits, the people hired to do the errands. "For us, we would rather accelerate our growth in a smaller market, creating a continually great experience for our customers. It only takes one subpar experience to generate a negative feedback loop."
Ms. Busque also said TaskRabbit is preparing a company A.P.I., or application programming interface, that will allow other services and start-ups to tap into the TaskRabbit network.
The company's recent financing, which is the company's series B round, is being led by LightSpeed Venture Partners, a Menlo Park, Calif., venture capital firm. Other investors include Allen and Company and the Tornante Company, an investment firm led by Michael Eisner, the former Walt Disney chief executive. As part of the new funding round, Mr. Eisner will also become an adviser to TaskRabbit.
An earlier version of this post mistakenly said that TaskRabbit is now available in 12 cities in the United States. It is available in five cities, but hopes be in 12 cities in the next year.

HEADLINE: A Correction From the Way Back Machine

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: A reporter thinks it might be interesting to revisit his first bylined article of 30 years ago. He learns he made at least two errors in the piece. The reporter cancels plans for a 35th anniversary retrospective. 

 BODY:
That's what I get - and, frankly, what I deserve - for having immodestly marked my 30th anniversary as a reporter with a retrospective post about my modest first story, which concerned the loss of WKCR's signal from a broadcast tower at Madison Avenue and 53rd Street.
Bad enough to discover, on revisiting the article, that I'd misstated the cross street at which the tower was situated. (I said it was 54th Street.)
Then came this e-mail: "I was Googling WKCR and found this article below. I had no idea that I was a part of your first article and that James Gleick was your editor! It was fun to know this after so many years. Michael Silberstein. P.S. It's Silberstein, not Silverstein."
Mr. Silberstein, who lives in Manhattan, is the co-managing director of the Paragon Coffee Trading Company in White Plains. I asked him to trace his journey from WKCR to Paragon. "I needed a job in what was then the great recession of 1982," he answered. "In fact, before I got into coffee, I was ABC Carpet's first full-time hand-knotted Oriental rug salesperson. I took a pay cut to get into coffee, and I'm glad I did. It's more fun to taste 100 cups of coffee a day and travel to the coffee-producing regions than it was to turn those damn, heavy rugs."
He was 21 then. He says he is now 39.
And before I have to write yet another correction, let me note that Mr. Silberstein quickly added, "At least, that's how I think and feel."

HEADLINE: Should We 'Occupy' Education?

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: What do we need to do to elevate the school performance of poor children? 

 BODY:
Dramatic disparities separate the performance of privileged and disadvantaged students, and as complex as the education equation is, one factor - poverty - is consistently associated with lower scores for districts, schools and individual children.
"Data From the National Assessment of Educational Progress show that more than 40 percent of the variation in average reading scores and 46 percent of the variation in average math scores across states is associated with variation in child poverty rates," write Helen F. Ladd, professor of public policy and economics at Duke, and Edward B. Fiske, former education editor of The Times, in Monday's Opinion pages. "No one seriously disputes the fact that students from disadvantaged households perform less well in school, on average, than their peers from more advantaged backgrounds."
It's a dismaying statistic, but not a new one. The No Child Left Behind Act, charter schools and countless arguments on tenure and testing have all sprung from a national recognition that our schools fail a significant portion of our kids, and particularly the one-fifth of them who live in poverty. (Interestingly, schools on military bases, which aren't subject to the various programs state and federal government impose on schools, outperformed all public schoolson both reading and math tests for fourth and eighth graders again this year.) Should that failure inspire as much outrage as income inequality?
"We are the 20 percent" may not have quite the same ring to it as the 99 percent Occupy meme, but it's just as ugly a number. When we fail to provide what's needed to raise and educate 20 percent of our kids, we very nearly guarantee that they'll find themselves raising the next generation of kids in failing schools and crumbling neighborhoods. Federal education policy has been focused on driving those schools toward equal achievement, with an assumption that equal inputs should lead to equal output.
Dr. Ladd and Mr. Fiske argue that disadvantaged students can't make do with equality - they're going to need something more. They support programs like the Harlem Children's Zone that provide access to after-school programs, summer camps, social workers, mentoring and enrichment. Other efforts around the country follow the same model. North Carolina has the East Durham Children's Initiative, and Syracuse, N.Y., has Say Yes to Education. But detractors argue that raising other poverty-related issues lets schools off the hook, and excuses low expectations and low achievement. And (needless to say) those are expensive programs in a world of limited resources.
How far can programs that enrich the lives of kids outside school walls go to help their work in class? Are they important, or necessary? And what of cities (most of them) faced with hard questions: more direct funding for schools or more funding for outside programs? What matters more? Read "The Unaddressed Link Between Poverty and Education" (linked above) and come back to comment.

HEADLINE: NYSE and Deutsche Borse Offer New Deal Concessions

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse have submitted new concessions to the European authorities as the exchanges attempt to gain approval for their proposed $9 billion merger. 

 BODY:
9:11 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON -- NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse have submitted new concessions to the European authorities as the exchanges attempt to gain approval for their proposed $9 billion merger.
The move comes as the European Commission and a local German regulator have raised concerns about the deal, which would give the two companies a dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.
To allay these concerns, the companies said on Tuesday that they had agreed to divest more of their equity derivatives trading operations, as well as provide the new owner access to Eurex Clearing, a clearinghouse for derivatives products.
The concessions include the disposal of all of NYSE Euronext's single-stock derivatives businesses in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
If local regulatory approval isn't given for divestments in individual European countries, the companies would look to dispose of Deutsche Borse's complementary operations in those countries, the person added.
NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Borse also said they would license Eurex's trading system to third parties looking to offer interest-rate derivatives. 
The firms said the European authorities were now expected to make a decision on the merger by February; the previous deadline was January.
"The revisions are designed to reflect the European Commission's feedback on the initial proposal, and thereby fully address the commission's remaining concerns while preserving the industrial and economic logic of the merger," the companies said in a statement.
The new concessions echo a similar move in November when NYSE Euronext said it would sell its pan-European single-equity derivatives units, but not the options businesses in its home markets. Deutsche Borse said it would divest similar operations. The companies had also agreed to give rivals access to Eurex Clearing to offset regulatory concerns that the pending merger would lead to uncompetitive practices.
The European authorities are concerned the merger would give the companies a dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market, where the firms' operations represent up to 90 percent of trading activity in certain contracts.
NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse are adamant that the proposed merger does not break antitrust rules. They cite competition from the so-called over-the-counter market, dominated by many of the world's largest investment banks, which still represents the majority of derivatives trades in Europe.
Under new global regulatory proposals, these opaque deals are being required to use clearinghouses -- financial intermediaries that guarantee trades if one side defaults -- and to trade on exchanges. 
Will Rhode, a senior analyst at financial consulting firm TABB Group in New York, said the over-the-counter derivatives market, not the exchange-traded sector, was where antitrust regulators should be focusing their attention.
"The NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse is an attractive proposition that will allow them to compete with the oligopoly of the O.T.C. dealers," Mr. Rhode said. "It's that market, not the exchanges, where the debate about competition should be."
Last week, Deutsche Borse's chief financial officer, Gregor Pottmeyer, said the deal could be in jeopardy if antitrust regulators demanded more concessions.
"We want to pursue the transaction, but not at all costs," Mr. Pottmeyer said. "Antitrust conditions should not be allowed to endanger the industry and economic logic of this transformational merger."
Along with antitrust concerns, a local German regulator has also questioned how the deal would affect the companies' future operations in Frankfurt, where Deutsche Borse is based. On Monday, the Hessian Ministry of Economy, the local regulator for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, called for changes to the merger to protect trading activity in Frankfurt.
"We have communicated suggestions about how our concerns could be remedied," said Wolfgang Harmz, a ministry spokesman.

HEADLINE: Inside Our Plan to Open in Brooklyn

BYLINE: BRUCE BUSCHEL


HIGHLIGHT: All told, we figure it will take $301,500 to get started in early 2012. 

 BODY:
Hunting and gathering in Brooklyn has been swift and successful. An existing restaurant recently became available -- a 45-seater with a small garden in the back, located on a bustling street in a cosmopolitan section of the borough. It is in excellent condition, though not perfect.
If a build-out goes smoothly (ho ho ho), we could open sometime in January. The key fee is $65,000, and the first two months' rent totals $15,000. Add another two months' security at $15,000, and we need $95,000 before stepping inside the door. In addition, our management consultant, Black Ink Business Services, insists that we set aside $75,000 for unforeseen calamities, including closing up shop if things go radically kerplooey.
We don't want to have to raise more money in the second or third year and then have to scramble the ownership percentages. Consider this $75,000 as back-up capital, a nest egg for a rainy day, a snowy week, or a euro tsunami washing ashore on Brooklyn.
Stuff happens.
And if stuff happens to go moderately well, that same $75,000 can become working capital and support all things bright and beautiful. All told, we figure it will take $301,500 to open in early 2012. Here are some of the numbers we are looking at:

Real Estate


Key fee:$65,000	Security deposit:15,000	Two months rent:15,000	Insurance (three months):2,000	Contingency fund:75,000	Subtotal172,000	We are not starting with an empty canvas. Still, we need paint and spackle. The kitchen has to be scrubbed and retrofitted. Out-of-date equipment has to be upgraded or replaced. The permits are all in place, including wine and beer licenses held by the landlord, which will save much time and money.
Leasehold Improvements


Pre-construction prep:$100	General construction:3,600	Hood sprinklers:2,500	Kitchen equipment:10,000	Electrical/lighting:5,000	HVAC:4,000	Signage/canopy:2,000	Landscaping:2,000	Design:3,000	Subtotal:65,500	Other Expenses


Liquor license:$2,000	Liqour license legal fees:3,000	Building permits:2,000	Subtotal:7,000	Even though there are tables and chairs and a bar and a bathroom, we have some work to do, some edges to smooth, refrigerators to install and then fill with food. The sound and security systems need to be tweaked. Computers and point of service communication are needed.
Equipment and Inventory


Furniture and fixtures:$2,500	Stereo/sound system:1,500	Computers/registers:1,500	Phone/voice system:500	Security system:1,000	Office equipment:500	Glass, silver, china:2,000	Supplies (front):1,000	Supplies (back):6,000	Food inventory:4,000	Wine inventory:4,000	Beer inventory:1,000	Subtotal:25,500	When we open, it will behoove us to let people know. The bulk of the marketing money will be spent on social media and the Web site.
Marketing and Miscellaneous


Marketing & promotion:$5,000	Print materials:1,000	Branding and Web site:2,500	Payroll/bookkeeping:1,500	Miscellaneous:10,000	Subtotal:20,000	Opening staff (with training, for three months):11,500	Total Projected Capital Needs (for preopening and three months): 301,500.
And here are our three-year projections for revenue and profit. They include the number of guests, average checks, labor costs, division of food and beverage for both lunch and dinner. Neither the best case nor the worst, this is somewhere in between.
Projected Revenue, Year One: Lunch


Number of patrons per week:190	Average guest check:$27.85	Food revenue:$232,960	Cost of food sold:$93,184	Food profit:$139,776	Beverage revenue:$58,240	Cost of beverage sold:$11,648	Beverage profit:$46,592	Projected Revenue, Year One: Dinner


Number of patrons per week:335	Average guest check:$52.85	Food revenue:$657,020	Cost of food sold:$197,106	Food profit:$459,914	Beverage revenue:$281,580	Cost of beverage sold:$56,316	Beverage profit:$225,264	Years 2 and 3 we expect to see revenue flatten out. Labor costs will grow, as will taxes, inflation and rent.

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear three major casesthat could help determine which party controls the House of Representatives and whether President Obama gains a second term, Adam Liptak reports. The court will issue rulings on challenges to the 2010 health care overhaul law and to Arizona's anti-immigration measures in June, in the heat of the presidential campaign. It will also decide a case about how Texas conducts its elections, which could cause a swing of four seats in the House of Representatives.

        
Under a Republican bill to extend a payroll tax cut, those Americans with gross adjusted income over $1 million would no longer be eligible for food stamps or jobless pay, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Millionaires on food stamps are rare, but the idea of ending unemployment insurance for very high earners demonstrates an increasing desire in Congress to find some way to make sure the wealthiest Americans contribute more to reducing the deficit and paying for middle class tax relief.

        
Until now, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich largely refrained from direct attacks, often using surrogates to attack each other's platform, Katharine Q. Seelye reports. But both men took to swatting at each other directly at a campaign stop in New Hampshire, highlighting just how important the state's primary may be in framing the fight for the Republican nomination.

        
There are searing divisions among conservative Christian voters in Iowa about which candidate to support in the Republican caucus, Susan Saulny reports. Some worry whether evangelicals will split their votes, undercutting their influence and giving the less popular candidates a clearer shot at a strong showing.

        
With her husband's bid for the Republican presidential nomination suddenly endangered by Newt Gingrich, Ann Romney is being deployedto draw attention to a potentially powerful asset in the race against the twice-divorced Mr. Gingrich: the Romney's stable, unblemished marriage of 42 years, Michael Barbaro reports.

Romney's Run Puts Private Equity in Spotlight | On Wednesday, Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president, will attend fund-raisers in Manhattan given by his former private equity peers and Wall Street bankers, putting the spotlight on the private equity industry and Mr. Romney's role in it, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
Mr. Romney, a co-founder of Bain Capital, will spend time at the sprawling Park Avenue apartment of his former rival and sometime deal partner, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the co-founder of the Blackstone Group.
While the fund-raisers are likely to generate many thousands of dollars and galvanize support among Mr. Romney's former peers, they may also give an opening to critics like the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Already, Americans United for Change, a pro-union Democratic group, has begun a campaign comparing Mr. Romney to Gordon Gekko, the character Michael Douglas portrayed in the film "Wall Street." It has even started a Web site, RomneyGekko.com. DealBook Column 
MF Global Inquiry Shifts to 2 Trusted Deputies | Jon S. Corzine bore the brunt of public fury last week when Congress began examining the downfall of MF Global. Now, two of Mr. Corzine's former top deputies at the brokerage firm are entering the spotlight, as lawmakers demand answers about an estimated $1 billion in customer money that vanished during MF Global's final days.
Bradley Abelow, MF Global's chief operating officer and Mr. Corzine's chief of staff when he was governor of New Jersey, and Henri J. Steenkamp, the firm's chief financial officer, are set to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday.
Both Mr. Abelow and Mr. Steenkamp are expected to distance themselves from the missing customer money, saying they know nothing of its whereabouts, according to copies of their prepared testimony for the Senate Agriculture Committee. Their remarks will largely echo statements made on Capitol Hill last week by Mr. Corzine, the firm's former chief executive, who is also to appear at the hearing. DealBook

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Keystone XL

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
The Keystone XL oil pipeline, the House Republicans' current weapon of choice in their fight with President Obama over jobs and taxes, would create only 6,500 temporary jobs annually, and perhaps only 50 permanent jobs.
On Dec. 14 a century ago, Roald Amundsen reached the South Pole.
After nearly 30 years, prosecutors in Philadelphia decided last week to end their fight to execute Mumia Abu-Jamal. The case highlights that Pennsylvania's system for administering the death penalty is highly flawed.

The House Republicans' bill to extend unemployment benefits would cut social spending without asking wealthy Americans to contribute a penny in new taxes. It would also undo existing environmental protections.
A Financial Times editorial summarizes the outcome of the Durban climate conference as a "decision to postpone a decision on how best to co-ordinate a global response." Given the economic crisis, the FT argues that this delaying tactic was perhaps the best that could be hoped for, and notes that the deal set an important principle: "In future, developing as well as developed countries will be responsible for emissions curbs."
A Wall Street Journal editorial is more pessimistic about the "wash out" conference, and wonders if there was any point to it at all. "Cynics might say that rich countries are doing the least they can to honor promises they once made but no longer believe in and can't afford anyway. The cynics would be right."

HEADLINE: What Iraqis Think of the American Withdrawal: Baghdad

BYLINE: STEPHEN FARRELL AND THE BAGHDAD BUREAU


HIGHLIGHT: As American forces withdraw from Iraq, we asked Iraqis questions about the war and their country's future. We start in Baghdad. 

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- As American forces start to pull out of Iraq, we asked Iraqis around the country three questions: Will Iraq be better or worse off after American troops leave? What did the Americans achieve in Iraq? And what have they personally lost or gained since the 2003 invasion? Some answered only one or two questions. Although the respondents varied from area to area and across social and religions divides, some clear patterns emerge.
In Sunni areas of the north and west -- from Baghdad to Mosul and out across Anbar - there is abiding fear among Saddam Hussein's once-ruling minority of the ancient regional foe, Iran, and how vulnerable a post-American Iraq may be to Tehran's military, political and economic ambitions.
By contrast, in the areas controlled by Iraq's majority Shiite population, more interviewees talked of the Iraqi security forces -- now, of course, controlled by a Shiite-led government - being ready to take over.
Members of minorities like the Kurds, Christians and Turkmen are often the most pessimistic, since they are the most vulnerable. One can in many cases treat with skepticism the often disingenuous and self-serving canard --
from people who most likely never visited the gassed Kurdish town of Halabja or the drained Shiite marshes of the south -- about Saddam's Iraq being a blind meritocracy free of sectarian or religious divisions.
But it is significant that in both Sunni and Shiite areas, there are some who say that life was better under Mr. Hussein because of the security his omnipresent police and intelligence forces imposed on Iraq, even from those who shudder in the next breath when recalling the dictatorial nature of his regime.
At War begins its informal, nationwide glimpse of some of the prevailing Iraqi attitudes about the war and the future of their country. We will visit five areas of Baghdad: the north, south, east, west and center of the city.
Baghdad is not just the capital of Iraq, it is the hub at which all the country's major highways converge, and from which all power emanated under Saddam Hussein's highly centralized Baath rule. It is dominated by Sunni and Shiite Arabs, with smaller Kurdish, Christian and other minorities. Since the sectarian slaughter of the post-invasion era, some neighborhoods have returned to something like normal. Others are still surrounded by high blast walls, to keep Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias out.
ADHAMIYA, Baghdad
(A Sunni Arab stronghold in north Baghdad. It was a bastion of support for Saddam Hussein, and still has blast walls to protect it from the Shiite majority neighborhoods around it, on the Shiite majority eastern side of the Tigris. An early source of anti-American hostility, its vulnerable population increasingly came to be more fearful of Iran and its Shiite acolytes in Iraq.)
Samir Nasrat, 28, Aluminum Cabinet Maker
In Adhamiya, Mr. Nasrat said the war brought worries never felt under Saddam.
Khalil Ibrahim, 46, Government Employee
1. I am so concerned about the U.S. withdrawal. I'm one of those who want them to remain. Many things will gradually deteriorate in Iraq, especially security, which will be affected by Iran's influence once the Americans have gone.
2. America has already taken what it was looking for, but I don't think they achieved all of their goals before it withdrew.
3. The benefits that we gained were the elimination of the militias and the bringing of democracy to Iraq.
Hassan Essa, 49, Businessman
1. I want the Americans to remain until the Iranian influence has been expelled somehow. I think there will be negative and worse security changes in the country.
2. I think that America accomplished its mission by achieving its goals concerning Iraq's oil, destroying Iraq's infrastructure in order not to be an obstacle to Israel's plans in the future, and taking revenge on Saddam. America is less hostile than Iran.I think America will remain in Iraq secretly, and one reason is to move against Iran in the future. This is our hope.
Nour Kasim, 30, Housewife
1. It is not the right time for America to leave Iraq with such internal conflicts and the security situation so unstable and unsafe. We need more time to stabilize security and to be ready for any external confrontation. I don't think Iraq is ready to do this alone.
2. I don't know exactly the American goals, but I believe that they achieved them, otherwise they wouldn't decide to leave. I don't have any problem with America, Saddam or any ruling party because I don't get myself involved in politics. I hope Iraq will be liberated, but we have to be able to protect our country first.
SADR CITY, Baghdad
(A Shiite district once called Thawra (Revolution) and then Saddam City it was renamed Sadr City after the 2003 invasion in honor of the revered Shiite clerical family - descendants of the Prophet Muhammad - of which Moktada al-Sadr is a scion. It has become the east Baghdad stronghold of the Sadrist movement.
Sadeq Rathi, 43, Motorcycle Taxi Driver
Mr. Rathi sees no bright future for his country.
Ali Hussein Ali, 45, Government Employee
1. It's difficult for me to see what is going to happen in the future; I am just a simple man. But I know that many of my friends think that things are going to get better, and many think that they are going to get worse. The people who think it's going to be better think that the Americans are going to stay, and they want them to stay, because they think that a situation that they know is better than a situation that they don't know. Children are now able to go to school, people are going to work, some construction has begun. We have had long wars with Iran and then Kuwait, and we need at least the same amount of time, maybe 35, 40 years, to fix our situation. And the key to that is security.
The people who believe it's going to be worse think that if the Americans leave there will be no work and no construction because no one will invest in Iraq without the Americans here. They are also afraid that sectarian and religious issues between Sunnis and Shiites will return, not only between the people but between the politicians in Parliament. Only God knows what will happen.
2. No. No.
3. My brother was killed. I am always full of grief and sadness. That is why I am wearing black until today. I gained nothing.
Muhammad Jumad, 42, Kebab Seller
1. It depends on how ready the Iraqi security forces are. I think they are ready, and I think it is better for the Americans to withdraw.
2. I didn't see any achievements. They created more unemployment. As you see, I have a stand selling kebabs. Before the war I had a proper shop in Fadel, but we were forced out in 2006 because of all the sectarian events with the Sunnis there. We had to move to Sadr City and I have this stand, on a sidewalk.
3. I gained nothing. I am trying to think of something, but we didn't gain anything.
A trio of Iraqi Shiites, gathered on a street corner, each answered one of the questions:
Jassem Ahmed, 25, Unemployed
1. It is a pleasant surprise for us that the Americans are leaving. God willing, things will be better because the Americans are the only excuse that the terrorist groups, Al Qaeda and the others, have to continue. They are behind all the sectarian conflicts.
Ali Jassem, 32, Unemployed
2. They didn't achieve anything, or let's say they achieved bombing, killing and explosions. They delivered false promises. They didn't bring anything good for us, for the people; they only brought politicians who are out for themselves."
Qassem Ali, 27, Unemployed, 
3. The one thing they did achieve was getting rid of Saddam Hussein. We might not have been able to get rid of him and his family for four generations. However, while it is true that Saddam was unjust to the Iraqi people, there was security, there was a chance of a job, there were services. Right now things are so bad because of the Americans.
CENTRAL BAGHDAD, off Tahrir Square
Safi Abed, Businessman
Mr. Abed believes the U.S. isn't leaving Iraq with a real democracy.
KARADA, Baghdad
(An affluent, middle-class area of central Baghdad which experienced few sectarian tensions but numerous suicide bombings, as insurgent groups tried to drive a wedge between its Sunni, Shiite and Christian populations.)
Najwan Basam Slaywa, 39, Christian
1. Iraq will be in a real dilemma. Iran and Al Qaeda in Iraq will kill all the Christians. I am pessimistic about the American troop withdrawal.
2. The U.S. achieved bad things for us, now the Christians are easy target. I need them to stay to protect Iraq until the U.S. gets rid of Iran and the terrorists.
3. I lost one of my relatives in a roadside bomb in Karrada in 2007, now I am looking to leave Iraq. This is the big loss for all honest Iraqis - losing Iraq.
Rani Basil, 34, Christian, Taxi Driver
1. Iraq will be great place if the U.S. withdraws, so I do not think that the US will leave Iraq because they are about to attack Iran. You can see recently all countries that have a connection with Iran, such as Syria, are witnessing sanctions and are about to change their government.
2. The U.S. government and Army achieved their mission exactly as they wanted and planned: they made all the Iraqis hate each other, and they created sectarianism in our once united nation. Now the way is clear for them to stay to attack Iran or Syria.
3. I lost my dignity. In 2003 when they occupied Iraq they raided my house. When I asked the American soldier to stop searching in my wife's clothing closet, he stepped on my head with his dirty foot.
Mal Allah Hillow, 48, Mandaean Jeweler
1. The Iraqi government asked the U.S. troops to leave, but this was not a wise decision, it is the government playing dice and gambling with all the Iraqis and our great history. Now I can see the difference between now and before 2003. Before 2003, we were living as real Iraqis. I believe that U.S. troops will remain in Iraq forever, because we have treasures, and they need to use Iraq as a strategic base to control the area, and to prevent Iran to dominate the region.
2. They improved their economy, created hate among Iraqis, and they achieved and completed what the British started in Iraq and the region.
3. Myself and all the Mandaeans lost our identity. We were killed by terrorists. Now I live as a person who is afraid of saying that I am Mandaean
ABU GHRAIB
The Sunni district of west Baghdad home to the notorious Abu Ghraib prison and was one of the centers of the Sunni insurgency after the 2003 invasion. It is close to the airport and Iraq's most important highways - west and south of Baghdad - along which American convoys are now traveling out of the country.

HEADLINE: Fed Makes No Changes To Policy On Rates

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it was closing the books on 2011, maintaining its existing efforts to increase growth but adding no reinforcement amid evidence that the American economy was chugging back toward health.
The central bank will enter next year as it entered this one, in a stance of hopeful exhaustion, optimistic the economy is gaining strength, worried about setbacks and doubtful it can do much more to hasten recovery.
Equity investors, who have been the major beneficiaries of the Fed's efforts to help growth, immediately responded with disappointment over the absence of any clear hint of new windfalls. Major market indexes recorded quick drops, reversing early gains. The benchmark Standard &Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.87 percent on the day. 
But the Fed left open the possibility that it would take additional steps next year, including an expected effort at improving public understanding of its goals and methods to increase the impact of its policies and disarm its critics.
The Fed's policy-making committee said its optimism about the economy was tempered by the persistence of unemployment, the blighted housing market, the deceleration of global growth and the risk of a European crash.
''The committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually,'' it said in a statement. ''Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.''
The decision was supported by nine of 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, once again dissented, arguing that the Fed should act immediately to help growth, fulfilling its responsibility to help the millions of Americans who cannot find jobs.
Notwithstanding the nervous twitching of stock markets, the committee's decision to do nothing was widely anticipated. One analyst joked that the most exciting thing about the statement was the timing of its release about three minutes ahead of schedule. Another titled his note to clients, ''Dull Dull Dull.''
''You could almost call it a yawner,'' said Eric Stein, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Eaton Vance, a Boston investment firm. ''But I think we'll see something bigger come January. The center of the committee, despite the fact that U.S. growth is looking stronger, they're always going to err on the side of doing more.''
The dynamics of the internal debate also will shift next year. Four of the seats on the policy-making committee are held on a rotating basis by the presidents of the Fed's regional banks. Three of the current four have argued that the Fed already has done too much to stimulate growth, creating the largest bloc of dissenting votes on the committee since the early 1990s. Only one of their replacements is regarded as similarly likely to break ranks with the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
''It certainly suggests that as we go into the new construct, you will have a more accommodative committee, a bit more proactive,'' said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at the broker-dealer Mizuho Securities USA.
Mr. Stein and other observers said they were eager to read the fuller description of this meeting that the Fed will publish on Jan. 3 because the committee had planned to discuss on Tuesday possible changes in the information that it provides to the public, including a forecast of its likely decisions about short-term interest rates.
The January meeting affords a convenient opportunity to announce such a change. Mr. Bernanke is scheduled hold a news conference after the meeting, on Jan. 25, and the Fed will release its regular forecast of other economic data.
Fed officials say such a forecast could bolster growth modestly, reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, by convincing investors the central bank will keep interest rates near zero for longer than expected.
The impact would be limited because such a forecast most likely would cover three years, running through 2014, and asset prices based on investor expectations on interest rates already reflect an assumption that the Fed will keep rates near zero through the end of 2013.
Articulating its goals and methods also could help the Fed to justify any new efforts to aid growth. But such efforts, viewed as inevitable by many Fed watchers earlier this year, become less likely as the economy improves.
The statement reflected the Fed's increased optimism, describing ''some improvement'' in labor markets instead of ''continuing weakness.'' And the Fed now appears to view the struggles of foreign economies as the greatest risk.
At the same time, officials have given no indication that they are ready to resume the discussions, suspended earlier this year, about when and how the central bank should begin to retreat from its existing efforts to stimulate growth.
The Fed said that it would continue an effort to cut borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by investing in long-term Treasury securities, using proceeds from the sale of its existing holdings of short-term Treasuries.
The December meeting convened on the third anniversary of the Fed's decision to hold short-term interest rates near zero, a policy it has said that it plans to continue through at least the middle of 2013 and possibly longer.
The meeting also was held on Mr. Bernanke's 58th birthday.

HEADLINE: A Face Wash Campaign for the iPhone Set

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHAT do teenagers and young adults hope to get as holiday gifts? Smartphones? Tablet computers? Video games? If a giant marketer has its way, they may instead find face wash dispensers under the Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush.
The dispensers are being introduced by the Reckitt Benckiser USA division of Reckitt Benckiser, which sells products bearing brand names like Calgon, Clearasil, Finish, French's, Lysol and Woolite. The Clearasil PerfectaWash automatic face wash dispenser, with a suggested retail price of $19.99, will be backed with an unconventional campaign that is meant to appeal to consumers ages 17 to 21.
The campaign includes video clips to be projected onto buildings in eight cities, a concert by the singer JoJo, social media like Facebook and QR codes, the scannable data squares that resemble bar codes -- in other words, the types of nontraditional approaches that are used to sell young people on high-technology products like smartphones, tablets and video games. 
Other efforts to build excitement for Clearasil PerfectaWash that emulate marketing methods for electronic gear include giving dispensers to bloggers to try out and review, along with naming three consumers to serve as ''all access agents'' for the product on the Facebook fan page.
And in an unusual step for Reckitt Benckiser USA, Clearasil PerfectaWash is being presold to consumers, who are being offered a chance to pre-order it on Amazon.com before the official introduction on Dec. 26.
The initiative is meant to be like campaigns for Apple products, said Rahul Sabnis, executive creative director on the Reckitt Benckiser account at Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of the Havas Worldwide division of Havas.
''We want that same type of innovation and energy,'' Mr. Sabnis said, to ''shift the conversation from advertising to cultural relevance.''
''It's not just about putting a commercial out there,'' he added. (There will also be television commercials for Clearasil PerfectaWash, scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2012.)
The budget for the campaign is $30 million, according to executives of Reckitt Benckiser USA. That is more than twice what the company spent to advertise Clearasil acne medications and skin-care products in 2009 or 2010, according to data from the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
The Clearasil PerfectaWash campaign is indicative of why many forecasters are predicting that ad spending this year will increase compared with last year and ad spending next year will increase compared with this year. Despite the uncertain economy, major marketers like Reckitt Benckiser USA are making ambitious plans to bring out new products while continuing to advertising existing ones.
Among Reckitt Benckiser USA brands for which Euro RSCG New York has recently produced new campaigns are French's French Fried Onions and Woolite. And more are planned for the new year.
''We are putting a lot of money behind this, quite a lot for the category,'' Jiri Kulik, general manager for marketing at Reckitt Benckiser USA in Parsippany, N.J., said of the Clearasil PerfectaWash introduction.
The dispenser will compete not only with face washes and acne medications sold in drug stores and mass-merchandise stores but also with the Proactiv line of acne treatments sold in infomercials, online and in print ads by the direct marketer Guthy-Renker.
Signs in stores like Wal-Mart that are to sell Clearasil PerfectaWash will stress its lower cost: ''one-third the price of Proactiv,'' Mr. Kulik said.
The ''key message'' of the campaign, he added, is the promise that the dispenser provides, to quote from the video clip, ''the perfect dose for visibly clear skin.'' The claim is to be reinforced by testimonials from younger consumers who include the bloggers receiving the free dispensers.
Each dispenser comes with two 10-ounce refills and shoppers who buy through Amazon.com will be invited, Mr. Kulik said, to sign up for the Web retailer's automatic delivery program known as Subscribe and Save.
''It's the good old Gillette model of seeding the gadget and getting people to get the refill,'' he added, then amended his remark to call it ''the Reckitt Benckiser model.''
Because the dispenser ''sits on your sink,'' Mr. Kulik said, it will encourage owners to ''use it every day.''
Mr. Kulik and Nathan Marafioti, senior brand manager for Clearasil, acknowledged the risk of marketing personal-care products ''like iPhones or iPads,'' as Mr. Kulik put it, ''with buzz and presell.''
''Maybe we are getting too excited about something other companies think is normal,'' Mr. Kulik said, laughing.
Mr. Sabnis said he believed the benefits of adopting the electronic device marketing model-- ''the intersection of digital and experiential marketing and advertising'' -- outweigh the risks.
The target audience likes ''to try products before they're on the shelf,'' Mr. Sabnis said, and ''they appreciate peer-to-peer influence'' in the form of testimonials, reviews and comments.
And the appearance in the campaign of JoJo -- including a sponsored concert in Los Angeles on Saturday and music from her coming album being featured in the commercials -- could serve as a ''cultural accelerant,'' he added, and ''speed up how a message gets out.''
Reckitt Benckiser plans to introduce Clearasil PerfectaWash in European markets after it makes its debut in the United States.
Reckitt Benckiser USA spent $12.8 million to advertise Clearasil in 2010 out of total spending for all brands of $416 million, Kantar Media reported, compared with $14.8 million in 2009 out of total spending for all brands of $426.2 million.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rose Slightly in November

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales grew at their slowest pace in five months in November, tempering expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.
Retail sales increased 0.2 percent after gaining 0.6 percent in October, a Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday. 
Relatively strong consumer spending in recent months has helped the United States resist a global slowdown fed by Europe's still menacing debt crisis.
A separate report showed business inventories rose in October by the most in five months, pointing to stronger growth as companies restock shelves to meet consumer demand.
November's retail sales growth, which was lower than analysts had expected, looked unlikely to rekindle fears of an imminent recession, and the Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced no major policy shifts. The Fed did, however, say financial market turmoil posed a threat to economic growth.
Some economists warned that some of the strength in American consumption has come from households saving less, a trend that might not last, and the retail data suggested some of that strength might already be waning.
The modest rise could ''be the start of a period in which households start to spend more within their means,'' said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics in London.
Receipts for motor vehicles and parts helped the overall increase, rising 0.5 percent. Excluding autos, sales rose just 0.2 percent.
One factor weighing on consumers, analysts said, was a substantial drop in household wealth so far this year. Big drops in the stock market during the third quarter led household wealth to contract $2.4 trillion, Fed data showed last week.
Another constraint on spending has been weak growth in after-tax incomes, which have failed to keep up with inflation.
In November, sales at food and beverage stores fell 0.2 percent, while receipts at gasoline stations dropped 0.1 percent.
Still, shoppers swarmed into stores over the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally retailing's biggest sales period. Reports of a strong weekend performance had fed optimism about the outlook for holiday spending.
Some of the weakness in the November retail sales might be because stores discounted heavily to attract customers, said Millan Mulraine, a senior United States macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
''It's fairly disappointing given that all the evidence was pointing to fairly strong gains during the month,'' Mr. Mulraine said.
Some details within the retail report were more encouraging. Sales outside autos, gasoline and building materials -- which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report -- rose 0.3 percent in November.
Also positive for the growth outlook, a survey showed small businesses grew more confident in the economy's future in November, a third straight month of improvement.

HEADLINE: Offices With More Breathing Room

BYLINE: By TOM ACITELLI

 BODY:
The 28th floor of the office building at 499 Park Avenue has 17-foot-high windows that run from floor to ceiling on four sides, and they offer views clear to the George Washington Bridge and to airplanes taking off from La Guardia and Newark airports.
George Klein, the developer whose company built 499 Park in the early 1980s, occupied the 6,732-square-foot penthouse on that floor, and after his lease was up in June, the space hit the leasing market.
Mr. Klein sold the building years ago, and the current owners, Hines Interests of Houston, knocked out the dropped ceilings from his former office in preparation for a new tenant.
''Our eyes lit up when we found that we had 17-foot ceilings,'' said David E. Green, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage firm marketing the 28th-floor space as well as space on three lower floors. The possibilities seemed immediately obvious. The space could be perfect for a private equity firm or a hedge fund -- with a lofty asking rent of at least $150 a square foot. 
Once a rarity in the Manhattan office market, big, brassy ''vanity plates'' are becoming more common, especially in new buildings, brokers say. And once seen as difficult to rent, the spaces can command some of the highest office rents in Manhattan since the recession, some more than $100 a square foot. The airy openness appeals not only to the financial masters of the universe who want clients to see the views, but also to new media and technology firms that want a loftlike feel.
These increasingly desirable spaces are found up and down the Manhattan office market, from Midtown towers like 499 Park and 250 West 55th Street to downtown in the Goldman Sachs headquarters at 200 West Street, which opened in 2009, and at 1 and 3 World Trade Center now under construction.
In between are locations like the future 51 Astor Place, the existing 28-40 West 23rd Street and the venerable 30 Rockefeller Center, where the investment giant Lazard is redesigning its 430,000 square feet on the top floors to create a more open space.
''Constantly now, we see firms wanting to build dramatic space,'' said Peter Turchin, an executive vice president at CBRE. Mr. Turchin was standing this month on the recently poured concrete of the second floor of 250 West 55th, one of the few skyscrapers to be built in Manhattan in the last decade. When completed in 2013, the Boston Properties tower will stretch 40 stories over Eighth Avenue and be anchored on the middle floors by the law firm Morrison Foerster.
The 50,000-square-foot second floor, however, is available. Its windows will run 20 feet from floor to ceiling and its columns will have as much as 37 feet between them. Mr. Turchin said the auditorium-like openness, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was deliberate.
''When we designed this building,'' Mr. Turchin said, ''we thought to ourselves, 'Why don't we build the building the way tenants want to build their space?' There are very few buildings like this. You see tenants do it, but they're doing it themselves and they're doing it with a building that's not really designed for it.''
It can be expensive for tenants to modify existing spaces. Changes might involve removing ducts; knocking out concrete slabs; and still getting only a partial run of glass from not quite the floor to not quite the ceiling. Few existing buildings are as fortunate as 499 Park, which was designed by I. M. Pei and is sometimes called the Black Diamond because of the faceted shape of its roof -- a shape only entirely clear from the inside when Mr. Klein's dropped ceilings were knocked out.
''I was up in the space many, many years ago, when George Klein had his office there,'' Mr. Green of Cushman & Wakefield said, ''and, although it was dramatic in the penthouse, it was just kind of typical office space.''
Typical office space -- nine-foot ceilings; neat rows of cubicles; warrens of hallways, either created with the building or made from partitions -- has dominated a Manhattan office market full of buildings developed decades ago. The average larger Midtown office building, in fact, is well over a half-century old, according to 2010 data from CBRE, though that is spry compared with the average Midtown South one, which is pushing 100 (think of the Flatiron building, built in 1902) or a typical downtown one, nearing 65.
That model is starting to fade into history. At 3 World Trade Center, the 80-story tower designed by Richard Rogers and developed by Silverstein Properties, the floor plates of 29,000 to 68,000 square feet have no columns.
''We're finding that the geometry of these floors and the absence of the columns result in most tenants needing anywhere from 10 to 15 percent less space,'' said Jeremy Moss, a senior vice president of leasing at Silverstein. A benefit of that for landlords is that more tenants can fit into a comparable size building. At 51 Astor Place, a 400,000-square-foot Edward J. Minskoff Equities development designed by Fumihiko Maki and set to open in 2013, the ceilings will run to as high as 18 feet and there will be virtually no interior columns in its floorplates of 25,000 to 42,000 square feet.
''It has a very adaptable and flexible use for a multitude of different types of tenants,'' said Paul Glickman, a vice chairman at Jones Lang LaSalle, which is marketing the building. ''So we've seen tech companies look at it; we've seen creative firms looking at it; we've seen financial firms interested in it.''
The most prominent example of the trend toward higher, airier office spaces is 1 World Trade Center, the 104-story tower being developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and scheduled to open in 2013. The publishing house Conde Nast will be the anchor tenant.
Tara Stacom, the Cushman & Wakefield vice chairwoman in charge of leasing at the tower, said more than 90 percent of the interior space at 1 World Trade Center would be reached by natural light.
''I think the other new buildings that will be built in this city in this next decade will do the same,'' Ms. Stacom added. She was also part of the brokerage team that advised Lazard last winter on its 21-year leasing deal at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The firm is renovating space it has held for almost 40 years to make it more open, including floor-to-ceiling glass walls in place of Sheetrock on perimeter offices. ''It's what tenants are demanding.''

HEADLINE: Subsidies for Child Care Keep Dwindling When Families Need Them Most

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- With states under pressure to cut their budgets and federal stimulus money gone, low-income working parents are facing a paradox. Just when they have to work longer hours to make ends meet, they are losing access to the thing they need most to stay on the job: a government subsidy that helps pay for child care.
The subsidy, a mix of federal and state funds that reimburses child care providers on behalf of families, is critical to the lives of poor women. But it has been eaten away over the years by inflation and growing need and recently by state budget cuts, leaving parents struggling to find other arrangements to stay employed.
''States have dropped their investment in child care substantially,'' said Linda Saterfield, vice chairwoman of the National Association of State Child Care Administrators, who oversees child care for the state of Illinois. ''We're being expected to do more with less.'' Her state has toughened eligibility for the subsidies and raised co-payments from families to cover the growing demand. 
Sheontay Smith, a single mother in Baltimore, and her son are among nearly 8,000 families on a waiting list for the subsidy in Maryland. Pennsylvania's list doubled since last year to more than 10,000 children, and Arkansas's quadrupled to 11,000, according to the National Women's Law Center.
At least two states, Arizona and Utah, are no longer appropriating state general funds for child care at all.
According to a recent report by the law center, families in 37 states were worse off this year than last year as waiting lists grew, co-payments rose, eligibility tightened and reimbursement rates for providers stagnated.
''We recognize that this is a tough time for states,'' said Shannon Rudisill, who oversees the subsidy program at the Administration for Children and Families, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. ''They have a hard set of choices that they have to negotiate.''
She said that President Obama had recommended an increase in the subsidy in the 2011 budget, but that it had not been approved by Congress. Stimulus money, which had raised financing by a fifth in 2009 and 2010, is now gone.
Christian Griffith, chief consultant of the California Assembly Budget Committee, said the state cut $335 million in child care financing this year, and with hundreds of millions in cuts to other public services -- courts, schools and the public university system -- ''there aren't many good options at this point.''
The nonprofit Child Care Resource Center, which determines eligibility for the subsidy for thousands of families in northern Los Angeles County, said it had noted a 13 percent decline in licensed child care centers since June 2010 as budget cuts reduced the numbers of families on the subsidy.
The reduction is prompting advocates for poor women to question whether the implied social contract that emerged during the federal welfare overhaul in the 1990s -- that women go to work in exchange for help with child care -- is fraying.
''There's a long history of recognition that child care is essential to helping low-income women work,'' said Helen Blank, the director of public policy at the National Women's Law Center, who helped shape child care policy in the 1990s. ''That commitment is being eroded.''
For children in families waiting for the subsidy, life becomes a kaleidoscope of caretakers. Women interviewed for this article said they left their children with grandparents, neighbors, cousins, siblings, and colleagues at a nail salon. Such ad hoc arrangements hinder early-childhood development, state administrators say, just as states are trying to make it a priority.
One mother on a waiting list in Virginia said her 11-year-old daughter rode around in a city bus after school, watched over by the driver, who is the girl's grandmother, until the mother got off work. The smaller safety net comes as the share of working Americans under or just above the poverty line -- the target group for the subsidy, which is linked to income -- is the highest in years. And while demand for the subsidy declined with the recession, it has shot back up in many states as employment has returned, putting new strain on child care resources.
''We've seen quite a steep increase in demand,'' said Elizabeth Kelley, director of Maryland's Office of Child Care.
Ms. Smith, who works full time at the Baltimore Housing Authority, has been on a waiting list since summer. She applied because her son's father stopped paying child support, and the monthly $520 she needed for her 3-year-old's day care was more than her $22,000 salary could support.
She took her son out, but ended up losing half her paycheck in unpaid days off because her regular baby sitters, among them Ms. Smith's grandmother, who is on kidney dialysis, fell through. The only way to get the subsidy, her caseworker told her, was to stop working and go on welfare. (In Maryland, someone on welfare is automatically eligible.)
''Is the system set up for me to fail? Because that's what it feels like,'' said Ms. Smith.
Her son is now back in day care, at the expense of other bills. Her phone was cut off this week, and she is behind on her gas, electricity and car insurance.
Another hurdle has been the rates at which the centers are reimbursed. The law center's report found that only three states reimburse at federally recommended levels, down from 22 in the beginning of the decade, and some providers say they can no longer afford to take families on subsidies. Toni Cacace-Beshears, who runs a network of child care centers in southeastern Virginia, said families on the subsidy paid at rates so far below her other customers -- about two-thirds -- that she had to do fund-raising to help make up the difference.
''I'm subsidizing my subsidized clients,'' she said. The gap created a shortfall over the past year of about $272,000 -- or about 14 percent of her child care budget.
Parents in income brackets that are a little higher pay more as a result. Monica Jackson, a bakery worker and a pharmacy technician in Norfolk, Va., was told that she and her husband, an Army reservist who is looking for work, did not qualify for the subsidy because their income, around $20,000, is too high, a ruling she is disputing. They cannot afford child care, which Ms. Jackson said cost $1,400 a month, more than their rent.
''What do you tell people who call you for an interview?'' she asked. '' 'I'm bringing my 3-year-old and 11-month-old'?''
Those who have the subsidy live in fear of losing it. Lori Lebo, a customer service worker for an electricity company in Pennsylvania, said she had to ask her new boyfriend and her 8-year-old son to watch her baby girl, who was at home screaming with a fever, because she had received too many warnings at work about taking time off to care for her.
''If we get removed, it will be back on the waiting list for both kids,'' she worried. ''That will be havoc for a new job.''

HEADLINE: Crowded Sidewalks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Rising Foot Traffic Redefines 'Crowded' '' (City Room, Dec. 7): 
While busier sidewalks are a big plus for New York City's economy, as you point out, overcrowding is a result of a misallocation of scarce street space between motor vehicles and pedestrians.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's shift of street space to create pedestrian plazas in Times Square and Herald Square is a welcome first step in correcting this imbalance. But given the concentration of pedestrians in Manhattan, New York remains far behind other global cities like Vienna and Budapest in creating space for pedestrians and urban amenities in their crowded centers.
The city has yet to embrace our plan to remake 42nd Street into a river-to-river pedestrian street with a modern low-floor light rail tram to replace the slower-than-walking buses. Perhaps the mayor should invite his transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, to accompany him on his next global junket and check out what truly progressive cities did many years ago.
Don't New Yorkers deserve as much?

HEADLINE: Pressured About a Merger, Exchanges Revise Their Proposal

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
8:31 p.m. Updated
NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse have submitted new concessions to the European authorities as the exchanges seek to gain approval for their proposed $9 billion merger.
The move comes as the European Commission and a local German regulator have raised concerns about the deal, which would give the two companies a dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.
To allay the concerns, the companies said on Tuesday that they had agreed to divest more of their equity derivatives trading operations, as well as provide the new owner access to Eurex Clearing, a clearinghouse for derivatives products. 
The concessions include the disposal of all of NYSE Euronext's single-stock derivatives businesses in Europe, according to a person briefed on the matter.
If local regulatory approval is not given for divestments in individual European countries, the companies would look to dispose of Deutsche Borse's complementary operations in those countries, the person added.
NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, and Deutsche Borse, the parent of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, also said they would license Eurex's trading system to third parties interested in offering interest-rate derivatives.
The firms said the European authorities were now expected to make a decision on the merger by February; the previous deadline was January.
''The revisions are designed to reflect the European Commission's feedback on the initial proposal, and thereby fully address the commission's remaining concerns while preserving the industrial and economic logic of the merger,'' the companies said in a statement.
The new concessions echo a similar move in November when NYSE Euronext said it would sell its pan-European single-equity derivatives units, but not the options businesses in its home markets. Deutsche Borse said it would divest similar operations. The companies had also agreed to give rivals access to Eurex Clearing to offset regulatory concerns that the pending merger would lead to uncompetitive practices.
The firms' exchange-traded derivatives market operations represent up to 90 percent of trading activity in certain contracts.
NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse insist that the proposed merger would not violate antitrust rules. They cite competition from the over-the-counter market, dominated by many of the world's largest investment banks, which still represents the majority of derivatives trades in Europe.
Under new global regulatory proposals, these opaque deals are being required to use clearinghouses - financial intermediaries that guarantee trades if one side defaults - and to trade on exchanges.
William Rhode, a senior analyst at financial consulting firm TABB Group in New York, said antitrust regulators should be focusing their attention on the over-the-counter derivatives market, not the exchange-traded sector.
''The NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Borse is an attractive proposition that will allow them to compete with the oligopoly of the O.T.C. dealers,'' Mr. Rhode said. ''It's that market, not the exchanges, where the debate about competition should be.''
Last week, Deutsche Borse's chief financial officer, Gregor Pottmeyer, said the deal could be in jeopardy if antitrust regulators demanded more concessions.
''We want to pursue the transaction, but not at all costs,'' Mr. Pottmeyer said. ''Antitrust conditions should not be allowed to endanger the industry and economic logic of this transformational merger.''
In addition to the antitrust concerns, a local German regulator has questioned how the deal would affect the companies' future operations in Frankfurt, where Deutsche Borse is based. On Monday, the Hessian Ministry of Economy, the local regulator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, called for changes to the merger to protect trading activity in Frankfurt.
''We have communicated suggestions about how our concerns could be remedied,'' said Wolfgang Harmz, a ministry spokesman.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bursts of Economic Growth in Panama Have Yet to Banish Old Ghosts

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
PANAMA -- Gleaming new skyscrapers line the waterfront like a mini-Dubai, as boosters say, including a new 70-story Trump tower that is the tallest building in Latin America.
A new free-trade agreement with the United States promises a surge of jobs. The Panama Canal is in the midst of a $5.25 billion expansion. And another big dig began earlier this year, to build Central America's first subway system.
Panama, said Sergio Yurman, one in a flock of Venezuelans who have fled their troubled country to start anew here, is the place to be.
''This is a third-world country on track to the first world,'' said Mr. Yurman, a lawyer who arrived five years ago and established a company providing office space to start-ups. ''The vision here is the right one.'' 
As the thin bridge between North and South America, Panama has long been a geographic and financial crossroads, propped up with a tight bond to the United States. The removal of Manuel Antonio Noriega and his military rule by United States forces nearly 22 years ago ushered in an era of political stability and financial investment that has now made this country of 3.5 million one of the fastest-growing economies in the Western Hemisphere.
But Mr. Noriega's return on Sunday to face murder and other charges here -- after serving prison sentences in the United States and France on drug and money-laundering charges -- has reawakened questions over whether the glare of success has simply better hidden many of Panama's old ghosts.
Several of the towers so impressive in the day stand out for another reason at night: Many of them are dark or nearly so, suggesting few or absentee tenants. Questions are raised here and abroad about the money behind them, and whether a bubble is swelling, particularly in the office market.
Local and international corruption watchdogs rank the country low in transparency, and American law enforcement officials, while giving the country credit for improving its police forces and cooperation with international agencies, still consider it a major money-laundering haven.
Streets flood from being overwhelmed by development. And while a new expressway promises to unclog ever-crowded streets, it has also become the center of protest over the toll of development, with plans for an extension that cuts close to the cherished Casco Viejo historic district and could lead to its removal from the list of Unesco World Heritage sites.
The extension is expected to help develop yet another high-rise project and has the backing of the president, Ricardo Martinelli, a pro-growth supermarket magnate elected more than two years ago whose hard-charging, get-it-done style as he builds what he calls the ''Dubai of Latin America'' wins applause from supporters and derision from opponents.
''If you had asked me a few years ago, I would have said that Panama has improved in every way since Noriega left,'' said Patrizia Pinzon, a real estate agent leading the protest against the highway. ''Now I am concerned that we are quickly heading back to being a kleptocracy.''
Others note that public education is lagging and poverty remains deep, particularly in rural areas yet to feel the boom.
''Growth has meant certain prosperity, but Panama has a dual economy whereby the urban areas benefit from the construction boom, government projects and foreign investment, but the rural, and particularly the indigenous areas, lag behind,'' said Orlando J. Perez, a Latin American politics scholar at Central Michigan University and author of ''Political Culture in Panama: Democracy After Invasion,'' published this year.
While Panama has one of the highest per capita income levels in the developing world, about a third of the population lives in poverty, according to United Nations figures. Dilapidated neighborhoods brush up against the glittering new ones.
Still, people like Mireya Franklin, 32, a secretary in one of the new banking towers, cannot help but marvel at the transformation, with new shopping malls, cafes and nightclubs.
''I would not say it is like Miami now,'' she said, strolling along the bayfront avenue. ''But we feel like we have a piece of that here.''
Most analysts believe the roaring, diversified economy will continue for the time being, buttressed by the canal expansion and development on former American-owned land along it as well as public works. Some slowing is expected in 2012 because of global economic woes. Even so, gross domestic product growth is expected to exceed 8.5 percent this year, with some forecasts even higher.
The canal, handed over by the United States to Panama in December 1999, has contributed $6.6 billion in revenue since then and the widening, to be completed in 2014 to allow larger ships to pass, is expected to keep the cash cow thriving.
At the same time, foreign investment is surging. It increased 33 percent last year, and has grown 17 percent in the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2010.
Luis Laguerre, president of the American Chamber of Commerce here, said several companies -- among them Dell, Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble -- are moving regional operations here, or establishing and expanding existing offices, in part because of a law passed in 2007 that waives certain tax and visa requirements for multinational corporations.
At the same time, Panama is taking steps to shake off its reputation as a place to hide money. In the past two years it has signed agreements with 12 countries, including the United States, to exchange tax and other information upon request, a tool to investigate financial criminals.
''It's more cumbersome and challenging to open a bank account in Panama than in the U.S.,'' said Felipe Chapman, an economist at the Indesa consulting firm and former chief executive of the Panama Stock Exchange. ''Panama has evolved tremendously in the past two decades.''
But American law enforcement officials remain troubled by money laundering. An American official who investigates such crimes but was not authorized to speak publicly said the bustling Colon Free Trade Zone, a duty-free shopping mecca on the Caribbean coast, remains a haven to launder money.
In addition, large amounts of cash, he said, pass easily through Panama City's international airport -- itself a growing hub for flights to and from all over Latin America -- because of loose and unenforced customs reporting requirements.
And the newspapers still revel in reporting a never-ending wave of swindles, double-dipping and other shenanigans, some of them on the part of government officials. Transparency International gave Panama a score of only 3.3 out of 10 on the perception of corruption (with a 10 being considered clean).
Even the canal project has been questioned.
Leaked American diplomatic cables last year portrayed a Panamanian vice president's warning that the canal expansion was ''a disaster'' in the making and Mr. Martinelli's lamenting that the canal authority, a separate agency from the government, may have chosen a primary bidder because his cousin runs it. Panamanian officials later disputed the claims in the cable.
Many are watching to see if and how Mr. Noriega is tried on pending murder charges as a sign of maturity among Panama's institutions.
''There is still some banana in the republic,'' said Maurice Belanger, a chamber executive and longtime Panama observer. ''But it is changing fast.''

HEADLINE: Group Urges Countries To Protect Web Speech

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- As a rising tide of digital dissent raises alarms in many capitals around the world, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday called on member countries to ''promote and protect the global free flow of information'' online.
The O.E.C.D. , a group of 34 developed countries, urged policy makers to support investment in digital networks and to take a light touch on regulation, saying this was essential for promoting economic growth via the Internet. 
''It's really a milestone in terms of making a statement about openness,'' said Karen Kornbluh, the U.S. ambassador to the O.E.C.D. ''You can't really get the innovation you need in terms of creating jobs unless we work together to protect the openness of the Internet.''
The approval of the recommendations by the O.E.C.D. council builds on a communique issued at a meeting in June, when the broad outlines of the policy were drawn up. The guidelines are not binding, but are intended to work through the power of persuasion . Also, the Internet recommendations will from now on be included among the criteria for assessing candidates for membership in the O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris.
While the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and other movements have shown the potential of the Internet for organizing political protest, there has also been a backlash, with a number of governments stepping up their efforts to crack down on free speech in the digital sphere.
China, which has long blocked access to Web sites deemed to be undesirable, said recently that it would step up monitoring of social media, messaging services and other forums in an effort to crack down on the publishing of ''harmful information.'' India has asked Internet companies and social media sites to prescreen user contributions to remove disparaging, inflammatory or defamatory content, according to Internet company executives.
In Russia there were reports of a crackdown on Web-borne dissent before and after parliamentary elections this month. Russia was one of a number of countries that blocked the adoption of a U.S.-backed declaration of online freedoms this month at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Russian officials, along with those of some developing countries, have made no secret of their desire to regulate the Internet at an international level, under the auspices of the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency. The O.E.C.D document, by contrast, endorses the existing, dispersed model of Internet governance, under which governments, business organizations and groups representing Internet users all have a say.
The move by the O.E.C.D. on Tuesday ''validates, defends and promotes an Internet model that is not government led, but led by the technical community and the private sector,'' said Markus Kummer, vice president for public policy at the Internet Society , whose members include technology companies and educational institutions. ''I think it is timely to remember some basic cornerstones, when there is increased pressure on governments to get involved in a more hands-on way.''
Some O.E.C.D. members' policies have also come under scrutiny, especially measures aimed at cracking down on unauthorized sharing of digital music and other media. Campaigners for an open Internet have criticized the French approach to fighting piracy, which includes the threat of disconnecting persistent violators' Internet connections.
In the United States, meanwhile, Internet companies like Google are campaigning against congressional proposals that could require them to block links to Web sites accused of facilitating piracy.
The music and movie industries say tougher action is needed to stop piracy. But opponents of the measures say they could be used to stifle legitimate political speech, not just copyright theft.
Among other things, the O.E.C.D. recommendation urges policy makers to ''limit Internet intermediary liability'' -- that is, to shield Internet companies from responsibility for the content that they carry. Under existing U.S. laws, Internet companies have a so-called safe harbor if they take down copyright violations when they are informed of them.
''Congress is proposing solutions that are inconsistent with the O.E.C.D. principles,'' said Leslie Harris, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
President Barack Obama has not taken a position on the bills, but members of his administration have been outspoken in their defense of free speech on the Internet.
''The right to express one's views, practice one's faith, peacefully assemble with others to pursue political or social change -- these are all rights to which all human beings are entitled, whether they choose to exercise them in a city square or an Internet chat room,'' the U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said last week at an Internet conference in the Netherlands. ''And just as we have worked together since the last century to secure these rights in the material world, we must work together in this century to secure them in cyberspace.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With States Desperate to Keep Jobs, Companies Have Upper Hand, Report Shows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As the unemployment crisis grinds on, states are trying to both lure and retain businesses by offering tax breaks, grants, cheap loans -- just about anything (short of candy and foot massages) they can think of. But how many jobs do these expensive incentives actually create?
And are the jobs any good? 
Economic development programs cost states and cities billions of dollars a year, but many programs require little if any job creation, fewer than half call for wage standards, and fewer than a quarter require the companies to provide health care for their workers, according to a study of program requirements scheduled to be released Wednesday by Good Jobs First, a nonprofit research organization that tracks corporate subsidies. Some merely require companies to invest in plants or new equipment, which could actually enable them to reduce their head counts.
States' desperation to hold on to jobs was vividly illustrated this week in Illinois, which is so short of money that it has been unable to pay its bills on time in recent years. After Sears and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were courted by other states, the Illinois Legislature passed large tax breaks to keep them where they are, over the objections of protesters who unfurled a ''Stop Corporate Extortion'' banner in the Illinois House chamber on Monday.
The new tax breaks will save Sears -- which got a big retention package just over 20 years ago, when it left the Sears Tower in Chicago for suburban Hoffman Estates -- an estimated $15 million a year. They will save the state's financial exchanges an estimated $85 million a year.
Such deals are hardly unusual. Companies routinely seek tax breaks to relocate or to stay put. But the new report found that many states lack safeguards to make sure that the money they give companies creates long-lasting, well-paying jobs.
''We hope that states will fix their rules to make sure that their programs are creating lots of jobs, and good jobs, with wages tied to the economy and with health care, so companies aren't getting paid to pull wages down,'' said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, who added that such deals should be watched even more closely in a downturn. ''There's a real tension between economic development spending and the maintenance of vital services.''
States rarely have accurate measures of how many jobs such programs create, but they are discovering that many such programs fail to live up to their billing. Pennsylvania found in a 2009 legislative report that many business in its Keystone Opportunity Zone program ''are not creating jobs or generating capital investment.'' A recent study that New Jersey commissioned of its Urban Enterprise Zone program found that the $2.17 billion it spent over six years had produced ''limited economic impact.'' New York changed its old Empire Zone program, which was supposed to give tax breaks to companies to create jobs in poor areas, after auditors found that some businesses had received tax breaks but lost jobs, while others were being rewarded for hiring in wealthier areas.
''Over time, the programs get deregulated in ways that make them windfalls instead of incentives,'' Mr. LeRoy said.
The new report singled out some states for praise. Nevada and North Carolina's programs were applauded for having strong wage standards, requirements that employers provide health coverage and pay part of the premium, and requirements that subsidized facilities stay open for a set period of time.
Other programs were criticized for their lax safeguards, with programs in Washington D.C., Alaska and Wyoming singled out as having some of the weakest requirements.
With stubbornly high unemployment rates bedeviling states and little new investment, companies find themselves aggressively courted. Chiquita, the banana giant, plans to leave its Cincinnati headquarters for Charlotte, N.C., which lured it with incentives valued at some $22 million.
Tax breaks in the name of economic development were an explanation given last week when another study found that some Fortune 500 companies had paid no state corporate income taxes in recent years. But no governor wants to see jobs flee.
After Illinois lawmakers passed tax breaks for Sears and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- as part of a package that also cut taxes for the working poor -- Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, defended the move. ''Every state in the union has, on the books, tax incentive measures that have been passed by their legislatures to try and get jobs from another state, and other businesses from another state,'' he said Tuesday.

OAKLAND, Calif. -- In most cities, the Occupy movement has been thrown on the defensive, struggling to regroup and plan new protests after being evicted from its encampments by the police.
Not in Oakland.
Long the most militant Occupy branch, Occupy Oakland has continued to push the movement's campaign against the wealthiest 1 percent even after losing its perch in front of City Hall. It spearheaded a one-day action on Monday in which thousands of protesters rallied at West Coast ports from San Diego to Anchorage, effectively closing the Ports of Portland and Longview, Wash., and largely shutting the Port of Oakland.
In the process, Occupy Oakland has cast itself as the true champion of America's workers, creating a potentially troublesome rift with the Occupy movement's sometime allies in organized labor. 
Several labor leaders criticized the plan to disrupt the ports, which cost many longshoremen and truck drivers a day's pay. And union officials were irked by Occupy Oakland's claim that it was advancing the cause of port workers even though several unions opposed the protests.
For example, several days before the disruptions, Robert McEllrath, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, issued a statement warning: ''Support is one thing. Organizing from outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda is quite another.''
Organizers at Occupy Oakland shrugged off the criticism, saying many union leaders are afraid of bold action. The Occupy movement, they say, is doing more for working people than some unions and union leaders are.
''You can't co-opt labor issues if you are in the working class,'' said Boots Riley, 40, a rap musician with the Coup who helped plan the port shutdown. ''The organizers of this movement are the working class, and these are issues that belong to the working class. No one has a copyright on working-class struggles.''
Occupy Oakland led the push to shut West Coast ports, holding conference calls two or three times a week with as many as 40 Occupy protesters in cities from San Diego to Seattle to plan and coordinate the disruptions. Occupy Oakland also sent $1,000 each to four other West Coast Occupy groups to help finance outreach and organizing for the port shutdowns.
The Oakland protesters also made regular visits to the longshore union's hiring hall in San Francisco to gather support from rank-and-file workers. They printed 50,000 fliers about the protest and went to the Oakland port, one of the nation's busiest, to distribute them and talk to nonunion truck drivers.
''The Occupy movement is a union for the 99 percent, and certainly for the 89 percent of working people who are not in unions,'' said Barucha Peller, 28, an unemployed writer who helped plan and rally support for the port shutdown.
The Occupy strategists said they were carrying on the struggle of longshore workers at the Longview port, who have been pressing EGT, a terminal operator, to hire longshoremen instead of workers from another union. A court had imposed a strict injunction against illegal activity by the longshore union after some members had engaged in violent protests.
But the Occupy planners also knew that they had chosen a target that was symbolic of multinational corporations, including the investment bank Goldman Sachs, which owns a major interest in a company that operates many port terminals. They also figured that disrupting ports was relatively easy and likely to bring them lots of attention.
While the protests drew support from some port workers, others were dismayed by the disruptions.
''They're taking money out of my pocket,'' said Lee Ranaldson, 63, a nonunion trucker from Cleveland who said he had been blocked from dropping off his cargo of refrigerated meat for more than 12 hours. ''Who are the leaders of this thing and what do they want?''
Some union leaders noted wryly that the Occupy movement -- after gratefully accepting major donations of money, food, sleeping bags and winter clothing from labor unions -- had repeatedly warned unions not to seek to co-opt them.
With the port effort, the Occupy movement suddenly seemed to be engineering protests and work stoppages on its own, essentially co-opting the unions' cause instead of working with them.
While praising the Occupy movement's goal of helping the 99 percent, Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association, faulted the protesters' tactics, saying, ''I don't know how you call a strike without involving the union or the workers.''
But the Occupy activists said unions were too timid about pushing the interests of workers.
''The 1 percent has been able to write and pass labor laws that are designed to restrict the amount of action that can legally be taken by a union. Most union officials today refuse to challenge those laws,'' Occupy organizers wrote on a Web site explaining the port shutdown. ''It is the responsibility of rank-and-file workers and their allies to escalate the labor struggle. Occupy can spearhead this movement.''
Some Occupy participants and labor experts asserted that the longshore union, which they said feared endorsing the protests because of the court injunction and pending contracts, was not really opposed to the port disruptions and was happy to see the Occupy protesters carry on its fight.
''It reminds me of what John L. Lewis, the great mine workers' leader, did when the mine workers engaged in a wildcat strike,'' said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara. ''He'd give a wink and a nod.''
Craig Merrilees, a spokesman for the longshore union, denied there was any such tacit approval and said his union resented the Occupy organizers' assertions that the union was craven.
''It's silly to lecture the I.L.W.U. about being overcautious when the members of this union have always been willing to be courageous and put their bodies on the line,'' he said.

HEADLINE: California, With Revenue Shortfalls, Will See More Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The California Legislature passed a budget in June relying on optimistic projections of how much money the state could bring in with a growing economy. But to the surprise of few, not all of that money has materialized.
Gov. Jerry Brown said Tuesday that the state was about $2.2 billion short of its projected $88.5 billion income and that that would force hundreds of millions of dollars more in cuts to the budget, primarily to state colleges and universities as well as to health care. Under the budget the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved, if revenues are more than $1 billion short of projections, automatic reductions specified in the budget -- known as trigger cuts -- will go into effect. 
The cuts will mean the elimination of $248 million in state financing for public school transportation and are almost certain to increase fees for college students. Still, the projections fell short of the doomsday predictions that some had worried about, which would have cut as many as seven days from the school year in some public schools. Now, schools will lose about $80 million, amounting to about $13.18 per student.
''I think we are very fortunate that at least we got half the revenue,'' Mr. Brown said, announcing in a Sacramento news conference the nearly $1 billion in cuts. ''So we did hope for more and we got more, but not quite as much as we wanted. The cuts are far less than they could have been. It was much wiser to assume the $4 billion, than to make the $4 billion in cuts.''
But the cuts remain drastic, with $100 million cut for in-home health care and other reductions to child care, libraries and services for the disabled. The University of California and the California State University systems, already suffering from steady cuts, will each lose an additional $100 million.
The superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, John Deasy, said he would file a lawsuit on Wednesday to try to prevent the state from ending financing for public school buses.
Last month the state Legislative Analyst's Office projected a higher shortfall of $3.7 billion, which would have meant even deeper cuts. But state budget officials said their projections were based on more recent state income and corporate tax receipts, which are higher than the earlier report predicted.
In some ways, the large cuts could make it easier for Mr. Brown to sell voters on his plan to increase taxes in order to pay for services. The governor is planning to ask voters next November to increase the state sales tax temporarily and to increase taxes on the state's highest earners, which he says would raise $7 billion a year. A poll released this week by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 60 percent of voters support such a measure.
Mr. Brown and his fellow Democrats argue that the problem is not that the state is spending too much, but that the revenues are not enough to pay for services that most citizens want, like schools and programs for the needy.
''Relative to the wealth of California, our spending is low,'' the governor said.
He invoked a Latin phrase to explain his view: ''Nemo dat quod non habet -- it means no man can give what he does not have, and the state cannot give what it does not have.''
''We can't go around spending in the way people would like when the tax revenue doesn't generate it,'' he added.
State Senator Bob Huff, a Republican and the vice chairman of the budget committee, derided the governor's plans for increased taxes.
''Lost in the slick sales pitch for higher so-called temporary taxes, though, is the fact that our tax revenues are up over last year,'' Mr. Huff said in a statement. ''Raising the tax rates at a time our state is struggling to emerge from a recession and high unemployment is not the answer, and will strangle our recovery.''
The legislative analyst's report released last month projected that the state would face a nearly $13 billion budget shortfall next year. So even if the governor's tax increase was approved by voters, the Legislature could still be forced to cut $6 billion.
''When the governor puts out a budget in January, I am sure it will be austere out of necessity,'' said Senator Darrell Steinberg, a Democrat and president pro tem of the Senate. ''But I do not think that we should jump to deeper cuts in any area. We know the best way to deal with the revenue package is to build in assumptions about what we have and then wait to see what we actually get.''
The main problem for the state is that the rules requiring a two-thirds majority for a tax increase was hobbling the governor's efforts, said Jean Ross, the executive director of the California Budget Project, a watchdog group.
''From a budget standpoint, California has these incredibly strict rules,'' Ms. Ross said. ''If we played by the rules they play by in Texas, Florida and New York, the Legislature would have been done with raising taxes early last year, and we would be moving toward getting our fiscal house in order.''
But with the governor moving forward on plans to put the question of raising taxes before voters, she said, ''there will be a real conversation about what we want from the government in California.''
