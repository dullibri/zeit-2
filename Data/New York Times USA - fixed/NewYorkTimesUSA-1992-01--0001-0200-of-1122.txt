HEADLINE: A Rising Argument That Teaching Values Should Rank With Lessons

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

 BODY:
Kevin Walsh, an education professor at the University of Alabama, says that what is wrong with America's schools is not that Johnny can't do math. Johnny can do math. And he can read and write.
The problem, Professor Walsh says, is that Johnny does not write neatly or take time to punctuate properly. When Johnny works through math problems, he often races to find a solution, seizing shortcuts and bypassing critical steps that prevent errors. 
 Nor does the trouble end there, Professor Walsh says. When Johnny is asked to care for the classroom rabbit, he is delighted to play with the pet but avoids the unpleasant task of cleaning the cage. When it is time to paint, Johnny produces beautiful artwork but does not rinse his brushes and put away his paints. Hand out milk? No problem, but Johnny will not return to the cafeteria and get more milk for classmates who did not get a container.
 
Plan for Building Character
 In short, Professor Walsh says, most American schools, while working at teaching basic skills, fail to instill in children the values, morals and other positive attributes that contribute to the development of good character. Long on facts but short on the qualities that so often produce success in life, including dependability, honesty and perseverance, many children do not realize their potential, Professor Walsh says.
In extreme cases, he adds, the absence in schools of an emphasis on a child's character contributes to classroom discipline problems, truancy and juvenile delinquency.
"Our society is certainly not deteriorating because of lack of knowledge," Professor Walsh said in an interview at the School of Education here. "While we are not going to make everyone a brain surgeon, we can develop people who have positive characters and who are, therefore, valuable members of society."
Among others, who, like Professor Walsh, are talking about the importance of developing character in children are Philip Jackson, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago, William Damon, chairman of the department of education at Brown University, and Penelope Leach, who writes children's textbooks.
Character education, which some educators call "values clarification," is not new. More than a half-century ago, the educator John Dewey wrote about the importance of using schools to impart values to children. Nor is character education without risk.
"You can have disciplined slaves, but is that really what you want?" asked Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a professor of developmental psychology at the University of Chicago. "Discipline is not always internalized and actually can breed resentment among children."
 
View Attracts Attention
 But at a time when parents, teachers and politicians are trying to understand why the quality of the schools has slipped and are debating solutions, Professor Walsh's contention that building character may be as important as reading, writing and arithmetic is injecting a fresh note into the discussion.
"To limit education only to what is relevant is to reduce it," he said. "The purpose of education is to prepare the next generation to inherit society."
Professor Walsh's views, particularly as they relate to expecting children to behave in a respectable and responsible manner, are attracting widespread interest. Here at the University of Alabama, which has named him teacher of the year 12 times, his courses are always fully subscribed, and often oversubscribed. And nationwide scores of educational organizations have asked him to speak.
At the heart of Professor Walsh's theories is the idea that if children are equipped to exercise self-discipline, they will be well on their way to developing a strong positive character and self-esteem. The object, he says, is not to turn public schools into military academies. Rather, he advocates schools in which children respect the teacher and one another, and in which the curriculum has character development at its core.
It is not enough, for example, that a student in a large group can give the right answer to a math problem, Professor Walsh says. That student must also know to wait to be recognized before giving the answer.
Some educators and child psychologists find this emphasis on character education superficial and misplaced. A preoccupation with self-discipline, they argue, ignores the horrors of some children's homes -- divorce, sexual abuse, drug use, violence -- and the importance of attending to their emotional needs.
 
'Those Other Qualities'
 "If someone is not listening to that child's emotional concerns, the child cannot possibly begin to concentrate on developing those other qualities you call 'character,' " said Patricia Sherman, a psychologist and professor of child development at New York's Bank Street College of Education.
Ms. Sherman also said that emphasizing decorum in the classroom can stifle creativity. "Children need to be moving and exploring their world," she said. "Professor Walsh is not taking the psychological and cognitive development of children into account."
Professor Walsh responds that by developing character, children build the self-esteem that often suffers at home. "Children experience joy in finding and fulfilling responsibility," he said.
With so many single-parent homes and households with both parents working, Professor Walsh says it has fallen to schools to take on some of the responsibility of building character through discipline.
Every elementary-school classroom, he says, should have a "rules chart" and every rule should have a purpose. For example, a rule requiring students to ask the teacher's permission to leave the classroom shows students how to respect authority and how to practice patience, and a rule forbidding speaking while other students are speaking demonstrates the rules of courtesy.
He says that he also believes in posting responsibility charts to make clear to children their assigned tasks, like handing out books, feeding the fish and watering the plants.
 
Preparing for Work
 These are precisely the qualities, Professor Walsh said, that lead to success in jobs.
"The development of character is the backbone of the economic system," Professor Walsh said. "It is the fiber by which the work ethic develops."
A postal worker's son who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Pittsburgh and who served as a principal of a rural Pennsylvania school for two years, Professor Walsh has become something of a hit in his own community, Trussville, the Birmingham suburb to which he and his wife, Donna, an elementary school teacher, moved 12 years ago.
Soon after arriving, Professor Walsh was elected to the Jefferson County Board of Education, which oversees public schools in Trussville and nearby Hewitt. He has used these schools as laboratories for his ideas.
At the Hewitt-Trussville Middle School, he met with teachers and encouraged them to praise students' good behavior and to quickly and unambiguously scold their displays of bad behavior.
In an effort to teach older students that they must bear the consequences of their misdeeds, Professor Walsh introduced a rule at the Hewitt-Trusville High School that required students who were caught spray-painting graffiti on the school's exterior walls not only to pay fines but to clean up their mess. To develop students' work ethic and sense of community, he had them weed and groom a derelict baseball field.
All this character building, says Connie Williams, the high school's principal, has instilled in students a desire to do the best they can.
As a result, she said, the high school, which used to have only two sections of chemistry, now has enough students enrolled to fill 12 sections. There are two sections of honors chemistry and one advanced placement course. The foreign language department, which included instruction in French and Spanish, has been expanded to include Latin.
Nowadays, she said, "It's hard for me to imagine teaching children reading and writing without also attempting to build their character."

HEADLINE: Accord Reached to Halt Civil War in El Salvador

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Wednesday, Jan. 1

 BODY:
The Government of El Salvador and the leftist guerrillas who have fought to overthrow it for more than a decade announced in the first minutes of the new year a comprehensive plan to end their civil war.
Their accord capped an extraordinary day and night of talks that saw the departing Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, postpone his retirement hour after hour to continue prodding the negotiators to settle their differences before the year ended. 
 The new year "will be the year of peace and harmony for a country very dear to you," Mr. Perez de Cuellar told the negotiators as they waited to sign the agreement in his office. Reading from its text, he said its execution would "bring a definitive end the Salvadoran armed conflict."
 
Cease-Fire on Feb. 1
 Negotiators said the summary accord they signed a few minutes after the deadline they had pledged to observe was based on a 75-page document that fell just short of the final peace treaty that they had hoped to conclude.
But leaders of both the conservative Government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said that with their pledge to negotiate a schedule for the implementation of their accords by Jan. 10, they were certain that the guns of Central America's most violent conflict would finally fall silent.
They said a cease-fire would begin on Feb. 1 and continue until Oct. 31.
Thus would end a conflict that has ravaged a tiny country that has become known to world for the disparities in its distribution of wealth and the intensity with which its people have gone about killing one another.
 
75,000 Killed in Fighting
 Since the fighting began, set off by the rightist backlash to the overthrow of a military dictator by reformist officers in October 1979, it has left more than 75,000 people dead. Most of them have been civilians.
From a population that was slightly more than 5 million when the war began, more than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes or have left the country. The fighting has also battered the economy and institutions of El Salvador without respite, frustrating a $4 billion effort by the United States to defeat the rebels, revive the country and implant democracy there under strong civilian control.
 
Negotiators Embrace
 The rebel and Government negotiators, who embraced each other warmly after the signing, said that their agreements would bring about a sweeping tranformation of Salvadoran society.
"Our ten years of struggle are expressed in these accords," said Salvador Sanchez Ceren, a former teachers' union leader who commands one of the two largest rebel armies. "These are fundamental changes that are going to take place."
Mr. Sanchez and other negotiators that the agreement would sharply reduce the size of the military, purge them of abusive officers, change their military doctrine, and turn over control of public order to a new National Civil Police.
The agreement will also provide full political freedoms for former guerrilla combatants after they lay down their arms and land for peasants in rebel-held zones, the negotiators said.
 
U.N. to Verify Accords
 The terms of agreement are to be verified by the United Nations, through a contingent of special representatives in El Salvador.
The excruciating difficulty of the negotiations stemmed in large part from the fact that they became a forum in which the rebels sought many of the political and economic changes that they had failed to win on the battlefield.
In negotiating an end to the war that they had fought in the name of political and economic justice, guerrilla leaders pressed for an agreement that might recoup some of the support they lost as Salvadorans tired of the fighting. The Government, which had long sought to undercut the guerrillas' appeal with limited democratic reforms, made significant concessions to the rebels last fall but then stiffened its positions as it came under sharp criticism from conservative military officers, politicians and businessmen.
The head of Mr. Cristiani's Nationalist Republican Alliance Party, Armando Calderon Sol, agreed that the agreement would dramatically change El Salvador. But he denied that it represented a rebel victory.
"It is the Salvadoran people who are the great victors of the end to this tragic chapter in our history," he said.
Through much of the 1980's, analysts on both sides of the conflict blamed much of the bloodshed on those who helped make El Salvador a scene of superpower conflict. But it was a further reminder of the depth of the hatred and mistrust among the Salvadorans themselves that as the night dragged on, they managed to resist intense pressures for peace from a grouping of nations that would have been almost unthinkable before the end of the cold war.
 
Pressure From U.S.
 At the request of Mr. Perez de Cuellar, diplomats said, United States officials including the Assistant Secretary of State of for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, spent hours at the United Nations headquarters coaxing and cajoling officials of a Government they had steadfastly supported in the war.
And for days, officials of Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico and Spain -- all countries that had criticized the United States in years past for opposing diplomatic solutions in Central America -- worked in concert in trying to soften the positions on both Salvadoran sides.
Throughout the day, United Nations officials had insisted that Mr. Perez de Cuellar would leave his offices without fail by 4:15 P.M. to catch a plane that would take him out of the city on vacation. Shortly thereafter, his wife, Marcela, arrived at United Nations headquarters, got out of a car and was overheard saying that she was going upstairs to get her husband. Instead, Mr. Perez de Cuellar came down to tell a crowd of reporters and United Nations officials who had gathered to say goodbye that he would continue his mediation for two or three hours more. And more than six hours later, he was still at work.
Diplomats involved in the talks said they had reached a deadlock in the final hours with a dispute over the terms economic and social measures in the agreement, including the terms under which the Government would distribute land to peasants in rebel-held zones.
 
Agreement on Sept. 25
 In the preliminary accords that Mr. Cristiani and the rebels signed at the United Nations on Sept. 25, they had committed themselves to broad terms under which the guerrillas would lay down their arms and return to legal politics.
The powerful armed forces were to be reduced sharply in size, purged of abusive officers and stripped of the virtual impunity that the officer corps has enjoyed throughout the war. Military doctrine was to be rewritten, military education changed, and responsibility for public order was to fall to a new civilian police force in which former rebel combatants would be allowed to serve. It was also agreed that social programs would be put into place to ease the effects of economic austerity policies imposed by Mr. Cristiani.
But with a vast amount of detail to work out, positions hardened on both sides. Three rounds of talks in Mexico made only limited progress.
 
U.N. Chief Preoccupied
 After the talks moved to New York, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, overwhelmed with the details of leaving the United Nations after ten years' leadership and hobbled by a bout of sciatica, was available to join them only intermittently.
Frustrated by the stubbornness that seemed to well up in negotiators each time sat down across from enemy representatives, Mr. Perez de Cuellar's representative to the talks, Alvaro de Soto, tried to move them along with indirect meetings. But he had little succcess, and the day before Christmas Government officials spoke of giving up for the time being and going home.
"There is a fundamental problem of trust," one Latin diplomat said on Christmas Eve.
Shortly thereafter, over what diplomats said were the objections of some senior military officers and extreme conservatives in his own Government, Mr. Cristiani finally agreed to Mr. Perez de Cuellar's requests that he take charge of the Government delegation. He decided to come after encouragement from several quarters, diplomats said, including President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico.

HEADLINE: SOVIET BRAIN DRAIN POSES ATOMIC RISK, U.S. REPORT WARNS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials are expressing apprehension that the economic deterioration of the former Soviet Union, the demoralization of its military forces and an expected high rate of unemployment may prompt some of its top experts with the know-how for making nuclear weapons to sell their services abroad.
A classified report prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence bureaus and agencies on weapons proliferation in the former Soviet Union warns that the potential for nuclear mercenaries is more worrisome than the danger of nuclear-related materials going astray because they are easier to control, said officials familiar with the report. 
 Other nuclear weapons experts both inside and outside the Administration said they believed the danger of the Soviet brain drain could be overstated. They argue that even with the know-how, the crucial ingredient in making a nuclear bomb is sufficient quantities of plutonium or highly enriched weapons-grade uranium, which are subject to strict international controls and extremely difficult to acquire.
 
A Worst-Case Scenario
 The intelligence report, one of about a dozen brief analyses on the breakup of the Soviet Union ordered by Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, estimates that 900,000 military officials and civilians work in the nuclear weapons community -- from blue-collar workers running lathes for nuclear weapons and academicians with theoretical knowledge about the state of nuclear materials to military personnel responsible for deploying and maintaining nuclear weapons.
Of that number, some senior Administration officials estimate, as many as 2,000 people in the former Soviet Union have an intimate knowledge of nuclear weapons design, and 3,000 to 5,000 people have worked in uranium enrichment or plutonium production.
"A large percentage of these people could be of value to foreign buyers," said one non-proliferation expert in the Bush Administration.
The intelligence report, a National Intelligence Estimate that has been circulated to President Bush and other senior policy makers, paints a worst-case scenario of what is likely to happen when unemployed scientists, military officers and academicians who have made their livelihoods in the huge nuclear weapons industry meet up with buyers who are already wandering around the former republics.
The potential problem is so serious that the Administration's goal will be to slow down, not eliminate, the seepage of materials and expertise, the intelligence analysis says.
 
'More Concern About Experts'
 "The paper discusses the enormous potential for draining away technologies and experts as people are looking to make a fast buck," said one intelligence official familiar with the report. "In the end, there is more concern about the experts. It's the people who really count."
In a news conference on Dec. 19 after his trip to the Soviet Union, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said that both authorities in the republics and the union gave him assurances that they would impose stringent export controls on weapons and technology. But even the strictest controls cannot stop the flow of expertise, said one nuclear non-proliferation official, who added, "There is no expectation they will have much success in stopping the movement of people."
American intelligence has not uncovered conclusive evidence that rogue nations have begun to recruit nuclear experts, although officials have received intelligence reports that wealthy individuals and groups are traveling in the former republics seeking both technology and expertise.
In testimony before Congress earlier this month, Mr. Gates speculated that among the tens of thousands of scientists and engineers emigrating annually from the Soviet Union, some may find a market for their expertise in countries in the developing world that are striving to acquire new weaponry. In a subsequent interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Gates said unemployment and food shortages may compel Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons experts to market their expertise abroad.
 
Concern in Former Republics
 Concerns by Bush Administration officials is echoed by officials in the various former republics, who have stressed the danger of widespread unemployment of nuclear experts in urging the rest of the world to pour in huge amounts of aid.
"You have to discount some of the rumors, because the scientists themselves have a vested interest making it appear like a big problem," said one Administration official involved in non-proliferation issues.
But the concern is reflected in the American academic community as well. A recent Harvard University report on control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal concluded: "Bomb designers, builders of assemblies for testing, custodians of the Soviet Union's excess supply of special nuclear materials, manufacturers of sensitive components and employees of final weapons assembly facilities all have some sort of access to nuclear materials and even to finished bombs. They also possess knowledge of the deployed weapons and have personal contacts among the custodians and the military. In this period of drastic cuts in military purchases, managers of these facilities may find themselves with large numbers of disgruntled workers seeking to use their special access and knowledge for political or economic gain."
As an example of the potential seepage of nuclear materials, the Administration's intelligence analysis cites a report on Moscow television last July about a roadblock set up to uncover drugs. Instead, officers conducting a search seized platinum and other materials used in nuclear weapons development that the television report asserted had been stolen from Chelyabinsk-70, one of the former Soviet Union's two main nuclear weapons design laboratories, which is in the Urals in Russia.
Bush Administration officials said they could not confirm reports that 65 pounds of low-enriched uranium seized in northern Italy last month and a tiny amount of plutonium seized from a businessman in Switzerland in October originated in the former Soviet Union.
On Monday, Romano Dolce, assistant public prosecutor in the northern Italian town of Como, said on Italian television that American experts had examined the nuclear material and concluded that they were of Soviet origin. But American intelligence officials said the United States had not inspected the material.
"We have seen various reports in recent months of attempts by entities in the former Soviet Union to sell nuclear and other materials," said Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman. "We cannot confirm any of these reports at this time but are checking into the latest reports from Italy. In view of the uncertain conditions in the republics of the former Soviet Union we are concerned that illicit sales could take place by entities or individuals seeking hard currency."

Technology Without Borders Raises Big Questions for U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Just as they once moved manufacturing plants overseas, American companies are now spreading their research and product development around the world, helping to turn the creation of technology into an activity that transcends national borders.
The trend raises tough new issues for policy makers intent on preserving jobs for Americans and keeping the nation competitive in high-technology industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals and information processing. But many business leaders say the march toward technology with no national allegiances -- the march toward the borderless lab -- is as inevitable as it is irrevocable. Government policies that do not adapt to this fundamental industrial shift, many executives contend, are bound to fail. 
 "Policy has to deal with these global realities," said John A. Armstrong, vice president for science and technology at the International Business Machines Corporation.
But not all policy makers and strategists agree how to proceed. Some would seek to stem the international flow to safeguard America's braintrust. Others insist that the best Government response is to accept the inevitable, while insuring that the United States offers a supportive economic environment for research and development work by foreign and domestic companies alike.
Most executives tend to be pragmatists who say that innovation recognizes no borders. "We want to be able to tap into technology wherever it is developed," said Geoffrey C. Nicholson, staff vice president for international technical operations at the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. "It would be naive to think the U.S. is Mecca for all technologies." The St. Paul company, which makes everything from Post-it notes to optical data disks, now has 2,500 technical people stationed abroad, three times as many as in 1980.
Overseas laboratories are not the only mechanism for the globalization of technology development. In the last month alone, other examples have included the acquisition of a majority stake in a promising American pharmaceutical biotechnology start-up, Systemix Inc., by a leading Swiss drug maker, Sandoz Ltd. From across the Atlantic came word that I.B.M. and Siemens A.G. of Germany had jointly developed the prototype for a new generation of computer memory chip. A few days later, across the Pacific, I.B.M. said it would produce a Japanese-English notebook computer for one of its computer rivals, Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd.
Since the mid-1980's, there have been more than 900 transnational alliances by United States businesses or investments by foreign companies in American technology start-ups, and those deals do not include countless other joint marketing agreements or outright acquisitions.
With more and more products assembled from components made around the world, notions like "made in the U.S.A." and "American know-how" may be destined to take their place alongside such relics as the "space race" and war bonds in the history of American industrial policy. Apple Computer Inc., which a decade ago was considered the epitome of renegade American entrepreneurial verve, is now working to combine its software expertise with the Sony Corporation's ability in miniaturization to develop consumer electronics devices that neither company could produce as well on its own.
 
Big Risks for U.S. Companies
 The advent of the borderless lab raises big risks for American companies and for the United States economy. Since, as is widely acknowledged, American industry often lags behind foreign companies in manufacturing, the nation's competitive edge now depends on being able to create new technologies faster than overseas rivals. But the rapid spread of technological expertise around the globe could dull this edge in the future.
Globalization also makes it more difficult for policy makers to determine how best to serve the nation's interests, or even to define what those interests are. The conundrum is likely to color the industrial policy debate that is starting to revive in this Presidential election year -- and cannot help but provide a subtext next week when President Bush visits Japan with 21 American executives in tow.
Among the policy issues is whether the Government should try to stem the overseas migration of American technology by such measures as blocking acquisitions of key American technology companies by foreign corporations.
Other questions: Does it makes sense for Washington to spend money on research and development, or on competitiveness programs like the Sematech semiconductor consortium, if the technological fruits are going to be immediately enjoyed overseas? If the Government does finance such programs, should they include only American-owned companies, or also foreign companies operating in the United States?
 
Technology at Fire-Sale Prices?
 "You don't want a situation in which very significant technology is being bought at fire-sale prices in the United States and commercialized overseas," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington.
Mr. Prestowitz is in the camp of strategists and policy makers who argue that the globalization of technology can still be, and should be, held in check. Access to technology, like access to markets, they say, is not equal around the world. It is far more difficult, for instance, for an American company to buy a Japanese one than vice versa, they note, arguing that the United States would be naive not to look out for its own interests.
"We're the only country in the world that thinks nationality doesn't matter," said Pat Choate, an economist who is a leading critic of foreign investment in the United States.
But another school of thought -- whose adherents include many business people -- contends that globalization is inevitable and that the best policy is to make sure the United States reaps its share of benefits from the trend.
 
'A Very Hazardous Exercise'
 "The policies that won't work are those that assume the technology base is national," said Proctor P. Reid, who is a senior program officer at the National Academy of Engineering, which advises the Government on technical matters, and is co-editor of "National Interests in an Age of Global Technology," a book recently published by the academy.
"These global networks are already well developed," he said. "To try to tear the fabric to advantage your companies, or companies resident in the U.S., seems to me a very hazardous exercise."
Just how hazardous was shown in the recent controversy over display screens for notebook computers. To help American manufacturers of these flat panel displays, the Government levied tariffs on screens imported from Japan. But American computer companies, led by Apple and I.B.M., said the tariffs hurt them as well as the Japanese because they needed the screens to stay competitive. To avoid the tariffs, Apple and some other companies have already begun moving production of their portable machines outside the United States.
Those who share Mr. Reid's outlook say that as companies become even more globalized, the companies' nationalities will matter less and less. If I.B.M. and Fujitsu Ltd., the Japanese computer giant, were to spread their jobs, profits and expertise equally around the world, the United States might have little interest in which company triumphed in computer sales.
But, according to this line of thought, the United States would have a vital interest in securing the best jobs for its citizens by making this nation an attractive place for both Fujitsu and I.B.M. to conduct their research, development and manufacturing.
 
Seeking Improvements
 Therefore, those who see globalization as inevitable are calling for Washington to improve domestic education, modernize American factories and create advanced telecommunications networks within the United States. Such improvements, they say, cannot migrate across borders as easily as research discoveries.
"The goal is to have a flourishing climate in the United States for the creation of wealth and added value," Dr. Armstrong of I.B.M. said.
Those who think the nation should go with the technology flow also say that rather than worrying about the nation's best ideas being smuggled away, American companies and the Government should concentrate on acquiring more foreign technology and putting it to use in this country -- an effort that the United States did not have to make during the decades of American technological hegemony.
Nowadays, parties on both side of the issue acknowledge, the United States no longer holds a near monopoly on technical advances. Indeed, while the earlier movement of American manufacturing abroad was aimed largely at taking advantage of low-cost foreign labor, the movement of research and development is intended to tap foreign knowledge.
 
Isolation Can Hurt
 "If you isolate yourself to the United States you can hurt yourself and your ability to be competitive," said Alexander MacLachlan, senior vice president of research and development at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the American chemicals giant.
Only 10 percent of Du Pont's current research and development is conducted overseas, Dr. MacLachlan said, and "we recognize that it is not a satisfactory situation." The company is gradually increasing its level of overseas research, he said.
At Motorola Inc., the Schaumburg, Ill., maker of semiconductors and communications equipment, researchers are quick to point out that the Europeans have pioneered many developments in telecommunications, including alternatives to cellular telephones. "We ignore that at our peril," said Dick Heimlich, corporate vice president for international strategy at Motorola, which established a telecommunications research laboratory in England in 1991.
Another motive in conducting research and product development abroad is to increase overseas sales, which already account for more than half the revenues of many technology companies. Companies are also trying to achieve closer cooperation between their research-and-development activities and manufacturing, to speed the introduction of new products.
 
Products From Singapore
 That sometimes means putting research and development near manufacturing plants that moved abroad years ago. The Hewlett-Packard Company, for example, began a few yars ago to move some product development activities to a plant in Singapore that in the past simply manufactured products designed in the United States. Recently, an engineer in Singapore developed a key component that will become the basis of an entirely new line of Hewlett-Packard printers.
Sometimes, of course, political factors play a role. Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive, John A. Young, said some foreign governments let it be known, however subtly, that they considered it good corporate citizenship to place research, development and manufacturing activities within their borders, rather than merely selling products there. The United States has also encouraged foreign companies, particularly Japanese auto makers, to set up plants and design centers in this country.
Despite the various transnational forces, technology development by American companies remains far less internationalized than manufacturing and sales. On the whole, only 10 percent of American corporate research and development funds is spent abroad. Basic research is even more likely than product development to be kept close to headquarters -- in large part because the creation of wholly new technology is so close to the heart of a company's business.
Motorola, for instance, gets half its revenues from international sales, and 40 percent of its work force is stationed abroad. But officials estimate that only 20 to 25 percent of product development is conducted overseas and only about 5 percent of pure research. Even I.B.M, whose European researchers have won two Nobel prizes, conducts less than 25 percent of its research and development outside the United States, Dr. Armstrong said.
 
Where the Benefits Go
 Armed with such evidence, some policy analysts argue that globalization is still relatively limited. There is an enduring national component to technology development, the argue, that continues to justify policies favoring American companies. "The primary benefits will always go to the host country," said Dr. Choate, the economist.
Dr. Choate and some other analysts fear that the transfer of high-paying research and development jobs could hurt the American economy by exporting prime cuts of personal income. But on this point, as in the other issues emanating from the borderless lab, corporate executives say that if they fail to direct their energies offshore when appropriate, their companies would be less competitive -- and the American economy would suffer even more.
At Hewlett-Packard, one of the nation's largest exporters, Mr. Young said the company had no choice but to continue expanding its overseas research and development. Otherwise, he said, "we wouldn't have a thriving business and we wouldn't be able to do these exports."

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Calls Muslim Militants a Threat to Africa

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
A few weeks before the Islamic Salvation Front swept to victory in the first round of national legislative elections in Algeria, a senior Bush Administration official was analyzing the many faces of political ferment in Africa in the 1990's: the drift to anarchy in Somalia, the move to democracy in Zambia, unrest in Zaire and the promise of peaceful change in South Africa.
At the end, he paused to reflect on the single most worrisome trend for policy makers. "The march of Islamic fundamentalism," he said. 
 In government and the research organizations, the Algerian election results last week were a reaffirmation of the potential power of Islam in African politics. Moreover, experts believe that the trend is not confined to North Africa, historically part of the Islamic world, but that it could affect the political stability of countries from the Horn of Africa south to Kenya and Tanzania and west to Nigeria and Senegal.
The result would be the establishment of governments antithetical to secular politics and Western cultures, posing a new challenge to Western policy makers after the collapse of Communism. The Senate Foreign Relations African Affairs subcommittee is to hold hearings on this issue early in 1992.
 
Networks Are Growing
 The test case, Bush Administration officials and independent experts say, is the Sudan. If the Sudan, where a military Government under the influence of a zealous Muslim party, the National Islamic Front, is able to enforce its austere vision of society on a country where various ethnic and religious groups have lived in uneasy coexistence for generations, then other nations historically more African than Arabic in culture and religion, are vulnerable to similar movements. Diverse Islamic movements are already building networks.
Some Muslims are tempted to see in the resurgence of religious fervor a renewal of the triumphant sweep of Islam across North Africa and into the Iberian peninsula from the seventh to the ninth centuries. Ijaz Gilani, an Islamic scholar and adviser to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, cautions against jumping to such conclusions.
"The feeling I have is that these societies where there is an Islamic resurgence are fairly weak societies not making great strides in science, art, economy or social organization as classical Islam did," he said in a telephone interview from Islamabad. "So this is more of a defensive step against Western society, which is still a dynamic force."
With the worldwide decline of Communism, always a foe of Islamic radicalism, or earlier suppression of leftist movements, as in the Sudan, well-educated Islamic leaders have begun to play on a search for roots and "to use the tools of modern society to reinforce an Islamic agenda," said Francis Deng, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Sudanese Ambassador to the United States. "It is a politicized Islam to be used for political control."
 
Assisted by Iranians
 Mr. Deng said in an interview that Islamic radicalism is coming down from the north and gaining strength in the Sudan, which is becoming a base for a wider Islamic campaign, assisted by Iranians.
"The Sudanese National Islamic Front, under its very bright leader, Hassan el-Turabi, is now recognized as a force across the continent," Mr. Deng said. "Sudan could become a bridge for Islam into Africa."
He added, however, that the strongly Christian southern Sudan would have to be put down by force first, along with areas in the west and north where Islam has been tempered by African religions and Sufi mysticism.
David Chand, a Sudanese political scientist living in the United States, said the military Government now in power, backed by the National Islamic Front, is already showing that it is capable of "genocide" in southern Sudan.
 
Training Camps Set Up
 In the western part of the country, he said in an interview, there are "systematic human rights violations against ethnic African Muslims." Training camps are being set up in the Sudan to train Islamic warriors from Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, the Persian Gulf nations and Saudi Arabia, he said.
Islamic groups are also active in Chad, Niger and Mali. Mali's President, Amadou Toumani Toure, began negotiations this month with four Muslim rebel groups made up of Taureg people from the Sahara region whose clashes with Malian troops have killed several hundred people in recent months.
Envoys from Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were observers at the talks. All are reported concerned at the links being built among Muslim movements.
According to a Congressional aide who has been researching the Muslim movements, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi is apparently among those feeling threatened by Islamic radicals. The Libyan leader recently made a speech against fundamentalism in the Sudan.
 
Comes From Many Sources
 Experts say the rise of Islamic fundamentalism or radicalism comes from many sources, mostly drawn from within the diverse African societies themselves. The Iranians are now reported to be taking advantage of these to foster their vision of an absolutist Islamic state that is neither African nor Arab. Iran, a largely Shiite Muslim nation, is a fierce rival of predominantly Sunni Saudi Arabia for dominance in the Islamic world from Central Asia to Southeast Asia.
A Bush Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Islamic fundamentalists, whose goal is to end a separation of religion from politics just as democratization is spreading in Africa, have devised different formulas to suit local conditions, supporting Muslim parties where there are religious divisions and backing the least "Africanized" Muslims where Islam predominates.
Moderates in Iran, this official believes, are encouraging militants to "do their thing" in Africa, far away from Teheran, which is now thought to be eager to rebuild bridges with the West.

The Global Lab
U.S. companies are spreading their research and product development around the world, helping to turn the creation of technology into an activity that transcends national borders. The trend raises tough new issues for policy makers intent on preserving jobs for Americans and keeping the nation competitive in high technology. Business Technology: A special report. [Page 1.] 
 In agricultural biotechnology, the contrast between the American style of creating new businesses and the approach in Europe and Japan is especially stark. [48.] The idea of an all-American semiconductor is fast becoming a historical artifact. No industry has seen a bigger blitz of international alliances. [48.]
An expanding international network of computer links is spurring a remarkable transformation in virtually every scientific discipline. [49.] Every new airliner is the product of international cooperation. [49.] Drug research has become as international as medicine itself, and pharmaceuticals are among the few products in which the U.S. has a surplus of exports over imports. [49.]
 
Markets
A year ago, few on Wall Street would have predicted the year-long bull market to come. War gave prices the initial lift, and the year was capped by a record December, sparked by lower interest rates. The Dow ended with a gain of 4.92, to 3,168.83, its fourth straight record. Small stocks did even better in 1991. [1.]
Stock mutual funds apparently had their best year ever, and bond funds seem to have turned in their best sales figures since 1986. [45.]
Treasury bond prices moved higher and long-term interest rates fell again in light pre-holiday trading. [55.]
The dollar settled mostly lower in extremely light dealings, but it was mixed compared with its levels a year ago. [56.]
Wheat and soybean futures prices recovered from their recent sell-off to close higher, while crude oil prices jumped. [56.]
 
Companies

Ikea said it would buy Stor, a West Coast competitor, for about $20 million. [47.]
 
The Economy
The Index of Leading Indicators fell 0.3 percent in November, the fourth straight month without a significant advance. And a gauge of current economic conditions dropped 0.8 percent, suggesting that the economy may have contracted slightly. [45.]
Prices farmers get for raw products declined 0.7 percent in December from the previous month and were 3.5 percent less than a year ago, the Agriculture Department said. [46.]
New-home purchases held steady in November despite the lowest mortgage rates in nearly two decades, as strong sales in the South and West offset a huge decline in the Northeast. [46.]

HEADLINE: Indicators Dropped 0.3% In November

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
The Government index meant to predict the economy fell three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the fourth straight month without a significant advance.
At the same time, a companion gauge of current economic conditions issued by the Commerce Department dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, suggesting that the economy may have contracted slightly in the final quarter of the year after modest gains in the spring and summer. 
 "The economy truly is weak," said Daniel Laufenberg, an economist at I.D.S. Financial Services in Minneapolis. Whether this period is ultimately recorded as a drawn-out early stage of recovery or a latter stage of protracted recession is merely academic, he added.
Daniel Friel, an economist at Nationsbank Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said: "We're really sort of dead in the water. Any growth is so slow you can't tell there's growth at all."
In a separate report, sales of new one-family houses were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 520,000 for November, the same as the revised pace for October, according to estimates by the Commerce Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department. [Page 46.]
Since most of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators have previously been published, today's negative figure was widely anticipated and did little to change views of 1992. To hasten an economic revival, the Federal Reserve already moved to slash interest rates, with steep cuts announced on Dec. 20.
As a rule of thumb, it takes three straight months of increases to signal recovery and there has been no solid gain since July's jump of 1.2 percent. October's gain was a negligible one-tenth of 1 percent and there was a two-tenths of 1 percent decline in September. In August, the index was flat.
While not large, the three-tenths of 1 percent decline in the leading index was the biggest since January, when the index fell six-tenths of 1 percent. Sizable gains began the following month and continued until an abrupt end in August.
Of the seven components that contributed to the November decline, the most important by far was the drop in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan. If expectations were excluded, the leading index would have been unchanged for the month. Since November, consumer sentiment has steadied and is unlikely to prove a significant drag on the December index, analysts said.
Other November negatives were a rise in first-time claims for unemployment insurance, a decline in building permits, lower factory backlogs, a decline in new factory orders for consumer goods and materials, and declines in the money supply and stock prices. During December, the money supply and stock prices surged, perhaps enough to push the index ahead, analysts said.
 
Some Positive Factors
 The positive factors for November were a rise in contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, higher prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle and a rise in the proportion of companies experiencing slowing deliveries from suppliers.
The 11th component, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged.
The decline for the coincident indicators, also the biggest since January, included falling personal income and shrunken company payrolls. Industrial production also fell while the fourth component, manufacturing and trade sales, was not yet available.
The index of lagging indicators, those that move after the economy and tend to confirm the coincident index, fell five-tenths of 1 percent in November, the 10th straight decline. The seven lagging items are average duration of unemployment, the inventory-sales ratio, change in unit labor costs, the prime rate, bank loans, installment credit related to incomes and the change in the services portion of the Consumer Price Index.
 
Another Index in Decline
 An alternative predictor -- the ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index -- fell in November after rising slightly in October, the report also showed.
In the private sector, a forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research in White Plains fell four-tenths of 1 percent for November, with 10 components up, 12 down and one unchanged.
But one designed by David B. Bostian of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, a Wall Street investment firm, rose two points, to positive 85, a small increase but from a point that was already bullish. "The recovery is on course," said Mr. Bostian, who is among the most optimistic forecasters for 1992, predicting that gross domestic product will climb 4 percent. His index rose to positive 50, which he regards as signaling a business upturn, in July.

HEADLINE: Tsongas Pitches Economic Austerity, Mixed With Patriotism

SERIES: Last of six articles on the Democratic Presidential candidates.

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H.

 BODY:
Anyone looking for a slick political campaign won't find it on the hustings with Paul E. Tsongas.
Mr. Tsongas, a former Senator and Representative from Massachusetts, runs a dogged, bottom-up campaign that works voter to voter, town to town, and captures space in the news seemingly newspaper by newspaper and sound bite by sound bite. 
 His is a Spartan campaign with a hair-shirt message: America must wake up to its economic peril or slide into a third-world posture of chronic unemployment and lowered living standards. His solution: an economic pragmatism, mixed with patriotism, sacrifice and responsibility, intended to recapture America's manufacturing pre-eminence.
This is not a message geared to win the hearts and minds of voters who ditched the Democrats and Jimmy Carter's "malaise" for Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" and George Bush's "No new taxes."
But given the economic downturn, a certain disillusionment with shop-till-you-drop materialism, and a natural American altruism that has not been tapped in several elections, it could be a stirring message.
The problem is that Mr. Tsongas does not stir.
He is less the rousing Paul Revere that he would like voters to think him than the somber St. Paul his critics once dubbed him. Whether he is speaking to a group of international executives in Washington or unemployed blue-collar workers in New Hampshire, Mr. Tsongas delivers his message of economic bootstrapping not with the bravado of a candidate intent on victory but with soporific sincerity. The 50-year-old Mr. Tsongas can occasionally be peevish in his presentations, warning his listeners that if they reject him and his message, "I'll go home to Lowell, make money and take care of my family."
Then there is the cancer that led Mr. Tsongas to retire from the Senate in 1984. Though he has overcome the disease -- he consulted with his doctors before announcing his Presidential campaign -- its specter rises each time Mr. Tsongas looks the least bit tired.
Mr. Tsongas is also a Greek-American Democrat from Massachusetts, which leads to unflattering comparisons to Michael S. Dukakis, another Greek-American from Massachusetts, who in 1988 failed to wrest the White House from Republicans.
Some political analysts think that what Mr. Tsongas really wants more than the party's nomination is the opportunity to influence the political debate and help to define the party's platform.
"He might provide the message for some other messenger," said Robert Squier, a Democratic consultant who is not advising any of this election year's contenders. "That's not fair but that's politics.
"Voters get down to does this person act, sound, look like a president?" he added. "His problem is he doesn't."
 
Tough Odds
Swimming Against the Tide
 What political professionals see as liabilities, Mr. Tsongas tries to present as assets. He is the dark horse that no one has ever taken seriously, the man who beat cancer and the odds in his political races.
It is the tack taken in his television advertisement in New Hampshire. Called "Swim," it is a 30-second spot of Mr. Tsongas doing the strenuous butterfly stroke the length of a pool while a narrator talks about his history of surprising the political oddsmakers and overcoming cancer, and ends with "Paul Tsongas has never been afraid to swim against the current."
Mr. Tsongas makes the advertisement itself a kind of courageous march against the odds.
"The nuclear weapon in this business is 30-second TV ads, O.K.?" he told an audience of teachers at the National Education Association in Washington in early December. "Now, we've already run our first ad. The ad which we've run in New Hampshire, which is the first primary state where we're putting a lot of effort in, is an ad of me swimming the butterfly. Very intellectual. I wanted to demonstrate courage. And I am 50 years old. And I was photographed in a Speedo bathing suit. I challenge you to do the same thing."
For seven months, he was the lone Democrat to challenge Mr. Bush, a straw in the wind of the President's overwhelming popularity in the wake of the Persian Gulf war. "Spring and summer was like going through a swamp," he said. Now he jokingly tells audiences his candidacy is responsible for the decline in Mr. Bush's ratings.
"He started out at 91 percent and now he's at 69. Not bad, huh?" he asked a group of unemployed workers, some of whom were studying for General Equivalency Diplomas they hoped would lead to jobs, at an adult learning center here. Not belly-laugh funny, but it elicits chuckles from audiences.
The party analysts do not openly ridicule Mr. Tsongas's campaign, but neither is he considered a serious contender.
"Paul Tsongas is a good guy who was an effective Senator who has absolutely no chance of winning," says Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic consultant, in a comment typical of those heard inside the Washington Beltway.
But Mr. Tsongas said he is not intimidated by the other Democratic contenders and conceded stature only to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. Without Mr. Cuomo, "we don't have any 1,000-pound gorillas" in the contest, Mr. Tsongas said.
Mr. Tsongas argues that the Democratic Party has an inferiority complex that prevents it from seeing that it can recapture the Presidency with the economic issue. And on that issue, Mr. Tsongas maintains, it is answers, not pretty-boy looks and scintillating rhetoric, that voters want.
 
Tough Message
Giving Priority To the Economy
 In New Hampshire, which has been hard-hit economically, Mr. Tsongas frequently emphasizes how far removed the Republicans are from the lives of ordinary Americans. He tells audiences there that the only unemployed person from New Hampshire that President Bush knows is John H. Sununu. It gets appreciative applause.
And though Democrats -- and now Republicans -- talk about America's economic woes, Mr. Tsongas notes that he began developing his ideas on the economy over a decade ago, starting in a 1980 speech in which he said that the Democratic Party was out of touch with a changing economic world.
For the campaign, he has honed this argument into an 85-page booklet, "A Call to Economic Arms," that trounces both parties for allegiance to partisan politics and ideologies that he maintains have sapped the country.
His solution is pro-business, but he touts his liberalism on social issues, citing his experience as a teacher for the Peace Corp in Ethiopia. He favors abortion rights, civil rights and gay rights. But first and foremost comes the economy. Without a vibrant economy, Mr. Tsongas says, the social services the Democrats have brought to the country cannot be maintained.
"No goose, no golden eggs," he told his audiences, noting that he serves on a dozen corporate boards and knows the business arena firsthand.
He wants the country to embark on an industrial policy that would rejuvenate industry from the ground up. He would encourage American technological progress with governmental investment in specific emerging technologies, better funding for science and research at the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the Departments of Energy and Agriculture. He contends that many German and Japanese industries captured markets from their American competitors because of support by their governments. Currently, most Federal research and development money goes to weapons development.
Mr. Tsongas would also change antitrust laws so that American companies no longer face barriers to joint ventures in research and development and marketing that now hinder their competing in the international market. He wants to reduce the capital gains tax for investments in certain securities held over long periods. He would also provide a tax credit to companies that do research and development.
Mr. Tsongas is opposed to the middle-class tax cut favored by other Democratic candidates, which he argues will be so small that it will neither benefit consumers nor solve the root problems in the economy.
When it comes to these issues, Mr. Tsongas is unapologetically tedious. The campaign has printed 100,000 copies of his economic booklet and Mr. Tsongas dispenses them at campaign stops like other candidates distribute buttons. And he expects his audiences to read that booklet.
"There will be a test afterwards," he quipped, as the small gray books were being distributed to an audience at Plymouth State Community College in Plymouth, N.H. He then went on to batter the audience with his call for a national economic policy as he fiddled with the lectern's microphones and drew charts and graphs on a large flip chart.
"I need to make people understand that this is a long tough haul," he said. "I've dropped a pebble -- maybe it's the wrong pebble -- but over time, people will talk about it. It is not unlike having cancer. You accept what's there. You deal with it. At some point there is generational responsibility, there is generational morality."
 
Tough Campaign
Trading Slogans For Sincerity
 Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager, Dennis Kanin, a veteran of many Democratic races, said his candidate's unorthodox strategy is based on Mr. Tsongas's belief that Americans are fed up with slickness, shaped campaigns and sound-bite sloganeering. "Paul has his own style and people find him genuine. People know Paul's not talking rhetoric, not making statements based on polling data," he said.
So far, Mr. Tsongas has focused his anti-glitz crusade on New Hampshire, with frequent sorties into Maryland, Florida, Washington state, and other states that hold early primaries or caucuses. He has 42 full-time paid campaign workers and he has been relying on a number of Boston-based advisers for advice, including Lester Thurow, the economist; Daniel Yergin, oil historian and president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates; Kelly McClintock, executive director of the Conservation Law Foundation on environmental issues, and Al Carnaschale at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and Ruth Morganthau at Brandeis University on foreign policy.
Mr. Tsongas's fund raising has been slowed by his seven-year absence from Congress and his low name recognition outside New England. He has managed to raise just over $1 million in campaign contributions through a combination of events, direct mail and one-on-one phone calls by Mr. Tsongas. Mr. Tsongas's fund-raising events are decidely downscale.
"We've had a lot of low-ticket events, in the $10 and $25 range," Mr. Kanin said. "Most of the high-ticket events have been in the $250-$500 range. Often we'll have a two-tier event, say, a $250 dinner and a $100-a-person reception and rally. Everybody has to rely more on organizational support because funds are much tighter than they were."
A good portion of the money has been spent on travel. Since his announcement in April, Mr. Tsongas has traveled to 30 states. In addition, nearly $100,000 was spent on Mr. Tsongas's television campaign advertisement that aired for two weeks in New Hampshire.
Mr. Tsongas thinks he will fare well in New Hampshire -- and he is considered by many political organizers to be the candidate to beat here -- not because he is from a neighboring state but because of his message of economic renewal.
"When the poll was done in New Hampshire in September, I had a lead, the others had not yet made any moves, and so the collective wisdom was that this was a sort of local favorite, but that it would dissipate," said Mr. Tsongas. "That lead is still there and something has to account for that. I'd say my message is getting through. What I generally hear back from people is that what I say makes sense.
"My strategy has always been to be the last person standing and to try to end up as the person who can steer the country away from economic disaster," said Mr. Tsongas.
"As long as people can believe that this is a temporary economic setback, that life is a beer commercial, a candidate like me has no relevance," he said. "But my message truly resonates in the business community because they're really scared. That I'm not a dominant orator is irrelevant because they want to get out of this dilemma.
"But there will come a point of scrutiny on specifics and that's the point where I'll shine. The media finds the economic downturn uncomfortable and inconvenient, so they're far more likely to be attracted to people who do better on television."
"You take something as simple as the capital gains tax issue," he added, underlining his status as the only Democrat who agrees even in part with Mr. Bush on this issue. "The other candidates have been out for months and yet who knows where they stand? What exactly is the blueprint the other candidates have to bring back the economy? We're going to do something to force the issue, make the other candidates respond. One thing I've done during the campaign is I still attend board meetings, partly for the income but also to keep myself in that mindset. Because on those boards they see what's coming. And at some point, when the nation sees that, they're going to want to know someone who can fly and that's me.
"I'm fully aware of all the disadvantages I bring," Mr. Tsongas said. "But because of the circumstances of my life, and the last seven years, I feel I'm prepared for that challenge.
"I know I'm the best candidate. Now if I could just convince God to make me a movie star."

HEADLINE: U.S. Orders Assessment of Harm Caused by Dams

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
A Federal energy agency is undertaking a long review of scores of hydroelectric dams, and promises a new era in which such dams will be operated in ways aimed at reducing or eliminating damage to the environment.
Over the next two years, the agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, will review applications from utilities, paper mills that run dams for their own power and other industries to relicense 237 of the country's oldest hydroelectric dams and generating stations. That is the most hydroelectric projects to come up for relicensing at any one time in the agency's 71-year history. 
 Most of the dams were built in the early decades of the century and have been operating under licenses that in some cases were granted half a century ago, well before builders seriously considered the harm a dam could do to fish, other wildlife, river beds and stream banks.
 
A Rare Opportunity
 Fred E. Springer, the director of the agency's Office of Hydropower Licensing, has joined American Rivers, an environmental group, in calling the relicensing project a unique opportunity to repair ecological problems caused by obsolete designs and outdated management practices.
Among the new structures the agency could require at old dams, Mr. Springer said in an interview, are devices called fish ladders that would allow salmon and other species to spawn upstream. Some dams will be required to install barriers to protect fish from being chopped up by turbines. In addition, Mr. Springer said, dam owners could be called on to build boat ramps and other provisions for recreational river users.
The agency could also require utilities to more carefully regulate the flow of water through dams. That wouldeliminate the sudden turbulent rush of water during periods of peak electricity demand, followed by a trickle as utilities store water in reservoirs to gain energy. The irregular flows, environmental scientists say, cause erosion of stream banks, ruin fish breeding grounds and make it dangerous to go canoeing or kayaking.
In rare instances, the agency may even require owners to remove a dam because the amount of electricity it generates is far outweighed by the environmental harm it is causing.
 
No Large Expenses Expected
 "Virtually every project we are reviewing will require changes to reduce their effect on the environment," Mr. Springer said. "Environmental standards are much different now than they were when these projects were first licensed."
Utility executives said today that in most cases new construction and changes in the way the plants are managed were unlikely to be excessively expensive. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, which is seeking to relicense 30 of its 74 hydroelectric projects in New York, more than any other utility in the nation, said it planned to spend $100 million over the next eight years on improvements including new equipment to increase the amount of power generated by 8 percent.
"We've already been working with canoeing groups, fishermen and cities where we operate hydroelectric power projects to prepare our application," said James M. Cosgrove, a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk Power in Syracuse. "We're trying to meet the concerns of the environmental people at the same time we're also meeting the demands of our customers."
When they were built decades ago, virtually all the 237 dams that are coming up for review by the Government were seen as vibrant emblems of American industrial ingenuity and engineering prowess. Some were magnificent, like the Cushman Dam, built in 1924 by Tacoma City Light in Washington State. It snaked across the Skokomish River, a concrete drapery unfurled in a snow-peaked wilderness.
More recently the reputation of the country's roughly 2,000 hydroelectric dams -- 1,400 are privately owned and 600 were built by the Federal Government -- has grown considerably more complex. Studies by the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies say hydroelectric power is cleaner, safer and less expensive than almost any other form of energy now available. About 10 percent of the country's electricity is generated by hydroelectric projects, the Energy Department says.
 
Criticism From Ecologists
 In addition, Mr. Springer noted that in many regions old dams were holding back lakes that are the centerpieces of regional economies reliant on fishing, hunting and other tourist activities.
But aquatic scientists and ecologists say that flooding vast areas to establish reservoirs, block rivers and artificially manage the flow of water to gain peak amounts of power is destructive to wildlife, fish and habitat.
The answer to these problems is not to destroy dams but to change how they are operated, said Matthew H. Huntington, director of the hydropower programs for American Rivers, the country's principal river conservation group.
But Mr. Huntington said environmental groups and state environmental agencies did not believe that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would go far enough in ordering changes that will make any difference.
"Given their track record, we have no confidence in FERC's commitment to bring about any kind of environmental repair," Mr. Huntington said. "They have been challenged too many times to count in court by state agencies and environmental groups in previous licensing decisions because they tell everybody they are protecting the environment and they don't."
Mr. Springer today defended his agency's record in licensing dams. "The commission independently reviews applications with a look toward balancing all the issues," he said. "In the last 10 years, 85 to 90 percent of the changes recommended by state agencies or the United States Fish and Widlife Service were put in licenses. But not all the wishes of every private environmental group or resource agency can be accommodated in a balanced decision. You have to weigh all the factors."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY -- The Global Lab: Aerospace;
International Flights, Indeed

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Every new airliner is the product of international cooperation. In the new Boeing 777 program, for example, the Boeing Company is manufacturing only the wings, nose structure and engine nacelles. The rest of the wide-body airplane will come from hundreds of subcontractors in North America, Japan and Europe. The main fuselage sections, for example, will be fabricated in Japan; the wing flaps come from Italy.
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Boeing's only domestic rival in the airliner business, wants to go even further. It is seeking to sell 40 percent of its civil airliner business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, a newly formed entity that has the backing of the Taiwan Government. Because no military technology is involved, the deal requires no approval from the United States Government. 
 But the arrangement could have far-reaching policy implications for the $30-billion-a-year airliner industry, in which the United States has long been the world leader, with more than 75 percent of the market.
 
A Widespread Practice
 International cooperation in aircraft development and manufacturing is a fact of life for several reasons.
For one thing, the other guys do it. To preserve their aircraft industries, the Governments of Britain, France, Germany and Spain have collectively poured an estimated $25 billion into Airbus Industrie, the Paris-based consortium that has developed into a big force.
Officials of Airbus say they are interested in taking on Japanese companies, like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, as limited partners if the consortium proceeds with plans to build a 600-seat jet transport some airlines say they might need. (A Boeing 747 seats between 385 and 400; the new Boeing 777, which will seat up to 375, is designed for service requiring a twin-engine plane.)
In the case of McDonnell, the aircraft builder needs the capital from a Taiwan deal to stay in the game. McDonnell is hoping to develop an all-new airplane, the MD-12, to challenge the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 in the long-haul market. The company's current models, the MD-11 and MD-80, are updated versions of older designs, and do not compete directly with the 747 because of size and range limitations.
But even Boeing, which has produced a majority of the world's airliners flying today, cannot go it alone. Aircraft purchases are political as well as economic decisions, particularly in parts of the globe where governments either own or heavily influence the national airlines.
Boeing officials say that to sell in some Asian and European markets, they have to include local manufacturers in aircraft programs. And by subcontracting parts of the planes to low-cost manufacturing areas, the company helps hold down overall expenses.
Boeing executives say they are acutely conscious that jetliners are among the few complex manufactured goods that American companies can still sell to the world, and the company knows that the Japanese Government has repeatedly focused on commercial aviation as an industry to conquer.
The strategy for keeping control of the business, Boeing executives say, is to contract out some parts, but to keep wing manufacturing, final assembly and integration of the electronic, hydraulic and mechanical systems firmly in-house. Uniting several million parts into an airplane that flies reliably and at low cost is not a skill that can be easily learned from the outside, they assert.
But some in the industry fear that McDonnell, which has nowhere near the bulging, $100 billion order book of Boeing, may have to trade key technology for the financing it needs to build the MD-12. That could be the first step toward true Asian competition for the American airliner industry, critics say.
There are other concerns, too. The next generation of airliners may have to be supersonic to shrink the vast distances between North America and the Pacific Rim. Some American aerospace executives say such a project may be too big and risky for even Boeing to tackle alone, especially in a future in which Pentagon spending is unlikely to subsidize aerospace research to the extent it has in the past half-century.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Australia, Under Fire on Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Wednesday, Jan. 1

 BODY:
President Bush opened a 12-day crusade today to increase American exports in the Western Pacific, picking as his first stop a country that, like his own, is mired in recession, running a 2-to-1 deficit with a major trading partner, and angry about the protectionism it says has sustained that sorry ratio.
But the villain here is not Japan, with which Australia actually enjoys a multibillion-dollar trade surplus. Rather it is the United States that stands accused of holding off Australia's wheat and cattle industries in the name of protectionism, a charge that is getting Mr. Bush's crusade for free trade in the Pacific off to a bumpy start. 
 The brouhaha only hints at the pitfalls awaiting the President as he seeks to convince voters back home that his 26,000-mile, four-nation Pacific journey is aimed at helping the sagging American economy.
Mr. Bush argues that freer trade will increase American exports and that more exports will create more jobs -- 20,000 jobs for every billion dollars in foreign sales. But at every turn he faces evidence that some of the same protectionist policies he is denouncing are used back home to keep existing jobs from vanishing.
 
Double Standard Charged
 "We see a little bit of a double standard," the president of Australia's National Farmers Federation, Graham J. Blight, said in an interview today. "You've got a President saying he wants to open up markets and have free trade. Well, we want that, too. And we hope that when he goes back home, he'll practice what he preaches."
Arriving in Sydney on Tuesday night after a 20-hour one-stop flight from Washington, Mr. Bush immediately attended a New Year's fireworks exposition with the new Prime Minister, Paul Keating.
After a jog under dreary skies, he began serious work this morning, meeting with Mr. Keating for an hour. The President is to fly to the capital, Canberra, tonight for more talks and a speech to Parliament on Thursday.
Ordinarily, Mr. Bush's lecture on the benefits of free trade might be expected to win a receptive ear here. As Finance Minister in the 1980's, Mr. Keating led a successful drive to sell off many state-owned monopolies and reduce some of Australia's own tariffs and other obstacles to open trading.
But on unseating an old friend of Mr. Bush, Prime Minister Bob Hawke, on Dec. 19, Mr. Keating inherited a wrenching recession that shrank the economy by 2.5 percent in 1991 and has sent unemployment up to 10.5 percent.
Australians bought an estimated $9 billion in goods from the United States in 1991, more than from any nation except Japan. But while their trade surplus with Japan exceeds $2 billion annually, due to huge sales of wool, ores and farm goods, Australia has been running a deficit with the United States that approached $5 billion in 1990, the last year for which figures are available.
 
Wheat Subsidy Rankles Most
 Most rankling of all to Australian farmers is the American subsidy of wheat, a direct payment that the United States Government makes to grain-exporting companies under a policy called the Export Enhancement Program. "Your subsidies alone are worth more than my guys are getting for their wheat on the farm," the head of Australia's Grains Council, Mitch Hooke, said today.
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister recently called the wheat subsidies "the act of a hostile power."
The Americans argue that the United States is merely reacting to the European Community, which grabbed a larger share of the world wheat market after beginning its own subsidy program in the 1980's.
Mr. Bush today acknowledged what he called "some differences" with Australia over wheat, and said: "I hope they understand that it is not aimed at Australia. But if they don't, they will by the time I'm through."
Mr. Bush is to meet with Australian farmers on Thursday in what promises to be a blunt session on the issue of agricultural exports.
Mr. Bush will hear similar arguments when he goes later this month to Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Already, a Japanese embassy official in Washington responded last month to complaints about Japan's closed rice market by noting that the United States had yet to repeal a barnacled mass of quotas and subsidies that all but exempt its domestic markets for sugar, peanuts, dairy products and other goods.

Compassion for U.S. Urged
TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan.1 (AP) -- Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has issued a New Year plea for Japanese auto makers to have compassion for their American counterparts.
"I am asking industry leaders to take more seriously and compassionately the U.S. situation, epitomized by General Motors Corporation's shutdowns," Japanese news reports quoted Mr. Miyazawa as saying at a news conference televised this morning. "G.M. is like the Stars and Stripes for the American people."
G.M. announced last week that it would eliminate 74,000 jobs and close 21 plants in North America over the next four years.

HEADLINE: Tired of Relying on U.S., Japan Seeks to Expand Its Own Intelligence Efforts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Japan is quietly moving to reshape and expand its intelligence operations in an effort to wean itself from its dependence on American analysis of threats to its economic and military security.
Officials here say they are not hiring spies and would steer clear of creating a single, large intelligence agency. Their biggest concern, they say, is to avoid rekindling memories of the Japanese secret police of half a century ago. 
 But over the last several months, officials of both the Foreign Ministry and the Japan Self-Defense Agency have described, in deliberately vague terms, plans to train hundreds of new intelligence analysts and spend a large amount of money to improve human and electronic information-gathering.
In part, the effort seems spurred by Japan's feelings of acute insecurity over the quality of its intelligence during the collapse of the Soviet Union, whose Far East bases have been the focus of Japanese concern for more than four decades, and about North Korea's effort to build nuclear weapons.
 
50 Years Behind
 "Japan is behind by half a century in its ability to collect and utilize information compared to other countries," said Seiki Nishihiro, a former Deputy Minister of Defense and one of the architects of the new intelligence effort. "In the cold war era the world moved in teams, and as a member of the American-led team, our judgment was not so important. Now Japan needs its own ability."
Over the next year, the Foreign Ministry says it will create an International Information Bureau, and hire 100 to 200 new analysts, mostly regional specialists.
The Japan Self-Defense Agency is putting up a new headquarters in Tokyo, including one large building that officials say will house an intelligence unit patterned after the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency. An official of the agency, insisting on anonymity, described the new unit's task as "tactical information gathering," focusing particularly on North Korea, the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, and the Persian Gulf.
"The whole structure will not be in place for another 10 years," the official said. "But ideally, we need our own sources of information. If we had to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Cambodia, right now we would not know what we are getting into." The defense agency is also increasing its ability to intercept signals, a task that it has slowly been taking over from some American units here.
 
No Spy in Japan's Sky
 Domestic political sensitivity, however, has prevented agency officials from building a piece of equipment they desperately want -- a Japanese-made, Japanese-operated intelligence satellite. To their chagrin, they are entirely dependent on satellite images from the United States.
For example, when Japan begins importing huge quantities of near-weapons-grade plutonium from Europe next year for its nuclear-power plants, it will find itself in the situation of again having to rely on American satellites to warn against any hijacking attempts.
The delicacy of the satellite issue among Japan's Asian neighbors, who are extremely sensitive to suggestions that Tokyo may be watching them, helps explain why most efforts to increase the country's intelligence capabilities go undiscussed. In a nation with a 20th-century history of gathering intelligence to support the use of aggressive military force, many people prefer to avoid even an expression of interest in intelligence or in broad military matters.
As an aide to Prime Minister Miyazawa noted: "If you ask the public if Japan needs more information about world events, everyone says yes. If you ask whether it needs intelligence gathering, well, no one even wants to hear the phrase."
 
Business Intelligence Network
 Japan already has one of the world's most sophisticated intelligence networks -- for economic intelligence -- but it is not run by the Government.
Japan's tightly linked businesses and sophisticated trading companies, with personnel everywhere from the oilfields of Kuwait to the laboratories of the Silicon Valley, are renowned for their comprehensive reports of political and economic trends. But they can also be politically obtuse, officials say, and as they have grown more independent, less of that data is funneled to the Government.
Japanese officials complain frequently about the quality of the analysis available to them on a day-to-day basis. When the abortive coup in the Soviet Union occurred in August, Mr. Miyazawa, still maneuvering to become Prime Minister, was widely quoted in the Japanese press as saying that the "information Japan had was different in depth compared to the information the U.S. had." In the case of the North Korean nuclear project, Government officials say they have limited capability to interpret the satellite evidence provided by the United States.
No one knows how much Japan spends on intelligence gathering, because the effort is spread across so many parts of the bureaucracy -- from the defense agency to the national police, which keeps track of suspected North Korean agents. The governing Liberal Democratic Party has agreed that big budget increases are needed, but that may not be enough.
 
Something Money Can't Buy
 "It is not an issue you can solve with just money," Mr. Nishihiro said. "There is no system in Japan to raise intelligence experts. And once the information is developed, there is no real system to bring it directly to the Prime Minister. It is all sent through various ministries and twisted to fit their own beliefs and interpretations."
As a result, some senior officials have been arguing for is a strong coordinating office just outside Mr. Miyazawa's door, able to sort and assess data quickly, much as National Security Council staff members do at the White House.
A little-known group called the Cabinet Security Bureau is now supposed to serve that function. But like the Prime Ministers it serves, it is considered weak and easily outmaneuvered by the bureaucracy.
A few years ago, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone tried to build a well-equipped situation room in the Prime Minister's residence. But the effort failed, partly for lack of money and partly because no one was quite sure what kind of situation it might be needed for.

Bank Fund, C.D. Yields Down Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were down for the week that ended yesterday, as the effects of Federal Reserve's latest discount rate cut, and the prime rate cut by most commercial banks that soon followed, continued to affect savings returns.
The lowering of interest rates this year to help a faltering economy has also played havoc with savings. According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication, the highest yield on a money market account at the beginning of the year was 7.57 percent, and that was more than the best yield on a five-year certificate the previous week. 
 If there has been an interesting trend from declining yields, it has been that money market accounts have not declined as much as other accounts. One reason, analysts said, is that banks are more conservative in reducing yields on accounts that affect all depositors.
Robert K. Heady, the publisher for The Monitor, said that since the discount and prime rates were cut on Dec. 20, the yield on a one-year certificate had fallen by 30 basis points, while those on money market accounts were down by 28 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
"In terms of what Americans are getting at banks, rates by midwinter should be at levels not seen since 1966, when passbook savings were 4 percent," he said.
 
Cuts by New York Banks
 In the last week, New York commercial banks reduced yields on money market accounts by an average of 11 basis points, to 3.77 percent, while cutting the three-month certificate by 12 basis points, to 3.64 percent, and a six-month certificate by 14 basis points, to 3.71 percent.
Among the savings institutions, the yield reductions were equally sharp, with a money market account down by 13 basis points, to 4.54 percent. Three-month certificates fell by 11 basis points, to 4.41 percent, and a six-month certificate was down by 12 basis points, to 4.58 percent.
Two of the steepest cuts among commercial banks were made by Fleet Bank and Banco Popular. Both reduced their money market accounts by 52 basis points, to 3.82 percent and 3.65 percent, respectively.
Fleet also cut the yields on its three-month and six-month certificiates by 45 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area also showed significant declines, with the average yield on a money market accounts and certificates of deposit both down by 7 basis points, to 4.01 percent and 4.11 percent, respectively.
In addition, the publication said its weekly index of regional bank rates outside the New York area showed 4.23 percent as the yield on a money market account and 4.26 percent on a three-month certificate.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, the average rate was 3.91 percent on both maturities, up from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds End '91 on a High

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Stock mutual funds had a banner year in 1991, apparently their best ever, fund managers say, and bond funds, which drew in almost twice as much money as stock funds, seem to have turned in their best sales figures since their peak year of 1986.
"People are beginning to realize that after inflation and taxes, they might be losing money on bank C.D.'s and money market rates," said Gavin Quill, a marketing analyst for the Scudder family of funds in Boston. "The low cash returns are converting people who used to be savers into investors." 
 Over all, when the final numbers are tallied later this month, it appears that 1991 will go down as the fund industry's best year since 1986, based on the observations of several fund managers and information released yesterday by their Washington-based trade organization, the Investment Company Institute.
"November itself was a very good month, but December is a final act in a very good year," said William N. Shiebler, the chief executive of Putnam Financial Services in Boston.
 
'We Were Surprised'
 Bruce Speca, a senior vice president in the marketing operation of the TNE Fund Group, a unit of the New England Investment Companies, agreed. "We've been seeing extremely strong sales about on par with November, which was a record-breaking month," he said.
The strong December performance ran counter to the industry's usual December showing. The month is usually the weakest for equities. "We were surprised," said Mr. Speca, who thinks equity sales will do even better in early 1992.
One reason for this thinking is a tax concern. Most equity funds pay out part of their profits in December. Some prospective investors are therefore reluctant to put new money into stock funds at the end of the year, since they will have made little on the investment, and yet will owe taxes on the distribution almost immediately.
Another damper to some investors is that the market has been trading at record and near-record levels all month, which some may regard as a turnoff.
Even without the institute's December results, which are expected to bolster the trends, investors poured $94.4 billion -- $31 billion into equity funds and $63.4 billion into bond funds -- of net new cash into mutual funds between January and November 1991, according to the institute. The computations adjust sales figures for redemptions and transfers among funds.
In the record year, 1986, equity mutual funds attracted $21.9 billion in net cash, while bond mutual funds brought in $108.6 billion.
A total of $3.5 billion flowed into equity funds and $6.7 billion into bond funds in November alone, the institute said. While that $10.1 billion was down from October's $14.4 billion, November's totals are impressive in light of a 120-drop one day that month that temporarily spooked investors.
"Mutual funds have become the investment and savings vehicle of choice," said Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Strategic Insight, a research and consulting firm to the mutual fund industry. The firm's projections showed that the industry had attracted $35 billion of net cash into equities and $73 billion into fixed-income products in 1991.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Flat In November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
New-home purchases held steady in November despite the lowest mortgage rates in nearly two decades as strong sales in the South and West offset a huge decline in the Northeast, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department reported that new single-family houseswere sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 520,000 units in November, unchanged from October. 
 The Government revised the October performance slightly to show an increase of 3.8 percent, instead of a previously reported 2.2 percent gain. Sales had fallen 4 percent in September.
John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said he believed that the weakness in the Northeast was overstated and that the figures would be revised upward next month.
While new-home sales failed to improve in November, economists said they were encouraged that there was no decline, particularly given plunging consumer confidence levels during the month.
Existing home sales were up 5.4 percent in November, the biggest gain in six months, and analysts noted that gains in the resale market often precede improvement in new-home sales.
The Federal Reserve has made aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy, helping to push mortgage rates down to their lowest levels in 18 years.
Rates for 30-year mortgages fell to 8.35 percent last week, the lowest since August 1973, while one-year adjustable-rate mortgages declined to an all-time low of 6.02 percent, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported.
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he believed that the Fed would cut interest rates further, allowing fixed-rate mortgages to dip to 8 percent by early spring.
He predicted new-home sales, which are expected to fall this year to around 502,000, the lowest level since 1983, should post a gain of 10 to 15 percent next year.
In November, the median price of a new home dropped by 6.1 percent, to $117,400, compared with $125,000 in October. That marked the lowest median price since May. The median is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less.
The average price for a home also declined to $141,100, or 5.3 percent lower than October.

Newmark & Lewis Closing 12 Stores

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HICKSVILLE, L.I., Dec. 31

 BODY:
Newmark & Lewis Inc., a New York City-area electronics and appliance dealer, said it would close 12 stores in January. That would leave the retailer, which began 1991 with 67 stores, with just 14 outlets.
Ronald Fleischer, the company's chief executive, said holiday sales were substantially below expectations. He said the economy had worsened since Newmark & Lewis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late August. About 100 employees are expected to be affected by the closings. Mr. Fleischer said the company would try to relocate some workers.

HEADLINE: No More Free Brunch

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
In the darkest days of the Great Depression, when banks failed, businesses went bankrupt and old family fortunes crumbled, membership in even the nicest men's clubs declined. Things got so bad at the Harvard Club, which was losing more than five hundred members a year, that its board imposed severe cost-cutting measures. In 1931, the club abruptly stopped ordering matchbooks embossed with the club insignia.
While nothing so drastic has yet occurred at most of New York City's dozens of social clubs, even some of the most prestigious preserves of the city's well-to-do are hearing the sharp, cold knock of the recession at their doors. 
 Those hardest hit are clubs like the Downtown Association or the Downtown Athletic Club, institutions that cater primarily to Wall Street bankers and brokers and have lost members in droves. The Century Club, whose members are mainly writers and artists, has not experienced as sharp a loss in membership, but it was nevertheless obliged to sell one of its most valuable paintings, "The Power of Music," by William Sidney Mount, last October to pay for renovations to its Stanford White building, at 7 West 43d Street.
 
Lose Job? Never Had One
 Members of other highly exclusive clubs, however, like the New York Racquet Club, the Knickerbocker and the Brook Club, say their clubs are not suffering at all. These are the old-guard, blue-blooded institutions that after 1988 banned briefcases and business cards and defined themselves as strictly social to circumvent a city law that prohibits discrimination in private clubs where business is conducted. At those places, where even in the 80's, old-world breeding was a more important criterion for admission than cash earnings or Nouvelle Society mystique, membership, members insist, remains steady.
"At the really aristocratic clubs, half the members have never worked," said Charles Scribner 3d, an editor at the Macmillan Publishing Company who belongs to the New York Racquet Club. "They can't lose their jobs if they've never had them."
Mr. Scribner said he was amused by a recent New York Post item that breathlessly recounted mass defections from the 125-year-old New York Athletic Club, on Central Park South. "I am delighted that The Post considers the N.Y.A.C. exclusive," he said dryly. "But of course, The New York Post still bills itself as the newspaper of Alexander Hamilton."
Much as neighbors sometimes seek to blame the victims of violent crime to reassure themselves that it could never happen to them, members of private clubs are increasingly able to detect social and economic distinctions between their own oak-paneled, leather-chair-lined sanctuaries and those that are suffering in the recession. In a certain rarefied stratum of New York, recessions are like weddings -- occasions that heighten social distinctions that are largely invisible to the hoi polloi.
"I belong to a club or so and I do not think they have been affected in this recession at all," Louis Auchincloss, a writer of elegant novels about a dwindling WASP upper class, said stoutly. "This recession has notoriously hit the lower economic brackets," he said, adding with asperity, "And the clubs surely haven't reached that point yet."
 
Every Little $1,200 Counts
 In fact, one of Mr. Auchincloss's clubs, the Downtown Association, has been so hurt by the recession that members held an emergency meeting on Dec. 4 to seek ways to salvage the club's finances, and decided to impose a $200-a-year spending minimum on its remaining members. The club's annual dues are $1,200. "It isn't that much, but that is $1,200 you don't have to spend," said one banker who gave up his Downtown Association membership after he lost his job on Wall Street two years ago. "You'd love to be a member; it's clearly the most pleasant place to go for lunch. But it just didn't make any sense."
A member of several other clubs, he explained that he had no plans to return to the Downtown Association, and had left with regret. "They maintained a real standard of people that made it particularly attractive," he said wistfully.
Carroll L. Wainwright Jr., president of the Downtown Association, said that it was not just a decline in membership but also less club usage among remaining members that was hurting the club's finances. He said his club would not go the way of the Century Club and sell off assets. "We could do it, but I doubt we will," Mr. Wainwright said. "We have a very valuable collection of old prints of New York, but once you start selling off things to pay for current expenses, that is trouble." He added stoically, "We are not there yet."
Mr. Wainwright, who also belongs to the Union Club and the River Club, said he did not think the hard times were limited to downtown businessmen's clubs. "I think the uptown clubs are feeling it too," he said. "I would suspect, without knowing, that their waiting lists have declined."
While it is impossible to get exact membership figures for individual clubs, the New York accounting firm of Pannell Kerr Forster, which keeps statistics on the club industry, discovered a 1.5 percent decline in city club memberships in 1991 for the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area, part of a steady, nationwide downward trend that became noticeable in 1988, when city club memberships first declined by five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Lowering the Crossbar
 "Companies are not paying club dues for any but the very top executives," said James Tinney, an accountant with the firm. He added: "In New York, a lot of the so-called yuppies were joining everything in sight when the going was good. Things got a little sour, they got out of the clubs." He said that even at some social clubs "their waiting lists are almost certainly shorter."
That unnerving prospect has disturbed some longtime members, who fear their institutions might have to "lower the crossbar," as one Racquet Club member put it. "There is a feeling the club is still suffering from a lot of people who were admitted in the 1975 recession," he said grimly.
The president of the Racquet Club, John Soutter, was adamant that admissions standards had not dropped. He explained: "We are not a business club; we're a sports club. People come here to play games." He added with irreproachable logic, "Whether or not one's business is doing well, people still want to exercise and see their friends."
The Racquet Club has not been spared some ill effects of the recession, however. Of the two members known to have committed suicide this year, one was an investment banker who shot himself after an economic reversal. "A rather dramatic way to resign," is how one Racquet member put it.
George Plimpton, one of New York's most famous preppies, said with what sounded suspiciously like regret that "it seems a little easier to get a court" at the Racquet Club. Mr. Plimpton, however, is mainly a devotee of the club's best-known feature: court tennis, an antiquated but exquisitely aristocratic racquet sport played by so few that as Mr. Plimpton put it, "if you pick up a racquet you're world-ranked." He noted happily that at the River Club, where he plays regular tennis, "you still have to call up six days in advance to get a court."
Despite the end of the roaring 80's, many younger club members do not expect their well-bred contemporaries to abandon club life in the coming decade. "In the 90's, the last thing you want to give up is your club," said one thirtysomething member of several prestigious institutions. He explained that he increasingly valued the gracious service and respectful treatment to be found in club dining. "Going to a trendy, expensive restaurant and being shuttled off to the kitchen and treated like dirt by some guy in a Mohawk -- in the 80's, that was funny," he said. "But it's not amusing anymore."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Continue to Gain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices moved higher yesterday and long-term interest rates fell again in light pre-holiday trading, as dealers closed their books on what for most was a highly profitable year.
Retail accounts seeking to lock in higher yields were responsible for most of the day's purchases, traders and analysts said. But thin trading exaggerated the size of the gains, which amounted to more than half a point on some longer-dated issues. 
 "The magnitude of the moves is not of much significance," analysts at MMS International, an economic information and service company, noted in their daily market commentary. "Nevertheless, the flattening of the yield curve that has been seen lately should remain a prominent feature of trading in the new year."
For most of last year the bulk of the drop in interest rates came in short-term securities, where rates moved sharply lower in response to persistent easing moves by the Federal Reserve Board. Bond yields, by contrast, remained stubbornly high.
As recently as Dec. 11, the spread, or difference, between yields on two-year Treasury notes and 30-year bonds stood at 2.79 percentage points, the widest of the year.
Since then, however, the yield curve has flattened somewhat, especially since the Fed lowered its discount rate on Dec. 20 by a full percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent.
At that time, the spread was 2.76 percentage points. At the close of business yesterday, the difference stood at 2.64.
The steepness of the yield curve and the steady decline in short-term rates throughout the year were a boon for primary dealers in Government securities.
"It has been the kind of market in which you could translate the decline in rates into profitability," said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a New York financial consulting firm. "I am sure some of the dealers did better than others. But everyone did well."
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which monitors the financial condition of the primary dealers, provides a snapshot of the way the firms are doing each November.
At that time the New York Fed said that pretax profits through August were about $600 million, about the same amount earned during the first eight months of 1990.
The sense that more firms were doing better was underscored by the Fed's figures. Through August, 80 percent of the primary dealers were reporting pretax profits, compared with 70 percent a year earlier.
New Year's Eve trading in the cash market for Government securities stopped at 2 P.M., New York time. All financial markets are closed today.
At the close of trading, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 107 1/4, up 19/32 , or more than half a point, to yield 7.39 percent, compared with 7.44 percent late Monday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 105 3/4, up 5/32 , to yield 6.69 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 15/32 , unchanged on the day, to yield 4.75 percent.
During the afternoon the Treasury announced it will sell $9.5 billion worth of new seven-year notes at an auction on Jan. 8.
After the announcement, the new notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.35 percent.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.84 percent as trading ended down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.85 percent. And one-year bill rates dipped by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.89 percent.
Trading in the secondary markets for tax-exempt municipal securities and investment-grade corporate bonds was virtually nonexistent, and traders said there was no meaningful movement in prices.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Slow Trading And Gold Is Mostly Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower on world currency markets yesterday in extremely light dealings, but it was mixed compared with its levels a year ago.
Gold prices were mostly higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $354.10 an ounce, up $1.30 from Monday but $40.10 below its 1990 close of $394.20. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $354 an ounce, up $1.30 an ounce from Monday. 
 Traders said markets in Europe and the United States almost ceased operating around midday.
Government data for November showing a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in the index of leading economic indicators and unchanged sales of new homes had little impact on the market because the figures were within expectations.
"Once that was out of the way, there was not a lot to push the market," said John Vincent, a trader with the Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
 
Seek Greater Liquidity
 He noted that most dealers closed their books for the year a week ago and would not resume active trading until sometime next week.
Most dealers refrained from trading "because of the potential problems that result when you have limited liquidity," Mr. Vincent said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.58 yen, to 125.25 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 124.95 yen. In New York, the dollar closed the year at 124.78 yen, down from 125.55 yen on Monday.
A year ago the dollar was trading at about 135.50 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8718, from $1.8673 late on Monday. In New York, it cost $1.8685 to buy a pound, more expensive than Monday's $1.8670 but less than its level of $1.9345 a year ago.
The dollar ended 1991 stronger against the German mark. In New York, it settled at 1.5190 marks, down from 1.5192 marks on Monday but up from 1.4885 marks a year ago.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.3590 Swiss francs, up from 1.3555; 5.1845 French francs, down from 5.1905; 1,149.25 Italian lire, down from 1,151.75, and 1.1555 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1578.
In London, gold settled at a late price of $353.40 an ounce, up from $352.05 late on Monday. In Zurich, gold settled at $353.30, up from $353. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $355.44, down 11 cents.
Silver prices advanced. On the Commodity Exchange, silver for current delivery settled at $3.883 an ounce, up from $3.85 on Monday. In London, silver rose to a late bid price of $3.87, from $3.85 on Monday.

U.S. Biotech Seeks Foreign Backers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
In agricultural biotechnology, the contrast between the American style of creating new businesses and the approach in Europe and Japan is especially stark. The difference has direct bearing on the way biotechnology companies tend to form their foreign alliances, with smaller American players teaming up with bigger overseas companies.
Although some big American corporations like Monsanto have invested heavily in biotechnology, many of the most intriguing developments in the United States have been reported by entrepreneurial start-up concerns like Mycogen, Ecogen, Calgene, Crop Genetics, Biotechnica and DNA Plant Technologies. 
 Granted, there are highly regarded start-up companies overseas, like Plant Genetic Systems of Belgium, but the research leaders seem to be the giant chemical and pharmaceutical multinationals like ICI of Britain, Rhone-Poulenc of France and Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland.
Part of the difference is the unparalleled access that American entrepreneurs have to venture capital and subsequently, if their companies survive, to the stock market. Sooner or later, though, many start-ups decide they need bigger corporate partners for further financial support, marketing and production skills and other expertise. In agricultural biotechnology those alliances are typically forged with big foreign companies.
The result: a largely one-way flow to foreign countries of research results and technology pioneered in the United States. So far, according to industry analysts, the real cost to American companies has been the surrender of potential foreign markets rather than the creation of potential domestic competitors.
Take Mycogen, a San Diego-based concern that has focused most of its work on biopesticides. These are naturally occurring toxins that Mycogen isolates from microorganisms and mass-produces by genetically engineering bacteria to make them. The toxins are encapsulated so that they will not degrade too rapidly to be useful when sprayed onto fields. These "natural" poisons tend to kill only targeted pests, cause fewer pollution problems, and be harder for insects to develop a tolerance to than synthetic chemicals.
Mycogen has various agreements with the Kubota Corporation of Japan, Japan Tobacco Inc., and a research subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell, the British-Dutch petrochemical giant. All of them leave Mycogen with North American marketing rights to the products covered by the agreements, while providing Mycogen with greater marketing resources and expertise.
"We couldn't commercialize this stuff without them," Marie C. Burke, Mycogen's head of investor relations, said of the company's overseas allies.
One result of so much collaborative work is that American agricultural biotechnology is probably closer to the international pack than American medical biotechnology, where United States companies like Genentech and Amgen are far ahead of the foreign competition. Some observers, like Jim McCamant, editor of the Agbiotech Stock Letter, say the difference is a matter of national policy, not chance. "There's been huge support from the National Institutes of Health for medical biotechnology research," he said.

DEAR Diary:
At 7 A.M., on my way to work the other morning, it seemed like a good idea to grab a bran muffin as fortification against the long day ahead. Little did I know.
The glass door at the local Food Emporium was a bit recalcitrant, so I applied that extra shove New Yorkers know is often needed. On this occasion the door slipped its track, tipping rapidly in my direction. Acting more on instinct than good judgment, I caught the door in midtilt and found myself holding an enormous piece of glass and steel that was no longer attached to the ground by any other fastening save my own tenuous grip.
By some adrenaline-induced miracle, however, I managed to totter under this incredibly heavy object all the way across the entrance hall of the Food Emporium, bringing it to an incredibly soft landing against the far wall.
Still shaking from my narrow escape, I motioned to the woman standing behind the register who had apparently witnessed the episode with something less than the astonishment one might expect.
"I'm sorry," she said. "We're closed." -- ERIC W. ANNER

 	 	 		. . .	 	Muriel Taub Glantzman (grandmother), Sara Stites (her daughter) and Chloe Stites (her granddaughter, age 4) are driving into Manhattan. Chloe is having a fine time during an imaginary conversation on her toy car phone. Suddenly she says: "Just a moment. . . . Hello."
Grandmother, looking up, bewildered: "What's that all about?"
Mother, in a matter-of-fact manner: "She has call waiting."

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
The scene, the second floor of Kiddie City in Manhattan. The time, the height of the recent Christmas bustle. A woman, holding a book she has chosen for her grandson, collars a Kiddie City employee. "Excuse me," the customer says. "Where is checkout?"
The employee looks quite puzzled. A long silence. Then he asks, "Is that a game?"
Customer: "No, I just want to pay for this book."
The employee directs her to the cashier. The woman pays for the book and chuckles all the way home. "Christmas shopping can really be fun," she says to no one in particular. -- EDITH MARTIN

THE SIGHS OF THE MATTER
 
I ask you, my loves,
What's become of the gloves
Sent by Rod with the card that read "Wish you
the best Christmas cheer."
I've a terrible fear
They went out with the trash and the tissue! -- MAUREEN CANNON

 	 	 		. . .	 	Dear Diary:
A funny thing happened on the way to Grand Central this time of the year a decade or so ago. It was a chilly Wednesday and I -- a suburban lady of a certain age who comes to town occasionally on business -- decided to forgo the rush-hour pleasures of the commuter trains and leave the city early. I hailed a cab on the corner of Eighth Avenue and 59th Street. It was 1:20 P.M. Plenty of time to catch the 2:05 to Westport.
Two blocks later, the cab came to a complete halt. I had not included the holiday traffic in my plans. There we sat, my philosophical, middle-aged driver and I, exchanging complaints about the double-parking, the economy, the weather, the Mayor. I closed my eyes.
When I opened them, we were turning into Vanderbilt Avenue. It was 20 minutes past 2. My train was long gone, the next one not until 3:05. "What do I owe you?" I asked.
"I hate to tell you, lady," the driver replied. "It looks like the national debt."
I pulled a bill from my wallet. Waiting for change, I wondered: Should I check my packages and take a walk? Too cold. Read in the station? Ugh! Get on the train? It wouldn't even be in yet.
"Lady," said the driver, "it's been a lousy day. Can I buy you a drink?" I hesitated perhaps a second and a half. "You sure can," I heard myself say with enthusiasm. We left the cab in front of the Biltmore, he locked his cash box and my packages in the trunk (could one have dared do that 10 years ago?) and, the quintessential odd couple, marched arm in arm into McCann's across the street.
Forty minutes later, we said goodbye. We had shared first names, the stories of our respective long-term marriages and a bowl of french fries. As we parted, he grinned.
"Doris, you made my day."
"Thank you, Ralph." -- DORIS F. JACOBY

Chefs' Hopes For '92 Include Lasting Till '93

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
CHEFS usually hesitate to think beyond their plats du jour. But at certain times, they are willing to raise their line of vision above the morning's market basket and peer into the future. Times like now, with a new year dawning, the economic climate uncertain and popular tastes in flux.
They say that business will improve, or that it will not. They say that customers want their plates loaded with hefty portions, or that they want tasting menus with food that is lighter than ever. So much for consensus. 
 They all, however, count their blessings, acknowledging that it has been a difficult year because of the recession and that they are lucky when seats in their restaurants are filled.
"I hope we can keep our heads above water in the coming year, as we have this year," said Don Pintabona of TriBeCa Grill in Manhattan. Thomas Valenti of Alison on Dominick Street said, "It's going to continue to be a matter of survival of the fittest out there, and I certainly wish the best for everyone."
At Square One in San Francisco, Joyce Goldstein predicted a rough year. "I wish I could be more cheerful and optimistic, but I believe the challenge of 1992 is to still be here in 1993," she said. ,"There certainly won't be any fat anywhere, especially not in the budget."
In Greenwich, Conn., at Jean-Louis, Jean-Louis Gerin, the owner and chef, is honing his creative edge for the new year. "These days only the best survive," he said. "I hope I will be brilliant."
At Vince and Eddie's on the Upper West Side, a leader in the trend toward down-scaling, Scott Campbell, the chef, believes the atmosphere of belt-tightening will continue.
Not everyone is so pessimistic. "Things are going to get better and better," said Charlie Trotter, the chef and owner of Charlie Trotter's in Chicago. Andrew D'Amico, the chef at the Sign of the Dove, said 1991 was a great year and he saw no reason to believe 1992 would be any different.
Many chefs acknowledge that the decade of the waiter-with-attitude is finally over. Thomas Keller, the executive chef of Checkers in Los Angeles, said people want to feel appreciated. "Friendly, caring service will be more important than ever," he said. Presentation -- the artfully arranged plate -- has lost out to flavor. "I want to simplify presentation, to concentrate more on the time I spend cooking and less on decorating the plates," said Gray Kunz, the chef at Lespinasse in the St. Regis Sheraton. John Doherty, the executive chef at the Waldorf-Astoria, feels the same way. "Food has to taste good," he said, "and I hope there will be more places where you can rely on just getting a good meal."
At the Sign of the Dove, Mr. D'Amico said minimalist plates are out because customers are more interested in hearty food. "In the long run, people want taste and flavor," he said. A lot of chefs talked of plates filled with meats and vegetables; there was surprisingly little mention of those foods that have been anointed with trend status over the last few years: grains and beans, chocolate and olive oil.
As for regional influences, the Mediterranean is still the favored culinary pond for many chefs. Mr. D'Amico expected to infuse his cooking with more Middle Eastern flavors in the coming year. Ms. Goldstein said she expects to serve more dishes from Turkey, Morocco and Spain. Antoine Bouterin, chef of Le Perigord in Manhattan, said that more than ever, his cooking would reflect the food of his native Provence.
Brian Whitmer, the executive chef of the Highlands Inn in Carmel, Calif., predicted that "we will all start relaxing on this obsession with lightness and look for better flavor."
"For that you need a little butter and more substantial meats," he said. "I'm not saying we should serve bigger portions, but the food should become heartier."
That's more or less the feeling of Christopher Gross, the owner of Christopher's and Christopher's Bistro in Phoenix. "Maybe this obsession with health will level off and people will understand the importance of enjoyment in moderation," he said.
Mark Strausman, the chef at Coco Pazzo, went beyond butter. "It's going to be the year of the steak," he said. "People want substantial food."
But not if you listen to David Bouley, the chef and owner of Bouley. "No dairy," he said. Or to Mr. Gerin, who said his style would continue to become lighter, with healthier food and more fish than ever on the menu. Or Mr. Trotter, who already serves all-vegetable menus.
Ms. Goldstein said she expects to serve more vegetable main courses. Mr. Kunz also hopes to sell more tasting menus, not in response to any pleas for lightness from his customers, but as a showcase for his style.
A close relationship with regional growers is integral to the insistence on flavor; great flavor is impossible without superb, fresh ingredients. Alain Ducasse, the renowned French chef from Monte Carlo, has told students at the Culinary Institute of America that 60 percent of the quality of the dish depends on the ingredients. To that end, chefs around the United States have resolved to work more closely with farmers.
Starr Boggs, the owner of Starr Boggs in Westhampton Beach, L.I., is lucky enough to have a restaurant surrounded by farmers and fishermen. Other chefs have to reach farther afield. "I'm tired of having everything flown in and there's no reason why some of the items can't be grown here," said Mr. Gross, who is searching for farmers around Phoenix.
Mr. Bouley, who has cultivated a long list of farmers in the New York region, said, "I want to spend as much time as possible with farmers, and I intend to look for growers in Virginia and the Carolinas who can enrich the winter season with quality produce."
Such alliances, Mr. Kunz suggested, will trickle down into the consumer produce markets. "There are a number of wonderful products that we use that consumers can't find, like fresh pea shoots in the spring that you can cook like spinach but have the flavor of sweet young peas," he said.
Tight money notwithstanding, a number of new restaurants are in the works. In a few months, David Burke, late of the River Cafe in Brooklyn, will be at the stove at a new restaurant on Park Avenue and 63d Street. Red Sage, the lavish new Southwestern restaurant that Mark Miller of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., is opening in Washington, will be ready in February. Eberhard Mueller, the former executive chef of Le Bernardin, expects to open Opus, a fish restaurant, in Santa Monica, Calif., in March. Alberta Wright, who owns Jezebel, which serves Southern food in Manhattan's theater district, will be heading west. She's working on a new restaurant on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, Calif.
"I think business will be good," she said. "I think there's a need for a restaurant like Jezebel in Los Angeles." She predicted that it would do better than the Paris version of Jezebel, which closed several months ago.
In New York, Alfred Portale, the executive chef of the Gotham Bar and Grill, resolved to open a new restaurant, preferably on the Upper East Side. "I am pleased with the direction we have taken with the Gotham but I would also like to be able to paint in different colors," he said.
In Westhampton Beach, Mr. Boggs hopes to open a new restaurant on the beach and to turn his small place in the village into a cafe and market.
Mr. Strausman resolved to see Coco Pazzo outlast its current trendiness with a full reservation book.
There also personal resolutions, like shedding pounds and spending more time with family. Brendan Walsh, the chef of Coyote Grill in Island Park on Long Island's South Shore, just opened the North Street Grill in Great Neck, on the North Shore. He hopes to take two days off in a row during 1992.
Most of the chefs take themselves more seriously than Zarela Martinez, the owner of Zarela's, a Mexican restaurant in Manhattan. She said that "Mexicans don't make New Year's resolutions because we're smart enough to know we can't keep them."
One chef who intends to keep his is Michael LoMonaco of "21" Club in New York. "What should I predict, that I'll be using more carrot juice next year?" he asked. "That's not the point. I intend to do more than ever to give something back, to use my talents" to help programs like City Harvest.

Freedom Against All Odds

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Humankind seems poised to survive the 20th century. It has not been easy. And it is frighteningly uncertain where leaders and events will take the story next.
But humanity's survival from the beginning of World War I until now, and arriving at this point with glimmers of freedom in places familiar only with tyranny, is a monumental achievement that should give courage almost whatever the unhappy turns of the next few years. 
 The world survived and defeated Hitler's Germany, a nation conceived in hell itself. Hitler called forth the towering evils in men's guts, evils that seemed invincible, and he was defeated.
From the debris emerged a Willy Brandt and a Konrad Adenauer, who helped transform hell into a thriving democracy. So did countless, unheralded Japanese politicians who also had to throw off a political culture of seemingly inevitable dictatorships.
From the Holocaust came the state of Israel, free and democratic, however troublesome.
Even the powerful dominion of Mao Zedong showed its vulnerability when his heirs decided they had to use force against the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. Victory will soon belong to that tiny, nameless man who stood in front of the tank and made the tank stop.
The lands of historical Russia outlasted idealistic killers like Lenin and sadistic ones like Stalin. They murdered tens of millions of their countrymen, and their visions of Communism led to the enslavement and deaths of millions more elsewhere.
Yet in the belly of this beast emerged the likes of Boris Pasternak, Natan Sharansky, Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Somehow they kept alive in their different ways a concept -- the idea of freedom -- never experienced in Russian history. Freedom was something they understood only from jail or dangerous conversations or banned books.
Or perhaps the idea of liberty was in their spirit to begin with. It must have been there in Nelson Mandela, who ultimately wielded more power in chains than his captors did from their seemingly impregnable fortress of apartheid. And it must have been there in Corazon Aquino, the woman who listened to her husband plot an impossible liberation and made it come to pass in a yellow dress.
No less amazing, man managed to possess the Promethean power of the nuclear bomb without destroying the world. Few in 1945, when the U.S. doomed the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, would have bet that such weapons would not be used again for almost 50 years. It was encouraging to see that common sense and sense of limits survived the megadeaths of the century. It was good to know that there was actually something leaders would not do to people.
These are all awesome historical facts. They give new life to the discarded theories of the 18th-century enlightenment historians who believed that history was the story of progress toward liberty. They give weight to the words of Immanuel Kant, who wrote: "A seed of enlightenment always survived, developing further with each revolution, and prepared the way for a subsequent higher level of improvement."
Most consequentially, the sparks of freedom that survived the inhumanities of most of this century and ignited the hopes of the last decade permit us to establish standards of decency -- and to judge.
When there was mostly oppression, who could convince us that liberty might be the natural order of things? When there were constant wars, who could persuade us that peace might be the norm?
Freedom's survival against totalitarian odds allows us to believe again in higher values and to hold leaders and followers to a higher measure.
Now the onetime outcasts -- the Yeltsins, Mandelas, Aquinos -- will also be held to the standards they helped to set. And they will be ferociously tested.
No one will be there for these new democrats with money and power the way the United States was there for Germany and Japan. The new flame-keepers came to power mostly on their own, and they will have to survive mostly on their own at a time of general economic famine and in places that have no roots in freedom.
The odds and gods of reason and experience are profoundly against them. On their side is the spirit of liberty that brought them this far, against all odds.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks With Japan Call for Toughness;
Where Theory Fails

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 22 editorial attack on Representative Richard Gephardt reminds me of a cancer patient in the denial phase. Reality is too difficult, so the doctor must be wrong.
Your economic analysis is simply silly. You argue that we should not try to end the trade deficit because that would strengthen the dollar and affect the trade balance. But achieving some sort of equilibrium is just what we want; there is no inherent virtue in a weak currency. Nonetheless, your arguments do bring out a couple of salient facts, even if in a somewhat backward manner. 
 The decline in the value of the dollar since 1985 has caused our trade balance with Europe to swing from negative to positive. This is what traditional economic theory predicts. Normally, this would result in strengthening the dollar to a new equilibrium point. This has not happened because the decline in the dollar did not take care of the trade deficit with Japan. We declined from an unbelievable to a merely monstrous deficit. We are rapidly on our way back to unbelievable despite the low level of the dollar. Something is clearly different here, something not explainable by theory.
In my years of practicing international trade law, I have been continually amazed at the willingness of economists to ignore reality. It is time we re-examined the theory, and that is what Mr. Gephardt is doing. Instead of castigating him, you should be applauding. His proposal may not be the answer, but the re-examination is necessary.
Mr. Gephardt's proposal recognizes that all the babble about a single global market is just babble. There is actually a series of markets, each functioning in its own manner. Some markets mesh relatively well, others do not. Where they do not, some mechanism must be devised to minimize friction and avoid severe damage to one or both of the economies. This is enormously difficult, but we should not shy away from it.
How can you not see the dangers of today's structural imbalances? How can you not see that every conventional "solution" offered is a replay of one that failed 5, 10 or 20 years ago? Continued adherence to theories will in the long run lead to tensions, resentment and conflict that could very well be uncontrollable.
The irresponsibility is yours, not Mr. Gephardt's. If you disagree with his solution, offer one of your own, one that takes account of history as well as the present reality. The times demand it.

The Dissonant Messages of 1991
The stock market story of 1991 was one of prices that soared early in the year and again at the end, producing an excellent year for large stocks, and a phenomenal one for small stocks. But the economy barely limped along, with the weakness returning in the summer and consumer confidence plunging to its lowest level in a decade. Such a divergence suggests that something has to give, that either the economy will pick up soon or the stock market will have to surrender. Some market bears even suggest that both could happen. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [Page D1.] 
 The precipitous decline in short-term interest rates should begin to pay dividends for the economy in the second half of this year, credit market analysts and economists say. [D1.]
The professionals who ponder foreign stock markets say they are optimistic about 1992. But their optimism, bolstered by an end-of-the-year rally, is tempered by the underlying economic outlook, especially uncertainty about a global recovery. [D1.]
U.S. companies' demand for cash from public markets grew to record levels in 1991 despite the country's economic troubles, helping to build renewed strength for Wall Street firms. [D10.]
The dollar is falling as the new year begins, just like last year. But analysts are not soon expecting a sudden and sharp rebound of the sort that occurred at the start of 1991. [D10.]
 
The Economy
Service industries are in the throes of a pervasive shake-up much like the one that racked smokestack manufacturing a decade ago. The concerted drive to squeeze costs and improve profits has resulted in extensive cost-cutting, job freezes, layoffs and consolidations. The storm threatens to last much longer than the recession; indeed, most economists expect the great American job machine to run at just half speed through much of the 1990's. [A1.]
Harold D. Jones has had a front-row seat on the excesses of an era. As the U.S. trustee in charge of administering bankruptcy cases in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, he has seen hundreds of thousands of parties file for bankruptcies. [D1.]

HEADLINE: DISSONANT MESSAGES;
Offerings and Fees Reach New Highs

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
American corporations' demand for cash from the public markets grew to record levels last year, despite the country's economic troubles, helping to build renewed strength for Wall Street firms.
Corporations issued a record $579.75 billion in domestic securities, up by 85.8 percent from the previous year's record of $312.11 billion, according to IDD Information Services, a New York-based research firm. 
 The underwritings for the fourth quarter were more than twice those of the comparable period in 1990. Corporations issued $162.57 billion in securities in the quarter, up from $80.48 billion in the last quarter of 1990, according to IDD.
"It was a banner year in virtually all categories," said Roger M. Vasey, executive vice president at Merrill Lynch & Company in charge of the debt markets group. "We saw significantly increased issuance on the part of industrials, as well as financials and utilities."
 
Rushing to Trim Debt
 The boom in underwritings was fueled by the rapid cuts in interest rates throughout 1991, underwriters said. Corporations rushed to reduce borrowing costs and cut debt levels.
The heavy business brought near-record fees to Wall Street investment houses. Disclosed fees more than doubled, to $4.54 billion from $1.94 billion earned in 1990. That surpassed the 1987 results of $4.51 billion, but fell short of the 1986 record of $5 billion.
Fourth-quarter results in fees were even stronger in comparison, with the amounts nearly quadrupling, to $1.57 billion, from $395.9 million in the 1990 quarter.
Virtually all the securities firms saw more business for the year and the quarter than they had a year earlier. The only exception was Salomon Brothers Inc.; its volume of underwritings dropped slightly in the fourth quarter, as it struggled to recover from the Treasuries market scandal that began in August.
 
Merrill Lynch Holds Lead
 The biggest underwriter for the fourth straight year was Merrill Lynch. In 1988, Merrill surpassed Salomon, which had been the perennial leader in underwriting, and Merrill has been building a steady lead since.
Last year, Merrill posted a 79.6 percent rise in underwritings, with $99.98 billion in securities, compared with $55.68 billion in 1990. But the firm's market share slipped to 17.2 percent in 1991, from 17.8 percent the previous year.
Goldman, Sachs & Company maintained its second-place ranking, with an 86.5 percent rise, to $72.74 billion, in underwritings, giving it 12.5 percent of the market. That compared with $39 billion in 1990. Goldman ranked third for the fourth quarter, although its underwritings doubled, to $19.32 billion, from $9.67 billion in the 1990 period.
Lehman Brothers jumped in the rankings to third place, from seventh in 1990. The firm underwrote $67.62 billion in securities last year, more than triple its $19.9 billion in 1990. For the quarter, Lehman ranked second, underwriting $23.49 billion, up sharply from the $3.5 billion underwritten in last year's quarter.
But the increase did not translate into proportionately higher fees. The firm ranked fifth in fees, with $335 million, compared with $125.3 million in 1990, when it ranked seventh.
The stock market began climbing early in the year after the beginning of the American-led bombing in Iraq, and after some backing and filling later in the year, surged to topple records at the close of the year.
Equity underwriting volume grew by more than twofold for the year, IDD said, and showed a sevenfold increase for the fourth quarter of 1991 over the 1990 period, which was exceptionally weak after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Initial public offerings were among the biggest beneficiaries of the appetite for stock. New public companies issued $54.83 billion in stock in 1991, more than double the $19.16 billion in 1990.
 
More Nonconvertible Debt
 For all nonconvertible debt, issues rose by 75.6 percent, to a total of $497 billion, from $283 billion in 1990. Among nonconvertibles, junk bonds had a significant recovery during the year, after being largely deemed as having collapsed in 1990. In 1991, Wall Street underwrote 42 junk-bond issues, six times as many as in 1990, when it underwrote seven.
"One of the most significant events in my opinion during the year was the movement of the institutional investor back into the higher-yield securities," Mr. Vasey of Merrill Lynch said. "Investors have moved into the triple-B category and double-B category in search of yield, wherever they have been able to find improving credits."

HEADLINE: Bush Assures Australians of His Support

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia, Thursday, Jan. 2

 BODY:
President Bush sought today to reassure Australia that he intends to uphold its economic stability and its security, saying that the United States would maintain its military presence in the Pacific despite its own economic troubles and the fading of the Soviet threat.
Mr. Bush made the remarks at a news conference midway through a three-day visit to Australia, where critics have questioned his commitment to freer trade and the reliability of American military forces in the region. 
 Appearing before reporters at the Parliament here, Mr. Bush bristled at suggestions that he is practicing a double standard by speaking on behalf of a global free-trade agreement during his visit while supporting farm subsidies at home that have undercut Australian exports of wheat, sugar and other commodities.
Japanese officials have made similar accusations, though more subtly, in advance of Mr. Bush's stop next week in Tokyo, the climax of his 12-day trek across the western Pacific. The President has demanded that the Japanese lower barriers to American exports of autos, farm goods and other products.
 
Denies Any Contradiction
 "I don't think it's contradictory at all," Mr. Bush said. "We've never said we're totally pure. We're working for freer and fairer trade, and the Japanese should work for freer and fairer trade."
He said that while he would not pledge to end Washington's subsidies of American wheat exports, he would consult with Australia to insure that those subsidies are aimed at markets where American farmers compete with Europeans, not with Australian growers.
He raised his criticism of Japan's trade policies another notch at the news conference, refusing to disavow a remark by his departing Commerce Secretary, Robert Mosbacher, that Japanese trade barriers have caused an economic recession to deepen in the United States.
The United States has a $41 billion trade deficit with Japan, and Mr. Bush has argued frequently that increased Japanese purchases of American goods would stimulate domestic growth and create thousands of jobs.
"The answer to all of this, whether Japanese-U.S. or Australian-U.S., is to get these economies going through expanded trade," he said. "But anytime you have an extraordinary trade imbalance, you'd have to say that contributes to sluggish growth."
Earlier, in a speech to Australia's Parliament, Mr. Bush said that plans to close the United States naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines, a major training, repair and supply installation for American forces in the Pacific, would have no impact on Washington's commitment to defend the region.
"Let me put it plainly: I have served in Asia personally in time of war and in time of peace," he said, referring to his Navy service during World War II and his stint as United States Ambassador to China. "Our role and our purpose as a Pacific power will remain constant. It is important for the people of Australia to understand this. We will remain engaged."
Planned cuts in the Pentagon budget and the loss of two American bases in the Philippines -- the other installation, Clark Air Base, was abandoned after it was buried in volcanic ash last summer -- have stirred concern among Pacific allies that the American military shield in the region will erode.
But Administration officials said this week that they intend to reach new agreements in the region that will spread the defense burden between Washington and its allies.
An accord signed last year with Singapore, where Mr. Bush is to fly on Saturday, is cited as a model for the new arrangements. American jets are being stationed at an air base there and Singapore military pilots are being trained to fly American jets for their country's own defense.
Addressing Australia's economic concerns in a meeting earlier today with Prime Minister Paul Keating, Mr. Bush tried to enlist the country in his campaign to lower global trade barriers, suggesting that Asia and the United States together could persuade a stubborn Europe to end a costly war over farm exports.
 
Linking Subsidies to Trade Pact
 Mr. Bush did not make an explicit offer to do what the Australians want most: end American export subsidies.
But a senior Administration official with Mr. Bush's party indicated on Wednesday night that the White House was prepared to abolish not just those supports, but an entire network of multibillion-dollar farm subsidies should a global agreement be reached to lower trade barriers.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Bush Administration was already studying the removal of some of American farmers' most sacrosanct trade barriers, including laws that protect sugar, rice and dairy products from any serious foreign competition.
The official said a preliminary Administration analysis had concluded that American farm subsidies and quotas cost American consumers $65 billion annually in higher food and clothing prices.
The disclosure of the analysis, in addition to Mr. Bush's pledge to insure that subsidies do not unfairly target Australian farmers, suggested that the White House is already taking heed of complaints by Australia and Japan that his Asian tour, billed by him as a crusade for free trade and American exports, was all stick and no carrot.
Several hundred Australian farmers marched through Canberra today to protest American agricultural policies, and Mr. Keating was said to have given Mr. Bush a personal note stressing farmers' objections to the wheat subsidy program.
 
Official Concedes Point
 In his interview on Wednesday, the Administration official conceded that that point was a valid one.
"You've got to be fair and honest about trade barriers, and we've got them," he said. Should the European Community agree to a global reduction in quotas and subsidies, he said, "we're willing to take steps to end this game" of trade protections.
"But in the meantime," he added, "we're not going to unilaterally disarm."
The official said Mr. Bush wanted to convince Mr. Keating that the quickest way to end American trade barriers is to force Europe to abandon protectionist policies that set off a trade war over farm goods in the first place.
A draft proposal that would require all nations to reduce subsidies and quotas for a variety of commodities by 20 to 36 percent is awaiting trade negotiators in Geneva. Talks on a new worldwide trade agreement have been stalled by disputes over farm exports, but are to resume on Jan. 13.
 
Sending a Signal
 The United States favors using the draft proposal as a starting point for a final agreement, but the European Community is balking at the notion.
"We'd like to send a signal that the U.S. would like to work from this draft" to fashion a final accord, the senior official said. "But it'll take the Asian countries to send a message to the Europeans that they'd better work with it too" or risk being isolated in future trade negotiations.
Mr. Bush spent an hour and a half in private talks today with Mr. Keating and his Cabinet, then met for half an hour with Australian farm groups that planned to press him on the trade issue.
Although Mr. Bush has talked extensively about free trade on his trip, his stated commitment to use the trip to showcase American exports and create American jobs has so far has been invisible.
Nine of the 21 American business executives who agreed to join Mr. Bush on the Asia visit accompanied him to Australia, but except for a brief drop-by at the Parliament house today they have yet to be seen or heard from.
Nor has Mr. Bush said much about American business concerns here. In a shift from the President's own emphasis of recent weeks, officials are beginning to stress the importance of strengthening American military and geopolitical alliances, a move that suggests that the White House fears that expectations have been raised too high at home for a Presidential triumph on exports and jobs on this tour.

HEADLINE: Long Viewed as Safe From Slumps, Las Vegas Finally Feels the Recession

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Dec. 29

 BODY:
For some time Las Vegas has purveyed an escapist world of fantasy and gambling and a view of itself as largely resistant to national recessions.
Now, the recession has finally hit the Strip, just as it has Atlantic City in New Jersey. There are more visitors than ever under the neon glare, but they are gambling less and spending less. The casinos' take has dropped substantially in recent months, local home sales are down from the torrid 1990 pace, and unemployment is up. Even the high rollers are lying low; baccarat play is down by a third. 
 "It is pretty clear the recession is finally catching up with Las Vegas," said Alan Feldman, spokesman for the new Mirage Hotel, one of the few hotel-casinos that have thus far weathered the downturn well. "Whether it will be a serious or mild effect, the jury is still out."
Casino operators fret over visitors like John Liemert, an administrator with an aerospace company from Torrance, Calif., who took a $42 room at a small hotel and then spent his Saturday afternoon sipping beer and flirting with the cocktail waitresses at Caesars Palace rather than playing the nearby blackjack tables and slot machines. "It's recession, fear, uncertainty," he said of his hard-hit industry in California. "It's scary. People are cutting their entertainment funds."
To be sure, the slowdown is mild compared with the recession in the Northeast and nearby Southern California. But the fact that Las Vegas has slowed at all is remarkable.
 
End of Increases
 "Nevada has a long history of virtually unbroken year-to-year increases," said William R. Eadington, an economist who is director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada in Reno. "For many years, there was a perception that the gaming industry was recession-proof. But as the industry has matured and the supply increased, it has become more susceptible to changes in the national economy. There's been a very noticeable shift in attitude, toward pessimism."
During the 1981-82 recession, Professor Eadington said, "there was a slowdown in growth rates, but at no time was there a decline." He added that there could be "significant layoffs" by hotels and casinos this time.
The recession comes to Las Vegas well after Atlantic City, which has apparently begun to recover. The amount of money won by the city's 12 casinos before expenses was up 1.7 percent for the first 11 months of this year, although the results varied considerably from casino to casino. This followed a poor year in 1990, when the gaming win fell from 1989 for the 11 casinos that predated the opening of the Trump Taj Mahal. Direct comparisons to Las Vegas are difficult because there are far fewer casinos in Atlantic City, and the addition of the Taj Mahal has skewed the data.
Other experts are less bearish on Las Vegas than Professor Eadington is, but signs of trouble abound:
*The Nevada Gaming Control Board reported Dec. 11 that the gambling industry suffered the steepest one-month drop in winnings in the state's 60 years of legalized gambling in October, the latest month for which figures are available. The casinos' gaming win fell by 6 percent statewide and 12 percent in Las Vegas, compared with October 1990.
*The state government, which depends on gambling taxes for 40 percent of its revenue, finds its current $2.2 billion budget in trouble because it assumed a 7.5 percent increase in gambling taxes.
*In the week before Christmas, two Las Vegas casinos -- Main Street Station and the Riviera -- declared bankruptcy.
*The unemployment rate for Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, rose to 6.0 percent in November from 5.5 percent in November 1990. The number of new jobs in the county in the 1990-91 fiscal year totaled a negligible 100, compared with 36,600 in 1989-90, according to the Nevada Employment Security Department.
*Sales of new homes are running 10 percent behind last year's pace in Las Vegas, and resales are behind by 18 percent, said Dennis L. Smith, president of Home Builders Research here. Mr. Smith said the 1990 level was so overheated, however, that the market remained comparatively healthy. "We have gone back into the reality world from the fantasy world," he said.
Though Nevada is expected to continue to grow in population substantially, economists now doubt that the state will continue to lead the nation. According to the 1990 census, Las Vegas was the fastest-growing major American city in the 80's.
 
Crowds Are Up
 From the crowds here this holiday weekend, it was hard to tell that anything was amiss. Long lines formed at the restaurants at the Mirage, the Excalibur, Bally's and other major hotels, all of which were fully booked through New Year's Day. Liza Minelli's four shows at Caesars Palace sold out at $72 a head, not including drinks and tips. And there were still regulars like Cecil Payne, a petroleum engineer from Houston, who visits two or three times a year and says, "I gamble till I leave."
Indeed, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the number of visitors to Las Vegas was up by 1.7 percent during the first nine months of this year over last, to 15.9 million.
But appearances are deceiving. "The consensus is that we are getting a decent number of visitors, but they are spending somewhat less," said Phil Hevner, a casino industry columnist for The Las Vegas Sun and editor of International Gaming and Wagering Business, a trade journal.
He added that economic difficulties in Japan and other parts of Asia had deterred many of the high-rolling Asian players who have become a mainstay here in recent years. For the four months ended Oct. 31, the baccarat take was down 27.5 percent, 33.1 percent in October alone, compared with the same periods last year. Figures show that table games like baccarat and blackjack have slumped much more sharply than slot machines.
Prof. William N. Thompson of the College of Business Administration at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas said October's slump was not so severe as it seemed. This October had the Comdex computer convention, whose 120,000 participants are notorious non-gamblers, and there was a heavyweight prize fight last October, making that month a record for profits.
 
'Business Is Awful'
 Even so, "clearly business is awful," said Paul W. Lowden, president of Sahara Resorts, which has three hotels in Las Vegas and one in Laughlin, a new gambling resort development on the Colorado River 100 miles south of Las Vegas that is bucking the recessionary trend. He added that he and other operators were having to work harder than ever to attract business and capture a special niche for each hotel.
The recession appears to be accelerating a significant shakeout in Las Vegas that has been building with the opening of major theme hotels like the upscale 3,049-room Mirage and the downscale 4,032-room Excalibur in the last two years. Moreover, three huge new projects on the drawing boards will add 10,000 rooms to the Strip by 1994, meaning more competition than ever for the gambling dollar.
"The win is off, and the pie is sliced up more," said Mr. Lowden, who said he was reaching out to potential new business in foreign countries.
A key indicator of troubles in Las Vegas is room rates, which drop substantially in slack periods. Earlier this year, for example, the Las Vegas Hilton was offering rooms at $20 a night, double occupancy, including buffet dinner and a show. In holiday periods like this, the room rate runs about $85 a night for two people.
The recent discounts meant the hotel was essentially giving away the rooms to entice gamblers; the casinos' win typically runs about $16 for every $100 played.
But if the gaming win is down, too, the hotels are put in a tough squeeze. In recent years, they have depended more than ever on turning profits from rooms and food. "The question now is how much are you going to have to give away to maintain the gaming room," said Mr. Feldman of the Mirage. "Most casinos rely on getting something from the hotels to turn a profit."

HEADLINE: India Seems Adrift in Changed World

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 30

 BODY:
Last August, when most of the world's leaders were rushing to denounce the hard-liners' coup in the Soviet Union, India's Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, declared that the coup was an instructive example of what happens to "over-enthusiastic reformers."
Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, and India's foreign policy as a whole, Boris N. Yeltsin crushed the plotters, resurrected Mikhail S. Gorbachev and began the final disassembling of the Soviet Union. Since then, India has struggled to cope with the new landscape in the old Soviet Union and has begun to search for its own place in a world that is changing rapidly, in ways that have upset India's traditional assumptions. 
 Yet, it is not only in regard to the Soviet Union that India is feeling its way forward, but on a range of international issues, whether with its neighbors, with its near-neighbors in Southeast Asia or with the United States. India's decades-long reliance on the Soviet Union as its ally, an ideological preoccupation with third world solidarity and a stubborn faith in socialism has, in the minds of many diplomats and Indians, hindered fresh thinking on foreign policy issues.
 
'Trying to Adjust'
 "India has been slow to grasp the change in the world and is hobbled by inertia," said a senior Western diplomat here. "But they are trying to adjust."
India's foremost news magazine, India Today, which is critical of the Government, is even harsher in its judgments. "Having been cussedly Indo-centric for so long," the magazine said in a editorial in its last issue, "with foreign policy conforming to ideology rather than reality, the politicians and bureaucrats running the country seem incapable of learning to think globally -- of tailoring international changes to fit the country's vital interests."
Many Indian professionals as well as foreign diplomats are expressing increasing concern about the Government's perceived missteps and gaffs in foreign policy, behavior that has done much to convey an impression of amateurishness in foreign affairs. Critics of India's performance point to a series of actions that have betrayed its uncertainties about the newly emerging world, including these:
*India's announcement that it would not recognize the three Baltic republics after they declared their independence from the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, it reversed its position. For their part, the Baltic states have largely ignored India.
*The failure of India's Embassy in Moscow to anticipate the events of August and to provide any effective analysis of the events in the wake of the coup's collapse.
*New Delhi's effort to pursue relations with the Soviet Union even as it was dissolving.
*The slowness with which India responded to Pakistan's proposal for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, a proposal endorsed by the Soviet Union, much to India's shock, and China.
*India's scuttling of a summit conference of regional countries last month and its apparent unwillingness to move decisively to resolve its decades-long disputes with its most powerful neighbor, Pakistan.
Emerging as a central target of criticism over the country's international performance is the Foreign Minister, Madhavsingh Solanki, an affable Congress Party politician who has publicly said he did not want the job, who is increasingly seen as unable to understand the world around him and incapable of providing leadership in formulating new foreign policy initiatives. India Today tersely labeled him as "a square peg in a round hole," who was "ineffective and inarticulate."
Indeed, at a meeting last month between Mr. Solanki and Reginald Bartholomew, the United States Under Secretary of State for international security, the Indian Foreign Minister simply sat in silence after Mr. Bartholomew gave a brief report on American concerns in the region.
Mr. Solanki, in recent conversations, has reiterated many of the policies of earlier governments, stressing the importance of such organizations as the nonaligned movement, a group of mostly third world countries known for hostility to the United States and a less-than-critical attitude toward authoritarian dictatorships and human rights violations among members.
Nowhere has India's lack of surefootedness in international affairs been more apparent than in its relations with the Soviet Union and the emerging republics. "They're still looking at the Soviet Union in a freeze-frame manner," said Shekar Gupta, a senior editor at India Today. "They still look at the Soviet Union as the same as before the coup. They have a nostalgia for the past and an affection for Communism."
Only belatedly did India recognize the importance of Mr. Yeltsin and only with difficulty was Mr. Solanki able to meet the Russian President during his visit to the republic in November. India's trade relations with the old Soviet Union, largely the product of sweeping treaties, have disintegrated as the union fragmented, but in New Delhi there is still talk in the halls of the Ministry of External Affairs about preserving treaties of friendship and of India's special relationship with Moscow.
 
Relations With the West
 But some Western diplomats here are more charitable in their assessments. "I see the Indians casting about," said a senior Western envoy. "That's not the same as floundering. There have been efforts to smooth relations with the United States, with the European Community, with Japan, the I.M.F. and the World Bank. That's been a solid decision."
Perhaps the most significant act by India, from the perspective of Western diplomats, was its decision to vote to repeal the United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism, a measure India sponsored when it was adopted in 1975. The United States as well as dozens of Western countries bombarded the Ministry for External Affairs with official and bluntly worded messages urging that India join them in the vote to repeal.
As India pursues a program of internal economic liberalization, and necessarily a more relaxed approach to foreign investment, there is a growing view here that India's foreign policy is being orchestrated less and less by the views of the Foreign Ministry officials and more by the consequences of decisions made by the Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh. Since his appointment in June, Mr. Singh has recharted India's economic course by encouraging foreign investment, closer links with the International Monetary Fund, devaluation of the country's overvalued currency and encouragement of private enterprise.

HEADLINE: DISSONANT MESSAGES: Market Place;
Can the Rally Endure Without a Recovery?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Rarely in the history of Wall Street has a year ended with such opposing messages coming from the stock market and the economy.
The stock market story of 1991 was one of prices that soared early in the year and again at the end, producing an excellent year for large stocks, and a phenomenal one for small stocks. The Nasdaq composite index had its best year ever, rising 57 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20 percent. 
 But the economy barely limped along, with the weakness returning during the summer, and consumer confidence plunging to its lowest level in a decade, reversing a brief recovery that followed the liberation of Kuwait. Corporate profits are weak, and layoffs are rising.
 
Something Has to Give
 Such a divergence suggests that something has to give, that either the economy should pick up soon, or the stock market may have to surrender. Some market bears even suggest that both could happen.
Wall Street has long been a place where conventional wisdom can change almost overnight, far faster than most economists or politicians can appreciate. Such a change took place in the final three weeks of 1991, when a mood of despondency about the fate of the economy was replaced by renewed confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to spur business activity with lower interest rates. The Fed's sixth discount-rate reduction played an important role in igniting that resurgence. The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 10.7 percent in 15 trading days.
It was the most explosive move for stocks since early January, when pessimism over the possibility of war with Iraq was replaced by exultation at how weak a foe the Iraqis proved to be. That rally, as it continued, convinced many analysts that the recession that had begun the previous October would soon end. There was a brief economic recovery, but it soon faded.
The period of dismay, which began in November amid signs of the weak economy, brought stock prices to their lowest levels since March.
The problem, said one economist who remained confident of economic recovery, was too short a time frame. "On average, a change in short-term interest rates takes nearly 18 months to reach its maximum effect on the economy," said R. David Ranson of H. C. Wainwright & Company in Boston. "The short-run impact is negative." Mr. Ranson predicts that a period of strong growth, lasting at least two years, is likely to begin in 1992.
That level of optimism is rare, but many economists expect to see real growth by the second half of this year, and that expectation is embodied in most bullish forecasts.
"I think 1992 is going to be a good year," said Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "It will be the first year in three in which we have had any kind of improvement in profits." She forecasts that stock prices will advance as the profit outlook becomes clearer.
But many people, including Ms. Cohen, suggest the riskiest time of the year may be early in it. Carmine Grigoli, the chief equity portfolio strategist at the First Boston Corporation, predicts that by the end of 1992 the Dow is likely to reach 3,400. In the meantime, he says, it could drop to 2,750.
"Taken together, a weakening economy, falling profits, earnings disappointments and high valuations suggest that the early months of 1992 will be a vulnerable period for the stock market," Mr. Grigoli wrote late in December. He said the earnings improvement needed to justify current prices was unlikely before late 1992.
Such forecasts should, of course, be taken with a grain of salt. As Mr. Grigoli also wrote, "For many forecasters, 1991 was a humbling experience."
While there undoubtedly was a crystal ball somewhere in which both the economy and the stock market were in focus, it was not easy to find. In general, a year ago forecasters thought that both the stock market and the economy would revive in 1991, or that neither would.
It is common for stocks to begin rising before the end of a recession, but in this case the lead time was far greater than normal -- assuming that the recession has yet to end. One explanation for that move, beloved among bears, is that traders simply put too much trust in the Fed, and have yet to recognize that this recession reflects structural problems brought on by the huge debt of the 1980's hanging over the economy, problems that cannot easily be offset by lower interest rates.
Many bulls offer an explanation of the stock market's explosive performance in 1991 that suggests it will be a precursor of things to come. They argue that the prolonged period of low short-term interest rates is leading to a fundamental shift in Americans' investment preferences, away from short-term, risk-free investments and toward long-term stocks and bonds.
"At some point, household investors will say: 'I am investing for the long term. I want to be investing in an asset category that offers a better long-term return,' " said Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs.
Another explanation, which could suggest a less-long-lasting bull market, is that the Fed's attempt to spur growth for most of 1991 simply provided money that the "real" economy did not need, because businesses did not want to build new plants or install new machines. That money had to go somewhere, and much of it went into financial assets, pushing up prices of stocks and bonds.
"What we are seeing is that there can be a paper asset inflation in the face of a slow economy," said Charles Clough, the chief strategist at Merrill Lynch.
To Michael Murphy, the editor of Overpriced Stock Service, a newsletter that reports on stocks he expects to decline, the flip side could come this year. He forecasts that if the economy does revive, it could absorb money that is now in financial assets, and send stock prices lower. Or, he argues, stock prices could fall if the economy stays weak.
If 1991 taught that the stock market can become decoupled from the economy, it also retaught some old lessons: for example, that the best buys may be found among the most hated stocks, or that it is possible to find a great performer in a bad industry, or vice versa.
Evidence of the first point could be found in the performance of Goodyear, which in 1990 ranked as the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average, losing 56.6 percent of its value. So what happened in 1991? Goodyear's prospects turned out to be not so bad as had been expected, and its stock made up all of that loss and more. It rose 183.4 percent, making it the best performer among the Dow stocks.
The worst Dow stock in 1991 was Westinghouse, down 36.8 percent as huge losses from its financial services subsidiary were disclosed. But as the year ended, it appeared that investors were hoping for another revival. From the time the market bottomed, on Dec. 10, to the end of the year, Westinghouse was up 22 percent, making it one of the best performers for the period.
If there was one industry to avoid in 1991, it was oil. At the beginning of the year there was talk of soaring prices brought on by the gulf war. Instead, Saudi Arabia stepped up production, demand fell as economies weakened, and the price fell. Many oil stocks were down, and Standard & Poor's ranked oil and gas as the worst performing group.
Don't tell that to holders of Triton Energy. Its shares rose a stunning 434 percent. Triton had the good fortune to make what its backers hope is a huge discovery in Colombia.
On the other side, there was no stronger group than biotechnology, which produced no fewer than 24 initial public offerings. Biotech stocks dominate the list of best-performing stocks both on the American Stock Exchange and in the Nasdaq over-the-counter market. But Granada Biosciences saw a planned sale of part of its business fall through, and the stock price went with it, dropping 96 percent.
Speaking of going in different ways, consider two companies controlled by media moguls: Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communication. When the year began, it was News Corporation that had widely publicized debt problems and was scaring investors, while Mr. Maxwell's company seemed far more secure. By the end of the year, News Corporation shares had nearly tripled, while Maxwell Communication shares may be worthless when the investigations of the late Mr. Maxwell's actions are completed.

HEADLINE: Banking Crisis Still Grips Rhode Island

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 1

 BODY:
On New Year's Day 1991, Bruce Sundlun was inaugurated as the new Governor of Rhode Island. Less than an hour after the ceremony, he announced that 45 banks and credit unions would be closed indefinitely because of the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, the private fund that insured them.
More than $1 billion, belonging to more than 150,000 depositors, was frozen. A year later, many of those people still have not been paid, and state regulators are still ironing out how to do so. 
 The state has blamed poor record-keeping by the banks and credit unions for the delay. Although Governor Sundlun, a Democrat, has proposed and won approval of a plan to pay the depositors, payoffs have been repeatedly stalled while the state waits for private investors to acquire the closed institutions.
Although 36 of the 45 closed institutions have been reopened, depositors with accounts in the remaining nine institutions have received payouts equaling about 10 percent of their accounts' values. Smaller depositors with accounts of $2,500 or less have been paid in full.
 
A Statehouse Demonstration
 Tonight hundreds of depositors still waiting for their money held a candlelight vigil outside the Statehouse here to mark the anniversary of the crisis.
With their arms around each other, depositors lined the steps of the marble-domed Capitol and waved signs demanding, "We Want Our Money Back Now."
Sam Masnuppelli, a 71-year-old depositor, rode a Honda motorcycle with a trailer that held a sign decorated in Christmas lights that said, "Governor, It's Our Money, Not Yours."
For many, last year was one of frustration and anger. Some depositors have been consumed by the daily developments of the credit union crisis, partly because they believed that their money would have been returned by now.
 
'Faith Has Been Shattered'
 "Nineteen ninety-one will be written off as the year Rhode Island lost its hope," said Terrence McKenna, who has led numerous rallies on behalf of depositors in Woonsocket, an old mill town 13 miles northwest of here. "That faith has been shattered by the inaction of legislators and their absolute inability to handle this problem in a quick and efficient manner."
Last August, in a protest with symbolic links to the Boston Tea Party in 1773, depositors dropped 3,000 teabags in front of the Governor's office. "We wanted the Governor to know how close we have come to a citizens' revolt," Mr. McKenna said.
Mr. McKenna, who owns a tire and auto parts business in Woonsocket, said he spent last year trying to keep his cash-strapped business afloat. With $90,000 frozen in an account in the Marquette Credit Union, one that is not expected to reopen, Mr. McKenna said he had to lay off some employees.
Many other businesses in this state did not survive 1991. Bankruptcy filings increased 62 percent in Rhode Island last year, a development that many residents attribute to the trickle-down effect of the credit union crisis. The size of the increase was second only to that in New Hampshire, where bankruptcy filings rose by 69 percent, according to a report released by the American Bankruptcy Institute this week.
All the money that was tied up in closed credit unions and banks is money that could have been spent or invested, depositors point out.
Waiting for Her Money
Jane Tinberg of Warwick, a 50-year-old native of Rhode Island and former McDonald's franchise owner, said she had more than $300,000 tied up in four of the closed institutions.
"I used to go shopping all the time, travel, go to the movies at least once a week," she said. "In 1991 I did not buy one article of clothing; I did not go to the movies once. My life has changed dramatically."
Before last Jan. 1, Ms. Tinberg said, she lived off the interest from those accounts.
She said she did not receive a single penny of her money until June. Since then she has received payouts totaling $29,500, she said, adding, "But I want to know when I am going to get the rest of my money back."
 
Some Have No Guarantees
 Under Mr. Sundlun's payout plan, depositors with up to $100,000 in frozen accounts are supposed to get back all their money. But those with more than $100,000 have been given no guarantees that all their money will be returned.
"The Governor has not ruled out payouts over $100,000," said Barbara Cottam, Mr. Sundlun's spokeswoman. But she said the credit unions that are in the worst shape -- Rhode Island Central, Central and Marquette -- will have to wait until acquisitions of the remaining institutions are completed.
"Once those are set we will be able to determine the payout schedule," she said. The state hopes to recover some of the money from pending lawsuits against the private insurer.
The insurer, Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity, failed when it bailed out one of its institutions, Heritage Loan and Investment, after $13 million disappeared from Heritage Loan in late 1990.
 
Heavy Toll on Depositors
 The Governor has said depositors with accounts in credit unions that will not be acquired by other institutions should be paid in full by next June.
Ms. Cottam said 65 percent of the depositors in these institutions had been paid in full.
Meanwhile, depositors say the credit union crisis continues to take its toll on Rhode Islanders.
'You can't imagine the number of strokes, heart attacks and even suicides that this has caused," said Stephen Altieri, a leader of the depositors' protest.
"The sad thing is," he added, many depositors "are in the same situation they were a year ago."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Moscow Pact on Kabul Clears Way for Transitional Rule

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 1

 BODY:
An era ended in Afghanistan today, 12 years after a Soviet intervention that drew Washington into a proxy war with Moscow over a poor crossroads country that for centuries had been the focus of big-power rivalry.
Under an agreement announced on Sept. 13, Kabul's former backers in Moscow and the United States pledged to end all military assistance to their respective allies -- the leftist Government of President Najibullah in Afghanistan and a loose alliance of Islamic rebel groups based in Pakistan -- by the first of this year. 
 Officials on both sides say that the pledge had been met before the deadline, clearing the way for the formation of a transitional government under the sponsorship of the United Nations.
But Afghans and independent analysts say that the story of Afghanistan's most recent civil strife is far from over, and that the nation of 15 million, where more than a million people died in war and 5 million fled into exile, faces more instability within its borders that could affect the formerly Soviet Central Asian republics.
 
Excluding Najibullah
 "The military era is over for us," said Hamed Karzai, foreign policy adviser to the president of a fractious Afghan rebel coalition supported by the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. "Now we have to concentrate on how to solve the bigger problems of Afghanistan."
"Afghanistan is so divided and there are still so many hands in the Afghan issue that the country may lose itself to its divisions," said Mr. Karzai, who is in Washington on what he described as "a strictly private visit."
Afghan rebels, quarreling among themselves, are united in their unwillingness to include President Najibullah, a ruthless head of the Afghan secret police who rode to power on a Soviet tank, in talks about a future government.
Among the Afghan rebels, there is a fear that the Najibullah Government, having lost Russian aid, will be supported by governments in neighboring Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where secular leftist leaders would be concerned that Islamic rule in Kabul would encourage Muslim fundamentalist movements within their borders.
 
Threat to the Secular
 "They would support Kabul not out of love for Najib," Mr. Karzai said, "but because a resistance government in Afghanistan would be seen as a threat to their secular social structure."
He said such considerations could outweigh the common ethnicity of Tajiks or other groups whose culture links Afghanistan to Central Asia.
Barnett G. Rubin of Columbia University, writing in a memorandum to be delivered at the Carter Center for policy studies at Emory University this month, said: "Today the war in Afghanistan is not solely or even mainly about who is to govern Kabul and under what rules of the game. It is about the nature of the state of Afghanistan itself."
"As much as, if not more than, the former Soviet Union, Afghanistan is threatened with economic collapse and ethnic and sectarian conflict," Mr. Rubin said. "Combined with the coming crisis of the international state system in Central Asia and the escalation of tensions between nuclear-armed adversaries on the Indian Subcontinent, Afghanistan threatens to become part of a regionwide challenge to world peace."
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan told reporters in Islamabad that his Government was not bound by the Washington-Moscow agreement. The Pakistani military and its Inter-services Intelligence agency are known to have a continuing interest in Afghanistan, which many consider a jumping-off place for influence in Central Asia.
A Bush Administration official said that it is not likely that Pakistan can do much on its own to continue a war in Afghanistan so long as it has to devote most of its resources to defense against India. In addition, the United States cut off all military aid to Pakistan in the fall of 1990. The official discounted reports that American weapons were being delivered to the Afghan rebels via Saudi Arabia.
Administration officials also do not believe that India, which has been a strong supporter of President Najibullah, would be willing to back him militarily at a time when New Delhi, having lost its Soviet alliance, is seeking friends in the West.

HEADLINE: ROSLYN HARBOR JOURNAL;
Spy's Library Holds Many Volumes but No Secrets

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROSLYN HARBOR, L.I.

 BODY:
"WHAT secrets have you learned?" is usually the first question Henry L. Grant is asked when he is introduced as curator of the personal library of William J. Casey, the former Director of Central Intelligence.
"But I have to tell them there aren't any juicy documents lying around," Mr. Grant said. "The C.I.A. made sure of that long ago." 
 The library is part of the late Mr. Casey's 133-year-old Victorian estate, Mayknoll, overlooking Roslyn Harbor on the North Shore of Long Island. Its 10,000 volumes include a vast collection of books on espionage, a subject that seems to emerge from every nook and cranny.
"These are not the kind of books you would pick up and read lightly," said Mr. Grant, a 72-year-old former member of the Central Intelligence Agency and a specialist in library and information sciences. "This is all heavyweight stuff. There's very little gumshoe or other fiction here."
"Mr. Casey was very interested in the history of subversion, terrorism, abduction and economic warfare," Mr. Grant said. "In addition to espionage and war, there are also the special areas of Judaica, Christianity, archeology and biography."
Mr. Grant said he had spent the last three and a half years sorting and cataloguing the collection and entering the data into a computer catalogue program, making it available for the first time to the public for scholarly research. He said that the Hoover Institute of War and Peace at Stanford University was seeking to add the Casey library to its collection, but that Mr. Casey's widow, Sophia, was holding on to it.
Mrs. Casey, carrying a silver tray with a crystal decanter and glasses, welcomed visitors with a warm smile. "Have some sherry," she said. "It's cold outside."
"We get a strong wind off the bay, winter and summer," she said, glancing out one of the many windows that surround the library, once a porch extending across the back of the house, which she said was built in 1858.
Mrs. Casey said that both she and her husband had grown up on Long Island, married in 1941 and lived in the house for 40 years.
"This was Tory country, an old English area," she said. She recalled that her husband had written an extensive history of the Revolutionary War. "There once were many spies in this area who would make runs back and forth to Brooklyn," she said.
"George Washington was his own intelligencer," Mr. Grant added. "He was the guy who masterminded the intelligence system that we had then. But it wasn't until Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Donovan during World War II that the United States really got interested in a formal intelligence network."
Mr. Casey was sent by Mr. Donovan, a former Roosevelt aide in Albany, to England to start an intelligence office in London. Mr. Casey, a graduate of Fordham University and St. John's University Law School, was successful at a variety of business ventures. He contributed heavily to the Republican Party and was rewarded by President Richard M. Nixon with appointments as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and president of the Export-Import Bank.
After serving as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan, Mr. Casey headed the Central Intelligence Agency for six years.
His C.I.A. tenure ranged through the United States aid program to the Mujahedin resistance in Afghanistan, the Solidarity movement in Poland and the Iran-contra affair. The affair raised the key question of whether a White House aide, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North of the Marine Corps, acted alone or with Mr. Casey's implied or direct consent in financing covert operations in Central America through the sale of arms to Iran. Mr. Casey's death at the height of the controversy in 1986 left the question unanswered.
Mrs. Casey, who is 78, sat in her husband's Cabinet chair from the White House, ran her fingers over its brown leather. "If you've lived history, you're very alert to history," she said. "Bill loved history as much as he loved coordinating intelligence, especially the analytical side of it."

HEADLINE: 2 Charities for Poor Children Battle Over a Name

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
Usually occupied with helping the world's poorest children, a Connecticut-based charity has recently become embroiled in a nettlesome legal and public-relations battle over its own name.
Save the Children, a 60-year-old nonprofit organization with headquarters here, has become more than a little upset over a newer, increasingly well-financed group also dedicated to aiding impoverished children. To defend its trademarked name and stave off what some organization officials say is an intentional effort to create public confusion about the two groups, Save the Children has sued the newer charity, Feed the Children, which is based in Oklahoma City, charging trademark infringement. 
 "We have objected to their use of 'Feed the Children' as confusing because we have gotten calls and letters about 'our TV ads' that weren't ours," said James Bausch, the president of Save the Children. "People said that they didn't look like the old Save the Children ads, suggesting that they were more exploitative and wondering why they were very religiously oriented."
But the Rev. Larry Jones, who founded Feed the Children in 1979 as part of the Larry Jones International Ministries, said that words like "feed" and "children" cannot be trademarked, and his organization's name merely states the obvious.
"We started by bringing surplus American grain to Haiti and then Africa, where we saw tremendous poverty and children suffering," said the 51-year-old minister, whose televised sermons are nationally broadcast. "As people called, wanting to give us food for children, we gave what we were doing a name."
Although each organization professes admiration for the other's work, the battle has cultural and economic undertones. Save the Children embodies a New Deal-era philosophy of secular charity, while Feed the Children is very much a part of the upsurge in Christian fundamentalism of the 1970's and 1980's.
In addition, at a time when philanthropic dollars have been declining, Feed the Children has attracted financial support that might otherwise have gone to Save the Children, its organizers say.
Feed the Children began to attract the attention of Save the Children several years ago. Responding to the older organization's objections, Mr. Jones applied in 1987 to the United States Patent and Trademark Office for legal registration of his charity's name. In the fall of 1990, the agency's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied the trademark, but Mr. Jones's group continued to call itself Feed the Children in its ads and other fund-raising appeals.
Save the Children filed a trademark lawsuit last summer and a motion for summary judgment in late December, said Matthew A. Landy, the organization's corporate secretary and an executive vice president. The suit demands that Feed the Children change its name and destroy all ads and printed material using the name.
Mr. Landy noted that Feed the Children has not only been using "remarkably similar" television ads and a similar logo -- of a child with outstretched arms -- but also showed up in nearby Bridgeport several weeks ago with 80,000 pounds of food to be distributed and an ample supply of press releases.
"At the same time that Larry Jones's attorneys were directed by the court to meet with our attorneys, he was holding a press conference beside two of his tractor-trailers," Mr. Landy said. "He claims that the timing and the selection of Bridgeport -- on our back door -- were coincidental."
In a Nov. 13 letter to Mr. Landy that was distributed at the news conference, Mr. Jones said: "It is extremely disappointing and frustrating that you and Mr. Bausch approach this matter as though it is McDonald's versus Hardee's rather than two organizations seeking to help needy children. To look at Feed the Children as 'competition' for the charity dollar rather than as an ally in an extraordinarily important and difficult battle is both cynical and callous." The letter also said both groups "should get back to serving children rather than paying lawyers."
Mr. Landy characterized the letter as "self-serving." He added, "We don't want to spend money on lawyers, and we don't have public relations firms working for us," referring to the fact that Mr. Jones has retained a former Congressman, Toby Moffett, who now works for the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton.
Mr. Landry said that in November, during their only face-to-face meeting, Mr. Jones refused to consider using another name that his ministry employs -- "Touch a Child" -- or even "Feed a Child."
 
New Group Grows Faster
 Feed the Children has been growing far more rapidly than Save the Children in recent years. In 1990, The Nonprofit Times, a monthly trade journal, ranked Save the Children as America's 34th largest charity and Feed the Children as the 41st. Although its 1991 rankings have not yet been compiled, information provided by the two charities indicates that Feed the Children surpassed the older charity in 1991.
In the 1991 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, Save the Children had a budget of $97.5 million, Mr. Bausch said. Feed the Children, which has the same fiscal year, received $86.3 million worth of food and other gifts in kind and $25.7 million in cash, Mr. Jones said.
The charities differ considerably in their missions. Save the Children combines long-term community assistance and child-sponsorship with immediate relief, with programs in 20 states and 37 other countries. Feed the Children principally provides short-term food assistance, particularly after disasters, operating throughout the United States and about 30 other countries.
Save the Children spends 84.1 percent on direct relief, while Feed the Children devotes 79.1 percent to direct relief and 12.1 percent to "ministry and education." For both, the remaining money goes for administration and fund-raising.
Both sides say their main concern is helping children.
"We don't want to do anything to harm Feed the Children, and we don't want it to look like a fight when we should be concentrating on children," Mr. Bausch said. "There's unfortunately more than enough need out there to go around."
 
Do TV Ads Aid Both?
 Mr. Jones also said that he has been "very complimentary of Save the Children's work," but added: "You would think that our television programs would elevate support for all children's causes."
Asserting that he remains baffled by Save the Children's lawsuit, Mr. Jones nonetheless speculated that "there could be some animosity since I'm from the Midwest, I'm a Christian minister and we're one of the fastest-growing charities in the country."
Save the Children officials dispute Mr. Jones's suggestions that they are rivals and that the Connecticut charity is having trouble raising money, but Mr. Landy said that "the confusion absolutely has siphoned money away from us."
Mr. Bausch added: "Over the years other organizations with names like Help Our Children or Feed Our Children have agreed to change their names, but Larry Jones has been unwilling to work things out. It's not a semantic issue. People should be clear what organization they are giving to."
With the courts thus far siding with Save the Children, Mr. Jones grudgingly recognizes that his charity may have to relinquish its name.
"Either way we go -- to find another name they would agree with, or a court battle -- we're in a no-win situation," he said. "I've spent 12 years getting people familiar with our name, and with a change we'd lose that name recognition. People would ask why we did it, and it would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."

An Uncertain Outlook For Dollar's Rebound

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
As the new year begins, the dollar is falling, just like last year. But analysts are not soon expecting a sudden and sharp rebound of the sort that occurred at the beginning of 1991. In fact, some forecasts show the dollar falling to record lows against the German mark before it makes a modest recovery late in the year.
The latest jolt to the sagging dollar came the week before Christmas, when the Bundesbank raised German interest rates sharply and the Federal Reserve cut American interest rates sharply a day later. By the end of the year, the dollar had lost almost all the ground it had gained against the mark and other European currencies in 1991 and had fallen against the yen as well. 
 The chance of new lows combined with the possibility of a subsequent rally could make the year difficult for American business, especially exporters or companies that have significant operations abroad. As long as the dollar is falling or remains low, they are in great shape, because their foreign profits are worth more in dollars. But they will have to scramble to protect profits from abroad by hedging if the dollar suddenly turns higher. And a turn in the dollar may not be nearly as easy to read this year as it was last year.
 
Layers of Protection
 "We are looking at the effects if the dollar were to turn around," said Peter M. Donahower, assistant treasurer at Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino, Calif. "We are laying in levels of protection using options in case the general market expectation is wrong."
He said that regardless of his view, which is that the dollar will continue to be weak until there is a clear sign of an American economic recovery, "We will take hedging action.
"The view would determine how much and how far we would go out on the economic horizon," he said, "and how closely we would watch it."
Last year analysts pinpointed the turn in the dollar fairly quickly, though the reverse last February probably came a lot sooner than many had expected. But they were generally fooled by the sharpness and speed of the dollar's increase -- up 23 percent against the German mark by July 2. They were a little less stunned by its sudden plunge at year-end, when the hope for economic recovery in the United States evaporated. The dollar ended 1991 at 1.5170 marks, up only 1.68 percent and showed similar increases against other European currencies.
Against the Japanese yen, the story was the reverse. In all the flurry of the dollar rally and the dust following its sudden fall, the yen quietly gained on the American currency. The dollar ended the year at its low of 124.78 yen, down 7.84 percent, even after the Japanese cut their discount rate on Monday.
 
Two Big Factors
 This year, two main forces will tug at the dollar, the same two as last year. Economic recovery, which would help the dollar, has yet to materialize. Nor is there any potential spark, like the victory in the Persian Gulf war last year, to set off the rally.
The sighting of a sure recovery should give the dollar some strength. A recovery would mean an end to falling interest rates. And it would attract foreign investment in the stock market and elsewhere to take advantage of the rebound, also giving the dollar a boost. Of course, to the extent that the economy of Japan strengthens, that would support the yen.
The force working against the dollar is the higher interest rates in other countries. That favors European currencies now and gives a smaller edge to the yen. Short-term interest rates in Germany are currently 538 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than in the United States. In Japan, the differential is 138 basis points. These differentials drain money out of the dollar into these higher-earning currencies.
"The interest rate argument favors the European currencies," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York. "The United States will ease more, and so will the Japanese. But in Europe, they cannot ease until the Germans are ready. But the economic-performance arguments tilt either in favor of the United States or Japan. These variables frame the values next year."
Mr. Soss said the increase in interest rates by the Bundesbank and the cut by the Fed had just strengthened the two forces pulling on the dollar, leaving its fate still unresolved.
"It re-emphasizes the themes," Mr. Soss said. "The American economy is more likely to pick up sooner, and the interest-rate differential is even more favorable to the European currencies than it was before."
John Lipsky, director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers in London, said the key for dollar forecasters is to decide "whether the United States economy faces some serious structural problems that will push it into a new decline or whether the traditional tools of monetary and fiscal policy will ultimately restore growth in the relatively near future, albeit it at a modest pace."
Salomon's position, he said, is that the traditional tools will work and that there will be a moderate recovery that will give the dollar a lift, possibly pushing it back into the 1.60 range against the mark by the end of the year.

Investors' Hopes Overseas Shaded by Doubt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The professionals who spend their time pondering foreign stock markets say that on balance they are optimistic about 1992.
But their optimism, bolstered by an end-of-the-year rally, is tempered by the underlying economic outlook, especially uncertainity about a global recovery. This makes 1992 harder to call than 1991, despite the threat of the war at the beginning of last year. 
 Some analysts predict returns on equities this year of 20 to 25 percent worldwide, better than 1991, when the gain was 16.53 percent in dollar terms after a sharp decline in 1990. But the 1991 performance was achieved only with a surge in the final week and a record-setting rally in the United States. As a whole, the Financial Times index for all world markets ended at its high for the year because of the American rally. But many leading markets still finished below their 1991 highs. Without the rally, the year would have been little more than half as good.
 
A Rally Late in the Year
 The fourth quarter began with a sharp decline. But the year-end rally turned that into a 3.72 percent rise in the index, in dollar terms. But much of this gain was from a slumping dollar. In local currencies, the index was virtually unchanged. In 1990, the index fell by more than 19 percent.
The reasons for optimism in 1992 include expectations of falling interest rates, a continuing decline in inflation and relatively attractive values in many stock markets, in part because of projections of higher earnings. But these forecasts all include ifs. The economic recovery in the United States, which is important for stock markets worldwide, is in doubt, despite the sharp interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Dec. 20. So is the recovery in Britain.
Economies elsewhere are slowing. While short-term interest rates have fallen sharply in the United States, Britain and Japan, which cut its discount rate on Monday, the Bundesbank raised German interest rates another half a percentage point the day before the Fed acted, confirming that rates in Europe will not soon fall. France, Spain and Italy have all followed with interest rate increases, and Britain may have to follow, too, despite an approaching election. Earnings estimates are falling rapidly. And the remaking of what was the Soviet Union offers plenty of opportunities for developments that may disturb world markets.
This uncertainty behind the optimistic forecasts is leading some brokerage firms and money managers to hedge or even trim their bets on equities by putting more money into bonds, especially in Europe, where there is the best chance for a bond rally next year.
For Americans there is another possible negative: the dollar. It fell sharply at the end of the year and could rally this year if the positive forecasts are right and the American economy rebounds. But a rally would cut into capital gains from abroad when they are translated back into dollars.
Guy Rigden of UBS Phillips & Drew in London has a well-hedged, optimistic view for 1992. When told that his optimism sounded a little pessimistic, he turned to Charles Dickens's "Tale of Two Cities" to underline his sentiment. "It was the spring of hope; it was the winter of despair," he read.
He then expressed his view in his own words. "You have to have a central case of assumptions, but that central case is more uncertain than it is normally," he said.
Because of the uncertainty, Mr. Rigden has just revised his recommendations for client portfolios, shifting money from equities to bonds. He has moved to a 50 percent investment in equities, below his normal or neutral level, from 65 percent. And he has jumped to an aggressive 40 percent in bonds, from 25 percent, with the remaining 10 percent in cash.
"I would rather get, with a pretty high degree of confidence, the 15 percent in bonds than the 20 to 25 percent in equities, with all the uncertainty," he said.
One of the uncertainties, he said, is corporate profits. While he expects them to grow this year, he acknowledges that forecasters have gotten profit forecasts wrong the last two years.
Lawrence W. Harris 3d, a director of Lombard Odier International, a fund manager in London, said declining inflation and falling interest rates would give equities a lift this year. He also argued that falling short-term and long-term interest rates would provide stock markets a sort of safety net, because there would be fewer attractive alternatives for investors as the return on fixed-income investments continues to drop.
 
Views Expected to Change
 "Sometime during the year people are going to think that things are good rather than bad," he said. "And then, at some point, stocks should kick in because there is so little competition to stocks these days, especially as long-term interest rates begin to fall."
But Mr. Harris is still placing his biggest bets in bonds; his funds are aggressively buying long-term bonds outside the United States. "I think in most cases that the long bond will do better than the stock market in whatever country you are talking about," he said.
The December rise in German interest rates makes this forecast even more likely. The rate increase should signal that rates have reached their peak and also further curb inflation in Europe by slowing growth. Both factors are good for bond markets.
Richard H. King, the manager of Counsellors International Equity Fund in New York, holds another view. This is the time for investors to switch from bonds to equities, he said, but he adds a note of caution. "Because we are coming from a recession, I think that 1992 is going to be a better year," he said. "But it is going to be a bumpy year."
Once one decides to invest in stocks abroad, the question is what country and stocks to choose, a matter of much debate and uncertainty. In Europe, the biggest question is whether to buy German stocks.
Mr. Rigden says yes, arguing that the German market is a good two-way bet. The stock market should rise, he said, if economic growth is slow next year, because interest rates will finally be cut and inflation will fall. But if growth continues, stocks should be helped by rising earnings and dividends.
 
Doubts About the Germans
 But Goldman, Sachs expects the German market to be a below-average performer in Europe because its stocks are still overpriced and because inflation will be high this year, with growth slowing.
The Japanese market is another tough question. Many firms take a neutral or negative view. Michael Howell, chief strategist for Salomon Brothers in London, said a recent survey indicated that equity managers in Tokyo did not expect the stock market to be higher a year from now. But Mr. King said that the decline in the market since 1990 had made it more attractive and that it should get some impetus from Japanese interest-rate cuts, like the one announced this week, that are expected as the economy slows.
As for the year that just ended, it began well for stock markets, soured in the fall and then ended with a rally. The United States and Hong Kong ended at new highs. But other record-breakers, like Britain, did not regain their lofty peaks by the end of the year. The threat of the Persian Gulf war, which drove markets down at the end of 1990 and the first two weeks of 1991, was turned to the impetus for a rally at the beginning of the year when the United States and its allies swept the Iraqi forces aside.
 
Exchange Rate Gains
 But markets slumped when the economic recovery in the United States fizzled and interest rates remained high in Europe. Without a 6.91 percent rise in dollar terms in December -- with half of that rally in the United States -- world markets would have been down for the last three months of the year.
For all of 1991, Mexico led the Financial Times index of 24 markets for the fourth consecutive year, as the Mexican market continued to ride the crest of the country's economic reforms. In dollar terms, the market was up 138.03 percent.
Hong Kong was No. 2, rising 44.79 percent on real estate gains and better relations with China. The worst performers were Finland, down 24.35 percent after being shaken by the loss of business with the Soviet Union; Austria, down 15.31 percent, and Norway, down 12.47 percent. The Norwegian market was hit by a banking crisis.
 
Where the U.S. Is Tops
 Among the large markets, the United States was tops, rising 27.44 percent. Japan was almost unchanged in 1991 in terms of the yen, but grew 8.86 percent in dollar terms, because of the decline of the dollar against the yen.
In Europe, the sharp dollar rally early in the year cut deeply into returns. But the fall at year-end eased that pain, more than doubling some of the gains in dollar terms in the last two weeks of the year. France, the second-best performer of the leading markets, was up 14.81 percent in dollars at year-end, compared with a rise of 5.3 percent on Dec. 13. Germany, the third-worst performer of the major markets, was up 4.84 percent in dollars, compared with a slight fall of 0.77 percent on Dec. 13.
Of the large markets, the Italians brought up the rear. Plagued by strikes that temporarily closed the Milan market, financial scandals, delays in settling trades, and the drag of a weak economy and faltering earnings, the market fell 3.72 percent in dollar terms and 1.97 percent in lire.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Delighted At Holiday Success. But Relaxed? No.

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 1

 BODY:
The movie world opened the new year in a giddy but nervous mood.
After a tepid economic year in Hollywood, such films as "Hook," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Father of the Bride" did strong business over the holidays in a time of recession. And many movie executives, vacationing in such places as Aspen, Colo.; Sun Valley, Idaho, and Maui, Hawaii, read their daily faxes of box office returns and proclaimed business better than ever. 
 But other film makers were less sanguine. "I don't see many blessings here," said Lili Fini Zanuck, director of the new film "Rush," about two undercover narcotics agents who turn into lawbreakers, and best known for producing the movie "Driving Miss Daisy" with her husband, Richard D. Zanuck.
Ms. Zanuck, speaking from her home in Sun Valley, said: "The real family-oriented pictures are doing incredible business, but the adult films, "Bugsy" and "J. F. K.," are not doing that kind of business. So there'll be pressure now on those of us who make adult films to come up with these same kinds of family movies. Including animated movies. Frankly, it's very difficult to make certain kinds of adult movies now, movies that were successful in the past, movies like 'Midnight Cowboy,' 'Serpico.' "
Even a traditionally optimistic executive like Mark Canton, head of Columbia Pictures, expressed some uncertainty about the box office over the holidays, one of the year's busiest times for moviegoing. "We're ending the year on an upbeat note," he said in an interview from Maui. "But I think the big news of last year is that the realities of the recession have begun to sink in and are still sinking in."
 
Finding Reasons
 The relatively poor year at the box office, he said, resulted from many factors, including the nation's weak economy, news events, including the Persian Gulf war, the collapse of the Soviet system and the Clarence Thomas hearings, all of which tended to keep people at home watching television, as well as the impoverished state of movies. "Maybe there just weren't enough good movies to attract people," Mr. Canton said. His comment was echoed by other executives.
It is still too early to predict the financial success or failure of any of the films that opened over the last two weeks. The producers of some smaller films took major risks in opening their movies amid powerful competition, risks that were made in order to qualify the movies for this year's Academy Awards. These smaller films include "Rush"; "Fried Green Tomatoes," a comedy-drama about a group of Southern women with Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy; "The Inner Circle," partly based on a true story about Stalin's loyal film projectionist, portrayed by Tom Hulce; Lawrence Kasdan's drama "Grand Canyon," about race relations, midlife crisis and the randomness of life in Los Angeles, and David Cronenberg's "Naked Lunch," based on the novel about drugs, creativity and hallucination by William S. Burroughs.
It is, however, the expensive and lavishly publicized movies that have drawn the most attention and uncertainty. The Steven Spielberg extravaganza about Peter Pan, "Hook," which opened to mixed reviews, held the No. 1 position for the third week and has been performing with resilience at the box office. To executives at Sony Pictures, the parent company of Tri-Star, which produced "Hook," the box office results have been welcome, especially after the expensive movie proved disappointing at the box office when it opened.
 
The Palliative Effect
 "Look, this business depends on people picking themselves up out of their couch, putting fuel in their tanks, loading up the vehicle, parking and putting themselves in seats with 600 other people to share a communal experience," said Peter Guber, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, speaking from his home in Aspen. "Movies basically have an allure that staying at home with a frozen chicken dinner and a video can't achieve. While entertainment isn't a panacea for problems, it certainly has a palliative effect. And this holiday season shows that."
A bleaker view was expressed by Marshall Brickman, a well-known screenwriter whose most recent credit was "For the Boys." Mr. Brickman, still upset about the failure of this holiday movie, said with a laugh that he was planning to write a prequel to it starring Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky and to call it "For the Goys."
"Why are people going to the movies?" he said. "It's probably the pre-crash panic. The kids are home. It's the holidays. I don't know many families who like to sit at home and discuss philosophy and art with their children. And if they can afford it, most American parents would prefer to take kids to a hypnotic experience based on the regurgitation of television."
Over the weekend, "Hook" took in $15.2 million, and its total gross earnings as of Tuesday were a formidable $65 million, Sony executives say. But whether the film will earn enough to repay the studio is another matter. Although the movie cost $60 million to $80 million, large percentages of the grosses go to Mr. Spielberg as well as to the three stars, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts.
 
The Biggest Success
 Perhaps the biggest success of the holiday season is the Walt Disney Company's musical animated film "Beauty and the Beast," which has grossed about $69 million as of Tuesday, film industry executives say. Because of holiday vacations, the movie had a striking leap in business last week, 119 percent over the previous week. Another Disney film, the remake of the M-G-M classic "Father of the Bride," was the third-highest grossing film for the weekend, earning $10.5 million over weekend and bringing its gross after less than two weeks to about $29.5 million. This is a surprisingly strong showing for the frothy comedy, which stars Steve Martin and Diane Keaton, because it got uneven if respectable reviews.
"You have a movie here where people walk out and feel everything's all right with the world, at least for the moment," said Howard Rosenman, co-president of Sandollar Motion Pictures and one of the producers of "Father of the Bride." He added: "The economy isn't good, the world is changing, there's AIDS, the homeless, terrible problems -- and you give the audience something reassuring and funny about a neurotic but not dysfunctional family. It'll work."
Others films that seem to be performing strongly are Barbra Streisand's "Prince of Tides," about a Southern teacher (Nick Nolte) who goes to New York to help his sister after she tries to kill herself, which came in No. 4 at the box office; "The Last Boy Scout," a Bruce Willis shoot-'em-up, which was No. 5, and "Star Trek VI," which came in seventh, after Oliver Stone's "J. F. K.," said Exhibitor Relations Inc., which monitors film releases for theater chains.
 
Some Disappointment
 What has surprised some film executives is that the extraordinarily publicized and controversial "J. F. K.," a revisionist version of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, is so far not doing quite the blockbuster business that the studio, Warner Brothers, expected. Industry executives said the movie had grossed about $21 million.
And the same mild if early disappointment is true to a degree for Barry Levinson's "Bugsy," starring Warren Beatty as the offbeat gangster who dreamed of turning Las Vegas into a mecca of gambling and entertainment. "Bugsy" has received some of the best newspaper and magazine reviews of the year, has already picked up several awards and is a probable prime contender for several major Academy Awards. Executives expect the film to start pulling in business over the next few weeks, especially after positive word-of-mouth reaction from audiences. "Bugsy" had grossed about $17.5 million as of Tuesday.
Mr. Guber said, "You can't attack every picture like 'Hook.' 'Bugsy' is a mature-audience film. It requires strong critical acclaim. This is a real film, not a movie. It requires audiences to become aware of its value and importance. That's what's happening."

HEADLINE: Kurt Masur in Leipzig: A Favorite Son at Home

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany, Dec. 28

 BODY:
His towering frame draped in baggy brown slacks and a gray shirt opened at the collar and not tucked in, Kurt Masur raised his arms and the Gewandhaus Orchestra stirred to life as though its genial music director had never been away.
It was his third visit to Leipzig, where he remains Kapellmeister, since assuming the directorship of the New York Philharmonic in September. At the end of his 10 days here, he will have conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony three times, including on New Year's Eve, extending a tradition begun in December 1918 by a predecessor here, Arthur Nikisch, in the dark aftermath of World War I. 
 "Grossartig" -- "Great" -- he murmured, flashing a thumbs-up sign as the music faded.
Leipzig is proud of the son who made it to the new world. For his part, Mr. Masur is still the same, kibitzing with soloists, harrumphing at the choir, throwing himself into the orchestra work as though he had never left.
Since he left Leipzig in the summer a lot has changed. Leipzig is afflicted with a million problems: crushing unemployment; wrenching debate about just who did and who did not collaborate with the old communist secret police, the Stasi, youthful disaffection. While he rehearsed in the empty craggy auditorium, knots of students huddled about campfires by the Gewandhaus, protesting the closure of a radio station for young people. But the musicians who rose to welcome him appeared glad to have him back if even for only a fleeting visit.
More than anything, Mr. Masur's return to conduct Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with its triumphal "Ode to Joy" climax seemed nothing if not an act of solidarity by a local son returning home with a much-needed message of hope.
"People are behaving maturely; hope is rising," he said, wiping his brow during a pause in the rehearsal. "Some, especially the unemployed, are in a bad situation." Those over 50, he said, were particularly hard hit, because in the primitive economy of what was East Germany, they had grown "unable to come into the computer age."
With Mr. Masur was his wife, the soprano Tomoko Sakurai; their 12-year-old son, Ken David, and a daughter, Carolin, from a previous marriage. Mr. Masur announced proudly that the family had just found quarters in Westchester County. "From February on we will have a home in New York," he said. But Christmas Eve, as in years past, was spent with family at the conductor's comfortable home on the edge of Leipzig, with its large garden and swimming pool, now covered for the winter.
Christmas Day the family went to hear Carolin, a singer with the Leipzig Opera, perform Hansel in Humperdinck's "Hansel und Gretel."
At the Gewandhaus, the conductor interrupted the musicians again and again, fine-tuning difficult transitions. The orchestra was breaking in new flute and bassoon soloists, he explained, but more importantly, "All the well-known pieces are in danger, if you don't work at them."
 
Source of Pride: No Defectors
 The 64-year-old conductor said he found his musicians in good spirits despite Leipzig's travails. None have defected to more lucrative jobs in western Germany, he said proudly, despite wage scales limiting earnings to about two-thirds of those in western German cities like Munich and Hamburg. His goal, he said, is to obtain equal pay and working conditions by 1993, in time to celebrate the Gewandhaus's 250th anniversary a year later.
Leading a visitor to his spacious office, Mr. Masur indicated the deep emotional links that tie him to the orchestra, which he has led since 1970. The walls of a foyer are hung with portraits of distinguished predecessors like Felix Mendelssohn and Wilhelm Furtwangler. He attributed the orchestra's "steadiness" to Mendelssohn, who founded the Leipzig Conservatory about 150 years ago, thereby creating the school that still supplies roughly 85 percent of the Gewandhaus musicians.
"That is not to say there is no competition," he said. "But what matters is that here, the principal goal of the students is simply to play in the Gewandhaus Orchestra." This was different in New York, he said, where, "normally, every musician's ambition is to be a new Isaac Stern."
The portrait of Vaclav Neumann, the Czechoslovak conductor who was Mr. Masur's immediate predecessor, seemed to bear witness to recent troubled times. In 1968, when East German troops joined Soviet units in crushing Czechoslovakia's brief Prague Spring, Mr. Neumann refused to conduct any more concerts in Leipzig and was replaced by Mr. Masur. In 1989, when protesters toppled the Communist regimes in both countries, the two men played key roles in the push for democracy.
In Leipzig, the revolution has been followed by bitter debate about those who collaborated with the old Communist secret police, the Stasi. The issue threatens to divide eastern Germans anew in January, when all citizens will obtain the right to examine their old Stasi files. Already, one orchestra member has resigned after confessing to being a Stasi agent, Mr. Masur said.
Chiding East Germans for their sluggishness in coming to terms with the past, Mr. Masur said that while West Germans generally overdid their discussions of East Germany's past crimes, "people here are in danger of not doing enough." He said the process was complicated by the spreading of scandals.
This was a reference to the newspaper reports that circulated here last year reviving discussion of a 1972 automobile accident in which three people, including Mr. Masur's former wife, lost their lives. The Communist authorities intervened to prevent an investigation of Mr. Masur's responsibility. But Leipzigers, recalling the conductor's leading role in the uprising that overthrew the Communists, appear to have laid the reports to rest.
 
Donations Instead of Subsidies
 The orchestra's most pressing problem, he said, is not political but financial, because of a collapsing economy. To offset cuts in state subsidies, he added, the orchestra would have to learn the unaccustomed American art of aggressively seeking private donors and commercial sponsors.
"We have to be careful and face the fact that the new provinces of Germany will not be able to pay for the upkeep of leading orchestras like the Gewandhaus or the Staatskapelle in Dresden," he said.
Even so, he added, he found "no disturbed mood" among the musicians, who he said were in "very good spirits, unchanged, doing what we have always done, trying to achieve artistic excellence."

HEADLINE: SALVADOR ACCORD AIMS AT QUICK END TO LONG CIVIL WAR

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 1

 BODY:
The peace agreement reached early this morning by the Government of El Salvador and its guerrilla enemies will bring an almost immediate halt to their fighting and a final end to the 12 years of civil war there by autumn, rebel and Government officials said.
Diplomats said that the accord, wrapped up by Javier Perez de Cuellar in the final moments of his term as Secretary General of the United Nations, contains a number of points that have yet to be resolved, including details of the dismantling of the rebels' military structure and a comprehensive schedule for putting its various provisions into effect.
 
Signing Set for Jan. 16
 Although the two sides have negotiated other incomplete agreements in the past, this time they devised a guarantee to back their categorical promise that a formal cease-fire would go into effect on Feb. 1. The guarantee provides that if they fail to settle their remaining differences by Jan. 10, the United Nations would have the power to decide them. In either case, they said, "final agreements of peace" will be signed in Mexico City on Jan. 16. 
 "This signing constitutes the beginning of a new era of rebuilding toward democracy and freedom," President Alfredo Cristiani said after his negotiators put their signatures to the two-page preamble summarizing the treaty. "Thanks to God, everything has come out well."
One of the five top rebel commanders, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, added, "The war in El Salvador is over."
 
Resistance From the Right?
 It would be typical of this conflict, which has claimed more than 75,000 lives, if such optimism is soon met by the outrage of militant rightists who have little interest in the sweeping political changes that the agreement would bring about.
On the left, there appeared to be little room to criticize the rebels' gains. In return, essentially, for laying down their arms without a claim to power, they won agreement to changes that will reduce the size and political role of the armed forces, alter the Government's conservative social and economic policies and provide the rebels with full political freedoms after a cease-fire.
But even in the final weeks of contentious haggling over details, these peace talks have been sustained by a strong conviction on both sides that the militants have been isolated as never before.
Under intense international pressure, the two sides continued working on the details of the treaty until the year-end deadline they had set was virtually upon them. But following an emotional signing ceremony that began just after midnight, they sought only to make the point that it had been the suffering of ordinary Salvadorans that forced them to an end.
Tuesday afternoon, diplomats involved in the talks said they nearly foundered once again in a dispute over land redistribution. With Mr. Perez de Cuellar minutes away from his scheduled departure for the Bahamas on his first vacation as former Secretary General, Mr. Cristiani also threatened to leave if no progress was made, the diplomats said.
In the end, Mr. Perez de Cuellar stayed, urging diplomats from Spain, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico to put pressure on some of the chief rebel negotiators. The United States Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Bernard W. Aronson, and the chief American representative to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, made similar efforts with delegates of the Government. Officials said the rebel position softened and a compromise was worked out to have a special commission review contested land claims in rebel-held zones on a case-by-case basis.
But around the same time of the day, an even more extraordinary meeting took place, diplomats said. For the first time, Mr. Ceren and Joaquin Villalobos, the two most powerful guerrilla commanders, sat down with a third commander to chat with El Salvador's Defense Minister, Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce.
 
Killing of Six Priests
 Like Mr. Villalobos, General Ponce has been the unchallenged leader of his comrades in arms and their most effective strategist. He has been vilified by his enemies as a ruthless killer. Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts, who led a special House panel investigating the killing of six Jesuit priests at San Salvador's Central American University in November 1989, recently accused General Ponce of being present when the slayings were ordered. It was an accusation that General Ponce denied.
Yesterday, however, the commanders spoke not of their pasts but of the future. And they agreed that they should keep in touch when the rebels return to San Salvador, in case problems arise.
It is expected that problems will arise. It is not yet clear how quickly the insurgents will return to political roles, but in an interview this afternoon, one of the five senior guerrilla commanders, Roberto Roca, said that members of the rebel front would try to establish a legal political presence in Salvadoran cities before the demobilization of the rebels is to be completed on Oct. 31.
 
'Open Politics' in 1980
 "We will have to be cautious," he said. "But we did a lot of open politics in 1980, when the situation wasn't anything like it is now. Then, the death squads were in full operation."
It was that bloody response to the liberal junta set up after a coup by reformist officers in October 1979 that drove the left fully underground by late 1980.
In the early 1980's it appeared that a man identified by United States and Salvadoran officials as a leader of the assassination squads, a former National Guard major named Roberto d'Aubuisson, would consolidate a position as the country's most powerful politician. At one point, United States officials said, he hatched an assassination plot against Mr. Pickering, who was then America's Ambassador in San Salvador.
But in 1984, in the second in a series of national elections with which the Reagan Administration tried to create the foundations of democratic institutions, Mr. d'Aubuisson was defeated for the presidency by the Christian Democratic leader, Jose Napoleon Duarte.
Soon after his inauguration, Mr. Duarte announced his intention to meet the rebels for peace talks. The talks quickly foundered, however, as the armed forces came to dominate Mr. Duarte's Government.
As Mr. Duarte's Government became more and more ineffectual, however, the Reagan Administration turned its attentions to the Nationalist Republican Alliance, which Mr. d'Aubuisson had founded as the vehicle for his ambitions.
A year after his 1984 election defeat, Mr. d'Aubuisson sponsored Mr. Cristiani, then a 37-year-old coffee producer who had been one of his proteges, to take leadership, saying the party needed a new image.
 
Rebel Attitude on Election
 For all practical purposes, the rebels backed Mr. Cristiani's successful candidacy for the presidency in 1989 against the Christian Democrats. More hard-line insurgent commanders believed that his election would polarize the country, allowing the rebel front to move into at least part of the political void that Mr. Duarte had left. Rebel moderates argued that if a negotiated settlement was going to be possible, only a rightist Government would have the power to make it.
Even before Mr. Cristiani began pulling his party back from the extreme right and offered to meet the guerrillas for talks, the idea that he could be El Salvador's peacemaker was being widely advanced from a seemingly unlikely source.
At San Salvador's Central American University, a Jesuit institution that educated many of the children of El Salvador's elite but also maintained a dialogue with rebel leaders, the rector, Ignacio Ellacuria, insisted to the guerrilla commanders that they should take Mr. Cristiani seriously.
Like so many other Salvadorans, Father Ellacuria did not live to hear the war silenced. He was one the six priests killed by soldiers as the rebels launched their strongest offensive of the war in November 1989.

Military and Security
Beginning Feb. 1, the warring forces are supposed to begin entering isolation zones, 50 for the 6,000 to 7,000 rebels and 100 for the Salvador Army. The process is to conclude on Oct. 31 with the complete dismantling of the rebels' military apparatus.
 The Government's armed forces are to be cut to less than half its current size, estimated at 53,000. Officers found to have been corrupt or abusive of human rights are to be purged. Military doctrine is to be rewritten and military education and training restructured.
 Rapid-reaction infantry battalions and the National Intelligence Directorate are to be disbanded, along with the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the National Police. A new National Civil Police force is to be created under the control of a public security ministry controlled by civilians. Former guerrillas as well as former members of the National Police will be eligible to serve.
 
Economic and Social Issues
The Government pledged to give away land it owns or purchase land it does not for peasants who now occupy land in rebel-held areas of the country. It will carry out land-reform laws that now provide for the forcible redistribution of holdings in excess of about 600 acres. Social programs will be created to alleviate the effects of economic austerity policies. (pg. A12)

HEADLINE: Overhauling Services: The Long, Painful Process -- A Special Report;
Employment in Service Industry, Impetus to Boom in 80's, Falters

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
For decades, banks, fast-food restaurants, hospitals, law firms, retail chains and governments -- the so-called service sector -- have been the engine that powered the great American job machine. In the 1980's, when services added a stunning 21 million jobs and employed almost four out of five workers, Americans debated whether service jobs were good jobs or bad jobs, but basically took the steady growth of services for granted.
No more. Except for health care, the services are in the throes of a pervasive shake-up very much like the one that racked smokestack manufacturing a decade ago. The concerted drive to squeeze costs and improve profits has resulted in extensive cost-cutting, job freezes, layoffs, consolidations and takeovers. The storm threatens to last much longer than the recession -- prolonged, very likely, by the wave of white-collar layoffs and the unusual reluctance among service companies to hire. 
 Indeed, most economists expect the great American job machine, even after it gets going again, to run at just half speed through much of the 1990's.
The consequences are likely to be felt by many, if not most, Americans for a long time, labor experts say. They expect job growth in the 90's to be the slowest since the 1950's. Pay, including benefits, is expected to rise more sluggishly. Unemployment, now 6.8 percent, is expected to hover above 6 percent for years.
And they predict that job security -- the comfortable expectation of being able to settle down somewhere for life, at least by middle age -- may be gone for good.
 
Lost Security at T.V.A.
 "If you got a job here it was probably one of the highest paid in the valley, it was secure and you could stay until you retired," said Robert M. Nimetz, a tough-minded 50-year-old former draftsman at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Government-owned utility that has cut staff drastically to try to do more with less. "A lot of us whose jobs were contracted out were close to retirement," said Mr. Nimetz, whose last day there was the Friday after Thansgiving.
Yet economists say that what is a traumatic episode for individuals may prove to be the painful but necessary cure for the nation's top economic problems: woeful productivity growth and stagnating living standards. Those problems, economists agree, are firmly rooted in the sprawling service sector and not in manufacturing, where productivity has been growing faster in recent years than in the 1960's. By contrast, output per hour in services has barely grown in 20 years.
Economists say the slump in services productivity (which they concede may be somewhat exaggerated by inadequate statistics) is partly a result of the huge influx of inexperienced workers in the 1970's and 80's. They also say service companies failed to use computers effectively. And finally, they say, the service sector has simply had just too much capacity. If less-efficient companies are forced out of business and more-efficient ones handle growth in volume without adding lots of new hands, productivity could pick up.
If restructuring does manage to kick back into gear the growth of efficiency in services, the way it did in manufacturing, real wages after inflation could eventually rise faster in the second half of the 90's than they have since the late 60's, economists say. If it does not -- and, after all, many corporate turnaround attempts fail -- real per capita incomes would grow even more slowly than in the 80's.
For now, what is clear is that the services are struggling to adapt to an unforgiving economic environment of slower growth and lower inflation. It is a rough process, built on cost-cutting and consolidations, and studded with layoffs and bankruptcies.
"Despite the mildness of the downturn for the overall economy," said Allen Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors, "most service industries suffered more than in previous recessions with regard to hours worked, jobs lost and the duration of the recession for that industry."
 
Professionals Join Unemployed Ranks
 Placement experts who try to match executives with job openings have remarked on the breadth of the cutbacks. "Unlike the early 80's, we're seeing accountants, engineers, lawyers, financial types, people from all across the spectrum," said Charles Albrecht, executive vice president at Drake Beam Morin, describing some of the unemployed people passing through the nation's largest outplacement firm.
Though service company sales have recovered a bit since last spring, hiring has not. And while service payrolls swelled 4.4 percent in the first 12 months of the early 80's recovery, they have barely budged since April. Many industries are, in fact, still trimming. Retailers, for example, are now in their 22d month of job cuts.
What's behind the belt-tightening? The four basic forces, economists and executives say, are:
OVEREXPANSION: In the 80's, the services added a stunning 19 million new jobs, $800 billion worth of new technology, 16,000 new shopping malls and three billion square feet of new office space (nearly as much again as existed in 1980). For Wall Street, retailers, fast-food restaurants and financial services, that added up to too much capacity, much of it in the wrong places.
"Large banks went into every town they wanted to be in," said James J. Preble who recently retired as vice chairman of the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group. "We wound up with a branch for every 2,500 customers. The norm is one branch for every 7,500 customers." Fleet/Norstar, which is based in Providence, R.I., acquired the failed Bank of New England last year. "We'll wind up with fewer banks," Mr. Preble predicted.
RUNAWAY COSTS: Wages and other costs in services, which grew no faster than manufacturing costs in the 60's and 70's, shot to the moon in the 80's. But service companies found they could not absorb these costs through higher productivity, nor could they recoup the higher costs through higher prices. "Service companies were unprepared for the arrival of an environment in which costs could not easily be passed along to consumers," said a commentary by economists at J. P. Morgan & Company.
TECHNOLOGY: From computers to specialized shipping containers, innovation has created opportunities to increase sales without adding labor. But it is only now, when companies are under the gun, that they are really exploiting technology. While much of the hardware did not pay off in the past, managers are now learning to use it. Michael R. Zucchini, executive vice president of Fleet/Norstar, says the potential for consolidating back-office bank operations has barely been tapped.
In retailing, the same headquarters staff can service nearly twice as many stores as a decade ago, in part thanks to point-of-sale computer systems that let marketing managers stay on top of far-flung sales and inventory trends.
Despite their financial squeeze, service company executives hope to take advantage of better technology to get them out of their current bind. The latest Commerce Department survey of capital spending plans shows that service companies, which barely cut back on spending on computers and the like during the recession, plan to increase outlays.
INCREASED COMPETITION: Challenges have come in many guises. Deregulation of airlines, financial services, telecommunications and cable television have opened the door to price cutting, invading of neighbors' markets and wiry new entrants. "Restructuring is largely due to increased competition," said James Brian Quinn, a professor of management at Dartmouth College.
Waiting to take advantage of these circumstances was a horde of hungry low-cost, high-quality, customer-friendly powerhouses like American Airlines, Wal-Mart, State Farm, CNN and Taco Bell. "The big are definitely getting bigger," said Randall E. Gebhardt, a Columbus, Ohio, retail consultant.
Foreign competition has also surged, with strong new global competitors arising in construction, shipping, travel and half a dozen other services. While foreign competition in service industries seems less apparent than in autos and steel and other manufacturing fields, it is there nonetheless.
Some of the competitive pressure from abroad is indirect. It comes via cost-conscious American manufacturers, who spend more on services than they do on labor these days and have to match foreign rivals on price. Many are pressing their suppliers, from ad agencies to electric utilities, to lower their prices and keep a lid on rates.
 
No End in Sight For Retrenchments
 The bind that service companies find themselves in -- and the radical surgery many are undertaking -- is evident at the Tennessee Valley Authority, which one executive called "a bankruptcy waiting to happen." By 1988, after 20 years of rate increases, large customers, including the city of Memphis, were threatening to defect.
T.V.A.'s chairman, Marvin Runyon, a former auto executive who came on the scene in 1988, spent his first three months on the job talking to customers. "They said to me, 'Look, you've got to stop raising the rates. That's going to drive industry and jobs out of the valley. We can't afford that.' " The T.V.A. has since cut 11,000 engineers, construction workers and clerks from its payroll, but it has not raised rates once.
A majority of executives expect the overhaul to continue indefinitely, according to a survey by Wyatt management consultants. One clear spot for cutbacks yet to come is in state and local governments -- public services that account for one-quarter of the service sector. State and local governments actually expanded their payrolls during the recession. But falling revenues will force extensive cuts next year and in 1993.
And even though airlines, retailing and other industries have been cutting for several years already, executives say they still have too much capacity.
"It's clear there will be more and more consolidation," said Stephen E. Watson, president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which added Marshall Field's, a Chicago-based department store chain, to its store chains in 1990.
The services shake-up is exacting a harsh toll. All the layoffs, hiring freezes and cost-cutting in services may be tipping the struggling economy back into recession by squeezing incomes and, more important, unnerving consumers.
"Hiring usually picks up five or six months into a recovery," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "October came and went, the hiring pickup was nowhere in sight, so consumers were hit with the cold reality that the dynamics of past recoveries weren't operative."
 
Slower Job Growth Through the Decade
 Job growth -- even after the economy gets moving again -- could be the slowest since the 50's, according to the latest long-term projection of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although services are still expected to create nearly all the new jobs in the 90's, forecasts call for job growth to be at less than half of the rate of the 80's. That would not reduce unemployment quickly.
"Long term, the changes will be healthy," said Jerry Cosley, a 56-year-old unemployed public relations executive in Overland Park, Kan. "But in the next 10 years, or however long this takes, all of our expectations will be subject to rude shocks. In no way did I expect to be without a job in my mid-50's."
With labor markets looser than in the late 80's, employers are likely to be stingier with pay, said Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company. Raises for service employees have already slowed, on average, to 4 percent in 1991 from 5 percent in 1989. Pay increases have slowed more sharply for civil servants than for white-collar workers as a whole, to 4 percent from 7 percent.
If service companies succeed in becoming leaner and fitter -- and that is a big if -- productivity could rebound, economists say. That would be golden for profits, inflation and, most important, living standards.
If there is little or no improvement, however, the economy would suffer. "Unless service industries perform in a way that adds output without adding workers," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, "real pay will continue to stagnate."
To be sure, many attempts by companies to streamline their operations do not work, often because the companies are in worse shape than anyone realized. Restructuring is also particularly risky in service enterprises where customer satisfaction and sales depend heavily on employee morale. Then, too, competitive pricing is a necessary, but hardly sufficient, condition for success. "Our industry can't make money by holding sales 365 days a year," Mr. Gebhardt, the consultant, said.
Nonetheless, some economists already detect hopeful glimmers. Efficient competitors like Wal-Mart and the Gap are doing well, even in this tough economy. Profit margins for service industries in the aggregate began to improve before the end of recession, something that J.P. Morgan economists say has not happened before. Some companies, even industries, are seeing the benefit of earlier restructuring. Wall Street, which was in the red at the beginning of the year, enjoyed a near record year.
And after two years of declining efficiency, productivity outside manufacturing rose smartly last summer. "The improvement in productivity growth could continue for years," said Mr. Vignola of Kidder, Peabody.
 
The Lowest Paid Are Hardest Hit
 For now, the pain is being felt most by those who are losing their jobs or who are working harder because their fellow workers were dismissed. Hardest hit by restructuring are the young, the low paid, the least educated: clerks, office workers, cleaning, security and food workers.
"This new wave of cost-cutting has had the greatest impact on workers who function in a back-office capacity," Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley said. "That's the assembly line of the American information-based service economy."
While the number of professional and managerial jobs actually rose in the recession, the number of clerical and sales jobs declined by several hundreds of thousands. Unemployment rates among various categories of clerical and sales workers currently range from 5 percent to more than 10 percent, while they tend to be less than 3 percent for managers and professionals.
More important, workers who lose jobs with good pay and benefits may find it impossible to find another job that pays as well.
"At my age, with a daughter in college, it's very frightening," said Clara Lay, a 46-year-old data base librarian for the T.V.A. "When you get over 40, especially if you don't have all the education, it's very hard. I could hope for a job in retail. The very best I could pull down is $5 an hour. I'd be part-time so I couldn't get benefits."
Most displaced workers are blue-collar or clerical employees, said Ronald E. Kutscher, associate commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The dividing line is education," he said. "People who have less than high school education are in a difficult position whether they're blue collar or white collar. They have higher unemployment rates and they have more trouble finding a new job."
 
Upheaval Hurts Higher Paid, Too
 But for many highly educated, highly paid professionals or managers who have also been laid off, the shock is nearly as painful. "A lesson in humility," as one such person put it.
For some, the upheaval can last for years. Take Sally Chin McElwreath. She was laid off from her public relations job at Trans World Airlines in 1985, spent three years freelancing and then landed a job at Maxwell MacMillan, where she is vice president of corporate communications. Now she is facing another crisis as the Maxwell empire crumbles, even though the individual companies she represents are making money.
"I was so involved in my job," Ms. McElwreath said. "I didn't have lunch. I didn't join professional organizations. I didn't socialize. I'm determined to do things for myself now instead of just staying in the office and finishing that last memo."
Still, despite the latest crisis, Ms. McElwreath said she was doing better in publishing than she would have had she remained in the airline industry. "I make more money, and I am in a more senior position," she said.
In contrast to the least educated service workers, the more educated ones at least have the possibility of recapturing what they have lost. "The more resources one brings to the job market, the greater one's ability to rebound," Mr. Kutscher, the Labor Department official, said. "Education is one of those resources."

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Needy Schools Test a Tradition: Little State Aid

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALLENSTOWN, N.H., Jan. 1

 BODY:
When a ceiling collapsed in the elementary school here, officials were so strapped for money that they had to take proceeds from a candy sale by parents that had been intended for a new playground.
Similar shortages in poorer towns around New Hampshire have prompted five school districts to sue Gov. Judd Gregg and other officials, challenging the state's system of paying for public education and, by extension, its most cherished political policy: the refusal to adopt a state income tax or sales tax. 
 Lacking revenue from such taxes, the state provides only 7 percent of its public schools' budgets, compared with a national average of 50 percent, according to documents filed in the lawsuit. That ranks New Hampshire last in the country in the state's share of public education spending.
 
An Awkward Spot
 The state's policy and the lawsuit challenging it place Governor Gregg, a Republican and a leading opponent of a state income or sales tax, in an awkward position. He is the chairman of President Bush's re-election campaign in New Hampshire's primary next month and therefore is the chief representative here of the man who has claimed the mantle of "education President." Also, as critics like to point out, the Governor has placed his own three children in private schools.
Mr. Gregg and those opposed to state taxes point out that New Hampshire has the lowest overall state and local tax burden in the nation, which has made it an attractive place to live and do business. The longtime no-tax policy has become synonymous with the motto on state license plates, "Live Free or Die." Alaska is the only other state with no income tax or sales tax.
Lawsuits charging unfair disparities in the way school financing is determined, including suits in Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas, have been successful in recent years. Similar suits are pending in 22 states.
But the effect of the lawsuit here would be the most far-reaching because, if successful, it would force a revolution of New Hampshire's tax system. According to figures in the suit, New Hampshire's 7 percent share of spending is not even close to that of the state that ranks just ahead of it, Nebraska. That state provides 24 percent of its schools' budgets.
"If we tripled our state appropriation for education, we would still be less than the 49th state," said John Garvey, a lawyer representing the five towns that brought the suit. It has been joined by 23 other towns.
The system makes some towns almost totally dependent on personal property taxes to support their schools. In some wealthier towns, which, in addition, have factories, shopping malls or ski resorts to tax, families may actually pay less in taxes and get more money for their schools than is the case with families in poorer communities with little or no commercial property.
 
Disparity in Rates
 In Allenstown, a small aging mill town where the last factory closed in 1991, residents were taxed at $17.24 for every thousand dollars of valuation on their homes in 1989, a rate that was almost twice the state average. Yet the town raised only $3,473 for each pupil for its schools, and that was more than $1,000 below the average for the state, the suit said.
By contrast, the suit notes that families in Rye, a wealthier town of similar size, paid taxes at the rate of $4.68 and raised $6,037, from all sources, in spending for each pupil.
"It's very nice not to pay income or sales taxes," said Ann Viar, an Allenstown resident whose 7-year-old son, Michael, is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. "But since property taxes are so high, I'd like a little more for my dollar."
Mrs. Viar, who has three other children in the town's public schools, complains that the junior high school can no longer afford a foreign-language program, courses for gifted students or a computer room. The school system has had to lay off its librarians and art teachers, and last spring it ran out of paper for students. Pupils in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades must share textbooks, so that, Mrs. Viar said, "if you have a test on Monday and it isn't your weekend to have the book, you are out of luck."
"At least we have running water," she said, referring to the plight of another town in the suit, Lisbon, where the junior and senior high schools are housed in a 19th century wooden building with antique heating and wiring systems. One classroom in Lisbon is in a converted chicken coop.
The suit is being fought vigorously by Mr. Gregg. Publicly, he argues that "the quality of education is not defined so much by dollars as by involvement of parents, involvement of teachers and involvement of principals."
 
Is Education a Right?
 Privately, colleagues say, the Governor is counting on the vague wording of New Hampshire's Constitution, which is less clear than those of many other states about whether education is a fundamental right. The suit, which was filed in State Superior Court last June, could be thrown out of court if a judge finds that education is not a constitutional right.
But some state residents find Mr. Gregg's stance hypocritical. "I have to laugh when the Governor speaks about the public schools, given the fact that his kids go to prep school," said Randy Perkins, the chairman of the school board in Franklin, another old mill town that is participating in the suit.
Apart from the lawsuit, Mr. Gregg has also come under pressure to deal with two years of plummeting state revenues as the state has slipped into the worst recession since the Great Depression. Last month the state struggled to close a $200 million deficit in its $3.9 billion budget for 1991-1993 and this was adding to the pressure for an income tax, until the White House said it would release $234 million in Medicaid reimbursements for New Hampshire.
Mr. Gregg's critics and supporters of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is challenging Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire Republican primary, have asserted that the money was a partisan windfall intended to help the President's campaign. The Governor has said the timing of the announcement of the reimbursement, came at the same time as his opening of Mr. Bush's campaign headquarters here, was coincidental.
Even some Republicans say they worry that the Medicaid money will lull New Hampshire into a false sense of contentment with its tax system and prevent the kind of changes that are needed to improve the state's schools.
"The Medicaid bailout is the worst thing that has ever happened to New Hampshire," said Bert Teague, a 74-year-old Republican State Representative who was chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party in 1952 when Dwight D. Eisenhower began his campaign for the Presidency with a victory in the state's primary.
"The property tax has really become a terrible burden," Mr. Teague said. He noted that while the absence of state income and sales taxes might appear attractive, excessive reliance on property taxes had driven up the tax bills on many families' homes to the point where they defaulted on their mortgage payments.
Forty years ago, he said, the property tax made sense, because the wealth of New Hampshire was still in its land. "But now everything is reversed, wealth is in wages and salaries and dividends and investments, not in land," he said.
"We've bragged for years, come up here and live free, pay the lowest taxes," Mr. Teague added.
"So now they've come by the thousands, and they all vote against taxes," he said, referring to the large number of newcomers who moved to New Hampshire during its rapid growth in the 1980's. "Of course, we have an alternative, it's there on our license plate -- die," he said.

HEADLINE: For Many in the New York Region, The City Is Ignored and Irrelevant

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Without quite noticing it, the New York area, home of the ultimate American city, has transformed itself into a sprawling, dispersed region that more than ever resembles Los Angeles, where a movie at the multiplex or a trip to Bridgewater Commons has become as much a day out as a journey to Lincoln Center or Herald Square.
In place of a "the-subway-can-get-me-there" attitude that survived the first moves to the suburbs from places like the Grand Concourse in the Bronx or Flatbush in Brooklyn, a new culture has taken hold. Many residents in the ring of communities around the city never lived in the five boroughs, hardly ever visit the city and do not care much about what happens there. 
 A recent New York Times poll reflects the weakening ties between New York City and the region around it. The poll found that many residents in the communities that surround the city work near where they live, shop and entertain themselves outside New York City more than ever before and feel that the city is unimportant to them.
 
Paramus Is Preferred
 "The city has moved out here," said Russell J. Hogdahl, who is raising his family in Riverdale Borough, N.J., and commutes to his chemical engineering job in Edgewater, N.J. "There's no need to go across the bridge," He said he would rather go to the Meadowlands than to Madison Square Garden, and he prefers the Macy's in Paramus to the one in Herald Square. Mr. Hogdahl was one of those surveyed for the poll who agreed to a follow-up interview.
The Times's poll, some details of which were reported on Dec. 1, confirmed trends of decentralization and increasing disaffection with cities that have been transforming other areas across the country. But the findings, urban policy experts said, challenge New Yorkers' chauvinistic view that their region is different from other places that have spawned strip malls and suburban sprawl and that have left their metropolitan centers weakened.
"In the 50's and 60's, people moved to the suburbs and they cut the first tie to the city," said Norman J. Glickman, the director of the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research. "In the 60's and 70's, retail stores moved and people severed the second tie. Now the jobs have moved. So people no longer need to go to the city to live, to work, to shop or to play."
In The Times's poll, conducted in November, 51 percent of those who live in the New York area outside the five boroughs said events in the city have "hardly any impact" on their daily lives. That was a sharp increase from 1978, when only 39 percent gave that answer to the same question.
The Times poll found that 51 percent of those who live outside the city say they spend a day or an evening in New York less often than they did five years ago, that more than two-thirds rarely or never shop in the city and that about 6 in 10 principal wage earners work in their own counties, not in the city.
More than three-quarters of the people surveyed said they would not need to go into New York City to see doctors, lawyers or accountants and, in a continuing sign of a shifting way of life, more than 4 in 10 said that, even to see a concert or a play, they could find what they like nearer home than in the city that offers Broadway and Carnegie Hall.
The telephone poll was conducted Nov. 2-12, with 1,726 adults in the 14 counties immediately surrounding the city in New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Glickman of Rutgers said the New York area is now "L.A. East," a spread-out, automobile-reliant community in which suburban residents find it hard to understand what the problems of the urban world have to do with them.
 
Multiplex Society With Its Back to City
 Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the New York University Urban Research Center, said, "We have seen the creation of a suburban culture in New York." It is marked, he said, by a dispersion of population across a broad area, a homogenization of cultural offerings through such ubiquitous institutions as mulitplex movie theaters and shopping options that rival or duplicate those available in the city.
In New York, as elsewhere in the country, Mr. Moss said, Caldor and places like Bridgewater Commons in New Jersey are the places for shopping, and El Torito and the Ground Round provide the identical dinner out from Hartford to Trenton and virtually everywhere in between.
Some of those who participated in the follow-up interviews acknowledged that there is a blandness in a regional life that is increasingly divorced from the city. "You do miss something," said Howard J. Feinstein, who lives and owns an interior landscaping business in Fairfield County, Conn. "You don't have the ideas, the vitality. New York is New York."
But like many of those interviewed, Mr. Feinstein, who said he considers himself a New Yorker, provided a litany of reasons not to go into the city, ranging from fear of crime to the irritation and expense of everything from doing business to going on a night out.
Growing up on Long Island in a different time, he said, life was focused on the city: the men went there every day, and everyone else went whenever they could.
As a young adult, Mr. Feinstein, who is 40, worked in the city, too, as his father always had. Then, he said, he and the city changed. He gave up the chance to take over his father's window-cleaning business, then gave up on working in the city altogether.
And in recent years, he said, he has found that he uses the city more like a tourist than a resident, visiting it only four or five times a year.
In the Times poll, 59 percent of the residents in the 14-county area surrounding the city said they had never lived in the five boroughs. In northern New Jersey 71 percent said they had never lived in the city and in Fairfield County, fully three-quarters of those interviewed for the poll gave that response.
 
No Nostalgia For New York
 Young adults who have never lived in any city are part of what Sylvia F. Fava, a senior researcher at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, calls "the suburban generation." Like their counterparts across the country, she said, they are in the first wave of Americans raised in the vast suburban developments that grew up after World War II.
They are, she said, used to the security offered by suburbs. They have no history and no interest in the city, and what they perceive to be problems there that have little to do with their lives. "Your protection," she said, "is you are surrounded by people who are like you in places you know."
The suburban generation's principal source of information about the city, she said, is the "crime, doom and horror" reports they receive from television and radio broadcasts that she said often specialize in caricature and can subtly perpetuate negative views of New York City.
In the poll, only 35 percent of suburban residents said they read a New York City newspaper almost every weekday, down from 40 percent in 1978, while those who listen to radio stations based in New York increased to 72 percent from 63 percent in 1978. Most of the region's powerful radio stations are based in New York City.
David P. Shields, 27, who sells information services to professionals, is one Westchester resident who says he canceled a New York City newspaper in favor of a local newspaper that provides information more relevant to his life, like classified advertisements and notices of local hearings. He gets other news mostly by listening to the radio while at work, he said.
Born and raised in Mamaroneck, where he lives with his wife, Mr. Shields said events in New York City "really don't affect me here in Westchester." And the delights of New York that he has sometimes heard about, he said, seem little more than bits of nostalgia.
He has heard, for example, that the Grand Concourse in the Bronx once offered a graceful way of life. "You speak to anyone who is 40 or 50," he said, "they tell you it was the place to be. On Sunday, everyone was out pushing their baby carriages. I go there now, I can't imagine it ever being like that."
 
Lifelong Residents Of Suburbia
 The Times poll also found that the sterotype of the suburban couple raising their children, then abandoning their bedroom communities to return to New York City is less true than it used to be. In 1978, 26 percent of suburban respondents said they had lived in their current community for 20 years or more. In the recent poll, 37 percent said they had lived there that long.
Even boosters of New York City say recent trends worry them. Mr. Moss noted that research at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University showed that, despite the flight from the city in recent decades, Manhattan still has a concentration of more than a quarter of all the jobs in the 31-county region around the city.
But, Mr. Moss said, the erosion of loyalty to the city illustrated by the poll reinforced his conclusion in a November study that it is necessary to "reinvent New York," not only economically but in the image it presents to the region. That study cited such statistics as those in a Port Authority survey showing that the rate of job growth grew faster far from the city than close to the city during the 1980's.
Some of the reinvention of New York, managers of the city's cultural institutions said, would involve an aggressive effort to change both the realities and the perceptions that "citizens of the region" have developed about a dangerous and costly city. "There is not nearly enough effort to make it easier and safer and more pleasant for people to come to the city of New York," said William H. Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
New York's municipal government has traditionally looked to the business community for help in improving the city's image. But some experts say the pressure on business is enormous, even in good economic times, to find out what the customer wants and provide it. And if the customer wants a suburban shopping mall with free parking and a Haagen-Dazs ice cream outlet nearby, the customer, as the saying goes, is always right.
A case in point might be Macy's, which is as closely identified with New York City as its Thanksgiving Day parade. A New York City attitude was once so pervasive at the department store that its early expansion efforts in the 1950's were governed by one rule: Macy's would build a new store in the New York area only if potential customers could get there on foot.
That notion is now quaint, said Edward S. Finkelstein, the chain's chairman and chief executive, and Macy's is the anchor store in malls across the region. The main store at Herald Square still claims to be the biggest in the world, producing, Mr. Finkelstein said, seven times the gross receipts of a typical suburban Macy's in such park-and-drive locations as Danbury or Stamford, Conn.
Macy's, Mr. Finkelstein said, is committed to New York. But it is also committed to selling. And that means that, like most businesses, it appears to be watching as the people of the region redefine their way of life. "We are positioned," Mr. Finkelstein said, "to be where the customers choose to be. If they decide they are disaffected with New York, we are in the suburbs."
An effort to change attitudes about shopping and everthing else in the city might be aimed at people like Lynn Vigilante, a 58-year-old retired real-estate broker who lives in Glen Head, near Roslyn, L.I. Her fondest memories, she said, include Italian feasts at Mamma Leone's and dinners at the old Luchow's on 14th Street.
Now, like many of those interviewed, she said the cost of parking in the city would pay for dinner at a pleasant place nearer home. When she thinks of the city now, she said, it tends to be of episodes like the killing of Brian Watkins, the Utah tourist who came to see the United States Open tennis tournament and lost his life in a New York subway.
"Now, it's a whole new era," Mrs. Vigilante said. "It's expensive. They're robbing you. Look at that couple that came from Utah with their son. I'd be afraid to go in."

HEADLINE: For President, Help in Tokyo;
Intent of the Japanese Is to Bolster a Friend

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 1

 BODY:
President Bush's trip to Japan next week has turned into a messy confrontation over trade and a major test for Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. But Japanese leaders also hope to make the trip at least look like a success for an American President viewed as a friend.
Aides to Mr. Miyazawa were dismayed when domestic problems forced Mr. Bush first to postpone his visit, originally scheduled for November, and then to take along 21 executives of the American automobile and other industries to demand greater access to Japanese markets. 
 But the Japanese have now apparently decided to try to salvage the trip as a gesture of friendship to Mr. Bush and a reflection of concern over a Presidential race that has already featured calls for trade retaliation against Tokyo.
 
'Bush Is Better for Us'
 "Let's face it, Bush is better for us than any alternatives we see right now," a Japanese official said. "He's the key person standing against protectionism and isolationism in the United States. So to the extent that Bush gains, Japan gains and Miyazawa gains."
But some American officials say Mr. Miyazawa may not have the political latitude to make any major promises. Successful Japanese prime ministers must be perceived to have a good relationship with Washington, but not a subordinate one.
Mr. Miyazawa's predecessor, Toshiki Kaifu, was done in because of a widespread impression that he did Mr. Bush's bidding. And like Mr. Kaifu, Mr. Miyazawa is surrounded by rival kingpins in the governing Liberal Democratic Party who do not necessarily want him to succeed. Their passive support of Mr. Miyazawa has led to a series of disastrous legislative defeats in his first two months in office.
Among them was the embarrassing failure of a bill to enlist Japanese troops in United Nations peacekeeping forces. Also defeated were measures to apologize to the United States for World War II, enact a series of political changes and raise taxes to increase Japanese foreign aid.
"As the year-end approaches, expectations for Miyazawa are failing," a respected political columnist, Kenji Kiatahara, wrote this week. "A feeling of disappointment and helplessness is endemic. Miyazawa has failed to provide anything resembling his promised leadership on any issue."
Some analysts say that if Mr. Bush's visit is perceived as a failure, Mr. Miyazawa could be ousted before the end of 1992.
Faced with American anger and impatience over the trade imbalance, particularly the fact that Japanese cars are wiping out the American competition, Japan is planning a set of initiatives that could have a marginal effect on the $41 billion imbalance.
Under consideration are some easing of environmental and safety regulations for imported automobiles that have been tough for American car-makers to meet if they want to sell their products in Japan. Japanese car producers and retailers are also being pressed to buy more American auto parts and open their dealerships to American cars.
Such steps are likely to have a small long-term effect. But Americans are unlikely to be comforted by the spirit in which these concessions are offered. Mr. Miyazawa, for instance, appealed for voluntary efforts out of compassion, not out of a sense that the current system is unfair, as Americans contend.
"I am asking industry leaders to take more seriously and compassionately the U.S. situation," Mr. Miyazawa said, mentioning what he said was the "considerable shock" felt by Americans at seeing their automobile industry wiped out by Japanese competition. "G.M. is like the Stars and Stripes for the American people," he said.
It remains to be seen whether voluntary purchases by Japanese industries will be satisfying to an American delegation that wants a more systemic change in Japan to make it more open to imports in general.
Many analysts in Japan think that President Bush will be happy to accept the Japanese steps, if only because he has raised expectations to such a degree that he cannot afford to act like he has been spurned.
As for Mr. Miyazawa, aides say that he needs what Japanese leaders always seem to need -- reassurance that Japan is an equal partner with the United States in tackling global problems. The format is to be a "Tokyo Declaration" of the two nations' "global partnership."
When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited Japan in the fall, however, he made headlines when he said Japan must abandon its practice of "checkbook diplomacy" and wade more into the thick of the world's problems. Many Japanese resented what they felt was his condescending tone.
In fact, Japan wants to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It wants more voting rights at the International Monetary Fund. It wants the United Nations to expunge references in its charter to its status as a former "enemy" state. American response to these requests has been lukewarm at best.
 
How Japan Disappoints
 Now Japan will be watching to see how much Mr. Bush papers over American disappointment that it did not send personnel to the Persian Gulf, but only money, and that its steps on the environment, aid to poor countries and aid to the Soviet Union have fallen short of expectations.
In the end, the biggest favor Mr. Miyazawa, a former Finance Minister, can do for President Bush is to help the United States by helping itself. Accordingly, Mr. Miyazawa is presiding over steps to stimulate the Japanese economy and let the yen rise in value against the dollar.
This week, he said Japan must be the "locomotive" that pulls the whole world out of its economic slump. Such steps as lowering interest rates in Japan and letting the yen rise are viewed by many economists as more likely to spur American imports into Japan than any specific steps in industries.
The problem is that Mr. Bush seems to want something more dramatic. The question now is what Japan can produce within its and Mr. Miyazawa's limitations. "There are things we can do and cannot do," said a senior Japanese official. "Let's see what we come up with in the next week."

Faces of Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

DATELINE: KYOTO, Japan

 BODY:
After just a week in Japan, some familiar American stereotypes about this country and its people seem shockingly superficial and dangerously out-of-date. Japanese society differs from America's in important ways. But like American society, Japanese society is neither monolithic nor static.
Today's Japan is one of the world's most modern, most affluent societies, plugged into every trend in international pop culture and a powerful creator of new trends for others. Its young people are highly educated, fashion-conscious and remarkably well traveled. Its face is far more diverse, and youthful, than would ever be guessed from the cautious politicians and corporate tycoons who dominate the news. 
 Americans can usefully debate the nature of Japanese society and how America can best respond to Japan's competitive success. But for too many Americans, Japan's image is a crude caricature, drawn from half-digested sound bites and painted in racist hues.
The Japanese are portrayed as faceless and conformist, their real feelings impenetrable to non-Japanese. This supposedly monolithic society is explained in terms of Japan's militarist traditions, its consensus style of politics and a shared national anxiety over scarce resources. These are said to produce people committed to work unceasingly so that Japan can dominate the world economically, and perhaps militarily too.
There are Japanese who think like that, but fewer than there used to be. Meanwhile a newer, youth-oriented leisure culture is emerging everywhere, from the nightclubs of Tokyo's Ginza and Roppongi districts to Kyoto's Kawaramachi Street.
Most of Japan's 123 million people have been born since 1960. Most adults have no personal memories of World War II or the U.S. occupation. Most Japanese today are children of affluence, not scarcity.
Older people still remember the hard times and hesitate to relax. The middle-aged worry more narrowly about astronomical housing costs and their children's increasingly expensive tastes. And for many school-aged children, the affluence achieved by past generations is there to be enjoyed now and the future can take care of itself. These younger Japanese pleasure-seekers are, their elders say, "nibbling on their parents' shins."
If this generational breakdown sounds familiar to Americans, there's good reason. An internationalized market and culture has homogenized experience to a remarkable extent, particularly in societies at comparable economic levels.
Japan is different from America, but also surprisingly familiar. There are unreconstructed militarists and nationalists who acknowledge no Japanese wrongdoing before or during World War II, but there are also potent pacifist and environmental movements. Traditional values are revered, but a growing feminist movement is challenging patriarchal traditions. Japanese culture values harmony and pleasing words, but some Japanese are bluntly outspoken, even to foreigners.
Why then do so many Americans see the Japanese as an army of ants? One reason may be unfamiliarity. Few Americans have spent much time in Japan. And the faces Japan turns to the outside world are usually those of its mumbling politicians and corporate samurai. It's also more comforting for Americans to explain embarrassing competitive setbacks by conspiracy theories rather than by poor American business practices.
The United States and Japan now have the world's two biggest economies. Their relationship is too important to fall victim to oversimplification and ignorance. Both societies have learned valuable and different lessons from history, lessons they might usefully share with each other. By better appreciating what we have in common with the Japanese, Americans might even discover how to benefit from Japanese successes.

No 'Horror Show'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Put yourself in the shoes of an assignment editor for any of the news media today, as shoppers in Russia return to stores closed for the New Year's holiday.
You dispatch reporters to cover an inflationary horror show. What Gorbachev had long flinched from doing, Boris Yeltsin has just dared to do: ended the state subsidies for most goods, removed the corrupt bureaucracy from the marketplace and opened the economy to the law of supply and demand. 
 You send one camera crew to a food market to take pictures of the price signs, and ask for interviews with enraged shoppers who cannot afford the food in the stores.
You send another foreign correspondent to a Russian economist raised in the Communist system, who deplores the "shock therapy" of the elected leadership and predicts the inflation that led to the collapse of Germany's Weimar Republic, followed by food riots in Moscow and an authoritarian coup.
For the reaction of the American intelligentsia, you get a sound bite from a think-tanker with C.I.A. ties or a Gorbaphile in a Princeton tie: "didn't work in Poland, won't work in Russia" is bitten off, or "the Russian people are not culturally prepared for self-rule, and yearn for the stability of central command."
That's the obvious "story": anger and worry in the faces of women wearing babushkas, learned predictions of doom by the acolytes of proponents of failed half-measures, and a satisfying exaggeration of the pace of inflation and degree of collapse by statisticians long fooled by the phony high figures of Kremlin economists.
That's the story because it is (a) easy to cover, (b) gratifying to panicmongers and (c) safe -- what everybody else is saying the story is. And nobody ever gets burned for predicting doom; it can be explained later as just a proper show of concern.
But let us not confuse the conventional coverage with reality. The tectonic news, as distinct from the troubling human-reaction story on the surface, is that Russia and its neighboring republics are at last accepting the law of supply and demand.
That is revolutionary change, and decidedly for the better. But instead of cheering, our bargaineering liberals (who were prepared to pay $30 billion to induce free markets and defense cuts) are moaning about safety nets while our supply-siders led by Jack Kemp are bewailing the bold floating of the ruble.
Face it: The Yeltsin men may be making some mistakes of their own, but they are not making the huge mistake of the long Gorbachev nose dive. They are not trying to salvage the Communist system. On the contrary, they are taking the plunge into the icy waters of free enterprise.
But why, some tidy minds demand, can't the old command economy be replaced gradually and painlessly and tidily?
Because turmoil does not give you time. Politicians new to office have only a certain grace period -- a few quarters, a year or two at most, to inflict the pain of necessary change. Our own politicians, safely espousing free-market principles, tend to forget that risking political capital is the highest form of capitalism.
A couple of years ago, a Leningrad student told me: "We are now free to call for change, and we do, all the time -- but nothing changes."
A month ago, the new Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, responded: "Our people will tolerate hardship if they see real change. If you want to help the Russian people, you should assist the forces of change."
How can we help? By joint-venturing with Russians in getting oil out of the ground and into pipelines and ships; by sending practical experts to show Ukraine's farmers and transporters how to keep harvests from rotting; by re-thinking Cocom regulations that prevent new telephonic communication technology from pulling the Russians out of their business morass; by organizing a private Capitalist Corps to compete with our Peace Corps in showing the former Soviets how to manage and how to enforce contracts.
What is "horror show" to us, as the novelist Anthony Burgess pointed out, is also the Russian word khorosho -- "okay." Through the trials of transition to supply and demand, the historic story of 1992 will be how the enduring Russians turned out khorosho.

He Let In The Light

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev went out like the old year, unmourned. There was a grudging quality to much of the comment when he resigned. He was not a true democrat, the critics said. He fumbled economic change. He temporized, he wavered, he failed.
The criticism was even harsher at home. Roy Medvedev, the anti-Stalinist Communist historian, said: "The country that was the Soviet Union in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power was incomparably better, given all its deficiencies, than it is today." 
 Was it? In 1985 thousands of political prisoners suffered in the gulag, and anyone who said a critical word about the system was likely to join them. In 1985 Andrei Sakharov was held in Gorky, harassed by the K.G.B., force-fed when he went on a hunger strike. In 1985 there was no independent newspaper or broadcast station in the whole vast country.
In 1985 East Germans who tried to cross to the West were machine-gunned on the Berlin Wall. Czechs and Slovaks lived in a grim silence, held in an alien empire along with Poles and Hungarians and Bulgarians.
All that Gorbachev ended. He let the light of free speech and a free press in on his country, ending 70 years of totalitarian darkness. He sent no armies when the Berlin Wall was breached, when Czechs and Poles and the others formed governments of their own choice; he invited the process.
In 1985 no one dreamt that freedom could come so far, so fast -- that the enormous mechanism of tyranny would be dismantled in less than seven years. Or that it could happen quite peacefully, despite the armies of bureaucrats and secret police and soldiers at the regime's command.
It happened that way only because someone who knew the system intimately, who knew the psychology of its legions, took it apart. Only Gorbachev the ultimate insider could do it. Andrei Sakharov was the voice of truth, the inspirer, the saint. But the Communist structure would not have dissolved itself at his command.
Melor Sturua, an Izvestia columnist visiting at the University of Minnesota, writes in Foreign Policy magazine that the fall of Communism was inevitable anyway. Yes it was, some day. So, too, could one predict that white supremacy could not go on forever in South Africa. But that does not lessen the achievement of President F. W. de Klerk in undoing it now.
Gorbachev was really interested in power, Mr. Sturua writes. If that were so, he could easily have blocked change, kept the lid of tyranny on and enjoyed the life of an old-style Soviet leader. If a dodderer like Leonid Brezhnev could hold the system together for years, he surely could. And it was expectable that Gorbachev would: A man who came up through the system, playing the servile games, enjoying the power and privileges.
But he did the opposite. He brought Sakharov back from Gorky. He opened the way for a critical press. He ended the Communist Party's historic monopoly of political power, allowing others to speak and organize.
Then, in 1988, he made the crucial move of creating a parliament that would actually be elected by the people. It was an imperfect election, but it was free enough to register popular disaffection from Communism, and to make the idea of democracy take hold.
He made great mistakes. He freed Sakharov but would not heed Sakharov's warnings. His unwillingness to put himself to the test of popular election cost him legitimacy. He made more and more concessions to the conservatives, failing to see their threat until they moved against him in the August coup.
The coup was his undoing when it aroused public resistance and then revulsion against the whole Communist idea. But there was irony in that. For without the experience of increasing freedom under Gorbachev, it is doubtful that editors and broadcasters and ordinary people would have had the courage to resist the coup as they did.
The world owes him as much as his own people. He ended the cold war, the greatest menace to freedom everywhere -- and to life. He turned back the hands of the nuclear clock.
The correct judgment, I think, is the one made by David Remnick of The Washington Post, writing just before the fall in The New York Review of Books: "Despite the twilight aura gathering around him now, Gorbachev will surely be counted as the dominant politician of the second half of the Twentieth Century."

HEADLINE: Time for Government to Start Spending Again

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While spending by individuals and businesses is an important component of the United States economy, it is a mistake to underestimate the role that Government spending plays in driving the economic engine. 
 From my vantage point as a university-based teacher and scientist, I can see that the recession in universities, and in scientific research, is largely tied to cutbacks in Government programs. People are being laid off, new hiring is frozen, and scholarship programs are threatened.
If Government spending in our sector were restored to former levels we could reinstitute construction and renovation programs, furnishing jobs to the construction industry and increasing our capacity for teaching and research. Students with scholarships would again have money with which to buy what they need, adding to economic activity.
We could afford to hire personnel in scientific research and to purchase supplies, which would again further not only our scientific efforts but also the economy.
I am sure that other Americans can see many examples in their own areas in which cutbacks in Government programs have directly led to our economic downturn. The Government need not sit helpless, watching the economy slide. Government is a key part of the economy, and its overfrugal policies have helped land us in this mess.
If the cutbacks we have had were quickly reversed, this might be just the pump priming needed to get us going again.

Low Rates Expected to Continue for Bonds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market analysts and economists say the precipitous decline in short-term interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve Board over the last 18 months should begin to pay some dividends for the economy in the second half of this year.
Few of them, however, expect much more than a tepid rebound. If they are right, short-term rates will stay low, and bond yields, which remained stubbornly high through much of 1991, will probably fall. 
 But economic recovery, these people acknowledge, has been widely seen as being just six months away for the last three years. And there are enough uncertainties to jeopardize even a modest improvement.
Nevertheless, guarded optimism prevails.
"The prospects for the economy are much better, because rates are down and we have already been through a lot," said Edward J. Hyman, president of International Strategy and Investment, a New York investment advisory firm.
Inflation, the scourge of the fixed-income market, has fallen nicely over the last year and is showing few signs of reviving. And while the worry of rising unemployment continues, the pall of an impending war does not.
Since July 1990, the Fed has lowered its target for the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market by 4.25 percentage points, to 4 percent. In response, other short-term rates have fallen and now stand at levels not seen since the late 1960's, when inflation was tame and Federal budget deficits were not a problem.
That short-term rates have fallen so far has been a big surprise to many analysts. So, too, is the fact that the rate moves have not yet rekindled economic growth.
But given the problems in the nation's financial system -- difficulties that have transformed what might otherwise have been a traditional recession into something altogether different -- economists shudder to think what might have happened had short-term rates not come down.
The efforts to work off the excessive debt incurred during the 1980's are only one year old. Many economists now say that short-term rates may need to fall a bit further during 1992 and remain at the new levels for the rest of the year if balance sheets are to be further repaired.
"We added up about $2 trillion in floating-rate debt" during the 1980's, said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, adding: "Every percentage point drop in short rates frees up $20 billion in cash flow to households and businesses. This economy would have collapsed without that sort of support."
Compared with the drop that has already taken place, further declines in short-term rates will be minimal, analysts agreed.
Still, if the economy performs as poorly as is currently expected in the first quarter, the Fed is likely to feel compelled to cut the Federal funds rate by at least another quarter of a point, and possibly more, between now and midyear.
 
Bullish on Bonds
 The analysts expect big things from the bond market this year, because inflation, currently around 3 percent, seems unlikely to move higher in response to a very modest recovery.
"Bond yields at 7 percent could be possible any time during the first half of the year, even in the first quarter," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "Inflation over the next year should be between 2 percent and 3 percent, which makes bonds look very attractive."
David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said: "We are still bullish on the fixed-income market, particularly for intermediate to long-term securities. A half-point drop in bond yields, which I think is very possible, would produce the double-digit return that Treasuries have provided this year."
Bond yields have fallen sharply since the Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate by a full percentage point last month, and now stand at just under 7.50 percent.
But analysts fear the rally will end, and the recovery will be delayed if not derailed, should Congress or the Administration concoct a wildly stimulative package of tax cuts by spring.
"There is a risk that the bond market may be recalcitrant and refuse to rally further," Mr. Soss said. "That would delay financial restructuring."
 
Among the Risks
 Other risks to the recovery, analysts said, include the possibility of a protracted economic downturn in Europe, especially Germany, and a failure by Japan to stimulate its economy. If one or both occur, American exporters will suffer.
For the bond market, however, the biggest risk is that the widely held view of a tepid recovery is dead wrong.
"The risk is that the traditional business cycle is not dead," Mr. Yardeni said, "and that even as economists conclude that rates will stay low for quite some time, a major turnaround in the economy occurs, causing rates to come roaring back."
 
Outlook for Junk Bonds
 It is hard to imagine how a resumption of strong economic growth could do much more for the high-yield junk bond market, even though its spectacular rise during the year just past reflected sharply rising stock prices, which in the past have been a harbinger of better times.
The combination of better stock prices and falling interest rates acted as a tonic for high-yield issues last year, and pushed up the Salomon Brothers high-yield index of 700 issues by a staggering 40 percent from the end of 1990.
Joseph Bencivenga, a managing director and co-head of equity and high-yield research at Salomon, is not expecting similar performance this year. But he does look for good things.
"With short rates falling dramatically, interest burdens on these companies are falling every day," he said. "All the indicators we look at point to a rate of return of between 12 percent and 15 percent," for 1992.
 
Municipal Bonds
 The big drop in interest rates was also a boon for issuers and investors in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
Spurred by the decline in rates, new-issue volume was up 30 percent from 1990, to around $165 billion, said George Friendlander, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
States and municipalities were able to sell that much debt because the drop in yields on taxable securities made tax-exempt bonds look increasingly attractive.
"It was a superb year for the muni market," Mr. Friedlander said.
In large part, the prospects for the coming year hinge on what happens to rates on Treasury securities, the benchmark against which all other fixed-income securities are priced.
"Unless the Treasury market really gets beat up, municipal bond rates will stay low," Mr. Friendlander added.
And, with rates at or near current levels, states and localities are almost certain to continue to call outstanding securities issued with higher coupons.
Similarly, if taxable rates stay low, demand from individual investors for tax-free notes and bonds figures to remain strong.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Italians Polish Their Wine Image

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SEEKING to increase "share of mouth" among American oenophiles, the Italian Trade Commission is beginning a multimillion-dollar campaign for fine Italian wines, its first in four years.
The advertising links Italy's premium wines with art, fashion, food and opera, under a "quality of life" theme. 
 "The job isn't to sell Italian wine," William McCaffery, president and creative director of McCaffery & Ratner Inc., the agency for the wines of Italy account, said during a recent interview at the commission's office in midtown Manhattan. "The job is to sell Italy in a bigger, broader sense, as a world leader in quality of life."
That selling job, however, will be difficult. Apart from the sour economy, changing attitudes toward drinking and symbols of conspicuous consumption pose serious obstacles to image-building ads.
Atop that, "the Italians have a lot of problems" of their own, said Frank C. Walters, vice president and research director of M. Shanken Communications Inc. in New York, which follows wine- and liquor-industry trends. Primary among them, he added, is a belief by American consumers that "higher-priced wines traditionally come from France."
Alfonso Barbera, the commission's executive director for the United States, Canada and Mexico, agreed.
"France began to export the best wine, and the image of French wine was built on the basis of their best wine," he said. "Italy began to export the wines the Italian immigrants drank, and the image of Italian wine was built on this wine."
As a result, he added, "it's very, very difficult to promote Italian wine in America."
So for the next two years, the commission will spend on the campaign what for the premium wine market is a large sum, $10 million. Eight print advertisements will begin appearing in January issues of magazines including Bon Appetit, Conde Nast Traveler, Food & Wine, Gourmet, The New York Times Magazine and Vogue.
The two-page spreads feature striking photographs of Italian sights like trattorias, museums and opera houses on the left, and Italian meals, complemented with wine, on the right.
Come spring, the commission will be the sole sponsor of a weekly, hourlong syndicated program of Italian music to be heard on classical radio stations in metropolitan markets. Augmenting the media advertising will be integrated marketing efforts like wine tastings and promotions at Italian restaurants.
The campaign is intended to reach a target market defined by David Hooper, McCaffery's executive vice president and marketing director, as "an influential group" that already regularly drinks wine -- 57 million mostly urban consumers, 35 to 54 years old, who have annual incomes in excess of $40,000.
Since Americans "are ignorant, period," about wine, said Mr. Walters of Shanken Communications, it would make sense to focus on those who already buy it, rather than recruiting converts to the cause.
Shanken's most recent full-year data show that in 1990, 9.25 million 9-liter cases of Italian wine were shipped to this country, down 9 percent from 10.17 million in 1989. Of the 20 best-selling fine wines, the highest an Italian brand ranked was ninth; Santa Margherita, from Palermo Imports Ltd., sold 190,000 9-liter cases at an average price of $14.50 for a 750-milliliter bottle.
The campaign is the commission's first since 1987, when its account was at Ketchum/Hicks & Greist, now known as Ketchum Advertising New York. McCaffery won the account in September, after a review that included two other New York agencies, Della Femina, McNamee Inc. and Geer, DuBois Inc., and the Armando Testa Group Worldwide of Milan.

The nation's industrial economy contracted in December to its lowest level in 8 months, the nation's purchasing managers said, stalled by declining orders and lower production. The report was the first significant indication of the state of the economy last month. [D1.]
Sales of U.S.-built cars and light trucks remained weak in mid-December, a historically slow period. Auto makers posted a 0.4 percent gain over last year, but the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate was the lowest since last year. [D1.]
The U.S. sale of S.& L. properties to Patriot American was wasteful, uncompetitive and plagued by financial uncertainties, a Congressional report said. The Bush Administration had touted the deal as a model for bulk disposal of properties. [D1.]
Spending on construction projects declined in November for the first time in five months as outlays for new office buildings and other commercial structures fell sharply. [D2.]
The number of Americans filing new jobless claims fell by 29,000 in the third week of December, erasing part of an earlier surge, the Government said. [D3.]
 
INTERNATIONAL
For all the Japanese fears that the executives joining Bush on his Asian trip are coming to protest their trade policies, many will probably bear a friendlier message. Many have already prospered from contracts with Japanese companies and see the trip as a chance to drum up business. [D1.]
 
MARKETS
Stocks edged further upward, as widespread selling was overwhelmed by a last-minute buying surge. The Dow rose 3.58, to 3,172.41, its fifth straight record. [D6.]
In the credit markets, the year began on a somewhat sour note, as prices of longer-dated notes and bonds fell fairly sharply, and interest rates rose. [D11.]
The dollar rose against key European currencies despite new evidence of economic weakness in the U.S. [D12.]
Silver prices rebounded smartly on a wave of speculative buying, and oil prices rose after a long downtrend. [D12.]
 
TODAY'S COLUMNS
For dividend actions, the year just ended was in some ways the worst on record, with fewer companies providing good news for shareholders than at any time since compiling began.

A Specialist in Cutting Costs Is the New President of PNC

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The PNC Financial Corporation, the prosperous Pittsburgh banking company, which grew rapidly in the 1980's to become the 16th largest in the country, yesterday named a new president, James E. Rohr.
Mr. Rohr, 43, started at the Pittsburgh National Bank in 1972 and spent most of his career in corporate banking. In his new position, he will be the No. 2 PNC executive after Thomas H. O'Brien, who gave up the president's title but remains chairman and chief executive. 
 Although Mr. Rohr said PNC's problems with bad loans were mostly past -- the company's holdings of badly troubled loans and foreclosed real estate more than doubled in 1990 but declined last year -- he expected the weak economy to continue to dampen prospects for the banking industry. "Loan growth," he said, "is not going to be the fuel to profits that it was during the 1980's."
He said banks needed to work harder to keep costs low. Although PNC is already an industry leader in controlling costs, Mr. Rohr recently completed a six-month study of PNC's six banks in Pennsylvania that found ways to improve the quality of service and cut costs by $25 million to $35 million a year, beginning in 1994.
Many improvements, which were culled from about 500 suggestions made by 175 company officials, call for more uniformity among the subsidiary banks. While PNC's 11 banks in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, New Jersey and Delaware already share computer systems and similar standards for loans and business practices, "we found incremental savings by adopting identical systems," Mr. Rohr said.
The move to uniformity could go so far as to include name changes for subsidiary banks. But even if the names remain the same, Mr. Rohr noted that the company expected to save more thanr $3 million a year by consolidating its six Pennsylvania banks under one charter, thereby eliminating some costs and making it easier to deal with regulators.
Mr. Rohr is a graduate of Notre Dame and has a master's degree in business administration from Ohio State University.

Yields of Money Funds Post A Mixed Showing for Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended Tuesday. Assets of taxable funds declined sharply in the same period, as investors sought higher interest elsewhere.
Tax-exempt money fund yields moved up smartly in the latest week. The rise in yields was attributed to a combination of seasonal factors and, to some extent, a dwindling demand for money market funds. 
 The seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund rose 40 basis points, to 4.41 percent, with the simple yield up 39 basis points, to 4.32 percent. During the same period, the 30-day compounded yield rose 16 basis points, to 3.99 percent, and the simple yield was up 15 basis points, to 3.91 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios fell by 2, to 56. Donoghue's analysts said the shortening of days did not necessarily indicate that managers were expecting an increase in interest rates, but might be pulling back in length of maturity to be in a better position to take advantage of rate changes that are tied to seasonal factors.
 
Tax-Exempt Assets Down
 Donoghue's said total assets of tax-exempt funds for the week were down by $531 million, to $91 billion. This compares with the $1.2 billion decline in assets the previous week, as investors disappointed by the rate of return moved toward equities and a surging stock market.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day compounded yield is 6.12 percent, while the equivalent in the 31 percent tax bracket is 6.39 percent.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, Calvert Tax Free Reserves, was the best performer. The fund, which is distributed by the Calvert Group of Washington, D.C., had a return of 5.49 percent, or 50 basis points higher than the best performer the previous week.
Assets of taxable funds fell by a hefty $12.5 billion, to $456.3 billion, as institutional investors were caught up in seasonal factors and window dressing, and small investors scurried for higher yields in other interest-rate- oriented investments like short-term bond funds, corporate bond funds and the stock market.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 3 basis points, to 4.61 percent, with the simple yield at 4.51 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was down 5 basis points, to 4.66 percent, as the simple yield fell to 4.56 percent.
The taxable fund with the best return was Merrill Lynch Ready Assets, with a performance of 6.78 percent.

HEADLINE: Sparing a Dime, Whether They Agree or Not

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
During the morning rush hour yesterday at the Borough Hall subway station in Brooklyn, flames leaped from a trash bin fire that the station manager said probably was set by someone with a ravaged mind. But to a grumbling commuter, John Beranbaum, a civil rights lawyer, the fire looked like a "subterranean protest" of the new $1.25 fare.
Already pinched for money from the holidays and the recession, New Yorkers returned to the subways and buses yesterday to encounter a fare increase that had them waiting in longer-than-usual lines and digging into pockets for an extra dime. The fare increase provoked a range of emotions, from indifference to peevish resignation. 
 Thomas Jones said he was so annoyed about the increase that he could barely read the religious pamphlet that he brought for his commute from the Bronx to his minimum-wage messenger's job in Manhattan. As the Lexington Avenue Express rumbled along, the 43-year-old Mr. Jones finally gave up his search for spiritual solace in the book, "What We Can Learn From the Angels."
"What I've learned from the angels is that M.T.A. comes in the night and sticks 10 cents down your throat," he said.
Mr. Jones said he was reeling from the recession and the expenses of the holidays for his wife and three children. Every day, he counts his pennies carefully to survive on a $4.35-an-hour salary. He called the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's fare increase, the fifth since 1981, "a lousy idea."
"You put your hand in your pocket and your money is gone," he said.
As of midmorning, the Borough Hall subway station manager, Debra Jean-Louis, said proudly that no one had cursed her out or given her a dirty look -- omissions she attributed to relief that the Transit Authority had not increased fares to $1.40, as first discussed, and to leftover goodwill from the holiday season.
Like a number of other commuters, Joe Finegan, a lawyer, had anticipated long lines yesterday and had hoarded tokens in the days preceding the increase. New tokens will take their place, but because of the last-minute nature of Tuesday's vote to raise the fare, the old tokens are valid until a date yet to be set.
As he moved through the turnstiles, Mr. Finegan said he thought the fare increase was reasonable, the opinion of a minuscule minority.
Paul Gee, a retired banker, fumbled impatiently for change as he complained not about the amount of the increase but about what he considered the sneakiness of the M.T.A. in first saying that an increase from $1.15 to $1.40 would be needed to close a projected deficit of $263 million in the Transit Authority's 1992 budget.
"The dime is not the problem; the problem is the way it was done," Mr. Gee said.
In the Times Square station, Kathy Darcy, a bank data processor from Sunnyside, Queens, said she thought the increase unjustified because the trains she rides were often crowded and delayed, with public address systems that were inaudible.
"They should pay me to ride the trains because my life feels in danger," she said.
For Charles Gayle, also at the Times Square station, the fare increase meant a day of blues. Mr. Gayle, a musician, blew hard on his trumpet as the straphangers spilled out. His battered tweed cap lay nearly empty of coins at his feet -- an indicator, he felt, that commuters had a new use for their change.
"Nothing is happening this morning," said Mr. Gayle. "This is the slowest day I've ever had."
But Mr. Gayle, a subway rider for 20 years, said he understood.
"People need their money," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: "People need their money," said Charles Gayle, who played trumpet yesterday at the Times Square subway station. "People are poor. They're complaining legitimately." He blamed the fare increase for the lack of riders, which caused a drop in his income for the day.; Joe Finegan, standing at center, a lawyer, said he thought the fare increase was reasonable.

NEW FARE CAUSES ANGER AND INDIFFERENCE
New Yorkers returned to the subways and buses to encounter the new $1.25 fare.

Toys 'R' Us Christmas Sales Jump

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
As the nation's retailers began reporting the results of the holiday selling season yesterday, Toys "R" Us stood out with better-than-expected sales gains that caused a stampede among investors to buy its stock.
Results of two regional discount chains were more in line with analysts' expectations. 
 Toys "R" Us said sales for the eight weeks ended Dec. 28 were up 16.4 percent, to $2.5 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in the corresponding period last year. Sales in stores open at least one year, which is considered a better indicator of performance, were up 7.9 percent for the Christmas season.
Analysts said Toys "R" Us's way of keeping mum during the normal holiday hype typically made investors jittery, and the better-than-expected sales made its stock the volume leader for the day. The stock closed up 2 points yesterday at 34 3/4.
 
Effect of Grim Forecasts
 On Nov. 6, when gloomy prognostications for the Christmas season were beginning to show up in newspapers and on television, Toys "R" Us shares traded at 26 5/8.
Venture Stores Inc., a discount chain with stores primarily in the Midwest, and the Caldor Corporation, a discount retailer in the Northeast reported sales results that were more in line with analysts' expectations.
Sales at Venture grew 9.3 percent for the four-week period that ended Dec. 28 to $254.9 million, from $233.3 million during the corresponding weeks last year. Sales in stores open at least one year increased 3.7 percent.
Caldor reported a 5 percent sales gain, to $321 million for the period from $306 million in the comparable 1990 period, but its same-store sales decreased 1 percent.
 
Question of Profits
 The two chains are likely to pay for their sales increases with some share of profits, said Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons.
Analysts said Toys "R" Us's good fortune during the holiday selling season was not likely to be matched by many other retailers reporting results today.
"We're not going to get much in the way of positive surprises," Mr. Buchanan said. He added that his company's index of retail sales would probably show a 2.5 percent increase in December.
Four to six weeks before the critical Christmas retail period began, Toys "R" Us executives were predicting that sales in comparable stores would increase only in the low- to mid-single digits.
Retail consultants and analysts had estimated that sales during the holiday sales period would grow between 2 percent and 3 percent, while some retailers had anticipated sales increases of 5 percent and more.
Richard N. Baum, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said a sales surge late in the season also helped Toys "R" Us clean out its warehouses, which means the company will be able to focus on testing new toys in the new year instead of digging out from under old inventory.
He also warned that some of the sales gains might have come at the expense of profit margins, since Toys "R" Us earlier this year instituted a low-price program for some of its key merchandise.
Similarly, Venture and Caldor reported strong consumer interest in their promotional merchandise, which carries lower profit margins.
Mr. Buchanan of Alex. Brown said Venture's sales were slightly below the company's plans in December, but the decline was balanced by unexpectedly good sales in November. He said Venture had done a good job of stocking the right merchandise in the right quantity.
"They've been keeping their powder dry by managing inventory extremely well," Mr. Buchanan said. He said the primary reason that Venture posted better sales results than Caldor was the Midwestern location of its stores. Caldor's 128 stores are in the Northeast, where the recession has been more severe.
While some stores are likely to report big sales gains today, analysts cautioned that those gains might look stronger than they actually were because the numbers were being compared with weak 1990 results.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Weak Again In Midmonth

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in the United States remained weak in mid-December, a historically slow period in the automobile industry. Although auto makers said today that they had posted a slight gain of four-tenths of a percent over last year, the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.2 million cars was the lowest since the comparable period last year.
"With few exceptions, this was a poor showing," said Tom Webb, the chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, a leading industry group.
 
Underreporting Results
 But Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco, said the sales figures were artificially low in mid-December because Chevrolet and Ford underreported sales of pickup trucks. He said they were likely to bunch sales in the final 10 days of December as a competitive move. Those results are to be announced on Monday. 
 Both auto makers hope an end-of-the-year surge will help them beat out each other for bragging rights as the best-selling pickup truck of 1991. A similar sales pattern occurred in December 1990.
Ford and Chevrolet have been offering heavy incentives on their trucks. Ford's dealer and customer incentives have ranged up to $1,500, while Chevrolet's have been up to $2,000, dealers said.
Even with the expected higher sales for the end of December, Mr. Glantz anticipates that December over all will show a drop from November. "Sales absolutely are bad," he said.
For the Dec. 11-20 period, which contained nine selling days this year and last, the domestic manufacturers said they had sold 124,312 cars, a decrease of 2.8 percent. Sales of light trucks rose by 5.6 percent, to 83,718 pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles.
Several dealers said their mid-December sales were not much lower than expected. Jonathan R. Bishop, the sales manager for Bishop Motors in Barberton, Ohio, called the car market "stable, albeit down."
 
Some Improvement
 Some even saw signs of improvement. Herb Gordon, who owns several foreign and domestic dealerships in Silver Spring, Md., said business in his service departments had improved in recent weeks, an indication that drivers were starting to loosen their wallets and pocketbooks. Other dealers also reported an increase in service business, but suggested that many car owners could simply no longer delay needed repairs.
Joseph Medwin, the general manager of Konner Chevrolet Geo in West Caldwell, N.J., about 25 miles from New York City, said his showroom traffic was up, although his dealership sold 10 percent fewer cars in recent weeks than the previous year.
"There seems to be buyers out there, but people just seem a little hesitant," Mr. Medwin said. "They're at least looking for cars."
The General Motors Corporation sold 56,872 cars in mid-December, down by 5.2 percent over last year. But one G.M. division posted a gain in car sales in the period, Buick, on the strength of sales of its redesigned LeSabre model. G.M. sold 31,626 light trucks, a decline of 7.3 percent.
 
Ford Car Sales Off 5.9%
 The Ford Motor Company posted a 5.9 percent drop in car sales, to 30,447. Its light-truck sales rose by 17.6 percent, to 30,091.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped by 17.7 percent, to 13,400, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports. Chrysler does not report its 10-day sales figures.
Chrysler's light-truck sales, including mini-vans and Jeeps, rose by 15.6 percent, to 18,500, Ward's estimated.
The Honda Motor Company sold 9,473 domestically produced cars in the middle of last month, a gain of 48.4 percent. But Honda's figures were soft for the December 1990 period because a special incentive had expired at the end of November.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 7,604 American-built cars in the period, an increase of 21.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Auto Plants to Shut

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Chrysler, Ford Motor and General Motors will close 29 of their North American assembly plants next week -- temporarily laying off nearly 74,500 hourly auto workers -- because of slow dealer orders, the companies said today. In addition, five other plants will be closed because of retooling or material shortages. Auto makers routinely shut assembly plants to bring production into line with sales. But the automobile industry was particularly wounded in 1991 by the national recession, which sharply eroded demand for new cars, and the cutbacks announced today reflected those problems. The number of layoffs during the first full week of the new year will be about 12,500 more than during the corresponding week in 1991.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Despite Signs Recession Continues in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against key European currencies yesterday in post-holiday trading despite new evidence of economic weakness in the United States.
Currency traders attributed the dollar's strength to short-term demand after the closing of financial markets on New Year's Day. Some said there was a feeling in the foreign exchange market that the dollar might have been oversold recently, which prompted some traders to buy the currency. 
 Others said speculation was growing that United States interest rates, which have declined significantly as a result of the recession, are not likely to drop further, which would at least be a reason not to sell the dollar. Cheaper interest rates make dollar-denominated investments worth less.
"People think this is a bottom for us," said Ziggy Zborowski, a foreign-exchange trader at the New York branch of Bank Leumi Trust Co.
Mr. Zborowski also said a rumor circulated that German monetary officials, who last month increased interest rates unexpectedly, were not likely to raise them again. He said that also helped the dollar, which gained more than a pfennig against the German mark.
But others said most of the dollar's strength yesterday was from short-covering, in which traders who had sold borrowed dollars bought them back to repay lenders. That created an artificially strong demand.
"The economic data certaintly wouldn't support a higher dollar," said Michael Kahn, a trader at the New York branch of Credit Suisse, the Swiss banking concern. "Thin trading and short-covering got the market moving."
More evidence of a prolonged United States bout with recession emerged yesterday. The National Association of Purchasing Management's closely watched index on the health of the nation's industry fell sharply in December, and the Government said construction spending fell in November after four months of improvement.
Tokyo financial markets remained closed yesterday in an extended break. In Europe, the dollar fetched 124.50 yen, down from 125.25 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday. Later in New York, the dollar fetched 124.60 yen, down from 124.78.
The British pound weakened in London to $1.8685, from $1.8718 late Tuesday. By the time trading concluded in New York, the pound traded at $1.8655, down from $1.8685 Tuesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. levels late Tuesday: 1.5315 marks, up from 1.5170; 1.3665 Swiss francs, up from 1.3590; 1.1509 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1555; 5.2305 French francs, up from 5.1845, and 1,158.00 Italian lire, up from 1,149.25.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
How Much Aid To Give the East?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AMID great turmoil and doubts, Russia has taken its historic plunge to economic and political freedom. And the United States, perhaps belatedly, is moving to organize Western aid for Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union that must rebuild collapsing economies.
At Princeton University last month Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the popularly elected leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the other republics are looking to America and the West for "guidance and help in launching genuine, far-reaching political and economic reform." But how much can the United States, running a budget deficit expected to exceed $350 billion this year, do to help the ex-Communist countries? 
 With the shortage of public funds, political pressures have been building on the Government to scale back its global commitments, pay more attention to domestic needs and strengthen America's ability to compete internationally.
Indeed, this may be the prime issue of the 1992 election. President Bush, accompanied by 21 American business executives, has billed his trip to Japan and other countries of the Pacific Rim as a move to create American jobs by opening markets and selling more American goods abroad.
Nevertheless, Secretary Baker will, sometime soon, summon a conference in Washington of the industrial countries to discuss measures to aid Russia and the other independent states. The date for the conference has not been disclosed; nor have which countries will be invited to attend and the specific agenda.
However, it seems evident that the United States, as it did during the Persian Gulf war, means to take the lead in mobilizing the capital and other resources of its partners to help rescue Russia and the others. In his address at Princeton, Mr. Baker said, "Together with our NATO allies, Japan, South Korea, the other O.E.C.D. states, our gulf coalition partners, we must pursue a diplomacy of collective engagement."
But there was caution in his call for aid. "We alone cannot determine whether these new democrats will succeed," he said. "Their success lies in their own hands, in the hard choices they make. But history will count our efforts a success if we help the democrats hold open opportunities to determine a better future." A major goal of the West, he added, will be to help promote "a process where even limited successes build hope and the authority of the democrats over time." Process and hope are not quite the same as money.
How much capital is really needed for the reconstruction and integration of Russia and Eastern Europe into the Western economy, and who will provide it? Nobody knows.
According to an estimate by David Suratgar of Morgan Grenfell & Company, writing in the journal World Link, the costs should amount to about $180 billion a year for 10 years for the capital stock of those countries in the East to reach the level of Western industrial countries. Since the Russians and others cannot possibly raise such sums internally, Mr. Suratgar estimates that their external financial requirements will come to more than $100 billion a year for 10 years.
That figure now looks out of reach. Writing in The Economist, Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who has been an adviser to the Russian and Polish Governments, proposes that about $30 billion a year go to Russia and the other independent republics for the next three or four years.
He suggests that the contributions be divided as follows: $5 billion a year from the International Monetary Fund, $4 billion from the World Bank, $3 billion from the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, plus $10 billion a year from the Western countries. He puts the United States and Japan down for $3 billion each. These sums look relatively modest. Germany alone is spending more than $50 billion a year on the integration of East Germany, with its population of only 20 million people.
Still, official capital is in tight supply. Government loans and grants to Russia and Eastern Europe will have to be augmented by the investments of private businesses, if they are to be integrated into the West. Private businesses in America, Europe and Japan have a huge contribution to make in transferring not only capital but also technology, marketing and managerial skills to the East. Through joint ventures, they can speed the process of privatization.
But the commercial risks are high, and private businesses will need the financial support, insurance or guarantees of Western governments, as well as their legal and diplomatic help. These are issues to be thrashed out when Mr. Baker assembles his foreign partners at the aid conference in Washington -- and as soon as possible, meets with Congressional leaders. Just as President Harry Truman needed the Republicans for the Marshall Plan, President Bush now needs the Democrats.

HEADLINE: Little Anger Among Those on Bush Trip

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
For all the Japanese fears that the business executives joining President Bush on his Asian trip are coming to protest their trade policies, many of these leaders will probably bear a friendlier message. Many have already prospered from contracts with Japanese companies and see the trip as a chance to drum up business.
J. Bronce Henderson 3d, chief executive of Detroit Center Tool Inc., simply wishes to sell the Japanese his most advanced welding systems. For him, the President's trip represents an unusual opportunity to get the attention of top Japanese auto executives, said Paul Diettmer, the company's manager of advertising. 
 Detroit Center Tool has already sold its welding systems, which cost as much as $100 million, to Toyota in Canada and in California.
"We want to expose the Japanese to the quality technology we have available," Mr. Diettmer said. "You have to be persistent when working with the Japanese. You have to play by their rules and do your homework."
But if most of the executives traveling with the President bear glad tidings, the chairmen of the Big Three auto makers appear ready for battle. They have complained frequently that they are unfairly excluded from selling cars and trucks to the Japanese, and their views have received the most attention so far. The auto makers have called on the Japanese Government to restrain exports even more as a way of reducing the United States' $40 billion annual trade deficit with Japan.
For example, Harold A. Poling, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, has proposed 20 percent annual reductions for five years. "I would say to them, 'You figure out how to do it,' " Mr. Poling said two weeks ago. The Chrysler Corporation has asked the President to limit the sales of Japanese cars, while the General Motors Corporation has made no specific proposal.
While sales of vehicles made by G.M., Ford and Chrysler have been battered by the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Nissan Motor Company, the Honda Motor Company and other Japanese auto makers, the Big Three are themselves important purchasers of Japanese-made vehicles, engines, machine tools and other parts.
Just one of the 21 executives on the trip was available to speak about it. Many of the others would rather allow the White House to take the lead at a time of some economic tension. Administration officials have expressed concern that the outspokenness of Lee A. Iacocca, the Chrysler chairman, could provoke a diplomatic uproar.
 
Some Past Victories
 The trip's roster includes executives who could testify to some notable victories in Japan. Motorola Inc., represented by Robert W. Galvin, a former chairman, has successfully sold telecommunications equipment in Japan, with the help of United States Government pressure.
Most delegates, like Maurice R. Greenberg of American International Group Inc., were invited because they represent private or government trade groups that promote business and cooperation between the United States and Asia. Mr. Greenberg is president of the U.S. Association of South East Asia Nations Business Council; his company has more than 10,000 insurance agents in Japan. James D. Robinson 3d, chairman of the American Express Company, is a member of the President's advisory council for trade policy.
Some members of the delegation represent smaller companies that are trying to crack the Japanese market. Robert J. Maricich, president of American of Martinsville , furniture company in Martinsville, Va., said that in 18 months of efforts in Japan, he had found business partners but no orders so far -- only encouraging prospects. "I think we've done everything we can do to get into the dance, but I don't think we'll know for another year whether we are dancing," he said.
Mr. Maricich said that his opportunities to do business had been fair. "I think we've discovered it's a pretty level playing field" in the furniture business, he told President Bush at a White House meeting a few weeks ago.
Mr. Maricich counsels cooperation, not confrontation. "I plan to tell the Japanese that it's important to minimize trade imbalances, but I don't believe in putting up restrictions in our country."
Mr. Bush started his trip Tuesday in Australia, and plans stops in Singapore and South Korea, but the most important action will take place in Japan. His four-day visit there begins next Tuesday.
The auto executives will arrive for the Japanese portion of the trip; only some of the others will be along for the entire trip. Beyond vague urgings for fair treatment, few American executives have offered concrete suggestions for Government action to help them succeed in Japan. Those who have done business there say there are few short cuts: Executives have to learn the language, spend time cultivating relationships and invest heavily in research and development.
 
A Host of Reasons
 "Japan has never been an easy market to do business in and never will be, for a host of cultural, historical and linguistic reasons that have nothing to do with government," said Steven Schlossstein, a Princeton, N.J., consultant to companies doing business in Japan.
Nevertheless, international trade experts think the visit to Japan could prod Japanese companies to do more business with their American counterparts so as to head off protectionist measures brewing in Congress. Lawmakers from Michigan and political opponents of the President promise to introduce legislation that would cap the Japanese share of the American auto market if the trade deficit is not reduced.
To prevent that, Japanese auto makers have pledged to increase purchases from United States suppliers. Many American suppliers wish to export to Japan -- and sell to Japanese companies in this country -- but have had little success penetrating the cozy relationships between Japanese auto makers and Japanese parts manufacturers.
American automotive suppliers have criticized the Japanese auto makers' practice of maintaining exclusive relationships with some suppliers. But manufacturing experts suggest that great perseverance can pay off.
The ASC Corporation of Southgate, Mich., will be represented in the delegation by the company's chairman, Heinz C. Prechter, who is also chairman of the President's Export Council. His company has won contracts to supply convertible tops to Toyota and other Japanese auto makers -- but only after 15 years of cultivating contacts in Japan. In a previous interview, Mr. Prechter said the lengthy wait reflected not unfairness but normal practices in a nation where companies feel great loyalty to their long-term suppliers.
 
Textron's Goals
 Textron Inc., whose chairman, Beverly F. Dolan, is traveling on the mission and also serves on the President's Export Council, wants to go beyond selling helicopters and some other products in Japan.
"We feel we have the quality and the expertise to supply the Japanese market" with auto parts including armrests and dashboards, a company spokesman said.
The Japanese blame foreign auto makers themselves for their scant sales in Japan, saying they have failed to develop vehicle models that are tailored to Japanese consumers, with steering wheels on the right-hand side.
But Japanese officials are said to be considering reductions in exports of vehicles to the United States, under the current voluntary agreement. American trade experts expect the Japanese to present President Bush with such a measure, or other concessions, if only as conciliatory gestures.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Very Stingy Year for Dividends

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The year just ended was in some ways the worst on record in terms of dividend actions, with fewer companies providing good news for shareholders than at any time since comparable figures began to be compiled in 1955, the Standard & Poor's Corporation reported yesterday.
Nonetheless, the year ended with some limited signs of revival. In December, as in two of the previous three months, more companies announced dividend increases than had done so in the comparable month of 1990. That provided some hope that the decline in corporate profits might be about to end.
 
Fewest Increases on Record
 The poor overall dividend figures reflected the recession and the cash-flow problems that have hit many companies burdened by debts left over from the 1980's and hurt by a slowdown in sales. 
 The essential strength of the American economy is reflected in the fact that even in a bad year, there were more than three times as many good announcements -- of dividend increases, extra dividends or dividend reinstatements -- as bad ones -- dividend reductions and omissions.
The total of 1,458 good announcements was the smallest for any year since S.& P. began keeping such figures in 1955, and was down 14 percent from 1990. With the number of companies cutting payouts climbing, a total of 437 bad announcements were recorded, the most since the 1982 recession.
The ratio of good to bad, at 3.3 to 1, was the lowest since 1958, a recession year that saw a flood of dividend cuts and a ratio of just 2.7 to 1.
As recently as 1988, there were more than 12 good dividend announcements for every bad one.
One of the most closely watched figures is the number of companies announcing dividend increases, which fell 14 percent, to 1,086, in 1991. That was the lowest for any year since 1970 and 1971, when Federal wage and price controls held the figures down. Excluding that period, the 1991 figure was the lowest since an identical figure of 1,086 in 1962.
 
Still Awaiting 'Happy Days'
 Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, noted that the increases were in relation to the depressed levels of late 1990, after the recession had begun and while Iraq was still occupying Kuwait. "The increase is not really an indication that happy days are here again," he said.
The seasonal high for dividend increases normally runs from November to February, as companies anticipate or react to good annual profit news. But while December's total of 102 dividend increases was up from 88 a year earlier, it was otherwise the lowest total for any December since 1960.
One bright point in the dividend picture was that fewer companies -- 250 -- omitted dividends in 1991, compared with 266 in 1990. But both years were the worst in almost a decade, trailing 1982, when 315 companies were forced to omit dividends.
Despite the recession, there appears to have been a small increase in the dividends paid on the stocks in the S.& P. 500 index as a group. That payout is computed based on what would be received by an owner of all 500 stocks, whose holdings of mostly fractional shares were worth a total of the S.& P. index's stated price, which was $417.26 yesterday. Mr. Kaufman estimated the figure for 1991 will be $12.20, only a quarter of a percent above the 1990 figure of $12.17.
It may seem amazing that the stock market could rise with the dividend picture so bleak, but history shows that stock prices are more likely to rise when the dividend news is less robust. By that measure, the 20 percent increase in the Dow Jones industrial average last year should have come as no surprise.
A way to measure that, known as the Dividend Dip indicator, compares the number of companies that increase payouts over a six-month period with the number that did so in the six-month period a year earlier. For the last half of 1991, that number was down 19.
Under the Dividend Dip indicator, invented by this columnist in the summer of 1987 when it gave a sell signal less than four months before that year's stock market crash, it is good to buy stocks so long as the change is negative. Indeed, this indicator is continuing to give a buy signal. Should the total for the first six months of this year be higher than the total in the 1991 period, however, that indicator would give a sell signal at the end of June.
The logic behind this may be that dividend actions are often a lagging indicator of the economy, while stock prices are a leading indicator. Many companies have a tradition of increasing dividends every year, and strive to continue doing so until the news is so bad they must stop. Similarly, companies may hesitate to raise dividends until they are confident that profits are rising.
Had an investor used the Dividend-Dip indicator since the end of 1956, when it gave its first buy signal, buying the stocks in the Dow when the indicator was bullish and staying out of the market when it was negative, an initial investment of $1,000 would now be worth $11,610, ignoring dividends and interest on the money earned while the money was not invested in stocks. In all, that investor would have owned stocks for 16.5 of the 35 years.
By contrast, a buy-and-hold strategy over the same period, again ignoring dividends, would have seen that $1,000 grow into $6,344.

Fewer File For Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 29,000 in the third week of December, erasing part of an earlier surge, the Government said today.
There were 438,000 Americans filing their first claims for unemployment assistance in the week that ended on Dec. 21, down from the previous week's revised figure of 467,000, the Labor Department said. 
 The latest decline was the second straight drop, after a 20,000 decrease during the second week of December, the department said.
 
Does Not Erase Surge
 But both declines combined still have not completely erased a 79,000 surge in early December, when claims climbed to nearly 500,000, back to the worst levels of the recession.
"The perception that the labor market is weak and has declined should remain intact," said Sam Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. "Whether it's about to deteriorate again or whether it's about to improve, we can't tell from today's number."
The claims number can be extremely volatile from week to week, and analysts hesitate to read too much into a one-week movement. Instead, they look to a four-week average of claims for a better barometer of hiring practices.
With today's decline, the four-week average stands at 453,000, down from the previous four-week average of 463,000.
But the four-week average is up from the levels of September, when economists thought the nation's jobs picture might be improving.
 
Average at 450,000
 In August and September, Mr. Kahan said, the four-week average hovered close to 425,000. But since November, the average has been around 450,000, he said.
The number of Americans actually receiving unemployment benefits climbed to 3.5 million during the week that ended on Dec. 14, up by 128,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said.
About 8.5 million Americans are out of work. The nation's unemployment rate is 6.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Mayor's Speech: A Vision of a City

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from yesterday's State of the City address by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
We have just ended another very difficult year, as life proved to be a little harder, a little harsher than the year before. It has been a year that began with the threat of war abroad and that concluded with tragedy and injustice here at home, as nine promising young people were taken from us so cruelly in a stairwell at City College. . . . 
 If the events of last year have taught us anything, it is that none of us can escape the hazards of this very real, very serious national recession.
I understand the feelings of hopelessness -- and helplessness -- that this recession has caused for too many New Yorkers. . . .
In facing these difficult times, we realize there are some things we cannot change by ourselves: a turnaround in the national economy will happen only when Washington commits itself to better lives for our people. . . . Indeed, as we work to fill gaps of billions of dollars where there once was Federal aid, we sometimes, feel, quite frankly, as if Washington has placed a giant boulder in the paths of all state and local officials, directing us to roll it up the steepest of hills. Yet, we cannot let the callous elimination of Federal dollars crush our dreams.
We must begin as I have always begun -- by hearing the voices of our people, especially of those whose pain is too great and whose voices are too small. For a government that succumbs to silence can accomplish nothing and will wither in the depths of its own isolation.
The voice of a young mother who wants to work, but who cannot find adequate day care facilities in which to place her children, resounds in my ears. Her words inspired my efforts to develop programs that help people find jobs while their children are in centers staffed by devoted and loving child care workers.
I remember the voices I heard one cold December morning during my visit to the bread line at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi. One man waiting in line told me: "I don't want my family and neighbors to see me this way. I don't intend to be here next year." I understood just what he meant. My resolve to build a shelter system that offers our thousands of homeless residents a dignified place to stay on their journey home was strengthened that day.
The grief-stricken voices of the family of James Zappalorti, a developmentally disabled young man from Staten Island who died merely because of whom he chose to love, cannot be erased from my memory. And I pledged to James's family that I will continue to fight for the passage of a bias-related violence bill -- legislation that has been held up for too long in Albany because of a handful of Senate Republicans.
The voice of a disabled person crystallized the cruelties of our own thoughtlessness as he explained to me the difficulty of pressing an elevator emergency button, if you must reach that button from a wheelchair. So I have made it my job to further the access of disabled residents throughout this city.
And today I also hear the voices of all our people saying much more needs to be done right now in order to turn this city around.
Now some have suggested that we simply cut and cut away at the services that affect the lives of the most vulnerable among us. But as long as I am Mayor, I refuse to do that. Of course bond ratings are important, but we are judged against a higher standard. We have so many who need so much; I have not turned my back on them, and I never will. I came into government hearing the voices of those in need, and I will never stop listening.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We all know that local government cannot change the course of a national economy that is headed in the wrong direction. Nor can we stand by and drift into ever-deeper waters of despair. We have developed a package of programs to help make a small dent in the burdens of our residents during this time of economic hardship. . . .
I know that a dozen years of reactionary politics in Washington have served to reduce the real incomes of families across America. . . . That's why I have proposed to stabilize property taxes over at least the next two years.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our course is clear. We must hold firm to our vision of this city. A city that stands for openness and compassion, for fiscal integrity and prudence, and most of all, a city that stands for opportunity -- the opportunity that generations of immigrants understood when they saw Ellis Island for the first time. . . .
It is the opportunity that awaits two Brooklyn College graduates, Lisette Nieves, our newest Rhodes Scholar, and Marshall Scholar Toba Friedman -- daughters and granddaughters of families who came here seeking all that New York has to offer, two young women who earned the right to make their dreams come true. Graduates of our public school system, they prove that the energy and ambition that built this city still shine brightly today, and that the promise of New York is within reach of us all.

HEADLINE: Dinkins as a Populist: Hearing 'Our People'

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's speech on the state of New York City was not so much a summary of the present as a political summons to the future, aimed at assuring restive supporters that he would not abandon the poor to balance the budget, even as he pledged new efforts to appease the middle class.
The Mayor's speech, delivered at the midpoint of his term with his popularity low and his electoral coalition shaken, was less a public report card than the product of having assessed his prospects in private and found them wanting. In forceful and unusually blunt tones, he unleashed what many in the invited audience of city officials and supporters said was the opening salvo of his re-election campaign. 
 "Now some have suggested that we simply cut and cut away at the services that affect the lives of the most vulnerable among us," he said. "But as long as I am Mayor, I refuse to do that. Of course bond ratings are important, but we are judged against a higher standard. We have so many who need so much.; I have not turned my back on them, and I never will. I came into government hearing the voices of those in need, and I will never stop listening."
How well that populist oratory can be translated into reality remains to be seen. The Mayor still faces billion-dollar budget gaps in each of the next several years, closing them will require new rounds of cuts in city services already bleeding and Mr. Dinkins has limited room to maneuver, especially since he reaffirmed his plans to hire thousands of new police officers. He has been unable to reach agreement with the municipal unions on shrinking the work force.
 
A Dual Message
 But by outlining a grab bag of proposals that would cost little money but could end up saving some eventually, the Mayor's aides said he hoped to send a dual message of fiscal conservatism administered with a compassionate approach. He spoke, for example, of placing management of more repossessed apartment buildings back in private hands, under the aegis of nonprofit groups, which could please business people who have urged the city to shed some of its burdens and grass-roots groups, who favor greater community control.
"That's the speech I've been waiting for for two years," said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and an early Dinkins supporter who has lately been highly critical of him. "I could hug and kiss him for that kind of comment about what the city needs. Hopefully, now this may be the beginning of an initiative to get those programs accomplished, even with very limited resources."
At the same time, Alfred C. Cerullo 3d of Staten Island, the City Council's Republican minority leader, while not happy with the Mayor's attacks on Republicans in Washington, praised his pledge to freeze property tax rates for two years, eliminate permit fees for minor construction and free 5,000 small businesses from licensing and fee requirements.
"He obviously is reaching out to the middle class more publicly than I have ever seen him do before," Mr. Cerullo said.
In preparing the speech, Mr. Dinkins set himself the challenge of rallying a city racked by recession and the turmoil of his two years in office, and in delivering it, he acknowledged "the feelings of hopelessness -- and helplessness -- that this recession has caused for too many New Yorkers." But he insisted, "There is more hope in this city than there are street corners."
 
Listening to People
 Even as some of his own aides and supporters have complained that Mr. Dinkins has become too defensive amid the city's mounting problems, unwilling to listen to their advice or criticism, he promised to take the operations of City Hall to offices in each borough for a week at a time in the coming months, to hear "the voices of our people."
"For a government that succumbs to silence can accomplish nothing and will wither in the depths of its own isolation," he said.
Delivering on those promises will be much harder than delivering the speech. Some of his ideas, like creating a new class of taxi medallions, will undoubtedly face stiff political opposition, while others, like expanding neighborhood health clinics to relieve overcrowding in hospital emergency rooms, will mean moving big operations with meager resources.
The Mayor spoke passionately of his proposals for building new homeless shelters around the city, some in middle-class areas, to provide better health and mental care to residents, saying, "While we may disagree over the precise address of our new residences, I am certain we will agree that the thousands of residents who live on our streets are God's children too, and must have a place in our neighborhoods." But the political challenge of making the plan come true was apparent when the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who would have to approve it, did not join the applause for that line.
 
No Financial Details
 "It was a wonderful speech," said Councilman Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, chairman of the Finance Committee. "The issue is how to implement the ideas. The policies he's outlined are wonderful. The issue is how you can carry them out, and that we have yet to see."
Mr. Dinkins did not provide financial or operational details for virtually any of his new proposals, or on his plans for keeping the budget balanced, deferring that until he presents his preliminary budget in two weeks.
Yet, unlike his state of the city speech a year ago, which struck such a relentlessly optimistic tone just as the depth of the city's problems was becoming apparent that it seemed unrealistic, this address took a more sober approach. He spoke of his efforts to lobby Washington and Albany for more aid, to make urban America's case with the rest of the country.
"But we are realistic," he said. "We know that, at least in the short run, our future is in our hands alone."

HEADLINE: New Measure Will Punish Fraud in Car Registration

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
New Yorkers and other out-of-staters who try to beat high automobile-insurance rates by falsely registering their cars in New Jersey will face stiff fines -- up to $15,000 -- under a bill signed into law today by Gov. Jim Florio.
The new law makes it a violation of the state's Fraud Prevention Act for any out-of-state motorist to misrepresent his legal residence in applying for automobile insurance. First offenders can be fined $5,000, a second offense is subject to a fine of $10,000, and third and subsequent offenses, $15,000. 
 "People engage in this type of fraud to save money though New Jersey's lower auto insurance rates, so the best way to eliminate this type of fraud is to remove the economic incentive by fining violators," Governor Florio said in signing the bill in Newark today.
Although New Jersey residents complain about high insurance rates, they are still substantially lower than those paid in high-claim areas like New York City and Philadelphia, where investigators say rate evasion is most common.
 
Contrast in Rates
 Rates in New Jersey, according to the Insurance Department, currently average about $1,000 a year, but insuring a car in New York City or Philadelphia can cost more than $3,000 a year because of the high accident and theft rate.
The most common method of evading the high rates charged in those urban areas is to register a car in New Jersey using an address of a vacation home on the Jersey Shore, or arranging with New Jersey relatives to use their addresses, particularly in rural or suburban areas where rates are lower.
Mr. Florio said such evasions cost New Jersey drivers about $100 a year in added premiums to make up for claims made against policies fraudulently written using New Jersey addresses.
The extent of the problem was suggested last May 20, when investigators from the New Jersey Insurance Fraud Division went into Philadelphia and several New York City boroughs to list and photograph vehicles bearing New Jersey plates between 6 and 9:30 in the morning. They recorded a total of 1,147 New Jersey plates, 663 in New York City and 484 in Philadelphia, many on expensive luxury cars. The disparity in insurance rates is biggest on more expensive cars because of the higher cost of repairs or replacement.
After investigators checked the vehicle registrations against other records -- local tax rolls, credit reports, post office records, school registrations, utility bills, telephone directory listings, employment records, insurance applications, voter registrations and lease company records -- to determine the actual residence of the owners, about 800 were found to actually live in New Jersey.
But without a specific statute specifically making such fraudulent registation a crime, rate evaders were only subject to civil penalties if they filed a claim against their insurance. The normal course of action when an insurer discovered fraudulent registration, usually after a claim was filed, was to rescind the policy and refund the premium.
Rate evaders who had not filed any claims could in theory be prosecuted criminally for theft by deception -- getting a lower rate by lying about the address -- but prosecution and proof were difficult, and in 1989, the most recent year for which statistics were available, only 23 people were indicted for theft by deception in such cases.
 
13,000 Cases Investigated
 But the Fraud Division actually received more than 30,000 complaints of rate evasion between 1988 and 1990, when investigators began to focus on the problem. In 1990, about 13,000 cases were investigated, and nearly 40 percent involved rate evaders who had filed claims.
Investigators said 95 percent of the cases involved out-of-state residents fraudulently claiming New Jersey addresses.
New Jersey insurance officials also said the new law would allow insurance companies and law-enforcement officials broader authority to physically inspect vehicles for which applicants have requested insurance.
In some cases, the insured person simply lies on the application, creating a vehicle that does not exist, gets a policy, then reports the nonexistent car stolen and collects on the policy. Insurance companies refer to this type of fraud as "the phantom vehicle scheme."

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

It's Better to Receive
Museums can't stop talking about what they got for Christmas. Despite cuts in public and private aid caused by the recession, museums -- both big and small -- are reporting a rush of year-end gifts of top-quality artworks. The reason: a Federal tax law that permits donors of valuable objects to deduct their full market value, determined by an outside appraiser, on income-tax returns. 
 Initially the law was a one-year "window" that went into effect last January and was to expire at the end of 1991. But Congress extended it for six months after a lobbying campaign led by the American Association of Museums. The provision began as an experiment after Congressional leaders realized that the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which eliminated such deductions, had resulted in a significant drop in donations to museums.
Late this month, the House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to hold hearings on all temporary tax provisions, with the possibility that the law will become permanent. But museum officials still worry that some members of Congress, concerned with the loss of tax revenue, will voice strong opposition.
For now, however, museums across the country were being flooded with gifts until the final hours of 1991, even though the new deadline is June 30. "Donors and their accountants still think in terms of the year end," said Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "And the amount of gifts we've received is very heartening."
Mr. Hawkins reports that 285 donors gave the Met about $40 million worth of art in 1991. This is a significant increase from 1990, before the tax incentive, when 156 donors gave the Met artworks valued at $9 million. "There's been a pent-up desire to give," Mr. Hawkins said. "Donors have been waiting for this opportunity. And we hope the response shows the legislators how important this tax incentive is."
Peter Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, agreed. "It's been incredible," he said, "not just in terms of numbers but also the quality. We've gotten a lot of big-ticket items." Among them are a 1951 Magritte painting, "The Kiss"; Maurice Vlaminck's "The Barge at Le Pecq," from 1909, and a Georgia O'Keeffe, "White Shell With Red Hills," from 1938.
In fact, quality seems to be the buzzword among museum directors. "We've really gotten some wonderful things we've wanted for our collections," said Richard E. Oldenburg, director of the Museum of Modern Art. "Donors have been from all over the country." Among the artists whose work the museum has received recently are Monet, Philip Guston, Jim Dine and Ross Bleckner.
The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis is also touting donations that include works by big-name artists from Mark Rothko to Andy Warhol. "It's more than Santa; it's the Government," said Kathy Halbreich, the museum's director. "We would like to look at this not as a loophole, but as a future incentive. If you believe museums are important places, then there's a serious social urgency here, a real concern that this law won't be extended again. And that message needs to get across."
 
Auction Sales Slump
 In contrast with museums, 1991 was the year the auction houses stopped believing in Santa Claus. Their sales figures for the year show a dramatic slump. The area hit hardest by the recession was paintings, especially the Impressionist, modern and contemporary categories. At Sotheby's, worldwide sales for 1991 totaled $1.1 billion, a decline of 54.9 percent from a year earlier, when the company reported a total of $2.4 billion and an even more significant drop from 1989, when sales totaled $2.9 billion. Christie's is reporting 1991 worldwide sales at $1.03 billion, a steady slide from $1.96 billion in 1990 and $2.14 billion in 1989. Both companies had a difficult autumn. Sotheby's autumn sales worldwide amounted to $512.9 million, down 24.6 percent from 1990. Fall totals for Christie's worldwide came to $468 million, a 20 percent decline from 1990.
The economic recession and the Persian Gulf war were two major reasons for the drop. Another was the large decline in both volume and prices of the houses' sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary paintings, which have traditionally been their bread and butter. "Several factors have contributed to the downturn," said Michael L. Ainslie, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house's parent company. "One of the biggest was the absence of quality. The uncertainty in the market has lead to a constriction of supply. For the most part, sellers have either been under financial pressures or they have been heirs with estate property."
Indeed, voluntary sellers are generally holding onto their property until the market shows signs of recovery. As a result, the auction houses are finding themselves in a Catch-22 situation. Since people are reluctant to offer works for sale, both Sotheby's and Christie's are having trouble putting together strong auctions that will generate high prices. "Fortunately, the few good things that came to us this last year did well," Mr. Ainslie said. "The result is that we are now seeing more voluntary sellers than we did a year ago. People want to know where price levels are, and this season has shown us a lot."
Categories like decorative arts and Old Masters, which didn't become wildly inflated when Japanese buyers began dominating sales in 1989, were the strongest in 1991. Sotheby's, for example, reports that decorative arts made up about 55 percent of its overall sales totals this year, compared with 38 percent and 30 percent in 1990 and 1989, respectively.
"These figures weren't really a surprise," Mr. Ainslie said. "Paintings had gotten to such outrageous levels they had to drop. And one of the benefits about being a full-line auction house is that the smaller departments have been able to pull us through these difficult times."
Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York, said that in departments like silver, porcelain, and French and English furniture, prices have been higher than in the boom years of the late 1980's. "And jewelry held firm, too, which was surprising, since it is the luxury end of the market," he said. "It shows that even though painting prices have slipped back to 1987 levels, as we predicted they would, there is still money out there waiting to be spent."
Mr. Burge said he believes that the field of contemporary paintings also shows hopeful signs. "The current group of younger artists who weren't on the scene five years ago are now appearing at auction," he said. "And for the first time the field has become international, in terms of artists and buyers."
But perhaps the biggest surprise in the auction house's new figures is that Christie's now has a 48 percent market share of worldwide sales, its highest since the mid-1950's, against Sotheby's 52 percent. "The big jump occurred in the first half of the year," Mr. Burge said. "In New York we now have over 50 percent of the Impressionist and modern market. They have taken the lead in the contemporary field."
Mr. Ainslie said: "Being a market leader is important to us. The reason for this year's decline is that Christie's had great numbers in their Old Masters sales. They did $135 million of business worldwide, and we did only $65 million. It's one field where we have to get more aggressive."
Both companies report that as profits decline, they are freezing salaries for their senior management. But Christie's reports that there will be no staff cuts. "We want to be fully staffed when the recovery begins," Mr. Burge said.
Sotheby's, the larger of the two houses, is looking at things differently. "We're examining every job carefully," Mr. Ainslie said.
 
Freud's Antiquities
 Experts analyzing Sigmund Freud's personal collection of antiquities agree: the master of psychoanalysis had a less-than-perfect eye for art. "There's nothing here I'd buy," said Edward H. Merrin, a Manhattan antiquities dealer after viewing the exhibition "The Sigmund Freud Antiquities: Fragments From a 'Buried Past,' " on view through Feb. 18 at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, Manhattan.
Michael Ward, another Manhattan dealer, said he believed the collection was of little value in today's market. "It's a totally different type of collection than anyone would put together today," he said. "It's not about connoisseurship, but about acquiring for symbolic and religious reasons."
Of the small solid-cast Roman figurine of Athena from the first or second century A.D. that held a central position on Freud's desk, Mr. Ward said: "It's crude. Artistically it doesn't represent the best Roman piece of its time." But Dr. Harold Blum of Roslyn Estates, L.I., a psychoanalyst, psychologist and executive director of Freud's archives, said the figurine was one of Freud's favorite pieces. "It had many meanings for him: wisdom, fertility, the protector of civilization," Dr. Blum said.
Indeed, the rich symbolism in the collection is what intrigues dealers far more than the quality of the works. "I was totally overwhelmed because it makes you think about the relevance of antiquities," said Torkom Demirjian, owner of Ariadne, a Madison Avenue gallery. "Freud used collecting as a means of self-discovery."
Dr. Blum said he believed Freud's preoccupation with objects was symbolic of his belief that so much of mental life is buried in the unconscious. "These pieces represent many senses -- for example, the childhood of man and the infancy of civilization," he said. "Antiquities were his way of linking the past with the present."
Even the dealers couldn't put a price on that.

A Time Capsule's Messages to Posterity

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"The Class of the 20th Century," the 12-part series that begins on Sunday at 8 P.M. on the Arts & Entertainment Network, is billed as "a kaleidoscopic view of the 20th century, as seen through the eyes of people who helped shape it." The agglomeration is to be stored in the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan for anyone extant in the year 3000 who might like to know what things were like back now.
The series turns out to be an anthology of anecdotes, mainly from American show-business figures and television personalities, along with a smattering of well-known journalists, politicians and random celebrities. It will be of particular interest to contemporaries who care about the ruminations of Hugh Downs, Howard Cosell and Hildegarde. 
 Sunday's opener, which zips through the years 1900 to 1929 at 21st-century speed, contains segments on cars, World War I, the 1920's and Charles A. Lindbergh. Richard Dreyfuss, the narrator, barely manages to keep up. The result is not exactly, or inexactly, history, but it is a spirited show that is bound to stir memories in viewers of a certain age.
To the accompaniment of well-edited, if sometimes familiar, newsreel clips, Hildegarde remembers patriotic neighbors in the Midwest throwing rocks at German-American families like her own in 1917. Julia Child remembers making wine in a cellar during Prohibition. The fashion designer Bill Blass remembers his father's suicide after the stock-market crash.
There's the young Cab Calloway hi-de-ho-ing at the Cotton Club in the 1920's and the present-day Cab Calloway reminiscing about speakeasies. There's Calvin Coolidge, and there are Dr. Benjamin Spock and Studs Terkel delivering old Coolidge jokes. Here's Dr. C. Everett Koop describing the welcome-home parade for Colonel Lindbergh -- and there's the parade.
What anybody in the year 3000 will make of such material is problematic, especially in light of Joseph Heller's prediction here that the English language will be stone dead by then, along with the rest of Western civilization.
Each hour ends with a personal message to discoverers of this time capsule from several of its contributors. Assuming that Mr. Heller is incorrect, 31st-century viewers will be able to understand that Hildegarde wishes them peace and Senator Strom Thurmond wishes them health through exercise and diet. A more original and highly characteristic farewell comes from Joseph Papp, the New York City theater impresario who died recently. He wishes everybody a millennium without theater critics.
The series continues on Thursday evenings, beginning next week with the 1930's (radio, the Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joe Louis, Shirley Temple, Hitler) and concluding 10 weeks later with the present (AIDS, the environment, homelessness). No happy ending.
 
'Talking With David Frost'
Channels 13 and 49
Tonight at 9
In his annual White House chat with George and Barbara Bush, David Frost touches on all the big issues, from the recession to the Middle East, in a deferentially inquiring way. He presses the President as far as a courteous guest can if he wants to be invited back. Although the answers are not startling, they offer the outlines of the Republican campaign in this election year.
Mr. Bush grants that he was overly optimistic about the economy until just the other day, but he points out that so were "a lot of people." Will there be a real recovery this year, Mr. Frost asks? "Yes, no question about it," the President says. " He is equally upbeat about his prospects in November: "I think I'm going to be re-elected." As he sees it, the world's glass is not half full; it is "bountifully full." He even expresses confidence that Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, will be overthrown, but he declines to give a date.
Now and then, the President lapses into severe Bushese. Explaining his opposition to some forms of affirmative action, he says, "It gets into, quotas go into numerical, set numbers for doctors or for, it could go into all kinds of things." Reiterating his objections to television coverage of the Clarence Thomas hearings and the William K. Smith trial, he speaks of "this indulgence in such specificity that turned people off." But what is bothering him, it appears, is that people did not in fact turn their sets off. He proposes that this should be done for them. "That's not censorship," he adds.
The setting, a prototypical campaign image, is armchair-cozy. Mrs. Bush comes on briefly to tell of her concern for people with AIDS and to speak of the pleasures of family life. She is as easy to take as ever, even if her reference to herself as "white-haired and a little overweight" is beginning to seem scripted.
 
'Critical Condition'
Channel 4
Tonight at 7:30
In recent months, Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, New York City's biggest municipal hospital, has been suffering the sort of battering that requires emergency treatment, and that is what it receives tonight on Channel 4. "Critical Condition," a 30-minute report by David Diaz, does not make light of the headlined failures, like the apparently preventable death of Yankel Rosenbaum, the Hasidic scholar who was stabbed during the racial violence in Crown Heights last summer, but it does explain how such things can happen.
At the root of the difficulties, Mr. Diaz emphasizes, is the hospital's obligation to attend to everyone who walks into its emergency room. That means 250,000 people a year, mild complaints along with critical cases, social problems along with medical ones. Patients must wait hours for treatment; doctors and nurses are overworked; resources are strained.
Mr. Diaz finds glimmers of hope in new, more efficient facilities and the staff's dedication, but his message, which seems like a mild antacid after the inflammatory exposes of most local news programs, is that Kings County Hospital, like New York City itself, is staggering under the burdens of poverty, homelessness, drugs, crime and attendant miseries of urban life.
 
'The Bill of Rights:
A 200th Anniversary Celebration'
Court Television
Tomorrow and Sunday at 11 A.M.
Evidence that Court Television is not exclusively interested in high-profile scandals like William K. Smith's rape trial will be available tomorrow and again Sunday, when the cable network carries the surprise talk given by the writer Salman Rushdie last month at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's tribute to the First Amendment. Mr. Rushdie, who has been in hiding since February 1989, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran offered a reward for his execution for perceived blasphemies in his novel "The Satanic Verses," has nothing bad to say about freedom of speech. Nor does Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment specialist, or former Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., who opens the hour with a quiet chat.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
At the Met, a Large Sampling Of Small South Asian Works

BYLINE: BY HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
For admirers of South and Southeast Asian art, the Samuel Eilenberg Collection has long been one of New York's hidden treasures. Mr. Eilenberg, a professor (now emeritus) of mathematics at Columbia, has spent decades building up one of the world's premier collections of small-scale Asian sculptures, chiefly in bronze, but including objects in silver, stone, terra cotta and stucco as well.
The Met purchased several pieces over the years, and in 1987 Mr. Eilenberg gave the museum more than 400 as a gift. Almost half of these works, supplemented by a few loans from Mr. Eilenberg himself, have been brought together in an exhibition titled "The Lotus Transcendent." Much of the material will be included in the Met's new Florence and Herbert Irving Galleries of Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture, to be completed in 1994. But schedules, economics and politics being what they are -- the Irving galleries' opening has already been put off more than once -- it is best to see this remarkable gathering while you can. 
 It isn't a show to be caught on the run between Seurat and Stuart Davis. A few of the sculptures make sense from across a room; the Gandharan terra-cotta head of a young man wearing a rakish turban is one, that of a god whose open-mouthed rapture lends him a startling vulnerability is another. But most are the size of what would be mere details in another context, and need slow, close-up viewing to reveal their beauties. This is true, for example, of the thumb-high Shunga-period bronze goddess who wears an outfit as chic as a Chanel suit and has weapons bristling from her coiffure; the tiny Buddhist goddess of dawn, Marichi, depicted as a sow with seven tiny piglets; the lovely Nepalese Shiva and Uma, casually leaning into each other as if posed for a family snapshot; and the minute (two-and-three-eighths-inch-high) Javanese silver Tara, her head bent forward and down as if tensed in adamant concentration.
The collection is especially rich in Javanese bronzes. Martin Lerner, the Met's curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art, who organized the show, said it was considered the most important group outside of Indonesia and the Netherlands. And anyone who saw the recent "Art of Indonesia" show either in Washington or at the Met will not want to miss what really amounts to a fascinating extension of that exhibition. The particular combination of gravity and dynamism found in the large-scale sculpture of the earlier show is fully evident here, and the wall text that describes Javanese artists as "Asia's consummate miniaturist sculptors" does not exaggerate.
"The Lotus Transcendent" offers historical as well as visual revelations. Asian art is often thought to be exclusively religious in nature, a misperception stemming from the fact that most of the secular work has been lost. But in the Eilenberg Collection we find it: in the terra-cotta pull toy of figures riding an elephant; in the carved stone box lids that were probably cheap knockoffs of silver originals made for a court, and in the stone plates carved with high relief scenes from Greek myths.
There is also the notion, only recently under revision, that the art of South and Southeast Asia -- and of many other non-Western cultures, for that matter -- is "timeless," reaching a classical phase early and then sinking into a gradual, static decrepitude. The work in this show tells a very different story. In the Indonesian pieces alone, the variety from early to late and even within a single period is dizzying. And in the art produced in the area we call Pakistan today, the influences of Mediterranean classical, Central Asian, Iranian, and indigenous Indian ideas and styles head a far-reaching list.
This may not amount to exactly the same thing as the pluralism of our own time, but it certainly suggests that the idea of a global culture is not an invention of the 1980's.
"The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from the Samuel Eilenberg Collection" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, through June 28.

HEADLINE: DINKINS PROPOSES EFFORTS TO ROUSE NEW YORK ECONOMY

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
In a broad, hopeful speech intended to build new confidence in his ability to lead New York City through hard economic times, Mayor David N. Dinkins announced measures yesterday to stimulate the city's sagging economy and to ease the burdens of residents and businesses hit hard by the recession.
Mr. Dinkins's second State of the City address, at the midpoint of his term, was studded with a mixture of ambitious ideas and simple gestures, some of which have been previously proposed, and he did not say how he would pay for his plans. The proposals include speeding payments to companies that do business with the city, pushing capital rebuilding projects ahead of schedule, freezing property-tax increases and reducing licensing rules and fees to aid small businesses. 
 While those steps seemed aimed at appeasing middle-class voters, Mr. Dinkins also addressed the poor, offering several plans to help them as well. [News analysis and excerpts, page B2.]
 
'Role of Leadership'
 The Mayor said he planned to open neighborhood health centers in low-income areas to reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms, double the number of schools that serve as community centers, put more housing into the hands of community and not-for-profit groups and create a new class of taxi medallions to expand service to residents outside central Manhattan.
Addressing the City Council chamber, which was packed with invited guests and city officials, Mr. Dinkins maintained that despite the persistent economic decline, New York City's "role of leadership has not changed -- and will not change." He cited recent investments of hundreds of millions of dollars by major corporations and foreign countries in the city as examples.
 
No Financial Details
 During his 45-minute speech, Mr. Dinkins spoke passionately of "hearing the voices of our people, especially those whose pain is too great and whose voices are too small," and he pledged not to abandon them.
"Bond ratings are important, but we are judged against a higher standard," Mr. Dinkins said.
But the Mayor offered no financial details about how and when the measures would be put into effect, especially when the city and state are once again facing mounting budget deficits that will force further budget cuts and even tougher choices. Instead, Mr. Dinkins said such details would be forthcoming when he introduces his preliminary budget for the coming year later this month.
Still, some of the Mayor's proposals could prove difficult to carry out and could take years to come to fruition. For example, the Mayor has proposed turning city vaccination and testing clinics into neighborhood health centers that provide a full range of services to reduce overcrowding in hospitals. The centers would also provide area residents with a family doctor who focuses on preventive medicine.
But the plan could fail to deliver services if some patients unaccustomed to visiting a doctor except in emergencies fail to go to clinics. In addition, the city must find money to upgrade the clinics into full service centers.
Some city and political officials sharply criticized the Mayor's speech, saying that it lacked substance and failed to address some of the city's most serious ills.
 
'Band-Aid Approach'
 The City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, who has indicated that he will run for mayor in the next election, called Mr. Dinkins's proposals "vague promises and cliches" that "will do little to alleviate New Yorkers' pain and anxiety about the future."
Mr. Stein said the Mayor's promise to freeze property taxes for two years is "a meaningless sop" because steep property tax increases in the last two years have already driven thousands of property owners into default and cost the city many jobs.
Citing the absence of any reference to support for public schools in the Mayor's address, Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said in a statement, "The Mayor's Band-Aid approach to curing the city's ills offers no hope to the one million school children suffering for an education that could prevent those ills in the first place."
While the Mayor is not legally required to give a State of the City address, most mayors have chosen to give the speech to announce major policy shifts or to gain support for programs and initiatives from City Council members and other local politicians. Mr. Dinkins's speech was crafted by his top staff advisers, including Deputy Mayors Norman Steisel, Bill Lynch and Sally Hernandez-Pinero.
Some politicians praised the Mayor's speech, calling it "right on the mark." Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker who has often criticized Mr. Dinkins's programs, said that the speech was "a shift in the right direction" and that "it's very important for the Council for the Mayor to succeed."
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said, "I thought it was extremely well focused and addresses those pressing problems in our city that have gone overlooked for a long time." Ms. Messinger said the Mayor's call for expanded health care and cuts for small businesses was "extraordinary."
 
Gaps and Crimes
 In his speech, Mr. Dinkins lambasted the Federal Government for withdrawing funds to cities and states. "A turnaround in the national economy will happen only when Washington commits itself to better lives for people -- not to better bombs for our armies and tax breaks for the privileged," the Mayor said.
Despite dwindling Federal support, Mr. Dinkins said, his administration has managed to close a combined 1990 and 1991 budget deficit of $1.3 billion and to decrease reported crime by 6 percent in the last year, compared with a 2 percent increase in crime nationwide.
Reviving an idea that has circulated before, Mr. Dinkins said that he plans to restructure the taxi industry, by licensing livery vehicles to pick up people hailing them on the street. Only yellow, medallion cabs are now allowed to pick up people who hail them on the street. Under the Mayor's plan, livery-cab owners could buy a medallion that would allow them to pick up people who hail them, except south of 96th Street in Manhattan.
Yellow-taxi drivers and medallion owners expressed strong opposition yesterday to the Mayor's plan. "Mayor Dinkins, by proposing this new medallion system, you are taking food out of the mouths of our drivers," said Betty Lawrence, executive director of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the city's major yellow cab fleet owners.
Ms. Lawrence said that despite recent stepped-up enforcement, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission has been unsuccessful in preventing both gypsy and black cars from picking up people who hail them in central Manhattan. "We simply would not be able to compete with the flood of new taxis that would enter the market at substantially lower rates than yellow cab drivers have had to pay," Ms. Lawrence said.
Mr. Dinkins said he had directed the city's Office of Construction to develop a "counter cyclical" spending initiative that would inject capital construction money into the struggling local economy. In 1992, Mr. Dinkins said, the city will accelerate $125 million in capital improvements and, in the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years, more than $100 million in design work.
In the 1991 fiscal year, the city's Department of Environmental Protection failed to award more than $600 million in contracts, or almost half its capital budget for sewers and water main replacement, at an estimated cost of 8,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: FEW WOMEN FOUND IN TOP PUBLIC JOBS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Women in public service face a "glass ceiling" that often blocks them from advancing to top jobs in state and local governments, according to a survey made public today.
Women held only 31.3 percent of high-level state and local government jobs nationwide in 1990, while women in lower-level jobs accounted for 43.5 percent of the work force, the survey said. 
 The study was conducted by the Center for Women in Government, which is part of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy and was based on data from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
"There are a lot of women in government but they're not doing too well at the top," Sharon Harlan, director of research for the center, said. "There is a glass ceiling."
 
How Minority Women Fared
 Minority women did even worse proportionally, the study found, with black women making up 5.1 percent of the top managers, compared to 9.8 of other jobholders. The proportion of other minority women in management-level jobs is also low, the survey said.
"There are a lot of minority women in government, but they're at the bottom level," Ms. Harlan said.
The term "glass ceiling" was coined to describe institutional biases that prevent women from getting senior managerial positions in private industry. The Women in Public Service survey asserted that women working in local, county and state governments also faced barriers in getting high-level jobs like department heads, division chiefs, deputies and examiners.
Ms. Harlan said that while there had been several studies on the status of women in private industry, it was difficult to make comparisons with women in government because each study measured a different range of top jobs. For example, a report by the Department of Labor in Washington on the glass ceiling at the largest American corporations found that women made up about 6 percent of the top executives, but Ms. Harlan said that study looked at a significantly narrower band of top jobs than were included in the study on women in government.
But there are some indications that women fare better in government jobs than in private industry.
"If you look at cabinet-level state officials, appointed by governors, 19.8 percent are women," she said. "That's probably the category that would be most comparable to the top executives in the Labor Department study, and 19.8 percent is certainly higher than 6 percent."
The survey did not try to explain the differences, but Ms. Harlan said men were often favored for promotions and appointments simply because of institutional biases.
The survey reported that state governments had a poorer track record than local governments in placing a proportionate share of women in top jobs, although they tended to employ more women in general.
 
State Percentages Compared
 The survey said the national low was in Hawaii's state and local governments, where only 13.9 percent of their high-level jobs were held by women. Louisiana had the highest percentage, 38.5.
New York State's governments placed above the national average with a 35.6 percent managerial placement rate for women. Connecticut, with 29.6 percent, and New Jersey, with 27.3 percent, were below the average.
The survey does say, however, that women fared better when it took new hires into consideration. Women accounted for 40 percent of all top-level positions filled in 1990, the survey said.
"Yes, it's getting better, but that's not the main conclusion," Ms. Harlan said. "There still are a lot of structural barriers in place for women."
She added: 'At the rate it's changing, it's going to be a very long time before women reach equity. And in this economic climate, there's some concern that women will not be able to hold on to the gains they've made. We're getting ready to look at whether women are being laid off disproportionately."

HEADLINE: Australia's Focus, Like Bush's, Is Tokyo

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MELBOURNE, Australia, Friday, Jan. 3

 BODY:
President Bush wound up a three-day visit to Australia today, having proved his will to keep the United States in a strong position in Asia, but failing to dispel a gnawing fear that he lacks the means to do so.
Just as in Washington, Australian officials said today, the worries here center on Japan, whose growing influence the United States seems hard pressed to balance, much less channel to its own benefit. 
 Mr. Bush has elevated his unhappiness with Japanese trade barriers into a major election-year issue, making Japan both the focus and climax of the four-nation Pacific tour. In that respect, Australia has not given that tour an auspicious start.
 
'Wired Together'
 "We're not thinking about anything sudden," one Australian official involved in the talks with Mr. Bush said about fears of an American retreat from the area. "We're talking about a grim slide. If the U.S. decides in the end to concentrate on its sphere of influence and leave the area to Japan, Australia is going to be much the poorer.
"It's a lot better for us if we can keep you two wired together some way."
The worry that Washington and Tokyo will not find common ground and that Tokyo eventually will seek to push the United States out of a position of influence, is a frequent topic of Australia and its allies, the official said.
The official, who refused to be named, called the visit "very worthwhile in ventilating these things," and said both sides agreed on the dangers of an uncontrolled drift in relations between Tokyo and Washington.
 
Uncertain Strategy
 But he said that Prime Minister Paul Keating and others remain uncertain whether the Bush Administration has a strategy for coping with Japan's influence, or whether Washington can summon the economic clout to carry out any strategy it might devise.
More often, he said, the two economic powers vent their frustrations in specific disputes over issues like auto parts purchases, rather than examining cultural and economic differences.
Japan has shrewdly exploited a trading system that the United States singlehandedly built and has protected, at great expense, with its military might, the official said.
But rather than blame Japan, "Australia feels there has got to be an effort within the U.S. to revitalize the innards of American industry, to be more competitive," he said.
The White House said this week that it is aware of those concerns. It has lately depicted Mr. Bush's 12-day Asia journey as visible proof that its military and financial stake in the region is not simply unshaken, but that it is vital to the United States's economic future.
Mr. Bush, whose argument that exports create jobs is the foundation of his efforts to fight the recession, has remarked this week that American trade across the Pacific now far exceeds that with Europe, and is growing exponentially.
On the military front, the President is expected this weekend to disclose a new agreement in Singapore. The Pentagon has stationed jet fighters there under a so-called access agreement, in which American forces are placed on locally operated bases instead of on vast and expensive Pentagon-controlled compounds like the naval base at Subic Bay in the Philippines.
At Manila's insistence, the Navy's Seventh Fleet is pulling out of Subic Bay, and Singapore is said to be a top choice for some of its remnants.
Administration officials call these developments part of a shifting strategy for America's Pacific interests, in which Washington will serve less as sole defender of the region and more as a rallying force for regional interests.
That role worked in Iraq, where the Administration marshaled a global military effort to end the occupation of Kuwait, Administration officials said. They say they see a similar role in helping Pacific nations to share the burden of their own defense, and to cooperate in lowering trade barriers.
Reassuring as the Australians find that, both they and Mr. Bush acknowledged that, after the Cold War, economic power is the real measure of national strength.
"Bilateral defense arrangements with the U.S. and Japan and ourselves are important," the Australian official said. "But we think the current challenge is to ensure that the U.S. is engaged economically."
The President found the stop in Australia "constructive," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
After visiting Canberra, Mr. Bush stopped briefly in Melbourne, the nation's southernmost big city, to speak to local business leaders.
 Mr. Bush then left for Singapore. He will travel next to Seoul before moving on to Japan on Jan. 7.

HEADLINE: Bush Signals He's Prepared For Tough Campaign in '92

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Acknowledging that it will be "very difficult" to get re-elected without an economic recovery, President Bush says he is girding for a "dog-eat-dog fight" in the campaign and will do whatever it takes to win.
In an interview with David Frost that is to be broadcast Friday night by the Public Broadcasting Service (9 o'clock Eastern standard time, and on Channels 13 and 49 in the New York area), Mr. Bush tried to project confidence about the economy, citing predictions that it would recover by July. 
 In an interview with Mr. Frost at this time last year, the President predicted that "the recession will be mild and that the whole country will come out of it in not too many months from now" -- a forecast he and his advisers have come to regret.
In the new interview Mr. Bush acknowledged that he would not be able to balance the Federal budget during his Presidency, even if he were re-elected, and that the Government would go on spending more than it earned for the rest of this century.
 
A Message of Concern
 The President raised the possibility of further reducing the Pentagon budget. The money could be used either for additional domestic spending, which would require renegotiating the 1990 budget agreement, or to reduce the Federal deficit.
Mr. Bush repeatedly said that he believed voters knew he was trying to turn around the economy and was personally concerned about struggling Americans, a message the White House has been trying hard to convey because of Democratic criticism.
In an apparent reference to his foreign policy record, Mr. Bush said, "I think also you got a whole wealth of other performance out there that the American people are grateful for."
But the President signaled that he was prepared to wage the kind of tough campaign that he ran in 1988 against his Republican primary opponents and then against Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee. "I'm certainly going into this as a dog-eat-dog fight," he said, "and I will do what I have to do to be re-elected."
 
The Hardest Decision
 To achieve that, Mr. Bush's campaign team has been trying to devise new ways to present him to voters as a reliable Commander in Chief, an accomplished diplomat, a conservative and, most important, as a President who is concerned about the economic troubles of ordinary Americans.
That sense permeated virtually all of Mr. Bush's remarks in the interview, including when he was asked about the tensest moment of the year.
Until recently, the President had always cited his decision to send American troops to war in the Persian Gulf.
But Mr. Bush said: "It began with that and it ended with the concern for Americans that are hurting because of this sluggish economy. I mean, when families are having trouble making ends meet or are thinking even if they have a job, 'I might not have one tomorrow.' Fear. You worry about that. I worry a lot about it.
"But I also worried a lot about sending some mother's son into battle. So as the year started with the agony of that and ended with the increased feeling on the other point, on the economic point."
The interview was recorded on Dec. 23, before Mr. Bush left for the Far East. In the interview the President sought to position himself as a conservative. He faces challenges from the right by Patrick J. Buchanan, the columnist and former Nixon and Reagan White House aide, and David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Louisiana last year.
"I'm basically a conservative," the President said, "and I've always been that way."
 
No Brickbats for Buchanan
 He did not hesitate to excoriate Mr. Duke, who has become an acceptable target for Republicans, calling him a racist and a bigot and predicting that if he ran as an independent he would get less than 10 percent of the vote.
But he held his fire against Mr. Buchanan, who is regarded by many Republican strategists as more mainstream, and therefore more threatening. Asked if he agreed with an article by William F. Buckley Jr. that accused Mr. Buchanan of making anti-Semitic remarks, the President said, "I'd let others make that determination."
Asked if he could be re-elected if there were no economic recovery, Mr. Bush said, "Sure, but it makes it very difficult."
He said twice that he was confident that he would win, but added: "I predicate that, of course, on that I think the economy is going to be doing much better. I think confidence will be coming back. I think people know that we are trying hard. I don't think they did at first."
 
Growth and Spending Caps
 Despite Mr. Bush's confidence, the interview suggested that he was finding it difficult to come up with proposals for economic growth, on which his advisers are now working, and stay within the 1990 budget agreement.
Mr. Bush said he expected additional cuts in military spending, but did not say if he would use that money to increase domestic programs. "Could be," he said. "Or might do something radical like reduce the deficit, which seems to be -- some people have a great interest in, including me."
The Washington Post said tonight that Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had agreed on new cuts in Pentagon spending but that final decisions have not been made.

HEADLINE: West Acts to Defer Issue of New U.N. Council Seats

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 2

 BODY:
By allowing Russia to take over the Soviet Union's permanent Security Council seat last week, the three Western powers believe that they have postponed action for several years on demands by Germany, Japan and several large third world countries for permanent membership on the Council.
Diplomats now say a consensus is forming that the United Nations should not give serious consideration to reviewing the privileged position of the five World War II victors, who hold permanent Security Council seats and a veto over its decisions, before the middle of this decade. 
 Britain, which was given the permanent seat in 1945 along with the United States, France, China and the Soviet Union, now wants the Security Council to confirm Russia's enhanced position by holding its first-ever summit meeting this month at the level of heads of state or government.
Britain has told other permanent members that such a Council summit, coming just as Boutros Ghali takes up his duties as the new Secretary General, would underscore Russia's commitment to working through the United Nations for peace, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, officials say.
The Bush Administration appears to be supporting the call for a summit meeting, which would be presided over by Prime Minister John Major since Britain holds the Council's rotating presidency in January, American officials said today. But the attitude of France and China is unclear.
 
Opportunity for Review
 The collapse of the Soviet Union was a logical moment to reopen the United Nations founding charter and review the Security Council's composition, many nations contend.
But as the Soviet Union disintegrated the United States, with the support of Britain, France and China, moved swiftly, without public debate or any attempt to reopen the Charter, to insure that the former Soviet seat went to Russia as the largest and strongest of the former union's republics. The United States and its allies were able to get their way because their vetoes control all decisions of the Security Council, which must approve its own membership as well as any changes in the United Nations Charter.
"Frankly, we were lucky the General Assembly wasn't in session," a diplomat said. "Otherwise we might have had howls of fury to contend with."
The move, many diplomats say, showed that the five permanent members were determined to resist demands for any far-reaching changes in membership of the Council now that it is starting to act like the guardian of world order it is supposed to be.
 
Pressure for Change Grows
 The pressure for such changes is growing steadily, with many countries arguing that the privileges still held by the five World War II victors seem anachronistic 50 years later.
When this year's General Assembly debated the Council's role for the first time in a decade, industrial and developing countries were almost unanimous in saying the Council should be refashioned to represent the realities of today's world, not the world of 1945.
The countries defeated in the war are also pressing for the Charter to be changed to eliminate discriminatory clauses left over from the war, and this would unleash demands for reforms of the Security Council, too.
Germany and Japan both say they deserve a permanent Council seat as economic superpowers that are paying a rising share of United Nations bills.
Since most strife occurs in the developing world, leading third world nations argue that the Council would be a more effective peacemaker if they had permanent representation on it.
 
Confident of Holding Line
 Nevertheless, the present permanent members appear confident that they can hold the line against change until the middle of the decade, largely because Germany and Japan, the two strongest candidates for new seats, have softened their demands recently.
Japan's appetite for a permanent seat was appeased somewhat by its election to the Council this year for a two-year term as a rotating member.
Bonn softened its campaign for a permanent seat when the two Germanys reunited because it feared that such a demand, coming immediately after reunification, might alarm its neighbors.
One much-discussed change might merge the British and French permanent seats into a single seat for the 12 European Community members, taking care of Germany's aspirations.
Permanent seats without a veto might then go to Japan and such big developing countries as India, Egypt, Nigeria and Brazil.

HEADLINE: Little on Its Agenda, Congress Plays Wait-and-See as New Session Starts

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Congress will return to the capital to meet for a few minutes Friday, fulfilling a constitutional command that it begin its session on Jan. 3, but with little on the immediate agenda besides leadership meetings and a few news conferences.
In contrast to the scene a year ago, when most lawmakers were here early expecting to confront the grave issue of war in the Persian Gulf, few are in town now, and the choices they face seem harder to grasp. 
 The Democrats, who control the schedule, see the struggling economy and the unraveling health care system as issues on which they have a natural advantage over the Republicans and President Bush, in contrast to an issue of war last year that favored Presidential authority. But there is no consensus in the Democratic Party on how to deal with the recession as the election year begins, and even less agreement on what to do about health care.
So when the lawmakers snarled out of town six weeks ago, they planned to wait until Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message on Jan. 28 before setting a course of their own on those issues.
Nothing has happened since to change that intention, and the Democratic leadership meetings on Friday are expected to confirm that approach. But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said today that Democrats would be ready to negotiate with the President, "if he wants to negotiate," when he returned from Asia on Jan. 10.
 
Real Business Later
 After the sessions Friday, the Senate will next meet Jan. 21 and the House the day after that. So late January will be the first real occasion for the leaders to get much of a sense of what is on the minds of "the followership," as one aide put it today.
The views of the House and Senate rank and file tend to matter more in an election year, and in the House in particular this will be a difficult one, for almost everyone who runs for re-election will have a district that is either slightly or drastically changed from the old one because of redistricting.
Traditional political issues like the economy are not the only problems on their minds, for this election is sure to be fueled also by attacks on Congress's own behavior, and a cost-of-living pay increase will take effect in January unless the rank and file stops it out of fear of the electorate and the movement that would limit the terms of members.
That sense of what the members want may be critical on the issue of tax cuts and economic stimulus, for the consistent message from professional economists at hearings last month was not to do anything drastic: It could be too little and too late to ease this recession and might harm the economy in the long run.
At the same time, the political message the lawmakers conveyed right back was that they were feeling the heat from their constituents and needed to do something. So some hearings on taxes and health care may follow Mr. Bush's address immediately, and the results of his visit to Japan will be examined to see whether there seems to be political mileage in some kind of trade legislation.
In the depth of a recession, principled arguments about free trade tend to carry less weight than the politics of lost jobs. A variety of measures have been introduced in each House, ranging from blunt anti-Japanese proposals to measure that would require the Administration to designate publicly the worst trade barriers the nation faces, then to focus its efforts on removing them.
 
Budget Accord Issue
 There may also be an early effort to change the budget agreement reached in 1990 in order that further reductions in military spending could be used to pay for domestic programs. The agreement prohibits such transfers until next year, and many lawmakers argue that military needs have plainly dropped with the dissolution of the Soviet Union so that the ban on such transfers now protects an artificially high level of Pentagon spending.
On all these issues, Mr. Gephardt said in an interview, "We want to respond as quickly as humanly possible." But then both Houses will take the second week of February off to go home for what they call a "district work period," and serious lawmaking on the economy, health care or trade will not get under way until they return.
The Senate will commence its legislative year, appropriately enough, with a vote on limiting debate on a motion to consider the Democratic version of an elementary education proposal. The Democratic bill would encourage students to choose among various public schools. Republicans prevented its consideration last fall because the Administration considers it too costly and because it does not allow public money to go with students who want to transfer to private or parochial schools.
After that issue is disposed of, the Senate plans to deal with legislation that would allow some cities to regulate prices for "basic" cable television service.
The House has no particular bills on its schedule for either this month or next. Its first sharply debated action may come in March on another move to provide more funds for the Resolution Trust Company, which is expected to run out of the $25 billion Congress provided in November for the savings and loan bailout. .
 
Important Conferences
 Some of the more important early legislative action may come in House-Senate conferences, especially in an effort to reconcile two different campaign finance measures. Some leaders, including House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington, regard this legislation as a way to reclaim Congress's good name and head off the effort to amend the Constitution to limit how many years lawmakers may serve.
But the heaviest attention is sure to go to legislation that seeks to spur economic growth through changes in the tax laws. Republicans are seeking cuts in capital gains taxes, and Democrats want to reduce taxes on the middle class and offset them by raising taxes on people with the highest incomes.
Democratic leaders from both Houses and the chairmen of the committees that handle that legislation will meet Friday. Mr. Gephardt and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, have planned speeches dealing with domestic issues.

HEADLINE: Who Won in Salvador? Everyone

 BODY:
After 11 years, El Salvador's Government and guerrilla armies have at last agreed to end a war neither can win in exchange for a peace from which both can gain.
The Government won a chance to turn its energies from killing to development, along with good prospects for foreign aid in reconstruction. The guerrillas won an official commitment to economic, social and political reforms, along with an opportunity for their fighters to return, safely, to normal pursuits. 
 El Salvador's people are also big winners; they will no longer have to endure a conflict that has killed 75,000 people and uprooted a million.
The peace agreement was brokered early Wednesday by the United Nations' departing Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, with help from Mexico and the United States. It was a signal accomplishment for U.N. mediation.
The Bush Administration, for its part, can claim vindication for its abandonment of ideological Reagan Administration crusades in Central America, which did little to encourage compromise.
The good will of outsiders would not have meant much without correspondingly constructive changes from Salvador's main combatants. Today's world is full of conflicts, from Afghanistan to Yugoslavia, that resist international efforts at settlement. Salvador's war was once in that category too. But changes since 1989 brought a breakthrough.
On the rebel side, the election defeat of the leftist Sandinista regime in neighboring Nicaragua surely played a sobering role. The military impact was slight; Sandinista leaders still run Nicaragua's armed forces. But even Marxist guerrilla leaders, if they were realistic, now had to acknowledge that a groundswell of Salvadoran popular support for their cause was becoming increasingly unlikely. Instead, Salvadoran elections in March 1989 brought the far right to power.
But President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist Government proved itself at least as realistic as guerrilla leaders. President Cristiani was confident he could prevent a rebel victory. But he had little hope of fighting the war to a military finish.
And the longer he persisted in fighting, the weaker his own power would become relative to that of military commanders. There was also an increasing risk that some military atrocity would provoke a cutoff of all aid from the U.S.
The Bush Administration used its diplomacy to press the Government toward peace. But without threats by Congressional Democrats to withhold aid on human rights grounds, Washington's leverage would have been far less credible.
Under the terms of Wednesday's agreement, the rebels promise to disband their military apparatus completely by October, with former guerrillas eligible to serve in a new National Police. Government armed forces will be cut in half from their present level of 53,000, and corrupt or abusive officers will be purged. Land reform will be accelerated, peasants in rebel areas provided with land and new social programs begun. Any details still unresolved as of next Friday will go to the new U.N. Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, for resolution.
The Salvador accord, like those for Namibia and Cambodia, shows the U.N.'s growing capacity to broker just settlements once combatants muster the wisdom and patriotism to prefer peace.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Japan, Jobs and Baloney

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB; A. M. Rosenthal is traveling.

 BODY:
President Bush says his trip to Japan next week is about "jobs, jobs, jobs."
But even to a tin ear that sounds like politics, politics, politics. 
 Which means that Mr. Bush's stay in Japan, with 21 top U.S. corporate executives in tow, could amount to a lot of baloney, baloney, baloney.
Which would be too bad, because Japanese leaders are eager to help Mr. Bush for many reasons, not the least being their contempt for and fear of Japan-bashing Democrats. Which means the trip could produce gains for American trade and a triumph for the President personally if he would only cool his political posturing and act Presidential.
That recipe doesn't require babying Japan. More than most countries, Japan needs a good dose of pressure to open up its economy. But also more than in virtually any nation, Japanese will be responsive to U.S. pressure as long as Americans don't drive them into a corner. That point is getting lost in the current rhetoric, and it argues for a two-track U.S. trade policy where Washington squeezes without bashing and takes responsibility for its own economic mess.
Japan's economic stake in the U.S. is enormous. No matter that Japan's trade with Asia exceeded trade with America last year for the first time since 1945. The U.S. will remain Tokyo's largest single business partner, and the last thing Tokyo wants is a trade war with its best customer.
Nor do Tokyo's power brokers want to provoke Washington into withdrawing its still-large military presence from Japan. Such a departure would lead inevitably to a new and more powerful role for Japan's military. That prospect terrifies the Japanese almost as much as it does their Asian neighbors.
The neighbors would have a nervous breakdown if the Japanese military were cut loose from its American moorings, and Japanese leaders know that well. Typical is what Yukio Sato, the Foreign Ministry's top man on U.S. policy, told The Wall Street Journal the other day: "Some Japanese say, 'If U.S.-Japan relations go sour, we can always go back to Asia.' But there are no Asian countries that would welcome a Japan that left the U.S.-Japan alliance."
Beyond these crucial general concerns for good relations with the U.S., Japanese leaders have strong motives for strengthening George Bush's hand in particular. They can't stand the Democrats.
Congressional Democrats are earning this dislike by pushing the worst sort of protectionist legislation. This year's entry is a bill that would virtually cut off Japanese car imports and could even curtail sales of Japanese autos made in the U.S. if Japan's $42 billion trade surplus with America is not almost wiped out by 1997. Most of the Democratic Presidential candidates reinforce this message by hammering away at the loss of American jobs to Japanese imports.
It was this jobs drumbeat that frightened Mr. Bush's political advisers. And it caused them to charge down the wrong path of aping protectionist Democrats.
Japanese power brokers also recognized the drumbeat and moved quickly to pre-empt an embarrassing confrontation during the Bush visit. They lowered interest rates to stimulate their economy with the hopes of spurring imports, and they will sharply step up purchases of American auto parts. They will make additional concessions if the Bush entourage does not publicly cross the line between squeezing and bashing.
Japan needs America and will be responsive to American needs. Far more so -- and this is key -- if Mr. Bush shows he understands that opening up Japanese markets solves only part of the problem, and that the larger challenge is to insure higher quality American products once the barriers come down.
No amount of Japan-bashing will magically make U.S. cars better than Japan's. Americans understand that, which is why they buy so many Japanese autos even at higher prices. And autos alone account for three-quarters of the trade deficit with Japan.
George Bush is always at his best when he shows he knows these things, and when he acts like a President and not a pol. If he conveys such statesmanship next week, he will demonstrate that good trade policy is good jobs policy is good politics, and help save his own job.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS AGREE TO SEEK END OF BAN ON BUDGET SHIFTS

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders agreed today to move soon to break down the barriers in the 1990 budget law between military and domestic spending so savings from Pentagon cutbacks could pay for other programs, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said.
Mr. Foley, a Washington Democrat, and George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, both praised President Bush for indicating during a television interview tonight with David Frost a willingness to consider removing those barriers. "We commend the President for reviewing and reversing his position in the light of changing circumstance," Mr. Mitchell said. 
 Administration officials said today that while Mr. Bush had not decided among the various budget options he was considering while on his Asian trip, there was a "strong inclination" to call for a tax cut for the middle class. The most obvious way to pay for it, they said, was through cuts in the Defense Department's budget and removing the ban on shifting funds between the military and domestic budgets.
 
Talk of Early Action
 This tentative Administration approach was supported by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip. He told a news conference, "I'd like to see virtually all the money available from any defense cuts go directly into a middle-class tax or some kind of pro-housing tax cut to stimulate the buying of new homes and that sort of thing."
Mr. Foley said there could be "early" action on such a change in the budget rules, which probably means late February. But he insisted that any amendment should preserve the larger principle of requiring that any new spending be offset by taxes or budget cuts, thus limiting growth in the budget deficit. "The pay-as-you-go principle should be maintained," he told reporters.
 That view was in sharp contrast to a proposal by two prominent Democratic Senators who urged a $55 billion increase in the deficit to stimulate the economy and fight the recession.
The Senators, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said a deficit increase of that size was necessary to counter the drag on the economy caused by recent increases in local, state and Federal taxes and cuts in spending by government at all levels.
Mr. Foley identified changes in the budget act as one top issue discussed at a long meeting of the joint Democratic leadership. In addition to Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley, the meeting was attended by Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, and the chairmen of the two committees in charge of tax legislation, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who heads the Senate Finance Committee.
Their meeting was devoted to making sure that they stayed in touch and did not surprise each other as they laid out Democratic views and alternatives to Bush Administration positions. Mr. Mitchell will speak at the National Press Club on Jan. 16 and Mr. Foley will speak there on Jan. 23 and give the official Democratic response to the President's State of the Union Message soon after it is delivered on Jan. 28.
Aside from the issue of changing the budget rules, the other main points they agreed to emphasize in any Democratic package were the need for a tax cut for the middle class and the importance of providing some kind of incentive for investment.
Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Bentsen have already introduced legislation for a tax cut for the middle class. Their approach differs from that of Republicans in that they would pay for the cuts by increasing taxes on people with high incomes. The Republicans would prefer to offset tax reductions for the middle class with money saved by Pentagon cuts, savings that the Democrats want to apply to domestic programs.
Most of the tax cuts that have been proposed so far have been fairly modest, leading critics to say that they would do little to stimulate the economy. Cuts in military spending slow down the economy in some areas, and it is not clear that additional cash in taxpayers' hands would provide enough stimulus to overcome that effect. Many critics have scorned the tax proposals now under discussion as little more than an attempt to buy votes in an election year.
Calling for some sort of investment incentive is a relatively new element in Democratic policy, since those present have repeatedly attacked what the Republicans argue is the best incentive for investment: a tax cut for capital gains. Democrats have denounced the idea as ineffective and a reward for the wealthy.
 
Shape of Republican Plan
 It is not clear just what is likely to emerge as the Administration's proposal. Administration officials said today that while Mr. Bush had said in the interview that reducing the deficit would be a worthy use of any savings from the military budget, his political advisers were pushing strongly for a tax cut for the middle class.
Nor was the Democratic approach today precise or decisive. The Democrats scheduled no news conference to proclaim their agreements, and Mr. Foley told reporters in a Capitol corridor that he did not want "to get into numbers" about how much should be cut from the military budget and spent on "the domestic needs of the country."
Mr. Mitchell was equally fuzzy. Talking to reporters before the leadership meeting, he called for an unspecified "major shift of revenues away from defense." He said, "We're engaged in a continuous process of consultation and review, and we hope very much to have action early in the new year."

HEADLINE: 6 EX-SOVIET STATES GAIN U.S. SUPPORT FOR TIE TO LENDERS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, in a policy switch aimed at more quickly assisting the economic transformation of Russia and five other former Soviet republics, urged today that they be admitted to full membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Membership in the fund and the World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the former republics with which the United States is initially establishing diplomatic relations -- could allow them access to billions of dollars in development loans to help make the unsettling transition from a centralized to a free-market economy. 
 The American decision today to support full membership in the two international financial institutions reverses a longstanding Administration policy set before the collapse of the Soviet Union that had blocked Soviet membership.
 
Russia's Commitment
 Administration officials had said they were concerned that Moscow under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not sufficiently committed to the broad economic reform necessary to bring the country into line with Western economies.
But Russia under President Boris N. Yeltsin has demonstrated its willingness to back away from central controls, and Mr. Yeltsin's example has been followed in other republics whose economies are linked to Russia's, officials said.
Until the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Administration had also been opposed to the introduction into the fund of such a large centralized economy that was unwilling to share financial data or accept institutional oversight, which have been the prerequisites for membership. When the fund and the bank were established after World War II, the Soviet Union spurned membership. The republics that have emerged from the breakup are smaller entities, and they have not objected to the requirements of membership.
 
$12 Billion From U.S.
 The Administration's move precedes by a few weeks the assembling of a large international conference in Washington to discuss aid to the newly independent nations joined in a Commonwealth of Independent States. Dates for that conference are not yet final, the State Department said today, but it is likely to occur about Jan. 22, financial experts say.
The announcement today by the Treasury Department made no mention of whether Washington would now hasten to fulfill a commitment to provide access to $12 billion requested by the fund as part of a $60 billion increase in the institution's capital base needed to meet rising borrowing demands. The American portion is awaiting authorization by Congress, where the lawmakers are under election-year pressure to tend to domestic problems aggravated by recession in the United States.
It is a matter of debate among financial analysts whether it would have been easier for the newly independent republics to make the transition to a free-market economy if the Soviet Union had been a member of the I.M.F. and World Bank before its demise. Although Washington had withheld backing for Soviet membership, it had not objected to the entry of other Communist nations with centrally planned economies, including China and Romania.
"The dramatic developments in the former Soviet Union have created new opportunities and challenges for international financial cooperation," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in a statement today announcing the American policy change. United States backing virtually assures that the former republics will be admitted to the two institutions, which have 156 nations as members.
"Membership in the I.M.F. and World Bank will further market-oriented economic reform in these newly independent nations," Mr. Brady said. "We will work with them to assure that their applications are considered as quickly as possible."
Mr. Brady also said that the United States was prepared to support membership for the other former Soviet republics that Washington recognizes but with which it has not yet decided to establish full diplomatic realtions: Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia and Moldova. The United States is awaiting assurances from those republics on their political and economic development, including the protection of democratic rights.
"The benefits of technical assistance and expertise provided by the I.M.F. and World Bank, pending full membership, should continue to be available to all 12 states of the former Soviet Union," Mr. Brady said.
 
Fund's Technical Aid
 For about six months before its collapse at the end of the year, the Soviet Union had been eligible for a specially created associate membership in the two international financial institutions, allowing Moscow to receive advice but not loans. That had allowed fund and bank experts to visit and begin to study the Soviet economy. Analysts who had visited the Soviet Union within the year before its collapse were estimating that the country might need something like $5 billion in start-up funds for economic restructuring.
But a spokesman for the fund said today that the time it takes for a country to become a functioning member of the institution varies greatly. Czechoslovakia completed the process in about eight months; Poland took four years. Apart from submitting a formal application for membership, the republics would have to enact enabling legislation to join the fund, which in turn has to collect the economic data necessary to calculate a nation's initial capital subscription.
"Everybody wants to get together and work as quickly as possible on this one," said the spokesman, who declined to be idenitifed. He said that the fund has been providing some technical assistance to what is now the new commonwealth since October.
 
No Opposition Expected
 Experts have visited the former Soviet republics, and there are plans to send teams on additional visits in the next six to eight weeks. The task before them is formidable. The records kept through decades of the mismanaged Soviet centralized economy are generally considered to be unreliable.
"Some of us think it would have been nice if Moscow had come in a couple of years ago so that in this crisis period, the fund and the bank would already have been there to help," said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Analysts do not expect opposition to membership for the former Soviet republics from other industrial nations. It is widely accepted that the International Monetary Fund will assist the republics in stabilizing currencies, which plunged sharply in value with abrupt economic restructuring.
 
Conditions for Loans
 In general, the fund's function is to help countries frame and carry out large-scale plans to reform malfunctioning economies, often providing financial support to cushion the process of change and adjustment.
The International Monetary Fund, set up after World War II as an independent financial institution working in cooperation with the United Nations, gets its capital from a combination of local currencies and hard currencies or gold paid into the organization by member countries according to quotas established when they join. The status of what were believed to be considerable Soviet reserves is unknown. The ruble is now a weak and nonconvertible currency.
The fund makes money available to members with loans safeguarded by agreements to abide by certain conditions of financial management in domestic economic policy and foreign exchange.
Some third world nations have objected to restraints imposed on their policies as infringement of sovereignty, but the fund and the bank are strengthening those oversight functions as demands for money proliferate.
The World Bank is normally involved in specific and more narrowly focused development projects like roads and dams and the management of specific services or industries in state and private sectors. The bank could, for example, provide expertise to the former Soviet republics on how to convert government industries into investor-owned companies.
To borrow from the World Bank, a nation must have a per capita income lower than $4,000 a year. Recent surveys by development organizations indicate that most if not all of the former Soviet republics will meet that criterion.
But it is unlikely that any would qualify for International Development Assistance loans, which are reserved for the least-developed nations with incomes under $500 per capita per year.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Allies to Seek U.N. Support Against Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Before seeking international sanctions, the United States, Britain and France plan to ask the United Nations Security Council to support their demand that Libya turn over agents accused in the bombings of two airliners, Western diplomats said today.
The three countries would ask the Council to approve sanctions against Libya only if Tripoli refused to obey the proposed order by the Security Council, which would also demand compensation. 
 Libya has been asked to extradite two agents in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, which killed 270 people, and turn over four men charged in a blast aboard a French airliner over the Sahara in September 1989 that killed 170. Should Libya still refuse to turn over the agents, the three nations would probably seek some sort of mandatory ban on all civilian air traffic to and from the country and on the sale of commercial aircraft and spare parts to Libya, diplomats said.
 
Step-by-Step Approach
 The three Western allies had previously indicated that they might threaten Libya with immediate trade penalties. But after sounding out other Security Council members, they opted for a slower step-by-step approach similar to the one used by the Council to increase pressure on Iraq to give up Kuwait during the Persian Gulf crisis.
Britain's United Nations representative, Sir David Hannay, who is President of the Council this month, confirmed today that Britain, France and the United States, all permanent members of the Council, are discussing the possibility of bringing the Libyan matter before the Council this month.
Sir David said that Prime Minister John Major was talking to other Security Council members about the possibility of convening a meeting of the heads of government of nations belonging to the Council this month. No date has been set for such a meeting.
In November, the United States and Britain jointly charged two Libyans with involvement in blowing up the Pan Am plane. France had issued arrest warrants in October for four Libyan officials, including a brother-in-law of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, in connection with the bombing of the French plane, which belonged to the airline Union de Transports Aeriens.
The United States, France and Britain began campaigning for support of their two-stage strategy to win Libyan compliance on Thursday, sending ambassadors to put their case to foreign ministers in the capitals of the 12 other countries that are members of the Security Council.
But they expect an uphill struggle with some countries, which are reluctant to pass judgment on accusations of state-sponsored terrorism against another country.
The three allies recognize that Colonel Qaddafi is maneuvering to divide the Security Council by offering to put the accused men on trial in Libya or hand them over to some international tribunal for judgment, rather then surrendering them to the United States, France and Britain.
The Bush Administration formally repeated its demands on Libya today without suggesting any change in its tactics.
"Should Libya continue to fail to comply voluntarily with our demands for justice, we have ruled out no option to gain their compliance," said Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman.
But a senior Administration official cautioned that a decision on whether to press for sanctions can only be made after the allies have assessed the Council's response to an initial call for a resolution supporting extraditions.
"This is an unprecedented action we are asking for, and it is going to be very difficult," the official said.
The United States representative at the United Nations, Thomas R Pickering, has advised the Administration that to get the Security Council action it wants over Libya, Washington must be prepared to mount a diplomatic campaign of comparable intensity to the one undertaken during the Persian Gulf crisis, diplomatic officials said.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has already expressed unhappiness over the planned initiative, the officials said. A few weeks ago Mr. Mubarak was so concerned about American intentions that he called President Bush to urge him not to take any new military action against Libya.
Today the United States, France and Britain sent their United Nations representatives to explain their position to the new United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, who is said to be worried that a new crisis is developing over the Libyan issue.
The three allies deliberately postponed their campaign against Libya until this month after calculating that changes in the roster of Security Council members effective Jan. 1 would make the body more sympathetic to their plans.
 
Cuba and Yemen Depart
 Cuba and Yemen, which voted against many of the gulf war resolutions affecting Iraq, have left the Council after completing two-year terms, as have the Ivory Coast, Zaire and Romania. Their places have been taken by Venezuela, Japan, Morocco, Cape Verde and Hungary.
Now that Japan has assumed one of the seats reserved for African and Asian states, the number of Council members belonging to the so-called non-aligned movement has fallen from seven to six. That means the non-aligned nations can no longer prevent the adoption of resolutions by the 15-member Council by voting as a bloc; only nine votes are needed to adopt a resolution.
Morocco, however, may be reluctant to see the Council act against Libya, its northern African neighbor.

HEADLINE: Cuban Pilot Defects With 33 Others in a Daring Helicopter Flight

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 3

 BODY:
In a daring escape from one of the world's last remaining Communist nations, a pilot for the Cuban national airline commandeered a helicopter in Havana today and flew 33 relatives and friends to a small suburban airport here.
The group, which included nine children and infants, immediately requested political asylum and was taken to an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center here to be processed. 
 "We just could not stand it there anymore," one female passenger said shortly after landing at Tamiami Airport, a small strip south of Miami normally used by pleasure craft and other small planes.
 
'I Truly Feel Complete'
 "Do you have any idea what it is like to be able to bring out four children and my grandchildren like this?" asked another passenger, who identified herself as Maria Lopez. "Now I truly feel complete."
Immigration officials said they expected all 34 Cuban refugees to be released quickly to their relatives here, perhaps as early as this weekend. Unlike people from Haiti and other Latin American countries, Cubans are eligible for a special immigration program that grants them legal residency in the United States in little more than a year.
More than 7,000 Haitians, for example, are currently being detained at a United States military base at Guantanamo, Cuba, while American courts decide if they can be forcibly repatriated to their homeland, a policy favored by the Bush Administration.
The Haitian exodus began after a military regime overthrew an elected civilian president last fall, but Washington, which has refused to recognize the new government, says it nonetheless regards the Haitians as economic, rather than political, refugees.
 
Based at Cuban Resort
 The leader of today's mass defection was identified as German Pompa, a pilot with Cubana Airlines who also holds the rank of lieutenant in the Cuban Air Force. Mr. Pompa was based in Varadero, a beach resort east of Havana catering to foreign tourists and members of the Communist Party elite, and regularly flew visitors and officials on helicopter excursions from the local airport.
Orestes Lorenzo Perez, a former Cuban military pilot who defected to the United States last year and said he had once been Mr. Pompa's commanding officer, talked to Mr. Pompa minutes after his arrival this morning. Mr. Perez said Mr. Pompa told him he went to the Varadero airport early this morning and boarded the craft. Mr. Pompa was accompanied, he said, by two friends who wore the uniforms of crew members so that the suspicions of airport security officers would not be aroused.
"They then flew to a prearranged spot nearby, where family members and friends were waiting," Mr. Perez said. "The passengers climbed on board in a hurry, and they flew off, keeping an altitude of less than 30 feet above the water so that the Cuban Air Force would not detect them and shoot them down."
United States Customs Service officials said a "slow, low-flying object" was first detected flying over the Straits of Florida shortly after 8 A.M. Two Government airplanes sent to intercept the aircraft quickly identified it as a Russian-made MI-8 helicopter, and accompanied the craft until it touched down around 9:15.
 
New Year's Greetings
 "The first thing he said to me was, 'Happy New Year,' " said Sebastian Ortega, a customs official who was in radio contact with Mr. Pompa during the flight. "Other than that we didn't do very much talking. We just wanted to make sure we got him down on the ground safe and sound."
Late this morning some small plastic flight bags that the passengers brought with them, including one that proclaimed "Cuba Awaits You," were still on board the helicopter as it sat on the tarmac at Tamiami Airport, with customs agents and Miami police officers guarding it.
Under the terms of an international air hijacking agreement that both the United States and Cuba have signed, the helicopter must be returned to Cuba. A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said this afternoon that the Cuban Government expected to send a crew to Florida to pick up the craft and fly it back to Havana as soon as arrangements could be made.
Inside the commandeered helicopter were seats for three crew members and seat belts for 18 passengers, indicating that the craft made its 200-mile journey dangerously overloaded.
"I was a little bit nervous in the beginning," said one of the passengers, a man in his 30's. "But after 30 minutes I knew we were out of danger."
Mr. Perez and other friends of the passengers said today's escape had been carefully planned for several weeks and that there had been at least one attempted escape that was aborted at the last moment. Shortly after their arrival several of the passengers used mobile telephones to call relatives in Miami, and their conversations made it clear that those family members also knew that some sort of escape effort was in the works.
As news of the helicopter flight spread on Spanish-language radio and television stations here, curious Cuban-Americans drove to the airport in the hope of catching a glimpse of the latest additions to Miami's flourishing exile community and the craft in which they escaped.
"The next thing you know, they will be coming in submarines," said one radio commentator, rejoicing that "once again the Cuban people have made a fool of Fidel Castro."
Today's flight to freedom comes amid Cuba's worst economic and political crisis since Mr. Castro seized power 33 years ago this month. Deprived of subsidies, oil and markets for its sugar exports as a result of the collapse of Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the Cuban economy has over the last two years sunk virtually to a subsistence level.
Food and fuel have long been rationed, but new restrictions on electricity and gasoline consumption, including the elimination of many bus lines, went into effect on Jan. 1. Television, newspapers, movie theaters and sports arenas have also cut back their operations, leaving the population with little diversion during what Mr. Castro calls a "special period" that he has admitted will intensify this year.
 
'No Freedom of Expression'
 At the same time, state security has stepped up its vigilance. "There is no freedom of expression there," one of the passengers on the helicopter, a teen-ager, told reporters today. "The minute you say something they throw you in jail."
In the first nine months of 1991 more than 2,000 Cubans fled to Florida aboard rafts, inner tubes or small boats, compared with 467 during the previous year, according to the immigration agency. The State Department says an additional 30,000 Cubans arrived in the United States to visit relatives and are believed by the United States authorities here to have overstayed their visas.
In a desperate attempt to flee the island just last week, an unknown Havana resident hooked a trapeze-like device to the wing of a charter flight leaving the Havana airport for Miami. As passengers watched helplessly, the man lost consciousness and fell from his perch into the sea shortly after takeoff.
Last March, Mr. Perez, flying a supersonic MIG-27 jet fighter, landed at a United States naval air station just north of Key West. That defection raised questions about the efficiency of the Pentagon's air defense network.
This time, however, the helicopter, which has a maximum speed of about 150 knots, was spotted soon after it left Havana. Michael Sheehan, a spokesman for the Customs Service in Miami, said two aircraft based at Homestead Air Force Base south of here were then ordered into the air, and spotted the helicopter about 20 miles south of Marathon, in the Florida Keys.
Customs officials said tail markings indicating the craft belonged to Cuba's state airline and the absence of guns quickly made it clear to them that they were dealing with a mass defection.
"We had no reason to believe this group was hostile," said the customs agent who piloted the Citation jet that intercepted the helicopter and accompanied it to the airstrip.
The pilot, who spoke on condition that he not be named, added: "As we approached we could see the people inside, smiling and waving at us. When they landed they were even more excited. It looked like they were kissing the ground."

HEADLINE: Election Panel Is Hoping To Replenish Its Funds

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The Federal Election Commission, hoping to stave off a $150 million shortage projected by 1996 in the taxpayer-financed campaign fund, announced today that it would begin a public relations effort and an appeal to Congress to replenish its coffers.
Joan Aikens, the chairwoman of the commission, said the Presidential Election Campaign Fund would probably not run out of money in the 1992 campaign season, but only because Presidential candidates had made lower demands on the public financing mechanism this year. 
 "The candidates this year have started later," she said. "There are fewer candidates running, and they have raised less money."
To raise more money for the fund before April 15, when income taxes are due, the commission has hired a public relations firm to produce $120,000 in broadcasting and print advertising intended to encourage taxpayers to check off a box on their tax returns that directs the Government to divert $1 to the campaign fund.
At the same time, the commission is asking Congress to consider raising the checkoff amount or allocating special grants to head off the expected deficit.
A $1 contribution does not increase or decrease tax liability, and the money for the campaign fund is drawn from the Treasury Department's general fund once every four years. But the number of taxpayers who have opted to contribute to the fund has declined steadily since 1988.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has the lead among the Democratic candidates in the race for the Federal matching funds disbursed by the the election commission. Fund-raising reports made public on Thursday showed that the Clinton campaign raised $3.3 million last year, $2 million of it December.
The Governor requested $831,209 in matching funds for February and had previously received $579,364, which was paid out this week.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the second most successful Democratic fund-raiser, submitted a request for $269,469 in matching funds for February to be added to the $1 million paid out to his campaign this week. He raised more than $2 million last year.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska requested $258,565 for his campaign for February, which would be added to the $574,597 he qualified for last month.
Lenora Fulani, the Presidential candidate of the New Alliance Party, received $624,497 in matching funds last month and has requested $141,269 more for next month.
President Bush's fund-raising and requests for matching funds total more than $3.6 million to date, far outstripping that any of the Democratic candidates.
Federal financing from the campaign fund is used to match contributions of $250 or less, dollar for dollar.
Two-thirds of the money in the campaign finance fund is to be reserved for the general election campaign this year, and only 21 percent of the money is to be expended in the primaries. The rest is spent on party conventions.
 
'Structural Flaw' in Program
 Mrs. Aikens said the fund would continue to be stretched in future years, in part because of what she described as a "structural flaw" in the program that has limited the check-off amount to $1 while inflation continued to rise.
"In 1974 the statutory limit was established at $20 million," she said at a news conference today. "This year each party nominee will receive $55 million, representing a 280 percent increase in payout since 1974."
If more candidates run in 1996, as is likely if an incumbent is not running for re-election, even more pressure would be put on the fund to increase contributions. If that occurred, Mrs. Aiken said, "there may not be any public money available for the primary election campaigns in 1996, not because of a lack of taxpayer participation but because of the effects of inflation."
Last month the Democratic National Committee filed suit to force the Treasury Department to change the way money flows into the campaign fund so that a shortage could be avoided this year. Even though the election commission says there is little likelihood of a shortage occurring, a Democratic official said the rules should be changed.
 
No Lobbying Effort Planned
 Mrs. Aikens said the commission would not lobby for any rules changes and would take no position in the Democrats' dispute with the Treasury Department. "We send legislative recomendations to the Congress every year," she said. "What they choose to do with it is entirely up to them."
She was unwilling to predict whether the public relations effort would result in any significant increase in contributions to the campaign fund.
In the television advertisements a woman, a black couple, an Asian man and an elderly man are seen filling out their tax forms as an announcer's voice informs them of the tax check-off option and gives them a toll-free number to call for more information.
Presidential candidates qualify for public financing if they agree to limit the amount of private money they receive in primary campaigns and reject all private financing during the general election.
To qualify for matching funds, Presidential candidates must raise $100,000 in contributions from individuals from diverse areas, with at least $5,000 coming from a minimum of 20 states.

HEADLINE: U.S. ACCUSES IRAQ OF BLOCKING AID

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The State Department accused Iraq today of continuing to impede international aid to its 18 million people and called on President Saddam Hussein's Government to immediately resume sales of crude oil under United Nations supervision to help feed its people.
A department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, catalogued several recent attempts by Iraqi officials to block the distribution of donated food and medicine to tens of thousands of Iraqis. Many Iraqis are said to be suffering from disease and malnutrition brought on in part by a 17-month-old trade embargo that has further devastated the Iraq's economy and prevented it from recovering from the effects of the Persian Gulf war. 
 In a separate statement titled "Humanitarian Issues in Iraq," the State Department said: "The reports of suffering of the Iraqi people are extensive, well documented and compelling. But there is a limit to what the international community can do in the absence of Iraqi cooperation.
"It is not the international sanctions which starve Iraq's innocent civilian population," the document continued. "It is the policies of Saddam Hussein's regime."
Three months have passed since the United Nations Security Council laid down procedures for Iraq to resume limited crude oil sales to finance food and medicine costs and to begin to pay reparations to Kuwait. Iraq's oil commerce had provided more than 90 percent of its national income.
 
Iraq Rejects Monitored Sales
 Iraq has refused to accept supervised sales and the monitoring that would go along with them as an infringement on sovereignty.
The Administration today praised Turkey's recent decision to extend the allied military and relief effort to protect and help feed Iraq's northern Kurdish minority through June. About 1,800 Air Force and other American military personnel are still taking part in the operation.
Turkey's cooperation in accepting American, British and French air forces and their daily flights over Iraqi territory is helping to keep Bush Administration options open for a continuing pressure campaign against Baghdad in the coming year.
The Pentagon last month submitted a plan to the White House on how United States forces would assist a coup attempt against Mr. Hussein if the coup leaders asked for American backing, Administration officials have said. No such request has been received, officials said, but the contingency planning was deemed necessary by President Bush's senior advisers in the event international sanctions succeed in breaking Mr. Hussein's tenacious grip on power in Baghdad.
Mr. Boucher, reading an Administration statement and referring to Resolutions 706 and 712 passed in October, said: "The United Nations Security Council has provided the means for Iraq to raise nearly a billion dollars from the sale of oil to meet the near-term humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. We call on the Iraqi Government to immediately and unconditionally accept these."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 29, Past 3,200

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
The stock market rally steamed further into uncharted territory yesterday, shoving the Dow Jones industrial average through the 3,200 level for the first time. Just a week after passing 3,100, the Dow closed at 3,201.48, up 29.07 points.
Posting its sixth straight record, the Dow rode an initial spurt of buying and then climbed gradually, reaching 3,200 in the final hour of trading. It was the Dow's 11th consecutive rise. 
 "The primary bull trend is still very much in force," said Anthony Ludovici, senior investment analyst at Tucker Anthony. Calling the market overvalued at current prices, he said the market's strength "definitely reflects optimism about the future."
Money continues to gush into stock funds from bonds and money markets. Fidelity Investments reported yesterday that on a single day -- Dec. 30 -- the company's equity funds under management grew by a remarkable $1 billion from a combination of new sales, fund transfers and market appreciation.
 
Other Records Set
 Trading was active yesterday, as the total number of exchanged shares reached 224.3 million. Gaining issues topped losing ones by 1,079 to 680.
Records were again set by the Nasdaq composite index, up 6.20 points, to 592.65, and by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues, which rose 2.08 points, to 419.34.
Before yesterday, the American Stock Exchange index was one of the market's few main indicators that had not set a record in the current rally. That barrier fell, too, as the index rose 3.32, to 398.83, surpassing the 397.03 set on Oct. 10, 1989.
The Dow's advance was paced by steady gains in several auto stocks, in apparent anticipation of an economic recovery.
 
Big 3 Are Up
 "Auto stocks will be the direct beneficiaries of an upturn," said Paul Kronlokken, a technical analyst at Piper Jaffrey in Minneapolis. "A lot of analysts have turned their tides on them from lukewarm to warm."
General Motors, which faltered last month as news of impending layoffs was announced, rose yesterday by 1 1/2, to 32 1/2. Ford went up 1 1/4, to 30 3/8, and Chrysler climbed 1, to 13 1/2. All three were among the day's 10 most active stocks.
Mr. Ludovici said he thought the market had also interpreted President Bush's decision to take auto executives on his trip to Japan as a reinforcement of the Administration's message that it would work to bring down trade barriers.
"The Administration is going to take steps to improve the economy," he said. "That's what this market is reflecting."
A byproduct of current low interest rates, Mr. Ludovici noted, is easier financing for consumers who purchase cars.
Mr. Ludovici added, however, that a surge by stocks in the first quarter last year was based on the expectation of an economic recovery, sparked by the victory in the Persian Gulf war. But when the recovery never came, the market essentially moved sideways for most of the year.
"It's very possible we'll see a similar situation," he said.
 
Getting on Bandwagon
 Mr. Kronlokken of Piper, Jaffrey conceded that the current rally had surprised him.
"I think it caught a lot of people by surprise," Mr. Kronlokken said. "Which causes more buying. More people want to leap on the bandwagon."
Yet he cautioned that he found it difficult to figure out if the market was becoming overheated -- and ready for a setback -- or poised for a further climb.
Among the most heavily traded stocks yesterday was Wal-Mart Stores, with 3.78 million shares changing hands. The stock fell 1 3/8, to 57 3/4, despite announcing that December sales in its stores were up 26 percent, to 5.86 billion from a year earlier.
Several other retail stocks moved sharply as December sales figures were released. Woolworth rose 1 1/8, to 28 1/8, after announcing that total sales for December through the 28th rose 4.8 percent, to $1.45 billion from $1.39 billion.
 
Dayton Hudson Drops
 Dayton Hudson dropped 1 1/2, to 60 1/4, after it announced that lower-than-expected sales would have a substantial impact on the earnings. Dayton Hudson's same-store sales gained 1.5 percent for the four weeks ended Dec. 28. The Gap climbed 2 3/4, to 58 3/4.
In Nasdaq trading, Scimed Life Systems leapt 8 1/4, to 90 1/2, after the company disclosed new products to be introduced in the next 90 days.
A mutual fund manager trying to keep up with the heavy flow of cash into stock funds said he had noticed a trend toward smaller growth stocks.
"We seem to be in a stock-picking environment," said Michael Hines, senior vice president for marketing at Fidelity Investments.
Mr. Hines said that new sales at Fidelity in December ran at about double the rate of November, but that in the final week of December, buying of stock funds by existing and new customers was up eightfold over November's daily average.
The market's sharp rise in late December, he said, combined with new sales and fund transfers to lift the value of the firm's total equity funds under management by about $1 billion, to $50.9 billion on Dec. 30.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Weyerhaeuser Taking Big Charge

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The Weyerhaeuser Company said today that it would take year-end special charges and a credit that would reduce its 1991 after-tax earnings by about $344 million, or $1.70 a share. The charges will result in Weyerhaeuser's first annual or quarterly loss since it began reporting in 1933.
"These actions should put a number of uncertainties behind us and allow the company to begin 1992 with a clean slate," said John W. Creighton, Weyerhaeuser's president and chief executive. 
 Weyerhaeuser's shares fell slightly on the news today, before recovering to close at $28.125, up 75 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The forest-products company said several factors necessitated the charges, among them that the economic recession had been longer and deeper than expected, which had generated losses associated with real estate land values and partnerships.
Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., also said that contractions in the supply of timber from public lands in the Northwest would cause the early closing of some manufacturing plants and would contribute to losses from contractual obligations. Modernization or closing of some plants with environmental and operations problems will be required. Environmental cleanup costs, and severance costs associated with plant closings were also a factor.
The company also said it would put into effect new accounting standards relating to post-retirement employee health benefits and to income taxes, causing a charge of $125 million, and a credit of $64 million, respectively.
The charges "are really an aggregation of little tag-ends that they seem to have taken care of all at once," said Evadna Lynn, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. "The negative side is that it's one more piece of bad news, and people are saying 'how many more until we see this company turn around.' ".
Ms. Lynn added that the charge was not that big and was not related to the company's operating results.

HEADLINE: Productivity Was Up 0.9% In 3d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Worker productivity rose at a slight rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the summer, a much weaker advance than had first been reported, the Government said today.
"It's consistent with an economy moving sideways," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. "These slow productivity gains are a product of a struggling economy." 
 Non-farm productivity, defined as output per hour of work, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent from July through September, rather than the 2.4 percent rebound first reported, the Labor Department said in revising its earlier numbers.
 
3 Quarters in a Row
 Although a rise of nine-tenths of 1 percent is small, it was still the third straight quarterly advance, the first such streak in nearly four years.
"It is promising that productivity growth is tending to show some gains," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company.
Increased productivity is considered vital to improving the standard of living without increasing inflation.
The report also included encouraging data on inflation. Unit labor costs, considered a crucial barometer of business expenses, rose 1.9 percent in the third quarter, well below the 2.6 percent increase in the second quarter and the 5.3 percent surge for all of last year.
"Wages are really being held down these days," Mr. Dederick said. "While that's tough for the worker, it is acting to contain inflation."
The productivity revision is not surprising since the Government also recently revised its calculations of overall economic growth for the July-September quarter.
The gross domestic product, or the nation's total output of goods and services, edged up 1.7 percent for the third quarter, below the 2.5 percent reported earlier.
In the third quarter, while output grew 1.6 percent, hours worked rose seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 
An Upward Revision
 Today's report revised productivity upward for the second quarter. Productivity increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent from April through June, more than the increase of five-tenths of 1 percent first reported.
Since July 1990, when the recession began, productivity has been lackluster. This year, it has increased at least slightly each quarter.
Factory productivity grew 3.8 percent in the third quarter while total business productivity, including farming, grew 1.1 percent, the Labor Department said.
For all of 1990, non-farm productivity fell one-tenth of 1 percent, after a retreat of nine-tenths of 1 percent the previous year. That was the first back-to-back slide in a decade.

HEADLINE: With Local News and Memories, a Paper Ends Its Run

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J., Jan. 3

 BODY:
Shailesh Patel, the owner of Brown's Cigar Store, looked up from his calculator at the stacks of daily newspapers arranged on bleacher-style shelving next to the door.
"See that?" he said, pointing to the one empty space that a few hours earlier held more than 200 copies of The Daily Journal. "All gone." 
 Mr. Patel was correct in two ways. He had sold out his daily allotment of the paper. And those copies -- with "Farewell" printed in bold black type across the front page -- were the last Daily Journals he would ever sell.
The oldest newspaper in New Jersey, founded by a group of Revolutionary patriots in 1779, has died, and for the first time in 212 years, Elizabeth is without its own newspaper.
The paper has had a series of owners and had a peak circulation of just over 60,000. But during the last decade, The Daily Journal, which published Monday through Saturday, failed to thrive in this aging industrial city of 110,000. As the paper's readership aged or moved to the suburbs, circulation leveled off at about 30,000. Then came the recession.
"We were holding our own up to then," said Richard J. Vezza, the publisher for North Jersey Newspapers, which acquired The Daily Journal almost seven years ago.
 
After 212 Years, 28 Pages
 After two straight years of steep losses -- particularly in classified advertising, he said -- the owners decided to sell or close. The staff was notified Nov. 1, and despite some deadline negotiations with the only potential buyer, there was never much hope for salvation.
Another of the North Jersey Newspapers, The Hudson Dispatch of Union City, was acquired by The Jersey Journal of Jersey City last April and ceased independent publication.
This morning's Daily Journal, a 28-page paper in four sections, contained the usual mix of local, national, foreign and sports news, as well as more than four pages of reminiscences about the paper, articles about its alumni and praise from citizens and public figures.
Where classified advertising fell short, The Journal inserted a filler ad promoting itself. The Star-Ledger of Newark, the state's largest paper, took two full-page ads, one inviting new subscribers and the other inviting Daily Journal carriers to apply for a Star-Ledger paper route.
Between 90 and 100 employees worked in The Daily Journal's modern offices at 295 Broad Street in downtown Elizabeth. In one large room, 25 reporters and editors shared space with the business and advertising departments and the composing room.
 
Most Employees Laid Off
 Eighty-four people will be laid off by the closing, Mr. Vezza said. The others will be absorbed by North Jersey Newspapers, which, in addition to The North Jersey Herald & News, publishes 13 weeklies. One of those, the Suburban News of Westfield, will be circulated in Elizabeth.
Staffers in the advertising department were on the phone throughout the day to solicit ads for the successor weekly. Reporters and editors wandered in later in the day, weary from an impromptu wake that kept them at a local tavern until 3 A.M.
Throughout its tenure, the paper's concerns were unabashedly local. The front page on Thursday was a showcase for two standard stories of local news. One featured the parents of the first child born in Union County in 1992, the other an account of a house fire that started in a mattress and killed a Roselle man.
Like many papers its size, The Daily Journal was often a farm team for larger newspapers. Sometimes, staff members stayed longer. Among them was Mike Murray, 29 years old, the managing editor.
"It was a little somber for me last night, because this is the only job I ever had," said Mr. Murray, who worked part time for The Daily Journal's sports department while in college. He became a sports reporter in 1985, after two years playing minor league ball for the White Sox.
"This is the paper that was on my parents' doorstep since I was 5 years old and we moved to Rahway," he said.
 
A Habit Hard to Break
 It was also the paper that showcased the talents of local athletes, he said. A call from The Daily Journal's sports editor could help a young athlete win a sports scholarship or gain visibility with college coaches.
And for many like Mr. Murray who were born or grew up here, The Daily Journal was a habit that will be hard to break.
Shortly after noon, an elderly woman marched into Mr. Patel's newspaper and tobacco shop near the train station, stared at the stacks of papers and asked of no one in particular, "No Journal?"
"All gone," Mr. Patel said again. But the woman misunderstood his double-edged reply and went off down the street to find a copy.
Informed that The Daily Journal had gone out of business, she seemed shocked. Shooing her informant away, she said, "You know I've read the paper all my life. I buy it every day."
"It'll be back," she said. "Don't you think?"

HEADLINE: Deep Recession Takes Aim at New Jersey Papers

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The Daily Journal of Elizabeth closed yesterday in the latest manifestation of the very hard times New Jersey newspapers are facing.
Indeed, the state's especially crowded newspaper competition and the deep recession in the state suggest that The Journal could easily be joined by other papers in the months to come. 
 Even the strongest newspapers have been affected by a huge decline in real estate, job, automobile and retail advertising in New Jersey. For example, The Record, which is based in Hackensack and has long prospered in Bergen County, has a $110 million debt for a printing plant it ordered when business was booming. The Record's payroll is smaller by 400 employees than it was in 1988. Among the missing are 186 employees dismissed last summer.
"That hadn't happened since my grandfather had a layoff in 1931," said Malcolm A. Borg, the owner of The Record, "and I didn't enjoy it."
In some ways, the New Jersey newspaper business -- especially the counties closest to New York -- is typical of the business in all suburban areas, where metropolitan and suburban papers fight for advertising with each other and with such competitors as dozens of new cable television channels and companies that deliver advertising circulars by mail.
But New Jersey is different from other places in that every aspect of its situation is exaggerated: it is more competitive, its economy boomed more spectacularly than most in the 80's, and many newspaper executives fear that its economy is less likely than many others to rebound significantly.
As a result, newspaper profits are off almost everywhere in the state, and some of the more vulnerable newspapers -- like The Daily Journal in depressed Elizabeth -- have slipped into an unprofitability from which there may be no recovery.
New Jersey residents probably live in the most newspaper-rich environment in the nation. The New York Times, The Daily News, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal are all readily available in New Jersey, and The Philadelphia Inquirer circulates widely in the southern part of the state. This year The Times plans to open a new printing plant in Edison, N.J., that will give it added flexibility to produce editions aimed at readers in specific areas and thus increase its ability to pursue advertising in New Jersey.
The Star-Ledger, which is based in Newark and owned by the Newhouse family, which also owns Conde Nast magazines, circulates throughout the state with an array of special "zoned" editions and local sections. In a typical example of The Star-Ledger's aggressive marketing savvy, its Sunday sports section is encyclopedic, tracking sports throughout the state in great detail. Not surprisingly, its 700,000 Sunday circulation dwarfs that of every other paper in New Jersey.
The Record in Hackensack and The Asbury Park Press could be considered regional dailies, and they have expanded their areas of coverage in recent years, often encroaching on the turf of smaller dailies. For instance, The Press has challenged The Ocean County Observer in Toms River, which is owned by Goodson Newspapers.
 
A Little Stronger
 Though The Star-Ledger, The Record and The Asbury Park Press have all been hurt in the advertising crunch, they have more fundamental strength than any other dailies in the state. But a newspaper executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said that declining profits have prompted the Plangere family to quietly seek a buyer for The Asbury Park Press, and The Record is hoping to sell its new presses to reduce its debt, then lease the presses back.
In the next category are small dailies that have been squeezed from above by the local sections of larger papers and from below by a swarm of non-daily papers that have formed networks covering large areas.
The small, community daily is probably New Jersey's most endangered type of newspaper. The Central New Jersey Home News in New Brunswick is an example. The paper has been in the family of William M. Boyd, its owner, since 1879, and it covers about half of Middlesex County. Also based in Middlesex County is The News Tribune of Woodbridge and Perth Amboy, which is owned by Mr. Borg, owner of The Record. In the 80's, said Mr. Boyd, "we were really booming along" as the job market produced double-digit increases in help-wanted and real-estate classified advertising each year. Everyone prospered.
It was during this period that W. Dean Singleton, chief executive officer of Media News Group Inc., began assembling his chain of daily and non-daily newspapers in New Jersey, including The Daily Journal in Elizabeth.
 
Bonuses Decline
 Indeed, though Elizabeth was one of the state's most decaying urban centers, real-estate prices were increasing so fast that it seemed even Elizabeth might be revived by people looking for affordable housing in the expanding job market.
Then came the stock market crash of 1987. The bonuses of New Jersey residents working on Wall Street dwindled, and service industry jobs began to decline with them. What had gone up fast began to decline just as rapidly.
In 1991, in the face of a revenue shortfall and huge social-service obligations built up during the fat years, the New Jersey Legislature passed a $2.8 billion tax increase package.
While the economy was being buffeted for many reasons, consumer confidence -- and advertising -- took a decided turn for the worse. "Everything came to a screeching halt," said Mr. Singleton.
Neither Mr. Boyd's Home News nor Mr. Borg's News Tribune is faring well now in Middlesex County. Mr. Boyd has put The Home News up for sale, and Mr. Borg has said that he intends to buy it, but cannot afford to do so right now.
Mr. Borg, whose candor extends to posting a notice at The Record last year announcing his decision to seek help for alcohol abuse, said that buying The Home News would make economic sense only if it could then be closed.
The most unpredictable parts of New Jersey's newspaper industry are its many non-dailies, which range from groups clustered in various parts of the state to independents, including The Two River Times, a weekly in Monmouth County founded in 1990 and soon after bought by Geraldo Rivera, who lives in the Red Bank area.
Claudia Ansorge, who owns 25 percent of The Times and serves as publisher, describes trying to start a paper in such a miserable economic environment as being "a dance between the raindrops," but thanks in part to Mr. Rivera's willingness to sign copies in shopping malls and other promotions, ad sales and circulation are growing.
But stand-alone non-daily papers are almost a relic of the past because, in groups -- and almost only in groups -- they have proven to be potent vehicles for attracting advertising away from dailies.
The potential profit was sufficient during the 80's boom to attract Malcolm Forbes, whose family now owns a group of non-dailies in New Jersey, which is one of several similar groups around the state.
With the closure of The Daily Record in Elizabeth, Mr. Singleton will own only one daily in New Jersey, The North Jersey Herald and News in Passaic, but he will own about two dozen non-dailies in Passaic, Union and Bergen counties with mid-week circulation of more than 650,000 and weekend circulation of nearly 500,000. He also plans to start a non-daily in Elizabeth.
Just as the dailies have suffered, so have the non-dailies, and many are thought to be losing money or close to it.
Mr. Singleton said that December was the first month in more than two years in which revenues at his New Jersey papers improved compared to the year before, and he said this was a promising sign for all of New Jersey's battered papers.
But he added that his optimism was all but unique.

HEADLINE: Politicians Assail Hertz For New York Surcharge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Kathleen Restifo and Dr. David Bernstein rented from Hertz this weekend, but she will be doing all the driving. She's from Philadelphia; he's from Brooklyn.
Dr. Bernstein had reserved a car a few days ago for a weekend getaway, but on Thursday, Hertz announced that it would apply a surcharge to rentals by most New York City residents; when he arrived at the rental counter at 222 East 40th Street in Manhattan yesterday after work, he was told that the extra cost for the two-day rental would be $68. 
 Dr. Bernstein, a psychologist at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Hospital, was disgusted. "I'm surprised they don't just shut down the operation," he said. "Why don't they just get out of town? Unless they want an elite, corporate clientele, which is maybe what they're after."
There were moments of individual outrage yesterday at rental counters around the area and at telephones where callers tried to reserve cars, and there was an organized demonstration of anger as officials lined up to condemn Hertz for the surcharge policy it announced on Thursday. Forty demonstrators paraded in front of a midtown rental outlet and chanted "Hertz hurts New York," and other car rental concerns offered theories of what motivated the company.
Hertz said it was imposing the surcharges -- $3 a day for residents of Manhattan, $15 for Queens, $34 for Brooklyn, $56 for the Bronx and nothing for Staten Island residents or corporate customers -- because of large losses that it attributes to New York State's insurance law. Company officials yesterday released information to bolster their argument that the law that allows for "vicarious liablity" suits has made it unprofitable to operate in New York City. Under the vicarious liability law, a rental company can be forced to pay for any damage caused by one of its cars, even if neither the company nor the person to whom it rented was at fault.
 
Case in Brooklyn
 A spokesman for Hertz, Joseph M. Russo, said the law meant, for example, that the company had paid $2.5 million in the case of a a Brooklyn resident who gave the keys to his rented car to his cousin, an unemployed, unlicensed driver who was under age 25 -- Hertz's minimum. Driving in New York City at excessive speed, the cousin hit a pedestrian, who fell into a coma after suffering a fractured skull and brain damage. The pedestrian lost 98 percent of the use of his right arm, and was so disabled that he was unable to propel a wheelchair. The pedestrian sued for $7.5 million, and the suit was settled.
The explanation for the surcharges did not go far with public officials. Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, said in a statement, "Hertz has put discrimination in the driver's seat." The charge, he said, was "an outrageous act of bias, dividing our people into privileged and underprivileged classes."
New York Attorney General Robert Abrams, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs and even the New York Civil Liberties Union all said they were investigating. The Attorney General's office said its staff would meet with Hertz next week.
Around the rental car industry, reaction varied. At Avis, a lobbyist who has been trying to have New York amend its vicarious liability law said the $45 million loss figure quoted by Hertz for the last three years was about what Avis would expect, given Hertz's volume of business. The lobbyist, Jerome L. Wilson, a lawyer with the firm of Rogers and Wells, said New York is so hard on rental cars that of Avis's nationwide reserve fund for accidents, 25 percent is dedicated to New York State, despite the fact that New York represents only 8 percent of Avis's business.
But Mr. Russo, of Hertz, insisted that the problem was not damage to the cars themselves.
"The cars range in price from $12,000 to $20,000," he said. "Suppose you total it, or you steal the thing. You lose an average of $15,000 per vehicle, that's it."
Referring to the vicarious liability suits, he said, "Here, we're talking about $220,000, $230,000, $2 million or $3 million."
But others said the problem did not justify Hertz's solution, which would appear to write off business from renters in those three boroughs.
 
$7 Million Judgment
 At Alamo, which rents from a location near Newark International Airport and which would like to enter the New York City market, Charles D. Platt, the president, said his company had recently paid $7 million in a vicarious liability suit. But Mr. Platt, who worked for General Motors in Manhattan for years, said that he did not think vicarious liability was the issue for Hertz.
"Local renters don't have the same motives," he said. "They're renting a car because they don't have enough money to buy a car, or they are wise enough to know -- and you never have to worry about a New Yorker being savvy -- that if you wreck that car, you don't have to be responsible for it."
Hertz is 49 percent owned by the Ford Motor Company. The other owners are Volvo of North America, 26 percent; Commerzbank, a German bank, 5 percent, and Hertz management, 20 percent.

HEADLINE: Threats by Phone: Free Speech or Just Another Evil?

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANSONIA, Conn., Jan. 3

 BODY:
The answering machine at Gary Hale's home has lost its angry edge. No longer does it play back obscene messages attacking Mr. Hale, a state senator, for casting one of the pivotal votes last summer that gave Connecticut an income tax.
But vitriolic messages left on that machine months ago, at the height of protests against the new tax, have come home to some of the people who called him. One anonymous caller has been identified and charged with harassment. The police say other arrests are possible. 
 The police investigation into the calls has raised alarms over the stifling of free expression in politics, at the same time that it has revealed just how low the level of discourse in Connecticut sank in 1991. What seems most clear is the depth of the anger Mr. Hale stirred by casting the decisive vote for an income tax he had vowed to oppose.
"Gary Hale's in the middle of a hornets' nest," said Robert C. Pollack, managing editor of The Evening Sentinel, a Naugatuck Valley newspaper that found sentiment running 62 to 1 against the income tax among 5,000 readers who took part in a straw vote. "People in the valley blame him."
John R. Williams, a well-known civil liberties lawyer who represents the person arrested, 27-year-old Robert Wall of Shelton, describes Mr. Wall's arrest as "a wonderful First Amendment case."
"I was amazed, when I saw the warrant, that the judge even signed the thing," Mr. Williams said. "I was also somewhat surprised that the prosecutor didn't throw the case out when we first went to court. I think the reason is that it's highly political."
Mr. Hale became a target for income-tax opponents in August when he and two other senators gave up their opposition to the tax. Their votes created an 18-18 tie in the Senate that was broken in favor of the income tax by Lieut. Gov. Eunice Groark.
Mr. Hale says he still opposes the income tax, and last month he voted for its repeal. But with the state in financial crisis last summer, he said, "I felt the responsible thing to do was try to break the deadlock." His price: assurances of a low-interest loan fund for expanding businesses.
 
'Burn Your House Down'
 "People calling me and yelling or swearing doesn't really bother me," Mr. Hale said. "I've been a senator for five years." But on Aug. 23, the day after Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. signed the income tax into law, he announced that his home and family had been threatened by anonymous callers who left messages on his answering machine.
"One said, 'You better stay awake all night or I'm going to burn your house down,' " Mr. Hale said. "The second said, 'Your two kids are going to pay for your vote in Hartford.' "
In an interview this week, Mr. Hale said, "I certainly don't mind anger or criticism directed at me. But I don't think when I signed up for this job I invited abuse of my family."
Mr. Hale went to the Ansonia and the State Capitol police. They suggested the telephone company install a trap on his line that could identify the source of calls. The calls continued, building to a peak as a giant anti-tax rally in Hartford on Oct. 5 approached.
About 5 percent of the calls, Mr. Hale estimates, were threatening or obscene, and anonymous. He reported the date and time of those calls so they could be traced. He also had his machine's recordings.
Senator Hale was not alone in receiving threats and talking with the police. Some legislators received death threats, and some stopped using their legislative license plates. On Oct. 5, more than 40,000 people railed against the income tax at an angry rally at the State Capitol. Governor Weicker was spat at and sworn at. The telephone numbers of legislators who voted for the tax boomed out over the public-address system.
That night, at 7:23, the telephone rang at Mr. Hale's house in the big downstairs room that includes both his office and his 4-year-old daughter's play room. The answering machine began recording.
According to a police transcript, the call began with several variations on a common vulgarity. The caller then said people would never vote for Mr. Hale again, adding, "You are stupid. You made a mistake. You're gone, boy, you're gone. You're through in this town."
That was one of several calls traced to Mr. Wall, who was charged with one count of harassment, a misdemeanor, on Dec. 6.
Mr. Wall's lawyer, Mr. Williams, said the call was not harassment, but the free speech of a constituent calling a legislator. "If that isn't the protected criticism of a public official, I don't know what is," he said of the transcript.
 
Suspect Feels Humiliated
 The fact that the message was anonymous, Mr. Williams said, does not matter. "The right of anonymous complaint is an essential ingredient of the First Amendment," he said.
Mr. Wall also protested, in an interview with The Evening Sentinel, that he had been set up, degraded and humiliated by his very public arrest. He acknowledged swearing in the Oct. 5 call, but said he was only doing what the Senator had asked people to do: share their feelings about the income tax.
Ansonia's police chief, James J. McGrath, said his officers have spoken to other people who have been traced to anonymous calls to Mr. Hale, and there may be more arrests.
"Nobody is arrested for just calling him and complaining about the income-tax bill," he emphasized. "It's more than that. It's harassing or threatening him."
Several people called by the Ansonia police in turn called the Connecticut Taxpayers Committee. The anti-tax group, which has organized protests and telephone campaigns against legislators who voted for the income tax, acknowledges sending thousands of pieces of mail listing Mr. Hale's telephone numbers into his district.
The committee's chairman, Tom Scott, a former senator from Milford, said, "We ask people to call legislators. In fact, we insist that they call legislators. But we ask that they call at reasonable hours, and that they be firm but polite.
"So long as the threat is limited to political retaliation," he said, "it's protected speech."
Mr. Williams said he found it ironic that in a First Amendment case, Mr. Wall's staunchest defenders would include many strong advocates of the income tax, like himself. But Senator Hale made no apologies for going to the police. Every call that he reported, he said, was "anonymous and involved either obscenities or threats."
"If someone called up and said, 'To hell with you, I'm against the income tax,' and left a name and number, I didn't report those calls," he said. "I have no sympathy for those who are being investigated."
Mr. Hale's telephone was quiet during the Legislature's special session in December, when he joined in an unsuccessful effort to repeal the income tax. Since the investigation became public, he said, only one person has left a message about the tax. That person favored it, and left his name and number.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
President Is Installed At Economists Group

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
William Vickrey, a grand old man of public finance whose avant-garde ideas have influenced economists since the late 1930's, has become the new president of the 20,000-member American Economics Association.
Mr. Vickrey, 78 years old, a professor of economics at Columbia University, will hold the post -- largely an honorary one -- for the usual one-year term. As president-elect last year, he took over the new position yesterday at the start of the organization's yearly meeting in New Orleans, succeeding Thomas Schelling of Harvard University. 
 Becoming the group's president "is the greatest tribute, short of the Nobel Prize, that an economist could receive," Mr. Vickrey said in an interview.
One of his main jobs is to preside over the meeting, which is a three-day affair that entails more than 500 different seminars on topics ranging from taxation in the 1990's to women in the work force. It also includes the biggest job fair in the world for academic economists.
Mr. Vickrey, tall, white-haired and rumpled, criticizes the economics profession for "not really coming up with sound solutions to basic problems."
"Too many economists," he said, "are basically astronomers, admiring our wonderful free-market system, or weathermen, predicting what the economy is going to do."
Mr. Vickery himself has concentrated on a handful of innovative proposals that were radical when they were introduced but have now become part of mainstream thinking. They have included a method for pricing subway rides, a model for preventing traffic tie-ups at toll plazas and a way to tax income fairly no matter when it was earned.
"Like Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize this year, he has written only a few papers, but each one has been influential," said Henry Aaron, an expert on taxation at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Vickrey counts himself a radical and expresses the radical's usual frustration. "My whole career has been spent making eminently sensible suggestions that have gotten nowhere," he said.
In fact, however, Singapore has a Vickrey-style traffic-congestion tax, and most cities, except Mr. Vickrey's own New York, charge subway riders by distance and time of day, a method he first proposed for New York a couple of decades ago. Indeed, one panel moderator who introduced Mr. Vickrey yesterday, pointed out that Mr. Vickrey helped write Japan's postwar tax system during the American occupation.
Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Mr. Vickrey grew up in New York. After earning a B.A. in mathematics at Yale, he studied economics at Columbia University, where he has taught nearly his entire career. A conscientious objector during World War II, he spent part of his alternative service designing a new inheritance tax for Puerto Rico.
Mr. Vickrey astonished his students and fellow faculty members for years by roller skating from his commuter train stop in Harlem to his university office. His addiction to crossword puzzles is so overpowering that he has been known to do them surreptitiously during lectures by visiting eminences.
And his catnapping is notorious. "He is known for sleeping through every seminar" he attends, said a Columbia colleague, who added, "But he always asks the first question -- and it's usually a good one."

HEADLINE: Treasuries Slip on Budget Concerns

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slipped a bit again yesterday, as worries arose again about what sort of fiscal package Congress and the Bush Administration were likely to concoct over the next few months.
Talk about tax cuts and the like was stimulated by an article yesterday in The Washington Post, which quoted President Bush as saying the 1990 budget accord might be reopened to shift spending planned for the military into domestic areas. 
"What the President actually said was constructive, in that he said he did not want to bust the budget," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets.
"But the market is still very sensitive to the fiscal situation, and has become conditioned to expect the worst from Washington," he added.
 
Protectionism and Profits
 Market participants said concern also arose about protectionist-sounding rhetoric that had fallen into Mr. Bush's public pronouncements during his trip to the Far East.
In addition, the urge remained to take profits after a prolonged rally.
"To get some selling after what we have seen is not surprising," one government bond trader said. "But the market has a good tone to it, largely because there is widespread anticipation that the economic news next week will be favorable to fixed-income investors."
Specifically, analysts are expecting a report on producer prices to show that inflation at the wholesale level was mild during December. And there is every reason to assume that the December employment report, scheduled to be released by the Labor Department next Friday, will show a fairly large decline in the number of non-farm payroll employees.
 
30-Year Bonds at 7.47%
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds due in 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 106 9/32 , down 5/32 , to yield 7.47 percent, compared with 7.46 percent late on Thursday and 7.51 percent on Dec. 27.
Among note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 25/32 , down 13/32 , to yield 6.82 percent. The 6 1/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 15/32 , down by 3/8 a point, to yield 6.48 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes dipped by 1/32 , to a late offered price of 100 14/32 , to yield 4.76 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.83 percent late yesterday, down by a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.86 percent.
 
World Bank Plans Sale
 The prospect that next week will be a very busy one in the investment-grade corporate bond market was heightened yesterday, when the World Bank said it intended to sell $1.5 billion in global bonds. In the past, such issues have generally had maturities of 5 to 10 years.
The bank said yesterday that the maturity of the securities to be sold next week would be toward the longer end of that range.
In the corporate bond market yesterday, the Cigna Corporation offered $100 million in 15-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 8.25 percent notes were priced at $100, or par, 1.42 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Money Supply Down
 In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week that ended on Dec. 23.
M-1, the nation's basic money supply, rose by $100 million.
The reported declines in M-2, the aggregate most closely monitored by the Fed, and in M-3 were much larger than expected. But the report had no effect on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Despite a Lingering Recession, More People Are Giving to the Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
A dramatic surge in the number of donations enabled The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to top $3.5 million yesterday as it entered the second half of the campaign.
Thirty-four days into the campaign, the Neediest Cases has received 9,789 donations, a 21.5 percent increase from last year when 8,060 contributions were made in the same period. 
 But the average size of donations has been smaller this year so that the campaign is only slightly ahead of last year's pace in the amount of money received. With two months to go, the 80th annual appeal must raise an additional $900,000 to match last year's total of $4.4 million.
Arthur Gelb, who is president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the Neediest Cases, said he is surprised and heartened that so many more people have decided to give despite the deepening recession.
 
Need for More Donations
 "The remarkable response to the Neediest Cases so far, in times of growing hardship, is a tribute to the loyalty and generosity of Times readers." he said. "Letters accompanying donations show how concerned many of our readers are about the harsh impact of governmental cuts in social services and the importance of private assistance in keeping such programs alive."
Mr. Gelb quickly added that there is still a long way to go. He noted that in the final two months of last year's campaign, $1.4 million was raised from 7,520 donations. "Our hope is that the dramatic success of the fund's drive will encourage further giving in the second half of the campaign," Mr. Gelb said, "so that donations will match or even surpass last year's record."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases" has expanded to meet the needs of thousands of individuals.
As in the past, The New York Times is covering all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities. The money provides many forms of relief including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide job training for the disabled, counseling for substance abusers, child abusers and services that address the complex problems confronted by people with AIDS.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Off on Report of Plans To Open Up Russian Mining

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Gold prices fell yesterday on a report that Russia would end the former state monopoly on mining and open up the new republic to prospecting.
Traders on the Commodity Exchange in New York said they were initially confused by the report that the republics making up what was formerly the world's third-largest gold producer would end the state monopoly on mining. 
 "I thought it was bullish when I first looked at the news," said a trader for a large Swiss bank. "But now I see it's not."
Fears that the breakup of the Soviet Union would disrupt gold, platinum and crude oil exports have provided background support to those markets for months.
The active February gold contract fell $1.70 an ounce yesterday, to $351.50, after the administrator of the large Magadan gold-producing district said the Government of the Russian republic planned to allow regions to give licenses for prospecting.
Silver prices, which peaked at $4.04 an ounce in the most active March contract, retreated later to close 0.3 cent lower at $3.972 an ounce.
Silver had jumped on Thursday in a speculative rally tied to the stock market's surge and vague hopes that the United States economy would emerge from recession and stimulate demand.
The prices of platinum, of which the former Soviet Union is a leading producer, also fell on the mining report. The January contract declined $4.10 an ounce, to $333.50, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil futures traded choppily yesterday, reversing course several times and finally ending lower.
February oil closed 26 cents lower at $19.23 a barrel after reaching an earlier high of $19.78. February heating oil gained 0.58 cent, to 52.14 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline for February eased 0.17 cent, to 55.27 cents a gallon.
Most of the action was viewed as technical, as the February contract failed to break through the $19.80-a- barrel level and then "slid quickly and scared a lot of length out of the market," said Tom Bentz, an analyst with United Energy Inc.
Poor weather in the North Sea forced a suspension of loadings and caused some futures buying, but traders said the weather was forecast to improve over the weekend.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies in Broad Rise As Mark Shows Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose broadly in foreign-exchange dealings yesterday, strengthened by new weakness in the German mark and speculation that the dollar's recent weakness may be overdone.
Currency market strategists said there was nothing in the domestic economic news to warrant a rise in the dollar. New statistics released by the Government yesterday showing modest improvements in factory orders and labor productivity did little to suggest that the United States is climbing out of recession. 
 Nonetheless, traders said the striking declines in interest rates in the United States that helped weaken the dollar last month have already been digested by the foreign exchange market, which is now looking for something new to provide direction for the currency.
 
Hints by German Officials
 Others said the dollar rallied on signs that the strength of the German mark was under increasing pressure. There have been hints dropped by German monetary officials that the nation is heading into a recession, suggesting interest rates in Germany will have to decline. Lower rates would make investments denominated in marks worth less.
The dollar strengthened sharply in Europe, to 1.5480 marks, up from 1.5275 Thursday. Later, in New York the dollar fetched 1.5435 marks, up from 1.5315 Thursday.
"We've had a pretty good rally for the dollar today," said Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services at the New York branch of Bank Brussels Lambert. "I think you're seeing some serious mark weakness."
Still, considerable skepticism prevails in the market over the strength of the dollar. Many traders believe it will head lower.
Some said President Bush's trip to Japan next week, with the stated goal of narrowing the enormous trade deficit, could yield some kind of currency-management arrangement with the Japanese that would result in a cheaper dollar. Such a shift would help raise American exports by making them more affordable in Japan.
Tokyo markets remained closed in an extended New Year holiday. In Europe, the dollar fetched 124.80 yen, up from 124.50 yen late Thursday. By the time trading concluded in New York, the dollar fetched 124.65 yen, up from 124.60 late Thursday.
The British pound fell in London, to $1.8445, from $1.8685 Thursday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.8485, down from $1.8655 Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, versus levels late Thursday, were: 1.3730 Swiss francs, up from 1.3665; 1.1466 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1509; 5.2675 French francs, down from 5.2905, and 1,165.00 Italian lire, up from 1,158.00.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Help for Workers Posted Overseas

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
WITH the economic integration of Western Europe this year and the remarkable drive by Eastern Europe toward a market economy, American companies are increasing their presence abroad. But people who assume that a transfer to Brussels is like a move to, say, Boston, can find that financial disasters arise.
Even in Western Europe, consumer banking practices often do not meet American expectations, and in Eastern Europe and the third world many services may not be available at all. Also, most people assigned overseas continue to have financial obligations at home -- mortgage and tuition payments, insurance premiums, investment accounts, credit cards, taxes, perhaps alimony or support for elderly parents. All of this calls for arranging financial affairs in advance. 
 Robert A. De Rosa, a Citibank vice president who is director of personal banking services for overseas executives, said, "Although businesses preparing their people for overseas assignments generally review factors such as housing, children's education, shipping personal belongings, cultural and language training, rarely do companies, even the more experienced ones, think about expatriates' banking needs until funds are lost in transit, checks start to bounce and credit ratings are damaged."
Mr. De Rosa experienced difficulties firsthand when the bank posted him to Italy, which led him to start the personal banking unit eight years ago to serve Citibank's own international staff. In the clubby atmosphere of American business people abroad, others soon wanted to become clients.
Today the unit serves 4,000 clients from 40 companies in 91 countries. In some cases, corporations provide the service to personnel as a benefit; in others, individuals sign up on their own at fees ranging from $25 to $60 a month, depending on the level of service needed.
"Some people go abroad and try having in-laws, for example, pay the bills," Mr. De Rosa said. "Even when they are diligent, it can strain the best of relationships," and bills mailed overseas often get lost or arrive after the due date. Sometimes job performance suffers because people become so preoccupied with financial snarls, he added.
The bank sets up personal arrangements for each client. For example, it may arrange to have a certain amount from each paycheck wired overseas for the client to use, and a certain portion deposited at Citibank. A personal banker can then pay agreed-upon bills or invest in mutual funds or through discount brokerage services, as agreed.
Not infrequently, Mr. De Rosa said, the personal bankers get involved in sorting out distant emergencies, like canceling credit cards for, and wiring money to, the panic-stricken executive who telephoned from Thailand that his wallet had been stolen. The department is at 666 Fifth Avenue; more details can be provided by calling either Mr. De Rosa or Helen Benjamin of the corporate sales and marketing department at (212) 307-8511.
 
 
Estimated Taxes
 Estimated tax payments for the fourth quarter of 1991 are due on Wednesday, Jan. 15, and tax professionals report that clients are asking about the rigorous new standards Congress imposed on estimated payments in November, when it sought to speed up revenue collections to pay for extended unemployment benefits.
The standards do not affect 1991 estimates. Taxpayers will not be subject to penalties if they have paid an amount equal to either 90 percent of their current liability or 100 percent of their 1990 liability through payroll withholding, estimated taxes or a combination.
But starting with payments due on June 15, 1992, certain taxpayers may no longer use the prior-year safe harbor. Generally, estimates will have to be based on current income for taxpayers who meet all of the following conditions:
* Their adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000, or $37,500 if married and filing separately.
* Their adjusted gross income increased by more than $40,000 over the previous year, or $20,000 if married and filing separately.
* They made estimated payments for any of the preceding three tax years or were penalized for their failure to do so.
Matthew R. Rosenberg, senior tax partner of Anchin Block & Anchin in New York, said he foresaw "an administrative nightmare for closely held family businesses," in getting accurate figures by midyear. Suppose, for example, a garment maker is owed money by a department store that later files for bankruptcy protection.
He is advising clients like family businesses and musicians to get records into better shape now.
Barry Salzberg, a partner in Deloitte & Touche, said, "I see a lot of problems with my client base," many of whom are in partnerships. Both tax experts predicted that some people would have to pay penalties because the necessary data would not be available, or the penalty would be less than the bookkeeping overtime needed.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Fall to 8.24%

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (AP)

 BODY:
Average interest charged on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has dropped to its lowest level in more than 18 years, according to a national survey released today.
Fixed rates this week averaged 8.24 percent, down from 8.35 percent the previous week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said. It was the lowest since rates averaged 8.18 percent during the week ending July 27, 1973. 
 On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 5.94 percent, down from 6.02 percent a week earlier and the lowest since the corporation, known as Fredie Mac, began tracking these types of mortgages in 1984.
Freddie Mac, reporting on 15-year mortgages for the first time, said they averaged 7.79 percent.
Mortgage rates have been falling since the spring but were given an added shove Dec. 20 when the Federal Reserve announced a one percentage point reduction in its discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks.
Economists are expecting the lowest mortgage rates in nearly a generation to spur a revival of home sales. The cuts have already motivated millions of homeowners to refinance existing mortgages.

HEADLINE: Junk Mail to Throw Into the Nearest VCR

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
As some companies scramble to generate sales, consumers are increasingly seeing high-tech forms of advertising -- videotapes and computer disks that promote products, including some that are mailed to consumers' homes.
Last September, for example, some newsstand copies of Elle magazine came with a videocassette that contained a two-and-a-half minute commercial for Spellbound, a perfume made by Estee Lauder. And for Christmas, the Hartmarx Corporation, the Chicago clothing manufacturer and retailer, mailed videotaped catalogues to the homes of some 150,000 customers. 
 These high-tech approaches to direct advertising are still relatively new. For one thing, they have been far more expensive than printed catalogues. But with many companies struggling in the recession, some are willing to gamble on novel strategies.
"It's so different that some companies figure that maybe it will work," said Lisa Caugherty, a spokeswoman for the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in New York City.
With videocassette recorders in 71 percent of American homes and with growing numbers of personal computers, this new approach to marketing becomes more attractive. But like junk mail, much of it will also be thrown away.
In recent years, high-tech marketing has taken several forms. Some companies, like Spiegel, have sold videotapes about fashion through their catalogues as a means of promoting clothing sales. Others, like Compaq Computer, have mailed prospective customers informational disks for personal computers promoting new computers.
Toyota the maker of Lexus, has been among the most frequent users of direct videotape advertising. In 1989, just before the Lexus went on the market, thousands of tapes on the new cars were mailed out to car enthusiasts, said Ann Pollack, the Lexus product marketing manager.
That promotion was so successful that last year the company sent videotapes featuring new models to thousands of potential customers before any publicity about them appeared elsewhere, Ms. Pollack said. The idea behind these six-minute programs was to entice consumers into showrooms when the new cars arrived, Ms. Pollack said.
 
$1 Million for Hartmarx Video
 The Hartmarx videotape, "A Perfect Picture for Christmas," showed a large family around a Christmas with each person wearing clothing from Hartmarx. It cost about $1 million to produce, which the company said was not much more than its printed Christmas catalogue. The video catalogue was sent only to customers who had bought at Hartmarx stores in the past year, the company said.
In terms of packaging, it would be hard to equal Estee Lauder's promotion. The videotape and Elle magazine came in a stiff plastic wrapper. Inside the box holding the tape was more promotional material including a piece of scented cardboard cut in the shape of a perfume bottle and listing prices.
The videotape features stark images of a man and woman intermingled with pictures of crashing waves. The videotape was distributed with Elle magazine at newsstands in 10 cities including New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
A spokeswoman for Estee Lauder said officials were not available this week for interviews about the promotion. But in a news release in August, Robin Burns, the company president, said the videotape was an effort to reach potential customers at home. "She can smell the fragrance via a scented blotter and make her selection at the same time she is enjoying the fantasy and romance of the commercial," the statement said.
Ms. Caugherty of the direct marketing group said the Hartmarx promotion had been well received by consumers and that she expected other companies would be trying similar promotions soon.
"Whenever there is a chance to stand out in a consumer's mailbox, it's a plus," she said.

HEADLINE: Credit Reports: The Overhaul Rolls On

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
After years of increasing consumer complaints about errors in credit reports, invasion of privacy and the cost of obtaining the records, the Federal Government and credit bureaus themselves are finally reacting to the pressure.
Here are some recent developments: 
 *United States Representative Esteban E. Torres, a California Democrat and the chairman of the House subcommittee on consumer affairs, introduced a bill intended to foster more privacy and greater accuracy in the reports. A similar bill is expected to be introduced in the Senate.
*Equifax, one of the three major chains in the $1-billion-a-year industry, has stopped selling personal information from its reports for direct marketing. It has also opened a national center with an "800" number -- (800) 685-1111 -- to answer consumers' questions.
*TRW, another giant chain, has announced that starting April 30, free copies of credit reports will be given annually to all consumers who request them. The company has also settled lawsuits with the Federal Trade Commission and 19 states by agreeing, among other things, to change certain procedures, resulting in easier-to-read reports and disclosure of credit-risk scores used to predict credit worthiness. Despite these settlements, a consumer-fraud lawsuit against TRW by the State of Vermont is still pending.
 
'Fundamental Decision'
 "Credit bureaus have made a fundamental decision that the negative publicity they've been receiving is not good for business," said Elgie Holstein, the director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit group in Herndon, Va. "They decided that the only way to forestall truly punitive legislation is to overhaul the way they deal with consumers."
D. Barry Connelly, the executive vice president of Associated Credit Bureaus, the industry's trade association, said that Congress would probably pass a new law amending the 20-year-old Fair Credit Reporting Act.
"We're willing to work toward passage of a piece of legislation that meets the legitimate needs of consumers, while offering a vehicle for the industry to provide quality service," he said. "Our product is built for usage by the credit grantor who pays for it, but it's a misconception to believe that the industry doesn't want the consumer to understand what the report says."
At hearings on the House bill last October, industry representatives gave cautious backing to some of the proposed changes. For example, Oscar Marquis, the vice president and general counsel of the Trans Union Corporation, another major company in the field, said that he supported "the requirement that disputed information be reverified and corrected within 30 days of the time the dispute is received by the credit bureau, in all but the most extraordinary cases."
Credit-bureau experts predict that the Torres bill will reach the floor of the House by spring. A companion measure that Senator Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois, plans to introduce may come up for discussion even earlier.
"There has to be a review administratively so that we can get the errors fixed," Senator Dixon said. "You don't want the huge Federal bureaucracy to get all over this thing, but we have not yet determined a good, workable plan for that yet."
Until any law is passed, it will largely be up to the credit bureaus to bolster their images among consumers. The move last month by Equifax to establish an information service center, with a toll-free telephone number, is designed to do just that.
"We recognize that the accuracy level could be better," said John A. Baker, a senior vice president. "The purpose of this development is to recognize that consumers are our customers and that we have an obligation to service them with professionalism."
Similarly, TRW broke ranks with the rest of the industry with an offer of free credit reports to anyone who asks for one. (The company has not yet announced the address.) A report now typically costs $15 to $20, except in the four states that have limits: California at $8, Connecticut at $10, Maine at $2 and Maryland at $5.
"The current rates are outrageous," said Mary J. Culnan, an associate professor at Georgetown University's business school. "It costs the credit bureaus a couple of bucks to put them out, and they should be sold at cost."
 
$7.50 Maximum
 TRW's settlement with the F.T.C. and the states sets a maximum fee of $7.50, adjusted each year for inflation, for copies of credit reports. What this means is that by April 30, TRW will offer one free report every year and additional copies for no more than $7.50 each.
"We wanted to involve consumers in the credit-granting system," said Susan Murdy, a TRW spokeswoman. "This makes them an active partner with us."
An annual check of your credit-bureau records is a good idea, particularly when it's free. But since the Big Three may have different information about you in their files, you would have to check with each company to be sure that no inaccuracies have crept in. Local numbers can be found in the Yellow Pages, usually under "Credit Reporting Agencies."
The F.T.C. is still seeking more enforcement powers over credit bureaus, including the authority to impose civil penalties for violations. And Vermont is still pressing its own suit against TRW, alleging the use of false and misleading credit reports.
In New York City, the Department of Consumer Affairs has reported that 35 percent of the credit-reporting agencies in the city disregard Federal law by making it easy to get unauthorized copies of someone else's credit file. Much of the criticism has been focused on middlemen, or resellers, who buy credit information from the Big Three and sell it to others. Some of these reports find their way to unauthorized users.
"Dealing in personal financial data calls for vigilance, not velocity," said Mark Green, Consumer Affairs Commissioner. "As computers get more sophisticated, some of our most intimate information is passed around to strangers more quickly and more widely and more cheaply than ever."

HEADLINE: ON PRO HOCKEY;
What's Up Inside the Rinks and With Outside Issues

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe

 BODY:
A survey of hockey's wintry landscape shows everything heating up. It is a busy and interesting time for legal matters, for trades and trade talk and for the intriguing National Hockey League race at the halfway point.
Behind the scenes, the issue is pension money involving the league and its players association. 
 In Camden, N.J., a Federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against the league by several former players over the disposition of funds. A similar suit is under way in Toronto and the league thought one was enough. The judge thought otherwise.
In Boston, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into broader matters of the union under the leadership of Alan Eagleson, who has been replaced as executive director by Bob Goodenow. All this comes while Goodenow tries to negotiate a new collective-bargaining agreement with the team owners to replace the one that expired on Sept. 15.
No strike deadline has been set or even threatened, although the start of the Stanley Cup playoffs in April marks the point when players will have earned most of their wages and owners will begin to harvest much of their profit.
Until then, the 22 league teams will scramble for 16 post-season berths. The second quarter of the season saw Washington and Vancouver maintain their first-place status but fall back to the pack after bursting ahead in the first six weeks. Two old-line clubs, Detroit and the Rangers, gained the most ground in the second 20-game segment of this 75th anniversary season.
The Red Wings, with three balanced scoring lines, lead the Norris Division, where Chicago and St. Louis have suddenly slid to mediocrity.
Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom, a defenseman from Sweden, is a strong candidate for rookie of the year. His plus/minus rating of plus-23 is tied for third-best in the league. Brett Hull leads the Blues and the league with 38 goals, but St. Louis isn't what it was last season.
The Rangers, with a second-quarter surge, seem so improved behind Mark Messier and Brian Leetch, who may be approaching his prime as an attacking defenseman. Still, this team is only 4 points better than it was at the same juncture last season.
Can Messier stay fresh and reverse the recent Ranger trend of fading in the stretch? Will General Manager Neil (rhymes with "deal") Smith attempt another blockbuster trade?
A make-it-or-break-it team for the second half is the Boston Bruins, whose .500 play can be excused by the absence of Cam Neely until Thursday night and the newness of Coach Rick Bowness.
Neely, a Messieric presence, returned Thursday night after recovering from a severe thigh injury suffered last spring. The Bruins made a big trade Thursday, sending Gary Galley and Wes Walz to Philadelphia for Gord Murphy, Brian Dobbin and a draft choice.
Bowness has been feuding with some of his players. If this trade and the return of Neely don't spark an improvement, look for more changes on the roster or behind the bench. Boston management isn't in the habit of finishing .500. Although second in the Adams, the Bruins remain 15 points behind the Montreal Canadiens, who cruise along in disciplined, dispassionate fashion.
They are so unlike the hot-headed Sabres, who pile up the penalty minutes and cling to fourth place only because Quebec brings up the near rear, just 3 points back.
Newly arrived star center Pat LaFontaine says newly arrived Coach John Muckler now wants to make the Sabres more of a skating, freewheeling team, the way the Oilers were when Muckler coached in Edmonton. It's a good idea, but hard to accomplish during the season.
In the Patrick, Scotty Bowman's Penguins are starting to play like defending Stanley Cup champions, despite two consecutive losses to the Devils. They lead the league in goals with 186. On the other hand, only four teams have given up more than their 149. With the death of Coach Bob Johnson and the sale of the franchise in recent weeks, they have been the league's most newsworthy team off ice and the most fun to watch on it, especially on the power play.
Another team in this category for the coming quarter might be the Devils, an equal-opportunity employer who must be putting "help wanted" ads in Russian newspapers. They just signed their fourth former member of the Soviet national team. (Will Viktor Tikhonov take over for Tom McVie?)
Things aren't as lively in the Smythe, where the sluggish, fourth-place Los Angeles Kings typify a divisionwide recession. The Winnipeg Jets hold second place with a .500 record and the Edmonton Oilers, a point behind Los Angeles, have a way of sneaking up from back in the pack and peaking for the playoffs.
Calgary began a housecleaning by sending Doug Gilmour to Toronto in Thursday's 10-man deal. But the most interesting team in this bunch has been the expansion San Jose Sharks, and only for their novelty value.
Keeping them company at the bottom of the league are the Islanders, the Maple Leafs and Quebec. What do the Leafs and the Islanders have in common? Both have general managers who developed sparkling reputations in the 1980's. Now, it's 1992 for Cliff Fletcher and Bill Torrey. Is it later than they think?
After signing Grant Fuhr to a long-term contract, Fletcher now hears his goalie rip the efforts of his teammates. After trading two of his longtime stars, Torrey sees his roster filled with new faces and his record worse than it was last season at this time. New ownership might not be the only change in the pipeline at Nassau Coliseum.
And shouldn't something change at the Colisee in Quebec, where the Nordiques' owner, Marcel Aubut, holding the rights to the reluctant Lindros, acts like the dog in the manger?
If the Nordiques still have a chance to make the playoffs when Lindros gets back from the Olympics, a major deal (attention, Neil Smith) could rearrange the league map for the fourth quarter and make at least two teams much better.

HEADLINE: Seaman Furniture Files Chapter 11

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The Seaman Furniture Company, a Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts leveraged buyout and the largest furniture retailer in the Northeast, filed yesterday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company cited a "severe and prolonged recession" in its markets.
The company, based in Uniondale, L.I., said that it would close 15 of its 37 stores and that more than 300 of its 1,300 employees would lose their jobs. 
 Yesterday's filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan results from two trends: an economic downturn that has been particularly hard on retailers, especially in the Northeast, and the continued unwinding of the leveraged buyout spree of the last decade.
In its filing, the company said it had liabilities of $363.7 million and assets of $141.3 million as of Oct. 31. The Christmas season was unlikely to have improved the situation, since it is generally a slow time for furniture retailers, with few shoppers making such major purchases during the holiday season.
Seaman is the second Kohlberg, Kravis buyout to file for bankruptcy protection. While Seaman is a relatively small holding in the firm's portfolio, the filing tarnishes Kohlberg, Kravis's reputation for finding profits in the financial transformation of mundane companies. In early 1990, the Hillsborough Holdings Corporation, a company formed to acquire Jim Walter, a large building-materials company in Tampa, Fla., also filed for bankruptcy protection.
Seaman has aimed to sell high volumes of low-priced furniture through the help of its aggressive television advertisements. But it has had a history of problems since it was taken private in 1988 in a $360 million deal.
In late 1989, Seaman said it could not meet its principal and interest payments. Its senior lenders and bondholders agreed to accept large losses in return for a larger equity position in the company.
At that time, Kohlberg, Kravis's ownership fell from 80 percent to 37 percent, and the firm's investors had to put in an additional $28 million. The company's banks, led by the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, acquired nearly one-third of the company in return for forgiving more than $100 million in debt and agreeing to defer principal payments until 1992.
Despite this, the company has been unable to turn a profit while servicing a remaining debt burden of about $310 million. In the first quarter, which ended July 31, 1991, Seaman's reported a net loss of $6.4 million, compared with a net loss of $1.2 million in all of 1990.
"We want to restructure the company, under the supervision of the court, to a debt level that the business can support," said Matthew D. Serra, Seaman's chief executive. "The reason for the filing is the prolonged downturn in sales. It's been much longer than we've expected.
Seaman executives calculated yesterday that a more manageable debt burden for the company might be in the neighborhood of $20 million.
 
Expression of Optimism
 Mr. Serra remained optimistic about Seaman's prospects. He said that the 22 stores to remain open contributed about 80 percent of the company's volume. He added that four of the stores to be shut had already been scheduled to close. With the cutbacks, the company will withdraw entirely from the Philadelphia area.
Scott M. Sperling, a partner at the Harvard Management Company, which has invested with Kohlberg, Kravis since 1982, said the bankruptcy filing "isn't good news from the perspective of the value of the Seaman's equity." But he said the filing was a "rational and prudent reaction" to the difficult retailing environment and the company's debt burden.
"Seaman's obviously had problems because of the amount of debt it took on, and therefore it has been more vulnerable than other retailers might be," Mr. Sperling said.
To support its operations during reorganization, Seaman has obtained a $25 million commitment from the GE Capital Corporation, the financing arm of the General Electric Company. Such loans to a company already in bankruptcy reorganization usually receive priority in repayment. Seaman will use the money to pay suppliers and vendors. "It will help us run the business in terms of working capital and meeting all our financial needs," Mr. Serra said.
Seaman's largest unsecured creditors include Credit Agricole of France, with $21.9 million; National Westminster Bank of Britain, $18.76 million; First Bank National Association of Minneapolis, $17.5 million; Nippon Credit Bank of Japan, $12.9 million; National Australia Bank Ltd., $7.75 million; town of Islip (L.I.) Industrial Development Agency, $5.5 million, and the Saudi International Bank, $5.169 million.

HEADLINE: Letter: On Research;
Utilizing Former Soviet Scientists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Forget Dr. No" (editorial, Dec. 22) correctly calls attention to the major problem of the future of the scientists of the former Soviet Union. But to suggest that Western governments and foundations support scientific work inside the former Soviet Union is dead wrong! 
 First of all, it will not work. "A Soviet (Russian) Academy Is Adrift" (news article, Dec. 14) cited the extensive emigration of hundreds of the best scientists. Giving funds to the laboratories of the defunct Soviet Academy of Sciences may well result in support of mediocre or politically favored work. To assure proper use of Western funds, an army of Western scientists would be needed. Talented scientists in Eastern Europe, India, China, Pakistan (to name a few regions) are also underemployed and are potential candidates to be attracted to "rogue" projects in bandit nations like Iraq.
The United States would do far better to reverse the downslide of support for employment of trained scientists in this country: (1) by a major increase of funding for basic and applied research in American universities; (2) by increasing the opportunities for permanent and visiting positions in major national laboratories such as Brookhaven, Argonne, Los Alamos; (3) by giving governmental tax write-offs for private industrial research laboratories.
All these mechanisms were used after World War II with great success, resulting in uncountable patents, in creation of new industries such as electronics, and in other major achievements.
Yes, save Soviet scientists! Have them come here and join American scientists to solve the nation's and the world's pressing technical problems -- such as the need for renewable energy sources, for the immunization and cure of AIDS, for weather prediction, for preservation of the global environment. But don't throw good money into a decaying and chaotic bureaucracy that has outlived its usefulness!

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Get Little Corporate Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to your Dec. 23 report that environmentalists are seeking corporate gifts, the Wilderness Society is not about to lay off any employees. There were some layoffs in 1991, but in the last month we have added two ecologists and two resource economists. Our financial picture is improving, not worsening. 
 Indeed, our situation does not support your thesis. The funds we receive from businesses, primarily from the Timberland Company, amount to just 1 percent of our budget. That hardly makes us vulnerable should Timberland decide to pull out.
Moreover, Timberland is much less likely to do so than a company like General Electric, which is ending its backing of the National Audubon Society. Timberland's executives are committed advocates for the protection of natural environments.
At the Wilderness Society, we will not take funds from companies whose interests are at odds with our guiding philosophy of public lands protection. Otherwise, we welcome help from the business world, though we suspect that the vast majority of our support will continue to come, as it has for the last 55 years, from our members.
Finally, there is no basis for saying the 10 largest environmental groups have become "political action enterprises." Yes, environmental groups advocate certain legislation, but most of us are limited by tax law to devoting only a small percentage of our budgets to such activity, and we stay below that ceiling. Most important, we do not engage in election campaigns.

HEADLINE: Cold War Static On Fiber Optics

BYLINE: By Antony J. Blinken; Antony J. Blinken is the author of "Ally Versus Ally: America, Europe and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis."

 BODY:
In a hangover of the cold war, the Bush Administration is continuing an embargo on the sale of sophisticated telecommunications technology to the former Soviet Union. This misguided policy prevents American companies from helping the Russians when they really need it and making a buck at the same time.
Washington's error became embarrassingly clear -- and costly -- when a German company, using a loophole in the trade restriction, recently sold high-speed fiber-optic cable to Moscow at the expense of an American manufacturer, U S West. Unless the Administration rescinds the embargo, it risks putting the U.S. telecommunications industry at a competitive disadvantage in its effort to capture a huge market. 
 The ban on the export of high-speed fiber-optic cable is administered by something called the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, whose members are the NATO countries minus Iceland, plus Australia and Japan.
When the East bloc collapsed, Western European nations and U.S. manufacturers successfully pressed Washington to eliminate many of the committee's restrictions. But despite intensive lobbying, Bush Administration officials refused to lift controls on high-speed fiber-optic cable, the bulwark of a modern telecommunications system.
The National Security Agency, the leading opponent of telecommunications exports to the former Soviet Union, believes that uncertainty and instability in the republics justifies this decision. If one or more of the independent republics turns hostile to Western interests, the agency reasons, the wiretap-proof fiber optics would make them more potent adversaries. As evidence, officials cite our inability to eavesdrop on Mr. Hussein's fiber-optic command and control system in the gulf war.
But the National Security Agency isn't all-powerful, and the U.S. can't prevent countries that don't belong to the export committee from selling their own fiber-optic technology to Moscow or Kiev or wherever. The German sale just before Christmas makes the point. Carl Zeiss Jena, the company in the deal, is based in what used to be East Germany, and is not bound by Western rules, which exempt Eastern European companies that did business with the Soviet Union in the past.
In any case, a fiber-optic network in the new commonwealth may be in our security interest. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a central nuclear command with modern communications could better prevent the misuse of nuclear weapons by the new states. It also makes sense for a U.S. company to build the Soviet network since that company would know where the cables are buried and how they are used.
Russian technology is on the brink of developing its own fiber-optic cable. "The bottom line is that technology moves forward," said Ed Mattix, a spokesman for U S West, whose plans to manufacture a $500 million trans-Soviet line with French, British, German and Korean partners were put on ice by the export committee. U S West is continuing to negotiate with the Russians, hoping that the export committee will reverse its policy.
Beyond dollars and common sense, a larger point is at issue. To build a stable democracy in an atmosphere of economic crisis, modernizing an archaic infrastructure, including a hopelessly outmoded telecommunications system, is one of the first tasks at hand. By doing what we can to promote a functioning economy in the new commonwealth, we help prevent a return to authoritarianism.
Economic embargoes that assume a possible revival of a threat in the former empire are ineffective at best, and costly to American business. At worst, they perpetuate the economic chaos on which authoritarian leaders feed. By selling fiber optics in and among the republics, it's a good bet that we can help them and, in so doing, help ourselves.

HEADLINE: A Growing Leadership Role for Women

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
WHEN Dorcas T. Helfant took her first job selling homes in a small real estate office in Portsmouth, Va., in the mid-60's, she was the only person on the sales team who wore a skirt.
"I was surrounded by men in my first sales job," said Mrs. Helfant, speaking from the vantage point of nearly 25 years in the residential brokerage business. 
 Today she has plenty of female company. Nearly half of those working in residential sales are women. In the last decade, the ranks of women in brokering, ownership and management positions have swelled.
Now her election as the first woman to head the 83-year-old National Association of Realtors, an 800,000-member organization, is coming as a symbol of the rise of women to leadership positions as the heads of real-estate businesses. Mrs. Helfant owns a brokerage business in Virginia Beach, Va. She took office as president of the realtors' association in November.
"Women have been doing well in residential sales for a long time," said Mrs. Helfant. "But one of the changes I have seen is that we do not view sales as just a way to make money; many more women have an entrepreneurial attitude about the business."
It took changes in attitudes about women in business, as well as the statutory clout of civil rights legislation, for women to start moving into ownership and management in significant numbers. Women leveled the playing field in sales by proving they were as capable as their male colleagues at handling the technical, financial and legal aspects of real estate transactions.
Despite the gains, the market's tumble of the last few years has left many companies, including those owned by women, treading water. Some offices have survived by cutting the sizes of their sales and management staffs, others by diversifying the services they offer. More sales outfits in New York City and its suburbs are depending on fees from rental transactions or management services to bolster sagging sales commissions.
In real estate sales the first rung of the ladder is that of sales agent. Licenses are required for anyone working as a sales agent, which is the stepping stone to brokering.
Brokers are professionals who have taken additional course work and passed more stringent state licensing requirements. A broker's license is required of anyone who handles a real estate transaction or owns a real estate sales business. But but not all of the people who hold brokers' licenses use them to maintain businesses. The N.A.R. says that while in the past the term broker was synonymous with owner, today about half of its members holding brokers' licenses hold ownership interests in businesses.
Surveys by the N.A.R. of its members show women making numerical as well as proportionate gains in sales and brokering. In 1975, fewer than 4 out of 10 full-time sales agents were women. By 1987, the date of the most recent survey, two-thirds of the people working full-time as sales agents were women.
BETWEEN 1975 and 1987, the proportion of member women working as brokers rose from 18 percent to more than 36 percent of the N.A.R.'s membership.
In 1975, women brokers earned 60 percent of what men did -- $15,000, compared to $25,000. By 1987, women were earning 75 percent of what men did. The average was $30,000 for women to $40,000 for men.
Although the N.A.R. has no similar comparative statistics that would show an increase in the percentage of women who own or are partners in real estate sales businesses, there is little doubt that the numbers have expanded. In a 1990 survey made by the Women's Council of N.A.R., 28 percent of the members said they have ownership interests in brokerage businesses.
But these gains in the home-sales field are not reflected in all the many aspects of real estate. On the commercial side, including the development, leasing, selling and managing of office and other investment properties, women are a still a distinct minority. Nor have they become prominent in residential construction.
"When I started in 1978 there were no women to have lunch with," said Jamie Covello, a rental space broker and director with Cushman & Wakefield, the largest brokerage company in Manhattan. "There are now other women in all aspects of commercial even though we are still few in number."
Ms. Covello said the door to commercial brokering opened for women during the surge in office development in Manhattan in the early 1980's.
Once inside, many did very well.
"The demands of the economy made the business much more intellectual, less macho," she said. "That was an advantage to us."
Cushman & Wakefield refused to say how many women in the company work as brokers or property managers.
Some of the women who came in during the office market boom, Ms. Covello said, were the first casualties of its downward slide.
"Some women left when the demand for space dried up," she said.
The shrinking market in both residential sales and commercial leasing and development have cut the numbers of people in every segment of the industry. In New York state, for example, more than 37,000 sales agents and brokers appear to have have dropped out of the business in the last two years. The number of sales agent licenses held by the New York Department of State, the licensing authority, fell from 117,096 to 83,971 between 1989 and 1991.
Brokers left the business, too. In November 1989, the Department of State reported 45,104 licensed brokers. By 1991, there were 41,042.
EVEN though most brokerage offices do not pay salaries -- sales-agent income overwhelmingly is commission-only -- for the owners of the business the expenses can be considerable. Operating costs such as rent, supplies and equipment as well as fees for multiple listing service membership and support-staff wages must be met no matter what the commission income is in a given month.
While some have thrown in the towel, others have survived if not thrived.
Manhattan has seen a half dozen real estate office merge or go under. Many of those remaining include some headed by women among them Donna Olshan, Adrienne Albert, Susan W. Bird and Barbara Corcoran.
Audrey Short, owner of Audrey Short Companies, a Realty World franchise, in Princeton, N.J., said her 1991 business was 15 percent ahead of 1990's. The Short office had 119 transactions in 1990 and 144 in 1991.
"People are still buying and selling," said Mrs. Short, "but today they are doing it not because they want to, but because they have to."
The growth of Mrs. Short's business to the point where she now runs a sales force of 20 agents illustrates the career paths that women have taken in recent years. She hung out her shingle on Nassau Street, Princeton's picturesque commercial strip, in 1971. Back then Princeton University and Johnson & Johnson in nearby New Brunswick were the area's largest employers.
But beginning in the late 1970's, Princeton planted the seeds for growth by offering up to1,600 acres of university-owned land to lease for private development. Other property owners followed Princeton's lead and corporate office parks, shopping centers and hotels sprouted along Route 1 there.
The economic boom blew up a fair wind for Audrey Short's sails.
"This area became hot," said Mrs. Short. "Companies like I.B.M., Exxon and Prudential started moving in."
And with them came home-buying employees. By 1984, Mrs. Short said, her sales force was selling homes from Raritan Bay to the Delaware River. She opened an office in East Brunswick to handle the added business.
Today many of the same companies that expanded in the 1980's are now retrenching. To accommodate the economy's change, Mrs. Short has changed tack; her bread and butter these days comes from relocation transactions.
Working through the corporate relocation departments of companies, brokerage companies handle not only sales but they also take care of the homes waiting to be sold in exchange for the listing. That usually includes paying mortgages, taxes and utility bills as well as arranging for repairs and re-painting as it is needed.
But even companies that have managed to state afloat, say business is harder.
Faye Radin, a broker for more than 20 years, started her own business, Rand Realty, on Staten Island in 1983 when the borough was feeling the ripples of the boom years on Wall Street just across the harbor. But from a high of 12 full-time sales agents and brokers in 1986, the office now has four selling full time and two part-time sales people.
Recently the office relocated to less expensive space, and these days the transactions also include land sales, commercial deals and rentals as well as home sales. Mrs. Radin said that it takes more work to make a sale than it did a few years ago.
"These days it counts to be known in the community," said Mrs. Radin. "Referrals are important. This is when networking and civic involvement pays off."
Despite overall sluggish sales, the industry is still attracting some newcomers. Denise Jacobs, relocated from Wall Street, joined Rand Realty last year. Ms. Jacobs job as a financial manager was eliminated by the company she had worked for more than seven years.
"I have found that my background in finance has helped me," said Ms. Jacobs, who is near to closing her fourth sale since July. "And the cliches about working for yourself are true."
Not all brokers or salespeople see owning a brokerage business as a career zenith. For many there is enough challenge and commission income in sales work alone. The N.A.R. says that one in 10 earn $100,000 a year or more.
If the market downturn has been something of a litmus test for the industry, some professionals, including Mrs. Helfant, feel the repercussions have not been only negatives. The bad times have forced many sales people and the brokers they work for to rely on some of the skills that may have gotten rusty during the boom times.
"SUCCESS is determined less today by the forces of the market and more by the hard work, energy and enthusiasm of the sales person or broker," she said.
"Times are tougher, but it is still possible to do well."
Mrs. Helfant when brokers and sales people bemoan the market, she tells the story of her own shaky start in the business.
"Times are tough," she said. "But I do not know many people who work for nearly a year before making a sale. But I did."
So disheartened, that she nearly quit to take a job at Sears.
But five deals came through in month 12 and the Sears personnel department never saw her again.
One of Mrs. Helfant's goals while president of the N.A.R. is to establish a mechanism for attracting more young people -- especially women -- into the field. The Woman's Council, says the median age of its members is 49 years.
"Women have many choices today," she said. "and real estate still tends to be the second or third career. I would like to see that change."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Saratoga Square;
New Site for Houses

 BODY:
Three years ago, in accepting City Hall's plan to house several hundred homeless people in the area between Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn insisted on a broader solution to the crisis.
"What we were trying to push for was a neighborhood approach," Mr. Golden's executive assistant, Marilyn Gelber, said last week. "Yes, we'd approve a considerable number of homeless units but it was more important that it be part of a balanced plan." 
 Now working its way through city review is the second part of the overall plan for the Saratoga Square urban renewal area, bounded roughly by Atlantic Avenue and Bainbridge Street, Ralph and Rockaway Avenues.
The project, which Ms. Gelber said has already been approved by Community Boards 3 and 16, involves the construction of 376 two-family, owner-occupied homes, sponsored by the New York City Housing Partnership, in a program jointly administered with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. An additional 555 units are to be rehabilitated in some 116 existing buildings.
"It's an interesting area because it really hasn't had any private investment for several decades," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the partnership, "so this will be opening up a new homeownership community."
Using a portion of the city's capital budget that is under his power to allocate, Mr. Golden is earmarking $10,000 a unit for the new construction. That is added to city and Federal subsidies of $25,000 a unit. The goal, Ms. Wylde said, is to bring the purchase price within the range of families with annual incomes as low as $25,000.

HEADLINE: Talking: Small Co-ops;
Shopping Around to Refinance

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IT'S always difficult for a New York City co-op in a brownstone or other structure with less than 20 shareholders to find a lender willing to refinance the underlying mortgage, especially for under $500,000.
Even in the best of times -- which these are not -- most bankers shun such loans. 
 "There's very little money in them," said Bernard G. Walpin, an Upper West Side lawyer who helps co-ops with refinancing difficulties. This is because the documentation needed to process such a loan is as cumbersome for a few thousand dollars as it is for a few million.
Marcie Waterman, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in co-ops, said bankers have also shied away because the risk is spread over relatively few families. They have argued that it increases the danger of default, especially in a softer market where the shareholder with financial problems cannot extricate himself easily and quickly by selling.
What should the small co-op do?
Harry Avradinis, president of NYM Capital Group of Manhattan, mortgage brokers, warned that the single most detrimental move would be to wait until a few months before the refinancng deadline. Options will become more limited and it could jeopardize the resale potential of all the units.
Buyers, he noted, are usually advised by their lawyers to steer clear of any co-op that must seek refinancing within a year for fear that the new terms could make maintenance payments prohibitively expensive.
Waiting in the hope that interest rates will drop even lower could be equally foolhardy, Mr. Avrandinis said. Smaller co-ops have traditionally been charged higher interest and origination charges because the loan is viewed as riskier.
The process should start, say these experts, by comparing options. These might include finding out how much it might cost to stay with the same lender (who may become the lender of last resort), seeking other lenders that might take on the loan to compare rates and terms and even analyzing what it might cost to simply retire all or part of the balance by assessing each shareholder for a proportionate amount -- as a seven-unit brownstone in the East 70's recently did.
The small co-op will need to compile the kind of documentation and financial analysis that may be difficult for a lay board to do without professional help. Thus, experts suggest hiring a mortgage broker to find a lender (usually a small neighborhood bank or private investor), prepare the papers and negotiate on its behalf. The broker should be able to demonstrate that he or she has obtained similar loans within the last year, since the highly specialized small co-op market tends not to be fully understood by all mortgage brokers.
A recommendation from a lawyer or accountant familiar with small co-ops is one way to find such a broker. Referrals can also be made by the Council of New York Cooperatives (497-7400). The fee charged by the broker is customarily 1 percent of the loan amount plus origination charges imposed by the lender. Occasionally a slightly lower flat fee can be negotiated.
Patrick Niland, a mortgage broker and principal with First Funding Group of Rochester, N.Y., said the small co-op must get its financial house in order before approaching anyone. Lenders, he said, tend to scrutinize the financial profile of individual shareholders far more closely than in larger co-ops. Thus the board should make sure everyone's credit rating is relatively clean.
"If there's a problem with one or two shareholders, they need to have an explanation ready," he said, "such as pointing out that the person is going through a divorce. Or somehow show that they are clearing the matter up."
THE board will also need to compile all pertinent papers to show that the co-op is truly creditworthy, he said. This will include a solid record of on-time maintenance collections and payments on the existing underlying mortgage, maintenance payments that have kept pace with increased costs rather than being subsidized by a reserve fund and a full complement of owners rather than one or two units still owned by a sponsor.
Mr. Walpin favors negotiating with the sponsor for an extension of the term if he still owns the underlying loan -- a strong possibility in small co-ops. "If you've been paying promptly, it's a good deal for him," said Mr. Walpin. "Sometimes you can even get him to make a concession or two on the rates."
If the loan needed is only around $100,000 it might be less costly to look for an alternative solution, since hardly a bank in the city will even consider such a low sum. Moreover, those that do charge origination costs that may be excessive in relation to the loan amount. National Bank of New York -- one bank making underlying loans of this size -- charges about $6,500, not including mortgage recording taxes of 2 percent, which may or may not be due depending on how the mortgage is being structured.
Thus, several co-ops are deciding instead to divide the amount among each shareholder, turning it into a special assessment. Steven Allen, a board member at 413 East 85th Street, a nine-unit brownstone, said his co-op is considering such a move. He argued that it would allow maintenance costs to drop and values to rise, thus not really costing shareholders too much more.
Stuart Bruck, a mortgage broker with Time Equities, the real estate concern, added that if one or two shareholders couldn't afford such a charge -- or qualify for an individual loan for the amount -- the total could be redivided among the remaining shareholders with the missing shareholders paying higher maintenance charges to cover their portion of debt service.
Sheldon Gartenstein, vice president of The National Cooperative Bank, another lender actively writing co-op loans under $500,000, has found that many smaller co-ops have become so fed up with the costs and difficulties associated with regularly refinancing the underlying mortgage they increasingly opt for self-liquidating terms.
As an example he said that a $400,000 loan at 9.5 percent would cost a co-op $4,177 a month to liquidate in 15 years. By contrast the co-op would still be paying $3,167 a month if it decided to pay interest only for the first five years and partially amortize the principal for the remainding ten years. Moreover, there would still be an outstanding balance of $334,700 at the end of the 15-year term. Thus, paying an extra $1,000 a month spread over all shareholders can be a far better deal.

HEADLINE: ART;
A Show That Evokes the Spirit and Principles of Kwanzaa

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
DR. MAULANA KARENGA is chairman of the black studies department on the Long Beach campus of California State University. His fame derives not from this, however, but from his having instituted the celebration of Kwanzaa, in 1966. The word is Swahili and denotes the fruits of the harvest; the holiday, which is not yet in the American calendar, lasts from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1.
By all accounts Kwanzaa is celebrated by eating, gift-giving, music, events like the recent Holiday Expo '91 at Manhattan Community College and, last but not least, the show here at Aljira. As this demonstrates, Kwanzaa is not another field day for Mammon. It is, rather, an opportunity for people of African descent to focus on principles vital to their survival with self-esteem. There are seven of these: unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibililty (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamaa), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani). 
 As Carl Hazlewood, Aljira's curator, has said, the works in the show don't illustrate the principles so much as evoke them. For outsiders, it is a matter of being primed to look for them, and because the art itself is a distraction, the search is at best sporadic. Though Mr. Hazlewood says this is but a "neighborhood" show, it includes works by established artists and by promising unknowns.
That much abused word, icon, can for once be used accurately to describe an assemblage by Janet Taylor Pickett. One of three, it features a reproduction of a Renaissance Madonna and Child with the faces replaced by photographs of black counterparts, and it is framed by irregular pieces of found wood painted matte black. Most of these assemblages incorporate nails, pushpins, brass-headed tacks and strips cut from tin cans. But in this one, the base metal serves as halo and moon as well as decoration, and it confers a mystical quality inspiring reverence.
The artist performs the same transmutation with three arched washboards -- two with bright metal ribs, one with dull -- cock feathers and hands, two of them photographed in black and white and two cut out of wood and gilded. The whole Byzantine-looking thing is titled "Grandmother's Hands."
Hard by the washboards is Ben Jones's "Shango Series," which seems, at first, no more than a white calligraphic pattern scattered on a black ground with green showing through. Actually, the white shapes, which have African significance, come with barely visible forms -- breasts, a penis -- that are scratched in the black, all of them allusions to the artist's preoccupation with issues like AIDS and socialism.
This painting is preparation for other works that are more than they appear to be. For example, one of Christopher Robinson's pictures is a tribute to Bob Marley, the other a vision of Moses and the Golden Calf. Though they are turbulent statements about color and line, it is easy to disentangle the shapes buried in them -- Marley's outline standing beside a tree, the calf on its back, mouth open.
Still, the piece that requires the most unraveling is the shrine-like installation, a joint effort by Shamba Farrar, and Grace Williams, with Thomas Heath, Pat Phipps, Kalief el Hadji and Taj. Three masked figures sprayed on unstretched canvas preside over objects that include on one side a black doll's head with a collar of feathers mounted on a pedestal wrapped in dime-store mats and, on the other, a cabinet crammed with, among other things, a cross, trinkets and a load of garlic.
On the floor between is a pile of earth and sawdust decorated with salt poured in a line (between this and the garlic, the devil doesn't have a prayer here), together with piles of fruit and ginger root.
Incidentally, the salt lines connect nicely with the white "Kwanzaa" inscribed in the painting of that title by Ujima Kuumba Majied, who took two of the principles for names.
Some color interpreters believe that the choice of yellow denotes a desire for release. "Mickey D's," by Arthur Coppedge, is a solution of chrome yellow in which are suspended the red awning of a McDonald's, a figure in pink at a pay phone, a bus stop and a parking meter. The company doesn't deserve such affectionate tribute; then again, as feeder of billions, , maybe it does.
Dudley Charles, a Guyanan newcomer to the scene, has a technique and color sense so delicate as to defy description. In "Forest Light," he covers the canvas with a low relief of crumpled paper, then glazes it with washes of greens, pinks, lavender and lemon yellow. It is a surface that changes like reflections in water, and though sweet in flavor, it does not cloy.
Gwendolyn Verner's watercolors of still-life harvests, Don Miller's renderings in the same medium of tribal Africa and Richard Gaines's black-and-white painting about men and women complete the group. But this is not the end. In the next-door gallery are 10 paintings by Fausto Sevila, and these, too, are not what seem to be.
In fact, most are erotic images that come on as statements about thick color laid on with abandon and a certain comic flair. One of the best is "Black Bean Soup With Onions in Oil and Vinegar," a vertical stretch of chestnut brown impasto dotted with small black shapes and relieved by occasional touches of emerald green.
Both shows close Jan. 18. Aljira is at 2 Washington Place and is open Wednesday through Sunday from noon to 6 P.M.

In Chappaqua, the Revival of a Chamber Group

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
CHAMBER MUSIC lovers can look forward to next Saturday at the Chappaqua Library Theater, when the renamed and reorganized Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra performs a revival program.
"Friends of chamber music can mark a joyous event on their calendars," said Mary Rohde, publicity chairwoman of the group. "Both players and former subscribers have been eager for this community orchestra to resume its excellent concerts." 
 Robert Brown, a trustee of the ensemble and a cellist in the larger orchestra for 27 years, added: "We're coming back because of an unexpected but very welcome ground swell from the community. We hope that with an orchestra scaled back to chamber music dimensions, a pleasant hall to play in and an excellent young conductor in James Sadewhite, we can make fine music again and still hold our budget in line."
The move returns the ensemble to its roots as a chamber orchestra, which is how it presented its first concert in February 1959, and as a community group. (Almost everyone involved is a local resident.) The concertmaster, Mary Ann Meade, is from Mahopac; Mark Kusnir, principal of the second violins, is a Stony Pointer. The new maestro is an Irvington resident, and so on. Even the guest soloist at the opening concert, the prize-winning young Taiwanese pianist Hui-Mei Lin, now lives in Pleasantville.
As for this first program -- which begins at 8 P.M. -- it hews to the classically tried and true: Handel's "Entrance of the Queen of Sheba" and two works by Mozart -- the "Prague" Symphony and the Piano Concerto in B flat, K. 450. For reservations, call 273-1633 or 238-8138.
A good reason to return to Pleasantville next Sunday at 3 P.M. is that town's Chamber Music Society, which despite the poor economic climate for the arts, is maintaining its free-admissions policy while continuing to present top-notch ensembles.
The society can also congratulate itself on its talent-discovering, having arranged an appearance three years ago for the fledgling Eroica Trio. Since then, the ensemble has sprung to national prominence, making its New York debut in the eminent Chamber Series at the 92d Street Y, touring successfully from coast to coast and -- as winners of the 1991 Naumburg Competition, perhaps the most prestigious chamber music award in the country -- performing next month at Alice Tully Hall.
For its return to the Pleasantville Presbyterian Church, the Eroica Trio have chosen a fascinating program, with trios of Lalo (a rarity to begin with) and Brahms enclosing the first Westchester hearing of "Angel Chant," composed last year by Augusta Read Thomas. For more information, call 769-1827.
Downtown Music at Grace, the innovative series at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains, has developed into one of the county's prime outlets for organ music -- both solo and in various instrumental and vocal combinations. The 1992 cycle gets under way Wednesday at 12:30 P.M. with a recital by Stephen Rapp, organist and choirmaster at Christ's Church in Rye. The all-Bach program includes a revision of a Vivaldi concerto, a Sarabande with Partita, two choral preludes and the G minor Prelude and Fugue. Details: 949-2874.
If jazz is more your beat, head across the Hudson to the Rockland Center for the Arts in West Nyack, where Saturday at 8 P.M. the vibraphone-guitar duo of Dave Samuel and Joe Beck will play original tunes along with such American classics as "Body and Soul" and several pieces from the jazz song book of Quincy Jones. For more information, call 358-0877.
The first major vocal concert of 1992 is coming up next Sunday at 3 P.M. in Ossining High School when the Choral Arts Society gathers to perform "King David." The music director, Timothy Vernon, has proclaimed this "the year of the dramatic choral work." Certainly the designation fits Arthur Honegger's brilliantly evocative setting of the biblical story.
The entrance of the Witch of Endor is probably the most riveting moment in the cantata, but the spoken narratives, some beautifully lyric solos and the rousing choral episodes make this one of the most exciting and accessible choral pieces composed in this century.
The actor Barrett Clark (a lifelong Ossining resident) will be the narrator. Linda Lehr portrays the Witch, and the other vocal soloists are Mary McGarvey, Kathleen Shimetz and Vincent Di Benedetto.
Incidentally, the Choral Arts Society welcomes new singers, so those who would like to participate in the May concert (a joint performance of Daniel Pinkham's "Garden Party" with Mr. Vernon's other county group, the Westchester Boys Choir) should call 723-2336.
January is usually a time when most choral ensembles seek to swell their ranks. Among local groups that have sent out membership calls are:
The Master Singers of Westchester, entering its 21st year with a spring program of Haydn and Bach; rehearsals begin tomorrow at 8 P.M. in Bedford's Fox Lane School; 277-5370.
The Taghkanic Chorale, continuing its 25th anniversary season with a March "Choral Masters" program of Mozart, Faure and Handel; first rehearsal: Tuesday 8 P.M. at the Yorktown Community Center; 621-1240.
The Westchester Choral Society, celebrating its golden anniversary in May with a performance of the Verdi Requiem; auditions are from 7 to 7:45 P.M. on the next three Wednesdays of the month at St. Bartholomew's Church in White Plains; 693-2453.
The Pleasantville Cantata Singers, looking ahead to a May program of Bach, Buxtehude and Faure; auditions are scheduled a week from tomorrow and the following Monday, Jan. 20, at the United Methodist Church of Pleasantville; 769-2314, evenings).
It is a bit of a drive, but the concerts of the Hudson Valley Philharmonic are also beckoning, with Bach (and Mozart) Friday at 8 P.M. at the Bardavon Opera House in Poughkeepsie and Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Ulster Performing Arts Center in Kingston. (For information, call 454-1222.)
The orchestra is, in effect, holding on-the-job auditions for the vacant post of music director, and the guest maestro for these concerts is Neal Gittleman, associate conductor of the Milwaukee Symphony. His program will include Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, Mozart's "Prague" Symphony and Dvorak's Seventh Symphony.

A Hollow Catharsis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It appears to be fashionable these days to expend great quantities of creative energy making bold statements about victimized American citizens. The arts, of course, reflect society in general. A prolonged recession has hurt many of us and has scared the rest. Artistic endeavors like "J. F. K." capitalize on our fears by reinforcing the attitude that we aren't responsible: someone else did it -- we need to get even. Instead of being ennobled by the creative experience, we get a hollow catharsis of anger and defensiveness. It's a cheap substitute. 
 Oliver Stone's descent into polemic reduces his obvious movie making skill to propaganda of the rankest kind. The haze of controversy surrounding "J. F. K." suggests that Mr. Stone may have missed his real story: James Garrison as a good man tempted to evil in a good cause. It's certainly more fascinating than another didactic plunge into conspiracy theory.

The Strange Appeal of a Slowdown

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The pace of investment by those who helped to discover the world's emerging stock markets is slowing down because many of the great bargains, like Latin America, have already been well mined.
According to a survey by Kleiman International Consultants, a majority of institutional investors in these markets said they expect to hold onto their current level of investment in these volatile markets in 1992. Those who plan to increase their share of investment expect it to be at a rate lower than last year. 
 In 1991, investment in emerging markets climbed by an average of 2 percent, to a total of 9.5 percent of all the funds invested in international markets by the firms surveyed. This was down sharply from the jump of 7.5 percent in 1990 and even below the 2.5 percent increase in 1989.
While these investors are slowing down, however, others are still climbing on the bandwagon, according to Antoine W. van Agtmael, president of Emerging Markets Management in Washington, D.C. The new flow of money, he said, is from traditionally conservative sources, like pension funds, that had shunned these markets as too volatile and too risky until it became clear that the opportunity for big returns could not be ignored.
"My expectation was that by this time I would have seen an ebb in the flood," he said. "But there remains a much stronger interest than I had anticipated."
Yet returns for the closed-end mutual funds that specialize in emerging markets have slowed. After a sparkling 51.5 percent total return, including dividends, in 1989, returns fell 10.9 percent in 1990, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Through November of last year, total returns are up 13.5. But the increase would have disappeared without the 73.8 percent surge in returns from Latin American funds.
The sharp investment increase in 1990 was overdone. It came with the sudden growth of funds designed to target these emerging markets, which did so well in 1989. The slowdown last year was, in part, a response to the slump of the economy worldwide, the survey respondents said.
But a longer-term reason is that the rapid rise of these markets is no longer a secret, and more of the money flowing in is from pension-fund investors and other middle-of-the-road managers rather than those who are specialists in emerging-country markets and high-risk investors who led the way into these frontier markets. Now some of the pioneers are out looking for other "undiscovered" markets, like those in Pakistan, India, Nigeria, and even Botswana, said Gary Kleiman, whose consulting firm did the survey.
He said that for the new wave of investors, the quality of regulation and trading procedures of these popular emerging markets, like those in Latin America and Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand, will play a bigger role in determining where to invest. Still, the survey showed that emerging markets had a long way to go in developing regulations and settlement procedures before they will be anywhere close to Western standards.
According to the survey, regulatory enforcement is still a major problem. But the institutions said Mexico and Malaysia were making progress. In terms of the worst enforcement, Indonesia was cited, both in "overt manipulation" and "lack of regulatory oversight."
The survey also showed how quickly money can move from one favorite emerging market to another. This is something investors should remember when considering single-country funds, in which the returns depend on both the individual stocks chosen by the fund and on the overall popularity of the particular fund itself.
In 1991, the share of investment in Latin America jumped to 36 percent, more than double the 16 percent level of the previous year. At the same time, the favorite of the previous year, the Pacific Rim markets, suffered, with its portion of investment plunging from 68 percent to 33 percent last year.
 
A Turnaround in 1991
 Last year was a much better year than 1990 in world stock markets. As a whole, the Financial Times index of world markets rose 16.5 percent, compared with a plunge of 19 percent in 1990.
But, of course, not all industry segments soared. Automobile stocks, for instance, again ended near the bottom of the performance list. In 1991, autombile stocks finshed 28th out of 36 industry categories ranked in the Financial Times index. They were up just 3.88 percent. This was better, but not much better, than 1990, when auto stocks finished last, down 25.85 percent.
Beverage and tobacco stocks managed to stay near the top of the industry list. In 1990, they were No. 1, down just 1.22 percent. Last year, they were No. 3, up 35.23 percent.
One big reversal was made by business services and computer software stocks. This group surged to No. 1, up 51.97 percent in 1991 after ranking 16th, down 13.43 percent, in 1990. Textiles and clothing moved up to fifth place, up 26.15 percent, from the 29th position in 1990, down 19.59 percent.
Media stocks, helped by a Top 10 performance by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, held their ground, finishing 18th in 1991 after a 15th-place finish in 1990.

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
From Campus to Car Czar

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
As president of the College of William and Mary, Paul R. Verkuil is surrounded by history and quiet: his office in a Colonial building on the school's Williamsburg, Va., campus is in what Mr. Verkuil describes as a "cocoon-like 18th-century environment."
Mr. Verkuil is about to get a rough dose of the year 2000. He is moving to the Orlando, Fla., area to become president and chief executive of the American Automobile Association, the 32.5 million-member emergency service cum travel agency cum insurance company cum whatever else might be useful to motorists. He succeeds James B. Creal, who has led the organization for 20 years. 
 Speaking from his office in the association's new corporate headquarters in Heathrow, Fla., where he was hanging pictures last week, Mr. Verkuil (pronounced ver-KYLE) said the shift from academia to one of the largest membership organizations in the country is not the great leap it seems. As a federation of local clubs with strong ties to a central organization, the A.A.A. resembles a university. "It isn't hierarchical," he said. "You have to be able to convince people to do what you want them to do."
Mr. Verkuil, 52, who has done scholarly work in law and economics and transportation regulation issues, plans to put more effort into the A.A.A.'s activities in Washington, the association's home base until 1989. The association lobbied to tilt the balance of funds of the recent $151 billion transportation bill toward highway reconstruction.
The A.A.A. has been criticized for using its muscle to push the interests of motorists at the expense of public transportation, an orientation for which Mr. Verkuil, like Mr. Creal before him, is unapologetic.
"We represent the motorists and the life style that the predominant number of Americans want to maintain," said Mr. Verkuil.
The A.A.A. is about to turn Orlando, a sprawling city that regularly hits the top of the places-on-the-move charts, into a lab for an automobile navigation experiment. The computerized Travtek system, which the A.A.A. is sponsoring with several corporations and government agencies, will supply drivers with traffic data via radio waves, allowing them to avoid congestion, police emergencies and construction bottlenecks.
Until William and Mary's Charter Day celebration in early February, Mr. Verkuil will run both the college and the association.

ECONOMY

 
Mr. Bush's Road Show Hits the Pacific
 
With the economy in a slump, it's a good time to take a trip. So President Bush and his entourage, including highly paid (some say overpaid) business leaders, are touring the Pacific, trying to talk the trade deficit down and American exports up. Last week they reached Australia. That was a good place to start since it is one of handful of nations to run a trade deficit with the United States. But Mr. Bush was greeted by Australian farmers complaining that America subsidizes its food exports. This week the mobile White House makes its most important stop: Japan, which is running the largest trade and current account surpluses ever. Japan is scrambling to make it at least appear it is doing something to reverse that trend, especially in an American election year. Mr. Bush is "the key person standing against protectionism," one official said. Since the United States accounts for almost half of its surpluses, Japan thinks Mr. Bush is a valuable man to keep on board.
 
 
Signs of Recovery . . .
 
Fatter order books are a sign of better times. When the nation's factories crank up to produce goods to fill the orders, they start hiring and spending more. According to the Commerce Department, that chain of events is beginning to unfold, although still without much snap. Factory orders rose by 0.6 percent in November. Those gains are "consistent with the idea of a weak recovery," said Jean Sundrla, an economist at Evans Economics in Washington.

 
. . . Or Maybe Not
 
It's not just the economists who disagree, it's the data. The monthly survey of 300 purchasing managers by the National Association of Purchasing Management showed a decline in orders. The index fell to 46.5 in December from after declining to 50.1 in November. A reading below 50 percent indicates the economy is contracting. Which numbers are most reliable? Last week the Federal Reserve said the index sometimes sends "false signals."

 
Buying Stocks Again
 
One beneficiary of low interest rates has been the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average surged to 3,201.48, its highest level ever, while interest rates hovered at their lowest levels since Edsels roamed the roads. Those low rates have brought individuals back into the stock markets. "Where else can you put your money right now?" said Lewis Sperber, managing partner of Sperber Adams, a retail brokerage in Westport, Conn. "You can renew a C.D. for 2 percent less than what you bought it for, or buy G.M.'s preferred stock, which gives you a yield of 8.8 percent. Which would you rather do?"


Consumers Continue to Fret
 
Though the stock market is rallying, it has done little so far to lift the spirits of the consumer. Consumer confidence, according to the Conference Board, fell to 52.4 in December, from 54.7 in November. The index was a confident 100 in 1985. To arrive at its findings, the board polls 6,000 households. What worries consumers now has been worrying them all year: the fear of losing their jobs. Since consumers account for two-thirds of all economic activity, their mood is a good indicator of future strength or weakness. "Clearly, an appreciable improvement in the consumer's spirits is a prerequisite for economic recovery," said Fabian Linden, the survey director.


An R.& D. Slowdown
 
Since the end of World War II, America's growth has been fueled by the success of its laboratories in turning out everything from microchips to genetically engineered products. But research and development -- whose payoffs are often years in the future -- is being trimmed, according to a study by the Batelle Memorial Institute, a research group in Columbus, Ohio. America will invest just 2.8 percent more in R.& D. in 1992 than it did the year before, far below the average annual increase. Why the slowdown? "Given the situation with the Federal budget and a generally sluggish economy, we've expected a slowdown in R.& D. spending for some time," said Douglas E. Olesen, president of the institute.

 
A Word From Commerce
 
The Government peers ahead with the aid of its index of leading economic indicators. Among other things, it measures hours worked, building permits issued and changes in unfilled manufacturing orders and is supposed to forecast developments six months hence. Bad news. The Commerce Department said the index slipped by 0.3 percent in November, the fourth straight month without an advance. "The economy truly is weak," said Daniel Laufenberg of I.D.S. Financial Services in Minneapolis. No spark, the index indicates, before the second quarter.
 
There is at least one area where the Government is getting more efficient. The Food and Drug Administration said it had shortened the time it takes to approve a new drug to an average of 22 months last year, from 33 months in 1986.
 
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Inflation in Rubles
 
In Russia, they called last week's price rises "price liberalization." The measures, brought into existence by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, allow factories, retailers and regional authorities to set prices on most of the goods they sell. (The price of vodka is still controlled). These reforms, Mr. Yeltsin says, will make prices reflect the cost of production and fill the country's empty shelves with goods. But not everyone agrees the reforms will work. There is still no privatization plan or banking system, they say. And nothing has been decided about how to stabilize the nearly worthless ruble. "This is not 'price liberalization' but simply the decentralization of price setting," said Sergie A. Zverev, an economist in Moscow. "There is no orientation on market forces, there is no Federal Reserve system, no way to gauge the money mass," he said. In other words, the reforms have not been thought through.

 
Japan Offers a Little Help
 
One of America's post-World War II jobs, analysts say, was to be the world's market of last resort. America's huge buying power -- and willingness to run trade deficits -- could be relied upon to pull the world out a slump. But with America mired in slow growth, it can no longer pull with both oars. Last week, So Japan's central bank made a gesture by lowering its discount rate to 4.5 percent from 5 percent. That was supposed to get companies to start buying capital goods, which -- coincidentally -- America produces in abundance. "With the latest reduction there will be a substantial impact on corporate investment," said Susumu Nozaki, an economist at Tokai Bank in Tokyo.


In Singapore, a Gum Ban
 
While the United States struggles to interdict shipments of illicit drugs, Singapore -- which President Bush visited last week -- is interdicting, well, chewing gum. Lawmakers on that tidy island are tired of stepping in the stuff. So last week a law went into effect making it illegal to "import, sell and manufacture chewing gum," said Hock-Seng Chen, a First Secretary of the Singapore Embassy in Washington. Selling gum now carries a fine of up to $2,000 and smuggling, up to $10,000 and a year in prison. What about chewing it? "As far as we know that's still legal," he said.
 
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
In for a Fight at Zales
 
When the Zales Corporation, the big jewelry and retail chain, told its creditors it would miss a $52 million payment and begin restructuring itself, its bondholders rolled up their sleeves for a fight. The restructuring plan, which includes shutting 400 of Zales' 2,000 stores and laying off as many as 2,500 employees, was "silly," said David Glatstein, president of the Dallas investment company Barre & Company, who is leading the creditors' group. Zales has $850 million in debt, mostly in high-interest junkbonds, from a 1986 leverage buyout. Last week, Mr. Glatstein and the creditors filed a suit in Dallas seeking to put Zales into involuntary bankruptcy. "We had warned everybody, if the company didn't make its payments, that we were going to do this," Mr. Glatstein said. A ruling is expected in three weeks.


Honda Sues a Customer
 
Honda has a reputation for quality, but not with everyone, it seems. So in an odd reversal, the American Honda Motor Company said it was suing a customer. Daniel Gregory -- who bought a 1990 Honda CRX -- was unhappy with the car. So Mr. Gregory used Honda's toll-free complaint number. Trouble was, Honda said in an affidavit, Mr. Gregory used it too frequently -- more than 100 times in a single day. No one else could get through.
Sales 'R' Up at Toys 'R' Us
It may have been a dismal Christmas for most of the nation's retailers, but at least one of them is smiling. Toys 'R' Us reported last week that sales for the season were up 16.4 percent, to $2.5 billion. Some of those gains came from price cutting at the chain. But investors did not seem to mind. Toys 'R' Us stock jumped $2 a share on the announcement to 34 3/4 and closed the week at 34 3/8.

 
A Big Contract for Harris
 
For the Harris Corporation, it was a big win. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration selected Harris to produce and install the nation's next-generation air traffic control system. The government contract runs for 14 years and totals $1.7 billion. Harris won this one in the trenches. Last summer, the F.A.A. pitted Harris's hardware against a rival offering from American Telephone and Telegraph Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of A.T.& T. The Harris system links air traffic controllers to pilots and to each other. And it is supposed to be reliable. The specs allow it to be down just 4 seconds a year.


Tough Terms for MGM's Owner
 
In an industry where deal-making is considered an art, Giancarlo Parretti's purchase of MGM-UA was hardly a masterpiece. Mr. Parretti, the Italian financier whose Pathe Communications Company paid $1.4 billion to acquire MGM, was accused of having mob connections, of being anti-Semitic and of not paying his Italian taxes. (He was arrested in Italy last week for tax evasion.) But Mr. Parretti's real problem may have been that he simply did not have enough money to buy the studio and run it. So Mr. Paretti made another deal with Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank. The bank agreed to lend the studio money, but only if Mr. Parretti agreed to stay away from the lot. Not the best of terms for a mogul. In June, the bank said Mr. Parretti was meddling in the studio's affairs. It filed charges in a Delaware court. Last week the court said Mr. Parretti had reneged on the agreement. Though Mr. Parretti still owns most of MGM's stock, he has been forced to cede all control to the bank.

Last week the Seaman Furniture Company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankrupcy law.

Who Would Move Money Where

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
When investors believe the economy will worsen, they are more likely to seek professional investment advice. But affluent and ordinary investors look for guidance in different places, according to Russ Alan Prince and Richard K. Weingarten in a report called "Marketing Mutual Funds," to be published in February by Renaissance Inc. of Carmel, Ind.
In one survey, 298 investors with at least $1 million in liquid assets said they would tend to abandon mutual funds in favor of private money managers when times are bad, returning to funds as the outlook brightens. But for another 3,442 investors surveyed at random, the opposite is true: a worsening economy would generally cause a movement into funds. Because very affluent individuals make up only a small part of the investing public, continuing economic weakness may actually be good news for the fund industry, Mr. Weingarten said.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Strategies for a New Ball Game

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
After a banner year, when the average stock fund rose 30.7 percent, mutual fund investors may wonder where to go from here.
The outlook is not so bright for 1992. Most experts predict a less-than-robust economic recovery that slows investment returns to just 10 percent or so. 
 Three fund investment advisers, asked to craft model portfolios for 1992, all included a mix of small-company and growth stock funds; two added a smattering of bond funds.
Here is what the advisers have to say.
Kenneth E. Gregory, principal in the San Francisco-based money management firm Litman/Gregory, believes that small-capitalization stocks, the biggest winners in 1991, will keep their lead this year. Small companies usually perform better than big concerns during economic recoveries, as they have the potential of growing faster. Not incidentally, they are beginning to regain favor with institutional investors. Strong earnings growth is worth a big premium in a stagnating economy, and today's premium is low by historic standards, he says.
He would put 70 percent of his portfolio into stocks, split between United States and international stock funds. Most of the domestic holdings would be in two small-company funds: Brandywine, an aggressive play, and Monetta, a more conservative fund that holds small and medium-size companies.
The rest of the United States stock-fund component is split between IAI Stock, a conservative growth fund with larger capitalization stocks, and Gabelli Asset, a growth fund.
On the international side, Mr. Gregory likes Harbor International, which invests overseas but downplays Japanese and German issues. And because interest rates are still falling, rewarding bondholders with capital gains, he would put 30 percent of the portfolio into the Pimit Total Return fund.
Mr. Gregory believes the market may drop in the first half of the year; after the decline, he would shift the allocation, moving half of the money in Pimit into stock funds, so that the portfolio would then have an 85 percent stake in stocks and 15 percent in bonds.
The Pimit fund is also a favorite of Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo. Mr. Ogorek says that while short-term interest rates have fallen dramatically, long-term rates have not hit bottom yet. He would put 20 percent of his portfolio into Pimit, which holds a mix of corporate and government bonds and is yielding about 7.7 percent, because "it's a diversified, conservative fund that doesn't bet the farm on one interest rate projection," he said.
A far riskier choice for investors who want to play falling long-term interest rates this year is Benham Target 2000, which holds zero-coupon bonds.
Historically, when small stocks outperform the overall market, their run has lasted eight to 14 years, Mr. Ogorek says. So he expects last year's small-cap revival to stay in place for several years, though he cautions investors not to expect the same outstanding returns that they got in 1991, when the small-stock group returned an average of 51.6 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
He would allocate 20 percent of his portfolio to a small-stock fund, namely Twentieth Century Ultra, a top-performing but volatile fund that has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average by an average of 8 percentage points annually for the past five years. For investors looking for a more cautious small-company play, he likes Sit New Beginning Growth.
He would split the balance of his investment in United States stocks between Selected American Shares, a growth-and-income fund, (30 percent) and Financial Strategic Health Sciences, which invests in health maintenance organizations, discount mail-order pharmacies and similar cost-cutting health-care plays (10 percent).
The final 20 percent would be invested in Harbor International, the foreign stock fund.
Kurt Brouwer, partner in Brouwer & Janachowski, an investment advisory firm in San Francisco, would put 32 percent of a conservative growth portfolio into small-company stock funds. Among his picks are Pennsylvania Mutual, a "value" fund whose managers look for stocks that are cheap relative to the company's probable worth. (Growth managers, who look for earnings that are expected to outpace the average, were among the big winners in 1991.) Another pick: GIT Equity Special Growth Portfolio, which invests mainly in very small companies with market capitalizations of $150 million or so.
Another 48 percent of the portfolio would go to large-capitalization stock funds, divided between the Janus Fund, a conservative fund with a growth orientation, and Gabelli Asset Fund, which takes a value approach to investing.
He also likes Warburg Pincus Counsellors Capital Appreciation, a growth fund that invests in a mix of small- and large-cap stocks.
The remainder of the portfolio would go to the international play, and he would invest in, yes, Harbor International, a value-oriented stock fund.

HEADLINE: Recovery Is All in the Job

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"More Layoffs? Hold the Applause" (Forum, Dec. 1) hit the nail right on the head. It is about time that a prominent economist stated the real reason for our current recession. 
 What frightens me is how little the politicians seem to relate to us average Americans. Don't they realize we will use our credit cards regardless of how high the interest charged, as long as we have jobs generating an income with which to pay the bills? We also will continue to spend no matter how high taxes are, as long as we are not fearing layoffs. But take away our jobs, or job security, and we will stick to buying the bare necessities for fear of living next year in a cardboard box.
If more of our powerful people could get this fact through to Washington and corporate America, we could probably look forward to a real recovery.

HEADLINE: Usual Suspects;
Blaming Japan Has Its Risks; So Does Bush's Visit to Tokyo

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
EVEN by the rigorous standards of an American election year, Tokyo is a long way to go to try to win votes back home. But in his three-day visit this week to Japan, President Bush will be doing precisely that, prodding the Japanese to open their markets and buy more American goods to help, he says, "create jobs and restore prosperity" in the United States.
Mr. Bush and his advisers recognize that with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the international threat that most worries voters is no longer nuclear warfare but something far more subtle -- an erosion of living standards as American industries lag in the global competition with foreign rivals, especially Japan. And those concerns have been magnified by recent announcements from pillars of corporate America, like General Motors and I.B.M., that they are cutting thousands of workers and permanently shrinking. 
 Yet in linking this national sense of economic insecurity to trade conflicts with Japan, Mr. Bush is on slippery ground, ideologically, politically and economically. For more than a decade, the United States-Japan trade issue has seemed intractable, always with us, never resolved. American policy toward Japan on trade has been divided and confused. On both sides, the debate has been colored by half-truths, hypocrisy and cultural chauvinism.
It's hard to make a credible argument that Japan is to blame for the American economic slump, despite the comments last week by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who said that the recession was "made in Japan," and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who remarked that Japan was partly responsible for deepening the slump. In fact, United States exports to Japan have increased and the trade deficit has declined in recent years, from a peak of $56 billion in 1987 to an estimated $41 billion. In a $5.5 trillion economy, such an imbalance does not loom so large.
Still, America does have genuine trade grievances with Japan. A joint study by the Commerce Department and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry found that because it is so difficult to reach Japanese consumers, American products are typically 40 percent more expensive in Japan than in the United States. Japan is also far more closed to foreign direct investment -- acquiring companies, building factories or buying real estate -- than are most developed nations. The United States is host to 29 percent of the world total of this "inward investment," while the 12-nation European Community attracts 35 percent, according to the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration. Japan, by contrast, receives less than 1 percent of foreign direct investment.
 
Internal Barriers
 From machine tools in the 1960's to supercomputers in the 1980's, Japan has tended to open up to foreign imports only after a Japanese alternative has been developed. Barriers at the border -- quotas and high tariffs -- are rare these days, but internal barriers involving inspections, product standards and a labyrinthine distribution system can still be formidable. And the outsiders' sense that they are discriminated against is sometimes fanned by loose comments from Japanese breaking ranks with the official party line that Japan is a free-trade paradise. A former head of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone once said that the only things he could imagine buying from foreigners were mops and telephone poles.
In government and academia, the debate over American trade policy toward Japan has been divided for more than a decade by two perspectives -- the macroeconomic versus the anecdotal. From the Olympian redoubt of macroeconomics, the trade deficit with Japan seems negligible. But for the trench warriors of business trying to crack the Japanese market the anecdotal evidence can be compelling.
The subject of fairness in trade matters, not the esoterica of trade deficits or economic theory, is an issue with political resonance. The theme of economic nationalism -- embracing education, training, technology development and getting tough on trade issues -- appeals to many voters, especially independents and Democrats who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988, said Ruy Teixeira, a sociologist at the Brookings Institution. "Trade is the most visible item in that cluster of issues," he said. "But people are not going to go out and vote tomorrow based on trade. If it's going to become an election issue, people are going to have to be primed for it."
But whether Mr. Bush will be able to score any political gains from his Japan trip is uncertain. He goes to Tokyo trailed by a retinue of American executives, a group heavily weighted with representatives from Detroit, like Robert C. Stempel of General Motors and Lee Iacocca of Chrysler. The Administration is pressing Japanese car companies to use more American parts, especially in their factories in the United States, and for the Japanese to buy more American cars.
This strikes many analysts as leading with the Presidential chin. Americans may believe that trade with Japan is unfair in some ways but, according to consumer surveys, they also believe that Japan makes better cars. Moreover, Detroit has never really made an effort to sell cars in Japan and American automakers increasingly use Japanese and other foreign parts. "For the Administration or Detroit to portray this as a nationalist issue is just shameless," said William Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, a research group in Washington.
The success stories in United States-Japan trade tend to result not from dramatic gestures but steady prodding and working with the grain of change. Selling American cigarettes and beef are recent examples, as well as finally getting Toys "R" Us stores into Japan.
The inefficient Japanese retail and distribution system, which Toys "R" Us is sidestepping with its huge stores, developed as a way of privatizing unemployment as Japan changed from an agrarian to an urban society. People coming off the farms became shopkeepers and wholesalers, protected by regulations limiting big stores. Consumers paid more for their goods, but unemployment was rare. The system has long outlived its social purpose. Japan has a labor shortage, and powerful interests in Japan, not just the Americans, think things should be changed.
"What works is when you have the facts on your side and you help the Japanese get out of a bind," said Michael B. Smith, a former United States deputy trade representative.
And the lessons can flow both ways. Coming during a recession, says Chalmers Johnson, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, President Bush's trip to Japan may highlight the more active role that the Japanese Government plays in its economy, nurturing new industries and spreading the social pain of hard times. Politically, the danger for Mr. Bush is that Americans may reasonably conclude that, if anywhere, the nation's recession was made in Washington, not Tokyo.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Salvadorans Make Peace in a 'Negotiated Revolution'

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
AT the height of President Ronald Reagan's crusade against Communist subversion in Central America, he and his aides liked to say that the United States would never let the guerrillas in El Salvador "shoot their way into power." And in the end that the guerrillas have helped draw to their tiny country's 12-year-old civil war, they have not proved Mr. Reagan wrong.
But while the settlement they announced with the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani in the first minutes of the new year did not give them actual power, leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front have won at least paper rights to participate in the political process of their country's transformation. Never, in the memories of diplomats who oversaw the last 25 rounds of negotiations between the two sides, has a such a conflict ended with agreement to such sweeping reform in advance of new elections. "This is the closest that any process has ever come to a negotiated revolution,"said the United Nations' principal mediator, Alvaro de Soto. 
 The essential difference between the final peace treaty to be signed in Mexico City on Jan. 16 and the trenchant public vows that El Salvador's revolutionary groups took as they launched their unified war in 1980 is that the rebels have given up their claim to even a share of power. Perhaps they did not end "the power of the great lords of land and capital" as they swore they would, and Salvadoran dependence on "Yankee imperialism" may not have been "liquidated." But the institutional changes for which the guerrillas are to trade in their stolen assault rifles and surface-to-air missiles should prove far more valuable than any quota of soldiers to the democratic society that the rebels say they now want to help build.
Under the accords, the Salvadoran armed forces that the United States spent $1.09 billion to turn from a bloody praetorian guard into a powerful and less abusive counterinsurgency force will be cut almost in half and a reviewing panel approved by the rebels is to purge officers found to be excessively brutal or corrupt. Paramilitary and civil defense forces and the military's intelligence directorate are all to be disbanded. And in the neat, concrete-block military academy that has produced some of the most virulent anti-Communists in Latin America, doctrine will be rewritten. No longer will the armed forces' mission include the prosecution of an enemy within.
If such changes are sure to raise objections among commanders who have come to think of themselves as a front line in the defense of national values, the creation of a new civilian police force will not be much less complicated. Though former guerrillas and former National Police agents will be allowed to join the new force in equal numbers, most of the new recruits are to be Salvadorans less cultured in the violence.
It is a measure of the changes that have already taken place in El Salvador that accords on economic and political issues at the heart of the war are somewhat less sensitive. Some farmland that the Government has agreed to try to secure for peasants in rebel-held zones has already been written off by its owners. Powerful families whose fortunes were harvested from coffee lands by miserably paid workers have shifted to nontraditional exports. The idea of an economic policy forum of labor, business and government representatives is less startling after one hears a Marxist guerrilla commander argue for the privatization of El Salvador's banks. And political freedoms for the rebels have become less unthinkable as moderate leftists like Ruben Zamora have returned from exile.
Until their negotiations finally ended two minutes before a midnight deadline, rebel and government delegates seemed to make the point with their tenacity that a mere end of the cold war would not force them into unwanted concessions. But negotiators on both sides acknowledged that changes beyond El Salvador had enormous impact on the process. Two years before the Berlin wall came down, Nicaragua's Sandinista Government began pulling away from the Salvadoran rebels. The Iran-contra affair and President Bush's shift to less ideological policies in Central America undercut those who still argued that a military solution was possible.
But in a crowded nation where the hatreds are as personal as they are intense, some of the most important transformations have been individual. After launching a national offensive in November 1989 in which some 2,000 people died, rebel leaders acknowledged that Salvadorans were not about to rise up to help them seize power. Their turn toward a more political struggle increased the importance of rebel moderates like Salvador Samayoa, a member in the junta installed after the October 1979 military coup that set off the war. And whatever the depth of his conviction, Joaquin Villalobos, the most militaristic of the rebel commanders, now talks of pragmatism and social democracy as guiding ideals.
With the offensive, military leaders came to accept more openly that the guerrillas could not be defeated on the battlefield. During the peace process, Col. Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, a government negotiator, helped to keep his side at the table even as some comrades in arms called him a traitor. With army opposition to the talks apparently rising, the conservative defense minister, Gen. Rene Emilio Ponce, flew to New York with Mr. Cristiani and told the rebels that he supported the peace.
 
Behind the Peace
 Yet perhaps more than anyone else in El Salvador, it was Mr. Cristiani who made the peace happen. Four years after he was named to lead the Nationalist Republican Alliance by its ultrarightist founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson, Mr. Cristiani began as President to move the party toward the center. Twice, Mr. Cristiani seemed to resist joining the negotiations in New York as criticism of the talks grew more strident in San Salvador. And even after he approved the final aspects of the New Year's accords, he skipped the signing ceremony. But he embraced the treaty's reforms as his own. He accepted guerrilla demands, Mr. Cristiani explained, when he felt they "had justification and reason and the goal of the accord was to strengthen and consolidate our democracy."
Mr. Cristiani said he believed that "the immense majority of Salvadorans" would understand this. And on both sides, officials argued that with help from abroad commensurate to the destruction that was sponsored in El Salvador, a spirit of reconciliation could be fostered. But none of them brushed off the threat of extremist violence, particularly from the right. The fear is that the mistrust that permeated the talks will likely follow them.
Still, among the negotiators at least, there was a palpable shift in mood. On the morning after the Government delegation left town, Mr. Samayoa, the rebel negotiator, sat down to breakfast in the hotel where the President had stayed and ordered French toast with Italian bread. "It's Cristiani's favorite," he said.

CENTRAL AMERICA'S ROAD AHEAD

 
THE cold war is over and the ideological differences largely laid aside, but Central America still needs work. Plagued by limping economies, emigration and its convenience for drug traffickers, the region will still be chasing stability. But it will have to rely less on an increasingly distracted Washington for help. At a glance, these are the countries and where they stand:
Costa Rica -- A demilitarized oasis and the oldest democracy in the region, Costa Rica sees itself as a model for the road ahead. Its former President, Oscar Arias Sanchez, fostered peace with a plan that became the framework for solutions in Central America. But Costa Rica has a troubled economy and, coincidentally, a threatened environment; its rain forests are a draw for tourism.
Nicaragua -- With the contra war over and repatriation of the rebels accomplished in good part, Nicaragua now fights for continuing unity. President Violeta Chamorro, swept into office over the Sandinistas in elections nearly two years ago, remains too weak to confront the old guard head-on and so has settled into a partnership in hopes of healing what remains of the rift. The prospects for United States aid, once the most hopeful in the neighborhood, are dimming as El Salvador stokes American guilt for its suffering.
Honduras -- For many years the poorest economy in the region until Nicaragua surpassed it, Honduras found itself militarized in the 80's by the United States, which used it as a training ground in the years of conflict in its front and back yards. In any given week, Honduras is host to an average of 1,200 American troops. One question is whether there will be a reawakening of El Salvador's longtime antipathy, which led to the so-called Soccer War of 1969 and which was suspended while the civil war occupied the Salvadoran military.
Guatemala -- There is still a civil war in Central America, the longest-lived at 30 years and counting, and it is here, although peace talks are under way. One feared obstacle to the end of violence is Guatemala's emergence as a growing site for opium to make heroin and as a transshipment point for drug traffic.
Panama -- Historically considered South American, Panama is now looking up the isthmus for economic opportunity, especially in hopes of benefitting from a regional trade bloc that leaders have been working to develop. Its economy faltered in the years of confrontation that led to the 1989 American invasion that ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and businesses that fled the country have not returned in force. The return of the general, who is on trial in Miami on drug trafficking charges, remains a possibility. The drug traffic, meanwhile, has not abated in his absence, and may have even expanded.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Arab World Comes to the End of Illusions

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: ALGIERS

 BODY:
ACROSS the Arab world almost a year after the end of the gulf war, people are comparing that crisis and its aftermath to the thunderclap of the 1967 defeat of the Arabs by Israel in the Six Day War.
That event is deeply engraved in the consciousness of an entire generation that was emerging then from school and that today administers the Arab world. The "naksa" (setback), as it is known in Arabic, set off a chain reaction that changed the Arab status quo in the late 1960's and 70's. Eventually Egypt made peace with Israel, and some Arab countries, notably Egypt and the Arab gulf states, realigned themselves with the West even as anti-Western leaders like Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi consolidated their power. 
 Now the gulf crisis has again scattered the Arab alignment, changing it from a configuration the world had come to know -- and often be comfortable with. One dramatic example is Jordan, which the West had come to depend on as an ally, but which sided with Iraq in the war; the lesson appears to be how quickly the friendship of a monarch like King Hussein can be turned into something else when his people insist on voicing their deepest yearnings and anger.
In Saudi Arabia and in other lands like Morocco and Tunisia that Western governments have long considered "safe," substantial segments of the population also showed extreme hostility to the Western alliance against Iraq -- revealing how much bitterness can lie just beneath a seemingly tranquil surface.
Now new alliances are forming in the Arab world, but they are far from clear yet. For the United States and the rest of the industrialized world, whatever new order is taking shape in this strategically located region of 250 million people and vast natural resources is bound to be of crucial importance.
The oft-expressed desire of the countries of the region remains to copy Western development, and the political profile of regions like North Africa is of special interest to Western Europe, where several million Muslims from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia live. Yet the Arab world's suspicions of Western intentions dates all the way back to the Crusades, and it remains a world to be won over.
 
'Year of Torment'
 It was in this context that the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram said in an editorial Friday that "the year 1991 was to a large extent a tragic one for our Arab world, a year of torment and division." That is a judgment echoed by publication after publication in the Arab world throughout the year, and often heard in private conversations.
Indeed, it seems that 1991 saw the demise of every illusion -- and some realities -- that had long supported this region's hopes for greater political and economic power.
At the beginning of the year, the vision of political harmony, already fragmented by years of competition, was wrecked altogether by the gulf war, in which half the Arab countries fought Iraq while the other half sympathized with it. At the end of the year, the vision of achieving unity through Islam was also in shambles, as the Sudan and Algeria appeared to be drifting toward a version of theocracy in which Islamic doctrine would be as militantly politicized as it is in Iran -- and, as such, a threat to traditionalist Muslim Arab regimes like those of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Morocco.
At the same time, the evaporation of the Soviet system deprived radical Arab regimes of a dependable supporter and supplier; the vision of a liberated Palestine and of a unified Arab front to face Israel collapsed when Palestinians and other Arabs sat down for peace talks with Israel, and the continued weakness of oil prices demonstrated in the most striking way to what extent the "oil weapon" had lost its edge.
In other words, every element in the collection of stratagems and illusions that King Hussein had called "the Arab system" had collapsed. By far the biggest trauma was provided by the gulf war itself. Many Arabs today compare the impact of the gulf crisis on the Arab psyche, mind and beliefs with that of Israel's defeat in 1967 of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armies. That war left Israel occupying the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights as well as Sinai, which it eventually returned to Egypt under the Camp David peace treaty.
Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, who waged another war against Israel in 1973 but then traveled to Jerusalem to make peace, was only the most prominent example of the Arab leaders who emerged after that defeat and took their lessons from it. Eventually an entire generation of administrators instituted the pragmatic, moderate pro-Western policies that have characterized Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and its Arab gulf allies and Jordan. While none of these governments can be described as truly democratic, they have given their citizens a broader degree of personal and political freedom, and they manage their economies with some degree of free enterprise.
Others, like Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Sudan remain in the throes of "revolutionary" ideologies, but these countries are clearly struggling, with their social and economic agendas ambiguous beyond the plain objective of keeping the current leaders in power.
It is too early to see what the ultimate consequences of the gulf crisis will be; the Arab world is still busy settling scores and assessing damage. But some political scientists say one thing is clear -- the Arab world that emerged in the 1970's and 1980's is under enormous stress. "The gulf war raises many questions for the Arab world, starting with the most critical issue, which is the failure of the Arab states to play a more active and constructive role in the resolution of an inter-Arab conflict," said Clovis F. Maksoud, the former representative in Washington and observer at the United Nations for the Arab League. "The crisis has gone on to allow a glimpse into the collective anxieties of the Arab world."
 
Reaching the Limits
 One conclusion already being drawn is that the Arab world has reached the limits of its own contradictions. It is, for example, not possible to speak of a "brotherly Arab world" when one Arab nation invades and rapes another while others justify this as a struggle between the rich and the poor. It is also impossible for economies like those of Saudi Arabia, which is by any economic standard a part of the first world, to "interact" in any significant way with destitute third-world partners like Algeria and Egypt.
Finally, it is impossible to present a unified policy vis-a-vis Israel when several Arab governments -- and the Palestinians -- enter peace talks with Israel while the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasir Arafat, promotes the concept of Islamic holy war against Israel, as the P.L.O. did on Dec. 11 at the summit meeting in Dakar, Senegal, of leaders of the Islamic nations.
The P.L.O. proposal to those 45 heads of state, including leaders of 22 Arab countries, was roundly defeated. And at about the same time, with hardly a ripple of protest from the Arabs, the international community swiftly erased its 1975 United Nations resolution declaring Zionism to be a form of racism.
Such turnabouts in their fortunes and policies leave many Arabs awaiting new visionaries to supply new pillars for their collapsed faith in the future. But first, a big question must be answered: Where does the Arab world fit in the so-called new world order? One hint of the confusion on even this point is that Arab regimes have failed so far to take a clear position on the one principle that seems to be emerging as a central tenet of this new world order, as seen from the West: respect for human rights in a framework of democracy.
"We wish for the Arab world in this coming year to achieve significant progress in those domains," Al Ahram said in its editorial.
But the first truly free parliamentary elections in the region were hardly an endorsement for the principle. The results, in Algeria last week, gave a ringing victory to Islamic fundamentalists whose proclaimed aim is to abolish the freedom of choice for others, and this left considerable doubt that the democracy many Arabs yearn for will be a priority on the Arab agenda.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For a Limited Time Only: The Presidential Primary Season

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
FIRST there were no candidates willing to enter the race. Then a non-candidate, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, stole the limelight. Then the holidays came, and who had time to worry about a bunch of Presidential contenders slogging around in New Hampshire?
Now 1992 has arrived and it seems as if the race for the Democratic nomination is just beginning. In fact, it's almost over. 
 After years of complaining that the nominating process drags on too long, Americans are about to get the kind of primary campaign that they said they always wanted: a short one. The hesitant beginning not only gave the campaign a late start, it also set conditions for an early finish. None of the candidates has had time to assemble a large war chest or a far-flung organization, so none of them is likely to survive more than a few primary losses.
"This is less like a playoff series, and more like sudden death," said Ann Lewis, a Democratic consultant. "The winner is most likely to be the person who starts scoring early, and who doesn't make any mistakes."
On top of the financial constraints, scheduling changes, too, are promoting a short primary race this year. So many states have moved their primary dates up that the election schedule, once weighted toward spring, now has a decidedly wintry feel. Most political analysts predict that, barring any bombshells or surprise late entrances, the Democratic nomination will be sewn up by the time tulip season rolls around.
"If you were going to bet, you'd bet you will know the nominee by April," said Geoffrey Garin, another Democratic consultant. "The field is going to get smaller pretty quickly."
 
Heading for New Hampshire
 This week, the campaign season begins in earnest with a mass political migration to New Hampshire, the site of the first primary. The six major Democratic candidates are fighting it out there in what for some is likely to be a make-or-break battle. They are: former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia. Dr. Lenora B. Fulani, of the New Alliance Party, will also be running as a Democrat in New Hampshire.
Patrick Buchanan, the conservative columnist, will be in New Hampshire, too, trying to wrestle Republican delegates away from President Bush. While Mr. Buchanan is given virtually no chance of winning the nomination, he could embarrass Mr. Bush with a strong showing on Feb. 18. He made his first request for Federal matching funds last week and declared that he would match Mr. Bush's spending in New Hampshire "dollar for dollar."
With the caveat that a campaign can be thrown into turmoil at any moment, here is a schedule of key dates for the weeks ahead:
Feb. 10: The Iowa caucuses. Any Iowa Democrat who wants to participate may go to a school or a living room and, in a public vote, raise a hand for his or her candidate. In the past the caucus has been a critical early test. But with Senator Harkin, an Iowa native, in the race this year, the caucus is viewed as little more than a warm-up exercise. Still, a strong second-place showing could bolster the candidacy of a non-native, while a weaker-than-expected win by Mr. Harkin would be a serious setback.
Feb. 18: The New Hampshire primary. The nation's earliest Presidential primary has taken on near-mythic significance this year. For any Democrat besides Governor Clinton, whose base is in the South, a poor showing in the state could prove fatal. "The current crop of candidates will be cut in half by the morning after New Hampshire," said Hank Morris, a New York-based Democratic consultant.
On the Republican side, supporters of President Bush are concerned that Mr. Buchanan could receive a strong protest vote in the recession-racked state. Buchanan forces meanwhile are working to diminish expectations. "If Pat gets 10, 15, 20 percent, it will be a devastating blow," said Paul Nagy, Mr. Buchanan's New Hampshire director.
 
 
Battling for 0.4 Percent

 
Feb. 25: The South Dakota primary. Only four-tenths of 1 percent of the national convention delegates are at stake in the race, but it is the last chance for candidates to score an early win before the main primary season begins.
March 3: Several states hold primaries or caucuses, including Colorado, Maryland and Minnesota. Georgia is expected to join them, providing the first test of Southern strength.
March 10: "Super Tuesday." The campaign heads south in a big way, with voters in a dozen states, including Florida, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, going to the polls. It is expected to be a good day for Mr. Clinton; if it is not, it could prove ruinous for him.
March 17: The campaign moves to the Rust Belt with primaries in Illinois and Michigan. These are important contests for the Democratic Party, whose strategy for winning the Presidency depends heavily on carrying major industrialized states. If the field has not already been pared to two dominant contenders at this point, most analysts expect these races to do it. When the votes are counted, half of the pledged delegates to the Democratic convention will have been chosen.
April 7: The New York and Wisconsin primaries. When the polls close, more than 60 percent of the delegates will have been chosen; most politicians expect the likely nominee to have emerged by this point. "Everything," Mr. Morris said, "is going to collapse in April."
June 2: The last five primaries, including those of California and New Jersey. If the nominee has not yet been chosen he will be by the end of this day, or the race will remain deadlocked going into the convention.
July 13-16: Democratic convention, New York City.
Aug. 17-20: Republican convention, Houston.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Battle Looms for Bush On Another Asian Front

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Bush returns to Washington this week, he is likely to find that many members of Congress are at least as disturbed by his policy toward China, which is not included on his Asian trip, as they are about his policy toward Japan. A common lament on Capitol Hill is that the President does not have a consistent or credible policy for dealing with Beijing, whose human rights record is flawed, whose support of authoritarian regimes in Asia is expanding, and whose role in the international arms market is a cause of concern worldwide.
The perception that China policy -- or the lack of it -- is a weak point in Mr. Bush's handling of foreign affairs stands out all the more because he has more personal knowledge of the Chinese than did any of his predecessors. In 1974-75 he headed the United States Liaison Office in Beijing, the precursor to the embassy. 
 Criticisms have been growing since Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited China in mid-November and returned with very little to show for the trip, apart from Chinese agreement to adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international accord designed to restrict the export of missiles and missile technology. China said it would adhere to the agreement but asked the United States to lift sanctions that bar some high-speed computer sales and the transfer of satellite parts.
 
A Quiet Approach
 Last week the State Department said that only a few details remained to be put in place in order to remove those sanctions; meanwhile, the Administration's good will toward the Chinese appeared likely to be further boosted by a recent vote in China's legislature in favor of signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a signal that Beijing may be ready to deliver in the next few months on promises that it will adhere to the accord.
It is on such signals that the Administration bases its argument for its approach to China -- the assertion that a quiet approach is the most effective. "It has now been two and a half years since the tragedy of Tiananmen," Mr. Baker said at a news conference in Beijing during the November visit. "Unless we were to keep United States-China relations in the deep freeze forever, we had to start talking."
But Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who heads the Congressional Working Group on China, characterized the moves to lift the sanctions as an unnecessary capitulation to a nation that has enjoyed most-favored-nation trade status while other countries with centralized economies, including the former Soviet Union, did not. Representative Pelosi is the author of a bill that would require President Bush to show in his legally mandated annual review of China's trade status that Beijing was freeing political prisoners, refraining from selling missiles to Syria or Iran in contravention of the new agreement and making progress in other areas of human rights and trade. Her bill, having won wide Republican support, passed the House in November by a vote of 409 to 21. The Senate is to take it up this month.
"One of the first countries Bush visited as President was China," Mrs. Pelosi said in an interview. "Since his visit, we have run up a $30 billion trade deficit with the Chinese, most of it since Tiananmen Square in 1989. I don't think that most members of Congress want to isolate China any more than the President does. The disagreement between the President and Congress is that our relationship with China or any other country should be one that makes trade fairer, the political climate freer and the world safer. Our relations with China meet none of those tests now."
While the Communist governments of Europe have been collapsing, Communism in Asia is retrenching, with China in the lead. Vietnam has dramatically improved relations with Beijing, and China, North Korea and Vietnam share the view that there can be economic development without political pluralism in Asia. These societies are different, a Vietnamese official said recently, arguing that consensus there is more acceptable than combative multiparty politics.
China has also given its blessing to some of Asia's anti-Communist military regimes; it is a major arms supplier to the Orwellian junta that rules Myanmar, formerly Burma, and it is a friend of Thailand, where a military coup overthrew an elected government almost a year ago. In Cambodia, Beijing still supports the Khmer Rouge as the country attempts to rebuild itself, more than 15 years after Chinese-Vietnamese-Khmer Rouge cooperation helped Pol Pot to capture the country in 1975 and to try to remake its society in a fanatical leftist reign of terror that left more than a million people dead.
Ben Kiernan, professor of Southeast Asian history at Yale, said in an interview that it was China that "brought the Khmer Rouge back to center stage" as negotiations on a peace settlement for Cambodia dragged on through the late 1980's. And Representative Chester G. Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, accuses Washington of playing down opposition to the Khmer Rouge to placate the Chinese.
The Administration argues that the accord signed in Paris last fall to end the Cambodian civil war would have been impossible without cooperation from China. But whether that agreement will be enough to prevent a Khmer Rouge return to power is another question. One Democratic Congressman who agrees with the Administration on the need to accept the Khmer Rouge into the government -- if only to lessen the chances that it would become a very dangerous wrecker outside the system -- is Stephen J. Solarz of New York. But Mr. Solarz also is calling for more urgent pressure from the United States on China and the United Nations to insure a quick transition to democracy in Cambodia. "The Khmer Rouge," he said last week, "are already out there in the villages booting out local officials."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Opinions Considered: A Talk With Tom Wicker

 BODY:
TOM WICKER, whose "In the Nation" began appearing in this newspaper in 1966, wrote his final column under that title last Sunday and took off for a well-earned rest -- a week or so -- before getting on with other writing projects including three books and various assignments for The Times. 
 On New Year's Eve Mr. Wicker talked by phone with R.W. Apple Jr., chief Washington correspondent of The Times, and editors of The Week in Review about questions and people that have engaged him through a life in journalism that began as editor of a small-town newspaper in the South. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
 
How Politics Went From Soapbox to the Tube

 
Q. You've been at The Times for 30-something years as a reporter and Washington bureau chief and columnist, and in all you've been in journalism since 1949. What changes in the politics and the governing of the country have you seen?
A. Television has worked enormous changes, in politics and in the governing of the country, as in life generally. It's my view that those changes have been so great that we don't yet fully realize exactly what they are; until we do, we're not really going to know how to cope.
Television has made national politics more accessible, in the sense that a viewer in the smallest town knows the President of the United States better than he knows his governor or his congressman or perhaps even his mayor, depending on where he lives.
Q. More accessible but less participatory?
A. Clearly less participatory. For example, the subsidies the Government now provides for Presidential candidates go very heavily into television and very little into things like bumper stickers or front-yard placards or having people stuff envelopes. What used to be -- I would say well into the 60's -- what used to be the absolute essence of politics, the participation of individuals, has been greatly lessened.
Q. Has that in turn weakened the ability of politics to take up problems that the people care about? Is it such a one-way street that Presidents are more cut off than they were 20 or 30 years ago?
A. I'm not absolutely certain of that, because I think a President could, if he would, be better informed than I regard President Bush as being. But because television is so powerful and its reach is so broad it's much easier for a President, or a governor or a senator, to try to avoid the issue that is on people's minds, like the recession, and to try to create some other issue.
The major problem the country faces in 1992, at least it would seem now, is the economic recession and the long-term economic problem. I don't believe that President Bush could absolutely take the country's mind off of that by something like the Willie Horton ad. But he could more nearly do that now, because of television, than he might have been able to do in the past.
Q. Newspapers have changed too, of course, since you began as the editor of The Sandhill Citizen in Aberdeen, N.C.
A. You really can't get away from the influence of television on newspapers, either. But to the extent you can, the major changes I've seen have been cyclical or, one might say, circular. Following the war in Vietnam and on into the 70's with Watergate, journalists became much more skeptical and inquiring than they had been. They began to go behind things more clearly, to challenge political candidates, because they had been burned by too great a willingness to acquiesce in the views of politicians. Unfortunately, that lesson didn't last too long and by now journalism has lapsed too nearly back into acquiescence.
 
J.F.K. (and 'J.F.K.') and Vietnam

 
Q. There's been a lot of speculation over the last 25 years about what John Kennedy would have done about Vietnam. In an ancillary way, this has come up again because of the Oliver Stone movie. What's your view -- where was Kennedy really going before 1963 and what sort of policy would he have followed in Vietnam?
A. Well, in my book "J.F.K. and L.B.J.," I speculated on that -- and I think my evidence has grown since then -- it's entirely possible that Kennedy, if he wouldn't actually have withdrawn from Vietnam, would never have carried us as far into it as President Johnson did. This is one of the very few things I agree with Oliver Stone about in his new film.
I base that primarily on the rather subjective judgment that all Presidents feel the need to prove themselves as tough guys. Kennedy had already done that, if not at the Bay of Pigs, certainly in the Cuban missile crisis. And I think he didn't feel that necessity anymore. President Johnson did when he took over. And it's true, I think, that Kennedy had looked at that situation in Southeast Asia and seen it as one that could lead us into great difficulties.
It's possible that he would have over the years eased us out. I hasten to add that I do not think that that's established as fact.
The fact of which Oliver Stone makes a great deal -- that they were going to withdraw 1,000 troops at the end of 1963 -- I don't think is tremendously significant. I've always regarded that as being much more nearly a political manifestation for 1964.
 
On Playing the Race Card

 
Q. Relations between the races: this is an abiding concern of yours. Where do we stand today? Are we making progress or not?
A. I think the attitudes between the races, the fear and the animosity that exist today, are greater than, let us say, at the time of the Brown case, the famous school desegregation decision in 1954. Now that's a judgment that's very difficult to make, and I'm sure if you were living in the worst parts of Alabama or Mississippi at that time, you wouldn't agree.
The great triumph of the civil rights movement, in fact, is the progress in the South. A great deal needed to be done. And, of course, that's why so much has been done: segregation was obvious and it was state-supported; it could be attacked in the courts; it was, and it was ended.
But even there, the attitudes have not necessarily been changed. And the attitudes meanwhile in New York City and Boston and other places -- my own feeling is that racial animosities and fears in New York City are far greater than anything I ever knew growing up in the segregated South.
Where have we gone wrong? In the approach to legal segregation and discrimination problems, we've done rather well. In the greater problem of reconciling people and causing them to live peacefully together and to accord respect to each other, we've not done so well.
Q. Why should George Bush who, after all, grew up in an environment where he met a lot of right-thinking people about civil rights, have been willing to play the Willie Horton card and in general move as he has?
A. I don't want to comment on what George Bush's motives may be; I don't know him that well. But I would certainly say that he is impressed by the power of the right wing within the Republican Party. And the right wing of the Republican party is not the most advanced in liberal thinking on the race question.
I also think, and this is a guess, that he simply doesn't fully understand the conditions that exist. After three -- or is it four? -- major civil rights laws have been passed and a number of things have happened, a lot of Americans feel: "Well, we've done all of that. The civil rights revolution is over. We were confronted with a crisis; we solved it; and now here these people are -- they want more." George Bush may be one of them. But I emphasize that that is a supposition.
Q. You have been identified with a number of other issues that aren't what most people would call light entertainment -- criminal justice, nuclear weapons, the global environment, to name some. Does a columnist choose topics like that, or do they choose him?
A. Some of these things come about circumstantially. I've written a great deal since 1971 about criminal justice issues, primarily because of my almost accidental involvement in the Attica prison revolt in 1971. I was called in there as a sort of an observer to -- as I thought at least -- to observe whatever agreement was being worked out and to give it some validity, to see to it that the state would keep its part of the bargain. That wasn't the case at all; those of us who went to Attica, we turned out to be the negotiators, which is a rather odd role for journalists and one in which I was uncomfortable.
But that whole thing awakened my interest in criminal justice matters, and since then I have devoted a great many of my columns and of my thought and concern to those issues, which are really important to American life.
In the same way I almost never wrote anything about nuclear weapons which, of course, were a major issue of the time, but it just wasn't something that engaged me. And then the SALT II treaty failed in the late 70's, failed in the Senate. And that struck me with such force -- that an arms limitation treaty would fail -- that I began to get into that subject. And in the 80's, I suppose I wrote about nuclear weapons and nuclear arms negotiations as much as any other single issue. And I'm glad I did.
As far as environmental questions are concerned, it's almost the same way. Just as the years passed, it began to be clear to me that these were issues of enormous importance. Back in the 60's I used to write about clean water and clean air because I was a fisherman and I was interested in those things, but I wasn't thinking about it in any great cosmic, global sense, you know.
 
The Measure of Greatness

 
Q. You've had a close-up view of so many extraordinary people over the years. Do you have any heroes out of all that?
A. I think it tends to work the other way. Which doesn't mean that I look at all those people with contempt -- quite the opposite. But the journalist's perspective makes you see the feet of clay and the warts, and that's a good thing. I found them in many cases to be truly engaging human beings and admirable persons but not really, in the long run, impeccable heroes, or even just heroes without the "impeccable."
We should try to see people as clearly as we can. Then if a hero does come into view, why, we can give him his due.
Q. Happy New Year, Tom.
A. Same to you. Bye.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
New Business Would be Nice But So Would Breaking Even

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
OF all the departures by city officials at this mid-point in the Dinkins administration, the one that is likely to prove most significant is that of the deputy mayor of finance and economic development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero.
With businesses threatening daily to leave the city, unemployment at over 10 percent and pervasive doubts about the city's ability to compete with other urban centers, the person who charts the next round of economic development policies could have great influence over the direction of the city. 
 "I think this is an absolutely critical job," said Peter C. Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "At the end of the next two years, people have to be able to sense that a couple of things have been done to turn things around over the long term and to show us that there is a future."
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's resignation has not yet been officially confirmed. But it is an open secret at City Hall that she will be leaving shortly to spend more time with her two young children, and a search has been under way for her successor for over a month. Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who was formerly the commissioner of the Financial Services Corporation, a now-defunct agency that offered loans, grants and energy cost reductions to keep employers in the city, is expected to remain a key Dinkins adviser, and to become one of the Housing Authority's three board members.
Among the many names being bandied about as her replacement are Arthur C. Levitt Jr., former head of the American Stock Exchange and chairman of a newspaper and magazine company, Thomas S. Johnson, former president of both Chemical Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, Roger C. Altman, an investment banker and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter Administration who is co-chairman of the mayor's Management Advisory Task Force, and Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Traditionally, the city's economic development agencies have tried to promote development projects and help companies willing to stay in the city. That can mean anything from making small-business loans to offering technical assistance to helping with property tax relief to administering cable franchises.
Already, the various constituencies around the city are vying for their candidates and the chance to make sure that their pet issues are at the top of the next deputy mayor's list. The New York City Partnership, which represents the city's largest businesses, would like someone from the business community who will press their case for a freeze on property taxes and a smaller, leaner city government. The real estate community wants the next person to be sympathetic to granting tax incentives to build more buildings. And labor groups want to see someone who will accelerate investment in public works projects, thus creating jobs.
 
'Captive to Entrenched Forces'
 "The danger is that whoever comes in will become captive to some of the entrenched forces in the city," said Mitchell L. Moss, professor of urban planning at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. That would be a great shame, he feels, because now is the moment when a person free of ties to the traditional power structure could take a bolder, more creative approach.
Some experts, including Mr. Moss, say this is the moment to redefine the job, and they offer a few innovative suggestions.
First of all, they say, forget about trying to correct the problems caused by the current recession. It's too late.
Instead, maybe the next deputy mayor should be an "investment czar" who oversees all capital spending, speeding up its pace when necessary and focusing energy on the city's ailing infrastructure.
Or maybe he or she should be in charge of city efforts to persuade the various public authorities in the region to coordinate the spending of the hundreds of millions of dollars they pour into local projects. Right now, city officials have limited contact with them, Mr. Goldmark said.
Maybe the next deputy mayor should have ties not to the city's business community, but to overseas businesses who could send more European, Asian and Latin American companies here.
Maybe the Department of Cultural Affairs should be in the deputy mayor's portfolio, recognizing its role in attracting people and resources to the city.
 
Too Little Time
 Thus far the administration seems to be persuaded that its most critical need is to find someone acceptable to the city's traumatized large businesses.
"The Mayor feels very strongly that it needs to be someone recognized in the business community," said Ms. Hernandez-Pinero. "They'll embrace and support one of their own." Also, she said, there is simply not enough time left in this term of the Dinkins administration for any successor to her to build the necessary credibility with the big businesses that play such a major role in the economy.
Some people argue that this is exactly the wrong approach to be taking at this time. If anything, they argue, there has been too much focus on short-term rescue efforts for businesses in trouble and not enough on fashioning plans to propel the city into the next century.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, for instance, has struggled to rethink the way the city has been subsidizing old-line manufacturers, the lack of support offered to many promising new businesses, and the merits of taking a more regional approach to economic development -- competing with Atlanta, for instance, rather than with Jersey City. But she has gotten bound up in endless meetings over the budget crisis. And she says she has had to spend 25 to 30 percent of her time trying to come up with ways to keep companies that are threatening to leave. Focusing on the broader policy issues, she said with a sigh, has been the hardest part of her job.

 BODY:
In her more than 13 years as the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Janet L. Norwood earned a reputation for having zero tolerance for numbers that lied. Dr. Norwood, who retired last week, is known not merely as a stickler for accuracy -- that goes with the territory -- but also for refusing to let her statistics be pressed into political service. She would say that if you mess with the data base -- perhaps by manipulating unemployment figures to justify an economic policy -- you mess with democracy. Such attitudes led one senator to deem her "a national treasure." Discussing her retirement last week, the 68-year-old Dr. Norton expressed concern that Washington might not be managing the ever growing stream of economic information as well as some others. "We are really not operating internationally as effectively as we ought," she said. "I'm concerned about the increasing effectiveness of other countries. I worry about where we will be 10 or 15 years from now."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Suddenly, Towns Fight To Keep Their Garbage

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: BABYLON, L.I.

 BODY:
YEARS ago, the town of Babylon was so concerned about the dwindling space in its landfill that the supervisor himself patrolled the dump with a gun, turning away out-of-town garbage. But now that the dump is closed and Babylon burns its trash in an incinerator, the town is finding itself in a strange and unforeseen situation: it wants all the garbage it can get.
It doesn't seem to make sense. But Babylon's situation is being repeated throughout New York and New Jersey, and the reason lies in the changing nature of trash disposal in the garbage-glutted Northeast. As alternatives dwindle and prices go up, municipalities are finding that the only way to pay for their new, expensive electricity-generating incinerators or recycling operations is to take in as much trash as possible and charge their residents hefty fees for dumping it. 
 The town of North Hempstead, L.I., for example, has seen its garbage costs go up and up over the years. It now pays about $24 million a year to run its recycling program, pay off debts incurred to buy land next to its landfill, operate the huge town transfer station, and clean up its closed landfill, which is on the Federal Superfund list of toxic waste sites needing attention soon. To pay for all this, it charges its residents $104 a ton for garbage through their villages or garbage districts and demands that everyone within the town use the town's facilities.
"You build a system to handle a certain amount of waste, and then you need that much waste to pay for the system," explained Thomas Melito, deputy supervisor of the town of Babylon.
But now the local facilities are often the worst deals around for the garbage-hauler. In Essex County, N.J., for instance, the "tipping fee" -- the price to drop off a load at the county incinerator -- is between $60 and $70 a ton. But the tipping fees at landfills from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma can be as low $12 or $13 a ton, and the incinerator -- which needs about 2,500 tons of trash a day to pay off its debts and burn steadily enough to generate steam for the electric power it sells -- sometimes finds itself scrambling for trash.
"There are cheaper rates elsewhere, and the garbage tends to go to the lowest price," said Deborah Schneekloth, project manager for the incinerator.
All this leads to a lot of confusion, as municipalities that once fought to keep trash out are now trying to keep it in. It's very hard, even though many towns and counties like North Hempstead have "flow control" laws which say that any garbage generated within their borders belongs to them. In their desire to enforce the laws, some towns have been reduced to actually trailing the trash to insure that it ends up in the right place.
 
Get in a Car
 "You literally have to get into a car and follow a garbage truck around," said Ray E. Cowen, Long Island regional director of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
Flow-control laws have generally stood up to court challenges. But in a ruling that sent frissons through the garbage community, a State Supreme Court Justice declared North Hempstead's flow control law unconstitutional last week. If the decision is upheld it could deny the town some 95,000 tons of trash a year and even drive its Solid Waste Management Authority into bankruptcy.
Meanwhile, Long Island is bleeding garbage. It is hard to tell how much, but Mr. Cowen estimated that some 2,000 of the 10,000 tons of trash generated here each day go unaccounted for and are probably shipped off the island, mostly in violation of flow-control laws.
"It seems that there's a complicated shell game being played with Long Island's trash," said Steven A. Romalewski, a garbage expert for the New York Public Interest Research Group, which suports environmental and consumer causes. "Garbage is being moved around and we really don't know where it's going."
Connecticut, which wrote plans and long-term contracts years ago, seems to have avoided most of this problem. But in New York and New Jersey, where there are thousands of garbage districts and garbage-collection methods, it is virtually impossible to keep track of all the trash.
In Washington County in upstate New York, the incinerator is short about 300 tons of trash a day it needs, said James D. Willis, director of solid waste for the Warren-Washington Counties Industrial Development Agency. And in the town of Huntington on Long Island, an incinerator with a capacity of 900 or so tons a day has been taking in just 550 a day.
"There's plenty of garbage around, but it's not coming in," said Herbert A. Smith, the departing director of Huntington's resource recovery project.
The companies that ship garbage to the Midwest at the lower prices argue that this is simply the free market at work. But environmental and municipal officials say free-market economics and won't protect garbage exporters for long. New York and New Jersey, they say, are finally beginning to pay the true cost of garbage disposal at home. The rest of the country, they believe, will eventually follow suit.
"It's not a level playing field," Mr. Cowen said. "The low prices that people are being quoted involve some sort of out-of-state shipment to facilities that don't have the same regulations that we have in New York State. And in fact, what we're going to see is that these out-of-state options may dry up."
This spring, Congress is to consider legislation that would allow states to impose huge surcharges on out-of-state garbage, or to ban shipments of it altogether. When that happens, Mr. Cowen said, New York and New Jersey will be forced to handle their own garbage themselves.
"We're getting lulled into a false sense of security by these low-ball contracts," Mr. Cowen said. "Something's going to happen on the Federal level that will chase the waste back to Long Island, and when that happens, I don't know if we're going to be ready for it."

HEADLINE: BUSH TO PROPOSE INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR HEALTH COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
In his budget request to Congress later this month, President Bush intends to propose tax credits to help people buy health insurance, further cuts in military spending and major new restrictions on the payment of Government benefits to the affluent, Administration officials say.
Mr. Bush's advisers say the tax credits will be the centerpiece of his election-year strategy to show that he has a substantial domestic policy and to fend off attacks by Democrats who contend he has no plan to aid the 34 million Americans who lack health insurance. 
 The President is also under political pressure to revive the economy. His budget is expected to forecast economic growth for 1992 of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, about the range expected by many private economists.
 
$2,000 Credit Is Weighed
 To combat the recession, Mr. Bush is expected to propose some type of tax benefits for first-time home buyers, and Administration officials said they were considering a tax credit of up to $2,000 for such buyers. While traveling today in Singapore, Mr. Bush said he would like to put any savings from cuts in the military budget "into the pockets of the American taxpayer."
Administration officials say the President also intends to propose once again a cut in the tax on capital gains, the profits from investments. He is also likely to ask Congress to restore some sort of tax credit for business investment in plants and equipment.
Even some Republicans question whether those measures would be sufficient to stimulate the economy, but Administration officials see them as necessary for political reasons.
A budget request is always a political document, and that is particularly true in a Presidential election year. Mr. Bush's campaign strategists say he probably cannot get re-elected on foreign policy and domestic promises alone, and they see the budget request as a manifesto for the campaign.
The President's budget request for the 1993 fiscal year will comply with overall spending limits set in the bipartisan budget agreement enacted in November 1990, Administration officials said. But they said he was considering removing the ban on shifting money between the military and domestic budgets.
The officials said that in view of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demise of communism throughout the former Soviet bloc, Mr. Bush will propose a military budget below the maximum allowed by the 1990 budget law. They predicted that he would seek $285 billion in military spending for the next fiscal year, which begins in October. The limit for military spending is $291.5 billion.
By moving on his own to pare the military budget, Mr. Bush hopes to pre-empt efforts by Congress to make deeper cuts, officials said. He is likely to seek cancellation of weapons systems like the Seawolf, a nuclear-powered submarine whose main mission -- attacking Soviet submarines -- now seems outdated, budget officials said.
 
Tax Credits for Insurance
 Administration officials say the tax credits for buying health insurance are consistent with the Republican precept that the Government not impose costly new mandates on employers or establish a vast new Federal program of national health insurance to supplant the private market.
Tax credits are a prominent feature of a health-care bill introduced in November by Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and 20 other Republican Senators. That bill, like the proposals being drafted by the Administration, would authorize tax credits to help individuals, families and businesses buy health insurance or health-care services.
Administration officials say Mr. Bush will describe his philosophy and general approach to "health-care reform" in his State of the Union Message, scheduled for Jan. 28, or in his 1993 budget request, which goes to Congress within a few days of the speech. Detailed proposals would follow a few months later.
"Serious decisions have been made, but some hard political calls remain," said Gail R. Wilensky, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor.
Tax credits are offset against income taxes; a tax credit of $500 reduces a person's tax liability by that amount. Under the proposal contemplated by the Administration, the credit would be refundable. In other words, the Government would pay an amount equal to the credit to people so poor that they pay no income tax.
 
Having to 'Face Realities'
 As for the military budget, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in an interview this week: "It's almost a certainty that there will be further reductions in defense spending. We've just got to face realities."
Mr. McCain sits on the Armed Services Committee and supports the Pentagon on most issues. But he favors cancellation of the Seawolf submarine, which, when loaded with weapons and electronic equipment, costs more than $2 billion a vessel. The Administration said last year it was planning to buy seven of the submarines from 1992 through 1997.
"It is an excellent piece of equipment, but it consumes over one-fourth of the entire shipbuilding budget," Mr. McCain said. "I don't believe the threat it was designed to face, Soviet submarines, is there any more, certainly not with the priority that deserves that type of expenditure."
The Electric Boat division of the General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Conn., is building the first Seawolf and expects to deliver it to the Navy in 1996, said Neil D. Ruenzel, spokesman for the shipyard.
Mr. McCain also wants to end production of B-2, or Stealth, bombers. He predicted there would be "a free-for-all" over the Pentagon budget as Congress re-examines the 1990 budget agreement and reassesses threats to national security.
 
Trimming Benefits to Rich
 As part of his budget request, Mr. Bush is expected to propose some type of tax relief for middle-income families. He also intends to make a systematic effort to cut Government costs of providing benefits to high-income households under programs like Medicare and farm-price supports. Last February, Mr. Bush floated the idea of limiting benefits for the most affluent families. Now, Administration officials say, Mr. Bush plans to expand the idea.
Mr. Bush's new proposal would more than triple the monthly Medicare premium, now $31.80, for people with incomes exceeding $125,000 a year.
Medicare, Social Security and veterans' compensation are called "entitlement programs" because anyone who meets the criteria is entitled to benefits. Last month Mr. Bush expressed concern about their growth, saying: "When you take a look at some of the entitlement programs, therein lies the real expansion of Government spending. What can be done about them? We're talking about that right now."
Mr. Bush overruled his budget director, Richard G. Darman, in one politically sensitive area: health-care benefits for veterans.
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Edward J. Derwinski, appealed successfully to Mr. Bush to restore money that Mr. Darman cut from the department's 1993 budget request.
In an interview, Mr. Derwinski said Mr. Darman would have allowed an increase of $750 million above the 1992 budget for veterans' health care, which totals $13.6 billion. After talking to the President, Mr. Derwinski won an increase of $1 billion over the 1992 figure. In recent years, Congress and veterans' groups have insisted on an increase of at least $1 billion a year in this account.
The Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest health-care provider in the United States, with 172 hospitals, 127 nursing homes and 93 clinics.
In his budget request last year, Mr. Bush predicted incorrectly that the recession would be "short and shallow." The new forecast is less rosy, and assumes that the economy will be flat or will shrink slightly in the first three months of this year; it envisions slight growth in the second quarter, followed by stronger growth in the remainder of the year.
The condition of the economy influences the outcome of Presidential elections. In the six elections since World War II in which the candidate of the incumbent party prevailed, the economy grew an average of 4.6 percent. In the five elections in which the incumbent party lost, the average growth was 3 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sees Major Policy Shift in Plan for Commonwealth Loans

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The United States' decision to endorse full membership in two international lending institutions for six former Soviet republics is the latest sign of a sweeping change in American policy toward taking responsibility for their economic recovery, Administration and banking officials said yesterday.
The changes, first spelled out by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d last month in his Soviet policy speech at Princeton, are forcing agencies across the Federal Government to reconsider longstanding policies. 
 The Treasury Department had opposed full membership for the Soviet Union for more than a year, but changed its position after the United States recently gave formal recognition to the 12 former republics and established diplomatic ties with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. The State Department also pushed for greater assistance, said Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The Baker speech in Princeton signaled a fundamental shift from confrontation to collective engagement," an official said.
Enabling Russia and five other former republics to borrow money from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will allow industrialized countries to provide money with less effect on their recession-strained budgets.
A series of several separate applications, instead of the single application received from the entire Soviet Union in July, will also ease but not eliminate the major bureaucratic obstacle to membership in the International Monetary Fund, Administration and banking officials said.
Whereas the entire Soviet Union might have been judged to have a larger economy than Britain or France, thereby giving it the basis to claim a powerful permanent seat on the lending institution's executive board, Russia by itself does not have so large an economy.
Russian membership in the International Monetary Fund alone could result in loans of up to $5 billion a year, although Administration officials said smaller amounts were more likely.
 
Plunging Ruble
 The exact amount of annual borrowing would depend on the size of the initial Russian contribution, which could vary from $2 billion to nearly $5 billion under the organization's bylaws, depending on several factors including the exchange rate used to calculate the size of the Russian economy. The ruble has plunged to more than 100 to the dollar.
Only 23 percent of the initial contribution would have to be given in internationally traded currencies like the dollar, the German mark or the Japanese yen, a sum that likely would be lent by Western governments.
The announcement Friday of the United States' endorsement of full membership also represents a raid on two huge sums of money and thousands of economic development experts who for the last two decades have been dedicated largely to helping the third world. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank already find their staffs stretched thin.
The fund has already been forced for the first time in its 46-year history to tell several dozen member countries that it can no longer perform annual reviews of their economic policies, but instead will do them every two years. The reviews have traditionally provided an objective basis for political debate in those countries and international lending to them.
And unless the fund's 156 member countries agree soon to lend it an extra $60 billion, the institution might be forced to cut back on lending to the third world next year, people with an intimate knowledge of the institution's financial health said. The increase was to have been approved by the end of last month by the members, but the United States has yet to adopt the necessary legislation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exit From Manila: Making of a Hasty Retreat

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Seven months ago, the Bush Administration was on the brink of a deal with the Philippine Government to extend by seven years its lease on two huge military bases in the Philippines.
Today, the United States military is packing up ships, supplies and ammunition, and preparing to leave the Philippines by the end of the year, closing out an American military presence in the country that has lasted nearly a century. 
 One small American naval operation will be transferred from the Philippines to Singapore, President Bush announced there early today. Mr. Bush, on the second stop of a four-nation Asian and Pacific trip, said the Seventh Fleet's logistics operations will be based in Singapore.
How the Administration's expectations of a long, phased Philippine withdrawal collapsed into a hasty retreat from two of its largest and oldest overseas bases is the result of an unusual combination of events, including the eruption of a volcano, the demise of the Soviet Union, an assertion of Philippine nationalism, and shrinking Pentagon budgets.
 
Slow Pullout Planned
 Closing the sprawling Subic Bay naval base, coupled with the abandoning of Clark Air Base this past summer after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, forces the largest reduction to date of United States forces in the western Pacific.
American negotiators, who opened talks in Manila in May 1990 on the future of the bases, say they braced themselves for months of intense bargaining in a political climate that emphasized Philippine sovereignty interests. Indeed, Washington planned to gradually withdraw its forces over the life of a new lease. But the Administration's final decisions were largely driven by events outside the negotiators' control.
American negotiators and senior Navy officers say they also considered the risks and advantages of staying or leaving. For all its highly touted ship-repair yards, supply depots and training centers, how much was Subic Bay really worth to the United States? If Manila's asking price was too steep, what was the political risk of browbeating the Philippine Government into accepting less? What were the costs of alternate sites in the Pacific region?
"We wanted an agreement, but not at any price," said Richard L. Armitage, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense who was the chief American negotiator in the talks with Manila.
 
Lost Training Ranges
 Mr. Armitage and current Pentagon officials said that a review of the installations' security value, made before the negotiations, downgraded them from vital to important.
Collapsing into 12 months what, under a previous proposal, was essentially a 10-year withdrawal has forced the American military to scramble. Pacific commanders say the greatest loss will be the prized Philippine naval, marine and air force training ranges -- especially a bombing range near Clark. But replacing Subic Bay will be less costly than expected, they say, partly because its functions will be parceled out to other bases rather than moved in whole. The Navy had estimated in the late 1980's that it would cost more than $3 billion to duplicate Subic Bay at a single site elsewhere in the region.
"It's not going to be as bad as we originally thought," Adm. Charles R. Larson, head of American forces in the Pacific, said in a telephone interview. "We've found that most functions can be disestablished or relocated without significant construction costs."
The Air Force has moved to a new bombing range in Alaska. The Navy has started shipping tons of ammunition to Hawaii, and plans to spread depots and ship-repair work to installations in Guam, Japan and Singapore. Training areas in Japan and South Korea are being readied for Marines and special-operations forces.
 
Countering the Soviets
 Subic Bay, in particular, has been important to the Navy since Commodore George Dewey sailed into Manila Bay to vanquish the occupying Spanish fleet in 1898. After the Philippines gained independence in 1946, Clark, Subic Bay and several smaller installations remained under a series of negotiated pacts.
The importance of Clark and Subic Bay increased after the Vietnam War, when the Soviet Navy began operating from the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Vietnam, an installation on one of the world's finest harbors.
Subic Bay employs 29,000 Filipinos and pumps more than $300 million into the Philippine economy. But bases have been increasingly unpopular with Philippine nationalists, for whom the bases were a symbol of colonialism and dependency.
In simplest terms, Manila's decision last month to evict the United States stemmed from an impasse in tense, 20-month-long negotiations about extending the 1947 base agreement.
During that time, the value of the bases eroded under the combined weight of the decline of the Soviet Union, Mount Pinatubo's continuing eruptions, growing frustration in Congress with the Government of President Corazon C. Aquino, and lawmakers' opposition to financing bases overseas when installations at home were closing.
Negotiators were under marching orders from Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d to avoid striking what Mr. Armitage called a "straight real-estate deal." Rather, they were to seek a broader, regional security partnership with Manila that called for a reduction in American troops at the bases.
 
Narrowing Differences
 As the first of eight rounds of discussions opened in May 1990, Mrs. Aquino served American negotiators with notice that her Government was canceling the existing base agreement, effective in September 1991.
The Philippine negotiating team, headed by Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, demanded $825 million a year in cash and aid to extend the lease for seven years. The United States countered with an offer of $363 million a year for a decade. By May, the two sides had narrowed their differences. Only a few technical details remained on a tentative seven-year pact of $363 million in annual aid.
Then came the act of God no one predicted: the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June. The value of Clark, buried under tons of volcanic ash, plummeted, and the base was abandoned. Washington was willing to pay $203 million a year for just Subic, and for at least 10 years -- terms the Aquino Government agreed to on Aug. 27.
But that smaller aid offer insulted many fervent Philippine nationalists, some of whom had spokesmen in the country's Senate. Many of the nationalists were upset that their dreams of converting Clark into a commercial airport were no longer possible.
 
'We'll Pactk Up and Leave'
 "No amount of bases money can take the place of sovereignty, independence and the well-being of future generations of Filipinos," Senator Agapito Aquino, President Aquino's brother-in-law, said at the time.
With a Sept. 16 ratification vote planned in the Philippine Senate, senior American officials dug in their heels in the hope that "shock therapy" would sway undecided legislators.
"We've made our best offer," said President Bush a week before the vote. "There will be no change on the part of the United States."
The same day, Defense Secretary Cheney said that while a treaty rejection would be a "a real tragedy for the Philippines, we'll pack up and leave -- that's it."
Treaty supporters in the 23-member Senate fell 5 votes short of the two-thirds margin -- 16 votes -- that was needed for approval.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania City Hopes It's Bouncing Back From the Bottom

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHESTER, Pa., Jan. 4

 BODY:
This small city of 42,000 people, surrounded by the thriving middle-class suburbs west of Philadelphia, has one of the highest concentrations of urban problems in America.
Its schools and public housing rank among the worst, as do the city's rates for crime, joblessness, truancy, teen-age pregnancy and infant mortality. Homelessness, drug abuse and AIDS are major problems. 
 But a series of startling changes in Chester is raising hopes among residents that the city is bouncing back after hitting bottom.
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, saying that the city's housing authority was in "total and complete breakdown," took over management of that agency last month. This month, the state increased its supervision of the school system, forcing its officials to address the truancy rate and what has regularly been the highest teacher absentee rate and lowest standardized test scores in the state.
Attacking corruption, the county district attorney recently won convictions of a member of the City Council and three members of the city's redevelopment authority on charges that included ethics violations and accepting bribes from contractors.
And in a stunning upset, a grass-roots voter-registration drive helped Democrats win control of city government in the November elections. Republicans, who outnumber Democrats 2 to 1 in this predominantly black city, have controlled the government since 1866.
 
Intriguing to the Experts
 Urban experts say Chester is an intriguing case study because it has all the virulent social problems of an inner city, but the number of people affected is relatively small and the city's isolation amid suburbs protects it from the sprawling blight common in big cities.
These experts also say the five-mile-square city has great development potential because of its abundance of inexpensive land and its convenient location: Chester is on the Delaware River three miles west of Philadelphia International Airport and has easy access to regional rail lines and interstate highways.
"Chester would be a good laboratory for trying to deal with hard social problems," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany. "The new leadership should have success with that argument in reaching out for foundation grants and trying to obtain more county, state and Federal support."
Indeed, the city's newly elected leaders, who take office Monday, say they are aware of the potential benefits that come with the city's plight and they plan to take advantage of offers of help they have already received from political, academic and community leaders.
Chester's decline is of relatively recent vintage. William Penn, having bought Pennsylvania from King Charles II, sailed up the Delaware River in 1682, stepped ashore here and named the settlement Chester, after the English city of his birth. The community thrived for 175 years, building the first iron-clad ships and becoming one of the world's busiest shipyards.
 
A Feeling of History
 That sense of history is more alive on the west side of Chester, where most of the whites live in old stone houses on Nob Hill, near the well-groomed campus of Widener University. Interstate 95 separates this suburban scene from the east side, with its blighted business district and waterfront littered with abandoned industrial buildings.
The east side still evokes the feeling of a Colonial village with narrow winding streets and small brick buildings, but each intersection has a knot of homeless beggars and all the movie theaters, the bowling alleys and a skating rink have closed.
"No one wants to live the way we do in Chester," said Barbara Bohannan-Sheppard, a 41-year-old nurse who operated a day care center in her home before she became the first Democrat to win a mayoral election here since 1905. "We have good qualified people in Chester, but the example we've set for our children has been that if you want to be a success you better stand on the corner or push drugs or do something illegal."
The election of Ms. Bohannan-Sheppard, who as Mayor is on the five-member City Council, and two other Democratic council members, will give Democrats their first majority on the council in 125 years.
"We're going to have town meetings, we're going to work as a team and we're going to step on a lot of toes to make changes around here," Ms. Bohannan-Sheppard said in a recent interview.
On a wintry day, several residents shared the feelings of guarded optimism about the future. But some were wary of counting on the new administration. "Taxes are too high here, and a lot of businesses are pulling out of Chester," said William F. Severs, the manager of a downtown shoe store. Last month, the city raised real estate taxes, already among the highest in the county, by 26 percent to $144 for $1,000 of assessed value from $114.
The newly elected officials have no government experience, but are brimming with optimism. "A lot of people are lined up to help us: lawyers, judges, the Governor's office, even the Mayor of Wilmington," said Annette Burton, a 51-year-old community college administrator, mother of 10 children and one of two Democratic council members. Charles McLaughlin, a 54-year-old aircraft inspector and union official, was the other.
Chester's Republican Party machine, one of the nation's oldest, has also been called one of the most corrupt in recent decades by state officials. The Pennsylvania Crime Commission, an investigative agency of the State Legislature, said in a report last year that Chester's government had been dominated by "a triad of criminals, corrupt politicians and rogue law-enforcement officers" since the 1960's.
During Chester's long prosperity as an industrial center, unskilled workers found high-paying jobs in steel mills, shipyards, aircraft engine factories, slaughterhouses and a Ford Motor Company plant. But at an increasing pace over the last 40 years, because of high labor costs and increased competition, all but two major companies closed or moved to the South; at the same time, more Southern blacks moved into Chester and many white residents moved to the suburbs.
As the population fell, from 63,000 as recently as 1970 to 42,000 last year, it became two-thirds black and increasingly poor and elderly. About one of every six residents lives in public housing, one family in three receives public assistance and about one adult in three is unemployed, the city estimates.
 
Powerful Republican Boss
 But the Republicans stayed in power, with the help of patronage jobs and favors. Last year's crime commission report concluded: "Government in Chester is Jack Nacrelli," referring to John H. Nacrelli, the 61-year-old Republican Party boss, who holds no official position.
Mr. Nacrelli was Mayor from 1968 until 1979, when he was convicted of racketeering and income tax evasion for taking $22,000 in bribes from an illegal gambling operation with ties to organized crime. The report says Mr. Nacrelli continued to run a "shadow government" during and after his two-year imprisonment and made most political appointments in city agencies and the school system.
Mr. Nacrelli, who has apparently moved, could not be located for comment on the report.
 
Facing a Big Deficit

The outgoing City Council, facing a projected deficit of 17 percent in its $22 million budget for the fiscal year 1992, convened Dec. 27 and, amid a raucous demonstration by city employees, voted unanimously to lay off nearly a quarter of the municipal work force. In all, 15 of 105 police officers and 56 other workers were laid off immediately.
Members of the new administration said they would reconsider the layoffs and would submit a new budget by the end of February. Ms. Bohannan-Sheppard, the newly elected Mayor, said, "We can't even get a copy of the budget, and they say they have zero money in the bank."
But the city's backers are optimistic. "Chester is the kind of place where you walk down the street and men still tip their hats to you, and the churches are filled on Sundays," said Ann G. Torregrossa, executive director of the Delaware County Legal Assistance Association in Chester and the lead lawyer on several successful lawsuits on behalf of citizens' housing and school groups.
"If there is a place where we should be able to turn things around, it's Chester," she said.

HEADLINE: Arabs Delay Leaving for Talks But U.S. Expects a Resumption

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan postponed the departure of their negotiating teams today for the second round of peace talks with Israel in Washington, joining the Palestinians in protest over Israel's planned deportation of 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories.
United States officials said, however, that they expected the Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese to turn up in Washington, where the talks are scheduled to resume at the State Department on Tuesday. The officials said that the four delegations apparently felt the need to make some gesture of protest over the Israeli actions, but that none of them appeared to want to scuttle the talks over the issue.
 
More Explosive Issue
 The chief Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said by telephone from her home in the West Bank that the Palestinians "are making our point" by delaying their departure. But she said it was her "surmise" that the Palestinians and others would end up going to Washington, now that the United States has strongly condemned the Israeli deportation orders. At the first round of Washington negotiations in December, Israel postponed its delegation's arrival in protest the venue of the talks, which Israel had wanted to hold in the Middle East. 
 While the postponements are troubling, United States officials are more worried about another issue that could have a far more lasting and explosive impact on the negotiations: Israel's pending request for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees to resettle Soviet Jews. The loan request is coming up for reconsideration coincidental with this second round of peace talks in Washington, and how the Bush Administration responds to the Israeli request could drive either Israel or the Arabs away from the negotiating table.
When the Israeli loan guarantee request was first raised last September, the Bush Administration insisted despite Israeli complaints that it be postponed 120 days so that the issue would not complicate Washington's efforts to get the first round of the peace talks convened in Madrid.
 
U.S. Plans Demands
 The reason the loan issue might have complicated the peace talks is that the Administration intends to demand certain restrictions on any new settlements that Israel might build as a precondition for the loan guarantees. United States officials knew that this demand would lead to a dispute with the Israeli Government that might have dissuaded Israel from taking part in the peace talks.
Administration officials say recent actions by the Israeli Government have not diminished the inclination of President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to insist on restrictions on Israel's use of any American loan guarantees in building settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The actions American officials point to range from the Israeli Government's decision to allow Jewish settlers to buy homes in Silwan, an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem, over the protests of Mayor Teddy Kollek, to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's promise to far-right members of his coalition last week that he would spend two-thirds of his 1992 housing construction budget -- some $350 million -- on new Jewish settlements.
One Administration official said Prime Minister Shamir is behaving in a "very short-sighted manner." The official said Mr. Shamir appears to be doing almost anything to placate far-right parties to hold his coalition together, without considering how his actions might affect President Bush and the American public at precisely the time the loan guarantee issue is coming up again.
"Obviously this is something that we will be watching very closely," said Rashid Khalidi, a historian at the University of Chicago who has served as an adviser to the Palestinian delegation. "The continuation of settlements affects vital Palestinian interests and ultimately the peace process itself. There can be peace or there can be settlements, but there can't be both."
 
No Decisions Made
 According to senior Administration officials, no decisions have been made yet on how Washington will respond to the Israeli request. All the Administration has been telling the Israelis for the past four months is that if and when such guarantees are granted, Washington reserves the right to attach certain "terms and conditions" on how the money is spent.
Israeli officials say that since September they have been trying to find out from the Administration what "terms and conditions" they might attach, particularly regarding Israeli settlement activities. "Unfortunately we have not received any answers," one Israeli official said.
"We'll address that when the President gets back from Asia next week," a senior Administration official said about the loan guarantee issue. "I would not speculate on what the outcome might be."
These loan guarantees would allow Israel to raise money from commercial banks at preferential rates of interest. The cost to the American budget depends on certain accounting rules, but would probably require at least $200 million to be set aside.
 
American Jews Mute Support
 Interestingly, many prominent American Jews, who actively lobbied the Administration for the guarantees back in September, have since adopted a much more low-key approach.
In part they recognize that the mood in America has shifted against foreign aid. In part, they realize that pro-Israeli members of Congress cannot pass the guarantees without President Bush's endorsement, and therefore the Israelis are simply going to have to negotiate with Mr. Bush about his terms. Their shift in approach is also a silent protest against Prime Minister Shamir's policies.
"It is not that the Jewish community is any less committed to the guarantees or their need, but they are aware that they are living in a totally changed political climate," said Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress. "It is difficult for the American Jewish community to mount a major campaign here for the guarantees because they are so important for Israel, if the Israeli Government says continuing settlements is even more important."
Abraham Foxman, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, added: "Domestic concerns mandate a lower profile in support of the guarantees. It would be counterproductive to have a debate on the issue at this time. We are saying to our Government and the Israeli Government, 'Work it out.' "
 
U.S. Has 3 Options
 In the view of pro-Israeli lobbyists, the Administration has basically three options. One would be for the President to postpone the issue again. This would put the primarily Democratic sponsors of the Israeli loan request in the uncomfortable position of having to take the lead in sponsoring a major foreign aid program in the middle of the election year with the economy in recession. To do nothing, though, would run the risk that the Israelis would use that as an excuse to drag their feet in the peace negotiations.
The second option would be for the Administration to support the loan guarantees -- although not necessarily the $2 billion a year for five years that Israel is seeking -- while insisting that they be granted only on condition that Israel totally freeze all settlement building activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The problem with that option is that the Israelis would argue that the United States had forfeited its role as an "honest broker" in the negotiations by forcing Israel to freeze settlements, instead of leaving this to be negotiated with the Arabs in return for Arab concessions.
The third option -- and the one that seems to be gaining the most support in Congress -- would be for the United States to agree to limited guarantees on the condition that an amount equivalent to what Israel spends on settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip be deducted each year from the total. In 1991 that was roughly $560 million.
This option is explosive, though, because the Administration would have to declare whether Israeli building in East Jerusalem would be considered part of building in the occupied territories. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem, but that annexation has never been recognized by Washington. For the United States to exclude East Jerusalem building activities from the total would be to alienate the Palestinians, but to include it would mean another fight with the Israelis.

For Bush, Jog Overseas Beats Running at Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Sunday, Jan. 5

 BODY:
After President Bush took his morning jog New Year's Day at a college in Sydney, Australia, someone asked whether he had made any resolutions. He responded, as expected, with pledges to work for peace and prosperity and a slightly faster two miles around the track. And then he said something revealing.
"I'll tell you something," he said. "We are blessed with family, with kids that come home, and with the loyalty and strength that one gets when one is in public life from sons and a daughter. And so I don't have to ask for any more there, but if I were, I would simply say 'Keep it strong, Lord, because we're going into one hell of a year over there.' It's politics from tomorrow on. And it isn't very pleasant." 
 Mr. Bush clearly loves being President, flying around the world, tackling problems and schmoozing with fellow statesmen. Just as clearly, he dislikes and is somewhat daunted by the prospect of going back before the voters this year and asking for another four years on the job as he is beset by an endless recession and plummeting ratings in opinion polls.
Never has that been more evident than in the last week, as the President swept through Australia and Singapore at the start of a four-nation crusade to promote free trade and American exports. It is a trip that is redolent of re-election politics, aimed squarely at shoring up his domestic recession-fighting credentials.
But the man it was designed to showcase seemed almost at times to be fighting the impulse to campaign, or even to think about going back "over there," to Washington and New Hampshire.
 
Echoes From Past: Cheers
 Australia, in particular, seemed to remind Mr. Bush of those halcyon days when he stood atop the popularity ratings and his jaunts overseas were political pluses instead of liabilities. The President reveled openly in the friendly crowds and diplomatic adulation. Asked if he was happy to be there, Mr. Bush shot back: "You got that right."
He confided that he had brought his golf "sticks" on Air Force One, though he was unable to find time to play, and wished openly that he could fire up his beloved speedboat in the sparkling waters off Sydney. In Singapore, he held a campaign-style rally Saturday at the Singapore American school, which caters to the 9,000 American expatriates here.
And he escorted guest after guest on tours of Air Force One, a hulking Boeing 747 that has been walled off inside into a maze of staterooms and high-tech conference centers.
"I was just showing the Prime Minster around," he said one day in Canberra, popping into the big plane's press room with Australia's new leader, Paul Keating. Mr. Keating gazed around and remarked, "When you've got one of these, you know you've made it."
The President just smiled.
 
Do We Have to Go Home?
 In fact, the only times during Mr. Bush's three-day Australia stopover that his brow furrowed and clouds materialized over his head were when he spoke of returning home.
"There is no way that I can tell you what it feels like to travel with so little hostility on the street," he told a crowd during a cruise in Sydney harbor. "I'm a man that knows every hand gesture you've ever seen -- and I haven't learned a new one since I've been here. So something is terribly wrong."
Dedicating a maritime museum, Mr. Bush talked about his love of fishing, then quickly added: "Please don't repeat that for the people back in the United States. I think sometimes they think the only thing I like to do is go fishing."
Both impromptu remarks drew broad laughter from his audience. But in the larger context of Mr. Bush's statements this week, the jests sometimes seemed strained.
By the time he arrived in Singapore, Mr. Bush seemed to have shifted into a somewhat grim campaign mode, denouncing Democratic budget proposals as "crazy" and belittling Democrats' efforts to make hay out of his coming showdown with Japanese officials over trade barriers.
Earlier, Mr. Bush seemed equally grim about the coming campaign, expressing a determination to win, and saying that he will do whatever it takes to get re-elected.
He will not have to wait long. While in Singapore, the White House announced that the President would travel to New Hampshire on Jan. 15, three days after his return.
 
Down to Business
 In the meantime, the President has set about more mundane work in the last half of his overseas trip, which goes on with a two-day visit to South Korea to discuss trade and arms-control efforts involving North Korea's nuclear program before the final stop in Japan.
In Singapore, the President announced actions aimed at shoring up Washington's standing in Southeast Asia. Chief among them was an agreement in principle to shift logistics operations for the Navy's Seventh Fleet from Subic Bay, in the Philippines, to Singapore harbor.
Mr. Bush also announced a new program that will encourage the sharing of environmental studies and technologies among Washington and Asian allies in a region that is being seriously degraded by wildfire development.
Finally, Mr. Bush officially lifted a 16-year-old trade embargo against Cambodia, which recently agreed to a United Nations-sponsored plan to end its long civil war. The United States imposed the trade ban in 1975, when the Communist Khmer Rouge Government stood accused of slaughtering Cambodian citizens in a bid to gain absolute control of the country.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Town Refuses Tax Increase To Rehire Teachers

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Residents of the tiny Massachusetts town of Wales, which laid off five of the seven teachers at its lone elementary school last year because of budget problems, voted Friday against increasing property taxes to pay for rehiring the teachers.
By 407-to-249, voters turned down a measure that would have raised $160,745 to bring back the teachers immediately. By a nearly identical margin, the residents approved a second measure raising $20,000 to maintain their garbage collection services. 
 The referendum marks the second time in two months that voters have rejected tax increases for the school. After the first attempt failed in November, the town laid off the elementary school teachers, leaving only two teachers and a principal to instruct 199 children in kindergarten through sixth grade. Two of the classes each have more than 50 students, and the third class, serving students in kindergarten through second grade, has 75 students.
Friday's referendum would have raised the average property tax bill $200 a year to provide at least one teacher for each grade. School officials blamed the recession for the proposal's failure.
"I think people find themselves on hard times and were unwilling to tax themselves," said David Roach, the Superintendent of Schools for Wales and four neighboring towns. "We didn't effectively make the case that the needs for the schools and the kids should transcend that."
Officials also said the state's recent approval of $30 million in emergency school aid may also have been a factor in the defeat, even though communities will have to pay back half of any aid they receive. School officials said they planned to apply for the emergency aid later this month.
"People said, 'See, the state is bailing us out,"' said the school's principal, Joseph DiFabio. "It's a sad day for the children of Wales."

HEADLINE: BOATING;
Smaller Craft Are Biggest News at the Boat Show

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
The boating market continues to reel from a two-year slowdown made worse by a widening recession. But a glimmer of light still flickers in the ailing industry, sustained by sales of the ever-popular 16-foot outboard runabout.
Organizers of the New York National Boat Show, which begins Saturday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, have addressed boaters' slimmer wallets and general skittishness with plans to exhibit a variety of craft that fit the small-boat niche. Among them will be ski boats, small aluminum fishing boats, day sailers and cruising boats. Costs can be expected to vary between about $5,000 to $10,000. 
 The small runabout or day sailer is often the boat that families want to know about. With that in mind, boat show organizers are targeting Friday, Jan. 17, as Family Day, and are offering free admission to children 12 years and younger who come accompanied by a parent.
"It goes along with the line of thought that boating is a family sport," said Michael Duffy, show manager, in a recent interview. "Having a special day is an effort to make families aware that they can water-ski, fish, cruise, sun-bathe, or sail with a boat."
 
Declining Sales
 Over all, new boat sales dropped 18 percent from 1990 to 1991, according to estimates from the National Marine Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group that tracks sales. Those numbers were somewhat better than ones posted for 1989-1990, when sales declined 21 percent.
Without the sale of runabouts, the picture would be far bleaker. Half of the new boat sales in 1991, or about 227,000 craft, fit into the outboard runabout category.
Among the manufacturers showing small- to medium-sized boats in New York will be Sea Ray, Bayliner, Fisher, Chris-Craft, Wellcraft, Yamaha, Robalo and Penn Yan.
Another relatively popular area in a sagging boat market is inflatables. The boats are popular because they tend to weigh less than conventional boats of the same size. Jeff McCurdy, a sales manager at Achilles USA, a Japanese firm with an office in East Rutherford, N.J., contends that the inflatable is economical. "They have more stability than other boats, and don't need as much horsepower to go," said McCurdy.
Achilles plans to show its new HB110 Sport, an 11-foot inflatable boat with a hard fiberglass bottom. The boat, which takes outboard engines up to 25 horsepower, costs about $5,000.
Among sailboat manufacturers, Howmar Boat Corporation of Moosup, Conn., will display its 14-foot Phantom. It is an open skiff that costs $1,700. Flying Scot of Deer Park, Md., will show its 19-foot day sailer, a traditional boat designed 30 years ago with a centerboard that allows the boat to maneuver in little more than two feet of water. It costs $8,890.
More expensive craft, in both sail and power, also will be on display at the New York show. Master Craft, a firm in Maryville, Tenn., which makes only water-ski boats, plans to exhibit its new Pro Sport 205. It is a 20-foot inboard speedboat with a 250 horsepower engine, powerful enough for tournament towing. It costs about $25,000.
The company, which produces ski boats from 19 to 25 feet, has not felt the slump that builders of luxury yachts and sailboats have experienced, said David Wilson, creative director for Master craft. Other boat builders are entering the ski boat market this season to take advantage of water-skiing's pocket of success.
On the luxury yacht end, Bluewater Marine of Mora, Minn., will be displaying a boat that organizers have named the queen of the show. Its Bluewater 53 is designed with three staterooms, two heads with full bathtubs and an unusual galley-kitchen area that has full-sized appliances. Its price is about $390,000.
The luxury boat market has been hit particularly hard in the last two years. Although the recession has taken its toll, manufacturers have bitterly complained about an excise tax approved by Congress last year that places a 10 percent levy on boats costing more than $100,000.
Greg Proteau, a spokesman for the national manufacturers association, said recently that the tax has "crippled" the luxury-boat market, causing the loss of 20,000 jobs in the marine market.
Some manufacturers are expanding into other areas. Fountain Powerboats of Washington, N.C., a firm known for its high-speed luxury sport boats, plans to introduce a new line of mid-size saltwater fishing boats at the New York show. Models that range from 25 to 31 feet are being built with the same deep-vee construction as Fountain's sport boats. A 27-foot fishing boat with a center console will be on display; the craft costs about $58,000.
A wide variety of marine equipment also will be at the boat show, including the newest outboard engines and the latest in navigational equipment. Numerous companies plan to display global positioning systems -- navigational tools that access satellites for pinpointing a boat's location, speed and course.
The Javits center is situated between 34th and 39th Streets, and between 11th and 12th Avenues on the city's West Side along the Hudson River. The show lasts through next Sunday. General admission is $8; $3 for children 6-12. On Friday, entrance to a pre-show Red Carpet Day costs a special admission fee of $20. For boat show information, call 212-216-3616, starting tomorrow.

Metaphor For Failure

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
President Bush's visit to Japan this week, with his entourage of business executives, is a metaphor for what ails America. There in a neat package are symbols of corporate failure, social division and lame political response.
The most prominent businessmen in the delegation are the leaders of the U.S. auto industry: the C.E.O.'s of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. And what is their message to Japan and the world? That when an American leads his company into disastrous losses, his response is to whine about the competition and indulge his personal greed. 
 Ten years ago the U.S. manufacturers won "voluntary" restraints on Japanese auto exports to this country. They said they wanted the protection temporarily: a breathing space to modernize their products and production methods.
After 10 years the American manufacturers are in worse trouble than ever. General Motors lost between $6 and $8 billion in 1991. Last month the company announced drastic measures to cut jobs and close plants over the next three years, steps that experts thought were long overdue. Ford and Chrysler are also losing heavily.
Having failed to make good enough use of the protection they were given, the car companies want more. President Bush is expected to press Japan for new export quotas. The losers will be American consumers, who buy Japanese cars not out of some bias but because they are very good cars.
Mr. Bush talks passionately about free trade and fair competition. But by bringing the Big Three auto executives along, he tells his Japanese hosts that what he really wants is an unfair protected position for inefficient American manufacturers.
There is another reason why the Japanese are likely to be unimpressed. That is the record of the American automobile chiefs in lining their own pockets while they run their companies into the ground.
The loudest of the auto C.E.O.'s is Lee Iacocca of Chrysler. In 1990 he was paid $4.65 million and given $718,000 in Chrysler shares. And the company bought two houses from him because he could not get what he wanted for them in a falling real estate market.
G.M.'s chairman, Robert Stempel, got $2.18 million in immediate and deferred compensation in 1990. His predecessor, Roger Smith, who presided over much of the company's slide, gets an annual pension of $1.2 million.
In Japan, managers whose companies do so badly resign. The ethic is personal responsibility -- which does not seem a bad idea for any society.
Moreover, Japan has a very different idea of what top business executives should be paid. The American pattern, with C.E.O.'s getting 160 times the pay of an average worker, seems to the Japanese to be grossly disproportionate and socially divisive.
The Wall Street Journal provided some comparative figures last week in a compelling story by Jill Abramson and Christopher J. Chipello. It should be required reading for all interested in the comparative rise of Japanese and decline of American industry.
The 12 major C.E.O.'s who are with Mr. Bush earned, on average, a little more than $2 million in 1990. Chief executives in Japan get about one-sixth of that figure: between $300,000 and $400,000 a year. And they pay a top marginal income tax rate of 65 percent.
A President of the United States who sought serious answers to the decline of American manufacturing might go to Japan to learn. He would learn about the ethic of responsibility, and about a system that values the production-line worker and not just the executive.
If he had an open mind, that President would also learn how much Japan has achieved by industrial policy -- by government working with industry to support civilian research and development and point capital toward promising areas. He would see what a difference it makes when the government does something about education instead of just talking.
But we do not have that President. We have one who repeats the cliches of free enterprise good, government bad. We have one who cares about short-run politics instead of the long-run problems -- the critical problems -- of the American economy. We have one whose answer to our recession is to blame the Japanese.

HEADLINE: Mayor Halfway

 BODY:
The intelligent State of the City speech that Mayor David Dinkins gave last week contained some good ideas and sounded New York City's traditional theme of compassionate leadership for all urban America. Yet it was just a speech, one of many he has given that reflect his performance over two years.
He certainly sounds as if he knows how to lift New York City from its recessionary torpor. Yet he has not yet pushed hard enough to master the city's fiscal fates, never pressed his appointees hard enough and never rallied his fellow citizens insistently enough. 
 Elected to govern in a flush summer, David Dinkins is serving in a harsh winter. The people of New York got just what they voted for, a decorous, conciliatory mayor, likely to lower heated voices and calm racial tension. Yet almost before he took office, the sudden economic chill demanded an aggressive leader willing to make harsh, unpopular decisions. If Mr. Dinkins has a chance of saving his city from economic recession and emotional depression, he will have to get tougher.
After a flawed start, Mr. Dinkins has lived up to his reputation as a conciliator. In the early days, he let a destructive black boycott of a Korean grocery in Brooklyn drag on for months without using his personal moral suasion to stop it. But he has learned. When Crown Heights erupted following the accidental death of a black child hit by a car a Hasidic man was driving, Mr. Dinkins was at his peace-making best, wading gamely through hisses, boos and worse to calm the community.
The Mayor's own top priority is to fulfill his inaugural day promise to be "the toughest mayor on crime this city has ever seen." It's too soon to assess his plan for more police and community patrols. Nor is it possible to measure the effect of cutting all other city services to pay for the police. But it can at least be argued that New Yorkers already feel better knowing the police plan exists and that, once it's fully implemented, it may cut street crime.
Still, the overwhelming priority is dealing with tough times, and by that criterion the Dinkins administration has repeatedly fallen short. The city budget is constantly being revamped, not only because the economy is dragging but because Mr. Dinkins is, too.
The Mayor has yet to make the bold innovations so necessary in times of duress. What an opportunity he has to force changes in wasteful civil service rules and labor practices, to introduce competition by privatizing some services, truly to create a leaner, more efficient government.
Mr. Dinkins has made some managerial progress, cutting down on overtime, reducing city cars and consolidating economic development offices. But when it comes to the labor force, half the budget, he has never overcome the damaging precedent of an unaffordably high wage increase to the teachers 15 months ago. He has yet to wrest significant concessions or productivity savings from any city union and has never presented a plausible plan to cut the work force.
Spending so much on labor inevitably means spending very much less on others, especially the poor, whom Mr. Dinkins considers his fundamental constituents.
The Mayor can do better, but not by himself. He is still missing a strong group of advisers and commissioners to whom he can comfortably delegate. Many of his appointees are undistinguished. And the most talented, demoralized, are job-hunting.
Mr. Dinkins would do himself and the city a favor by revamping and strengthening his team. With strong aides, working in a cooperative climate, Mr. Dinkins can blunt, perhaps even conquer, a mood of civic sourness that sometimes drives him to defensive despair. For instance, he sometimes claims he is being held to a higher standard because he is black.
That is not a credible contention. New York has its share of racists, but if anything, most New Yorkers want their first black Mayor to succeed. His ability to say the right things suggests that, in the second half of his term, he still can.

HEADLINE: Recycle the Budget Agreement

BYLINE: Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One year after its implementation, the budget agreement of 1990 has achieved a bizarre status: worshiped as a kind of totem by the Bush Administration, it is simultaneously scorned by fiscal zealots as a sham that did nothing to reduce the Federal deficit.
Both views are wrong. The budget agreement did cut the deficit. It's just that cutting the deficit did nothing to help our stagnant economy, which, as a perverse consequence, will yield a record $362 billion deficit in fiscal 1992. In short, the budget agreement performed as advertised and failed miserably anyway. 
 As we struggle to recover from what is now the longest recession since the Depression, it has become clear that the budget agreement needs emergency alterations to stimulate the torpid economy. These changes must include a temporary tax break for middle-income families and enhanced unemployment benefits. We also need a package of grants to state and local governments to restore cuts in education and public services.
We should also scrap the rule that prohibits the transfer of funds from defense to domestic spending. Even Mr. Bush expressed in a recent interview a willingness to join Congressional Democrats in removing this barrier.
The savings achieved by the agreement were ambitious and genuine. The summit meeting produced $482 billion in deficit reduction. Of that, $338 billion in painful program cuts and tax increases were put into law by the 1990 Reconciliation Act. The rest was achieved through caps on spending and pay-as-you-go requirements.
Despite all this, the deficit projections have grown more outrageous. When the Congressional Budget Office made its initial post-summit estimates in December 1990, it projected the total deficit declining from $253 billion in 1991 to $29 billion in 1995. In August, it revised its estimates upward by an eye-popping $539 billion over the five years of the agreement, with the projected 1995 deficit hovering at $150 billion. The next report is due later this month, and all signs say it will confirm the bleak projections.
What happened? The recession stole a huge portion of the savings we struggled over last year. Of the total $539 billion in deficit increases, only $3 billion -- or 0.6 percent -- can be attributed to Presidential and Congressional spending beyond the agreed upon limits. Government did not actively dig this hole.
Much of the fiscal atrophy is the result of so-called technical re-estimates. We lost $82 billion over five years in personal tax receipts because of Treasury Department computer models that did not take adequate account of the declines in real estate, which caused and compounded the downturn.
We've also had to raise our estimates of spending in areas such as Medicaid and food stamps. Those unexpected drains on the Treasury, mostly the result of growing unemployment and increasing poverty, are controlled by courts and regulators as much as economics.
Other elements, however, have been induced solely by the recession. Some $25 billion a year in deficit increases, or $145 billion by 1995, will be revenue losses resulting from declines in personal income and poor corporate profits.
Thus, out of the summit meeting's $482 billion in deficit reduction, we have lost a minimum of $200 billion to sheer economic stagnation in the first six months of the agreement. And the loss is swelling.
The lesson is largely one of timing. We moved to reduce the deficit to insure long-term economic stability. But we did it at the worst possible moment. We had a window of opportunity in 1989 with a new President and a growing economy. Many of us urged immediate action. Instead, we ended up delaying and taking contractionary steps at almost the precise moment when the economy stopped growing.
Deficit reduction is not an end in itself and the agreement is not holy writ. The economy must get through the recession before we can minister to its long-term fiscal soundness. To achieve that end, we have little choice but to revise the agreement.

HEADLINE: An Open Letter To Bobby Bonilla

 BODY:
Dear Bobby:
Congratulations on your new contract. It must feel great knowing that you and your family are secure for life. So Bobby, why are you so sour? Why do you persist in bashing the Pirates' management at every turn? Are you so concerned that selling yourself to the highest bidder doesn't square with your "great guy" image? Does maintaining that image require the presence of other, non-economic factors? Is that what's behind this modern-day tragedy you've created in which those simultaneously wicked and bumbling Pirates executives are solely to blame for your leaving Pittsburgh? Bobby, are you trying to kid us or yourself? Listen, forget the image thing and just enjoy your fortune; you're not such a great guy, anyway, and the money hasn't a thing to do with it. 
 A great guy would have made a graceful exit. A great guy would have publicly thanked the Pirates for providing him the opportunity to grow into a $29 million player. A great guy would have thanked his teammates for giving him the thrill of participating in two National League championship playoffs. A truly great guy would have expressed his gratitude to the fans of Pittsburgh for their warm support.
Look, Bobby, you've said this is a business; now you should start acting as though you mean it. The situation boils down to a very simple business proposition: You acted in what you perceived to be your best interests by signing with the Mets, and the Pirates acted in what they perceived to be their best interests by letting you go. Maybe the Pirates felt they couldn't afford to pay you $29 million. Or perhaps the Pirates felt that while they could afford the freight, you weren't worth more than their last offer.
Interestingly, before you signed, many people opined that you should command a larger contract than you merited strictly for your on-the-field performance because of "intangibles"; i.e., because you're such a great guy. As I recall, the Pirates' last offer was for about $24 million, which would be about at the level where the "great-guy premium" part of your $29 million contract kicks in. That makes the Pirates' handling of your contract negotiations look pretty responsible.
Bobby, there are no villains in this saga, and there are no heroes, either. There aren't even any great guys.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Sweeping Up the Rubble of the Year

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
LAST year seems to have wound down in a grump, at least among some readers. And, for the first column of 1992, we might as well get rid of some of the rocks and pebbles that have rolled this way.
 
 
A Bummer of a Bimmer?

 
Dear Sir:
Based on your article, "With the 325i, BMW Drops the 4th Shoe," (The Times, Dec. 1), I'm convinced you're about as qualified to evaluate cars as a graham cracker.
I own a 1992 325i and I'm exceptionally pleased with all aspects of the car. As for the "weak detent between low and reverse," I have to force it into reverse, and my wife let the car sit in the garage for three days because she didn't know the "trick" to get it into reverse.
Maybe this BMW isn't the greatest car on the road. Time will tell. But it's an excellent complete package. Come to your senses!
 
HOLLARD R. EARLE
Long Valley, N.J
A graham cracker? I tend to think of myself as Cracker Jack.
Dear Sir:
What a travesty to condemn a terrific new car almost solely because of your inability to distinguish first gear from reverse. I did agree with you about the air-conditioning controls: a mishmash of confusion, particularly at night.
But if I'd agreed with your obvious preference for lightweight and thin-skinned small cars like the Lexus, Maxima and Camry, I'd have bought one. How strange to condemn BMW for being itself.
 
EDWARD S. DUBEL
North Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 I confess. I have an affinity for the thin-skinned.
Dear Sir:
After your positive impressions of the new models BMW has introduced since 1987, everyone here was surprised by your 325i review. BMW's surprise was compounded by the fact that the 325i was on the eve of receiving significant awards from both Car and Driver and Automobile magazines, and the newspaper reviews of the car have been very good throughout the country.
Your opinions are your opinions, but one part of the article states a fact that is difficult to understand. BMW has never been criticized for the operation of our five-speed manual transmission. Reporting that the "reverse gear lives in dangerous proximity to low" is something new and "the problem, echoed by others who have driven the car" does not match our experience from the media or customers.
Safety is very important to BMW, so we are concerned with the emphasis you placed on an experience others have not shared.
 
THOMAS O. MC GURN
Woodcliff Lake, N.J
McGurn is general manager of corporate communications for BMW of North America. His opinions are his opinions.
Dear Sir:
Having purchased a new BMW 325i several weeks ago, I found your review insufficiently critical. Let me tell you what we have encountered.
First, the windshield developed a long vertical crack at 200 miles, and at about the same time a defective sensor told us we were without coolant. None of the heater ducts worked and much packing material had to be removed from each. Then the power steering began to groan. After a long wait, it was replaced. At about 300 miles, the right cornering light fell out of its socket and was dangling by its wires while we tried to figure out why people were tooting and pointing at us.
There is more, but I will not bother you with it, except to cite one problem that BMW dealers told us is endemic in the new 325i: engine vibration. that is felt through the accelerator and the steering column. The new engine is quite rough, and at certain steady speeds on our freeways, you can really get quite annoyed at the vibration of the accelerator pedal and the steering column.
Compared to our '85 BMW, this really is an unpleasant car to drive.
 
DANIEL S. CHAFFIN

 O.K., I'll try to be more critical.
 
 
Hit From Both Sides

 
Dear Sir:
Your recent article discussing the differences between the Volvo wagon and minivans ("Volvo Makes Its New 960 a Safe Bet," The Times, Dec. 15), which came complete with a few technical updates and emotional letters from mommies, left me cold.
Sideguard protection isn't new. G.M. has been putting this type of protection into autos since the late 70's. And your emotional mommies are just that. If they want all the protection they can get, they should consider a Jeep Wagoneer, a G.M. Suburban or maybe a production Hummer.
 
TOM HANDLER
Cherry Hill, N.J.
 It's rumored that surplus Gulf War Hummers are going for 25 bucks.
Dear Sir:
Your column about the Volvo 960 did not really address the concerns of the letter from Ellie Dunham. Where is she supposed to seat four young children if she and her husband also want to ride in the car?
We have three children in car-seats and own a Volvo 740 wagon, and we have the same dilemma. The Volvo wins on safety, but the minivans look attractive because they offer more seating.
Volvo does offer a third bench seat for the back of the wagon, but I am concerned about the safety of that -- tiny knees pressed up against the rear door in a rear-end collision, etc.
 
SUSAN SWARTZ
Highland Park, Ill.
 Given the volume of mail, this is a problem that is on the minds of a lot of people. Automotive engineers are among them, and they say they are trying. They also maintain that vans have gotten a bad rap, so to speak.
Dear Sir:
Just weeks before your column appeared, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration responded to Congressional questions on the safety of light trucks and vans and stated the following:
"NHTSA is aware of the greater use of light trucks and multipurpose vehicles such as vans as passenger-carrying vehicles. In spite of these increases, accident data have shown that the average occupant fatality rate for all types of light trucks and vans (LTV's) is identical to that of passenger cars.
"In side impact crashes, the number of fatalities per million registered vehicles for LTV's is significantly lower than that for passenger cars (25.5 vs. 57.3). Although this may be in part because the side door sills are somewhat higher on some LTV's than on passenger cars, nonetheless LTV's have a lower fatality rate, even though they have not had to meet the same safety standard as passenger cars."
We agree on this point. For the record, the only manner in which Chrysler minivans do not meet all passenger car standards are the side-impact door beams and the unbelted driver-restraint requirement. Both of these will be resolved in late 1993, when a passenger air bag will also be added.
One certainty about adding door beams is an increase in weight and an offsetting reduction in fuel economy. We have preferred to invest our minivan resources in the first and only integrated child seat, the first minivan air bag, antilock brakes and all-wheel drive.

But Then . . .

 
Dear Sir:
I'd like you to know that before your excellent column appeared regularly in Sunday Sports, this section of The Times was used at my house only for such things as wrapping fish heads, training the dog, kindling the wood stove and the like. Now these tasks wait until I've investigated your column.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow" (editorial, Dec. 19) distinguishes between short-term and long-term economic problems, but neglects the banking crisis, which affects both. 
 Because of the speculative excesses of the 1980's and some regulatory excesses of the 90's, many banks and savings and loan institutions are afraid or unable to lend. This means small entrepreneurs -- who otherwise might exploit low interest rates to start or expand businesses, create jobs and help lead us out of the recession -- are having a tough time finding credit.
Many banks and savings and loans were too eager to lend in the 1980's. But sharp policy reversals compounded the problem. After fostering a real estate boom with the 1981 tax cut and its extraordinary shelters for real estate, nervous law makers in Washington did an about-face in 1986. They took the best shelters away all at once and punctured the real estate bubble. The result was to gut savings and loans portfolios.
Policy makers committed a similar reversal on savings and loan regulation. After encouraging massive deregulation in the early 80's, they observed the resulting failures and secured tough reregulation in 1989. Unfortunately, the reregulation has not only disciplined incompetent and dishonest managers, but has also straitjacketed competent and honest ones.
What we need is greater regulatory flexibility -- institution by institution. Those institutions with good track records should be allowed some leeway on capital requirements and portfolio restrictions. The last thing we want to do is sharply reverse our policy again, but some regulatory moderation is in order.
And what about the banks? Many need more capital. We suggest another look at a program from the 1930's that worked. Beginning in 1933, a Government agency called the Reconstruction Finance Corporation began buying preferred stock in the country's banks. While this added cash to bank balance sheets, it was not a give-away program. The R.F.C. demanded dividends on the stocks it bought. Once the banks regained strength, the R.F.C. sold its stock and recouped the original investment.
The R.F.C. stock purchasing program was one of the most successful parts of the New Deal.
Stabilizing banks and savings and loans -- without give-aways -- will help pull us out of the recession and open the way to sustained growth.

Buy American

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow" (editorial, Dec. 19): We look to the Federal Government as the sole force capable of reversing our deepening economic morass. It is the sole organized force, but consumers can turn the economy around by simply buying American-made products. 
 Our Government cannot openly support a buy American policy for obvious reasons. But organized labor, big business and especially the news media must begin to educate the public that we are in large part to blame for our economic woes.
American consumers provide well over $100 billion in foreign aid each year by buying Dutch shavers, Korean shirts and Japanese cars (that figure more than doubles if the drug trade is included). Each year, $100 billion flows out of the United States that should have been recycled into more jobs in the United States. The buying power of American consumers is no longer strong enough to support the world. We are barely supporting ourselves
As the number of employed American consumers shrinks, so does confidence and spending. This feeds on itself. An economic jump start such as you refer to in the Robert Solow-Francis Bator proposal is a good and temporary first step. It may buy time to devise a flexible, long-term economic scheme that allows the United States to insulate its capitalistic integrity, short of outright protectionism, from often unfair practices of some in the international community. And our Government must be a partner. Corporations alone cannot successfully compete against foreign corporate monoliths in partnership with their governments.
The key word may be "temporary," but we had best recognize that something much more potent and innovative is required for our long-term health.

Pension Borrowing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow" (editorial, Dec. 19), you imply that a business could borrow from its own pension fund and use these "tax-subsidized" dollars for "tax-subsidized" investments. This ambiguity results from the preceding sentences, which paraphrased read: It makes little sense to allow businesses to deduct the entire cost of long-lived investments with tax laws that also permit tax-free contributions to pension funds. 
 Pension fund rules prohibit a "party in interest" (a trustee) to borrow from the plan to which it contributes. This clarification is essential.
You recommend only a temporary tax cut to stimulate the economy. Your emphasis on temporary would be more credible if you had been equally adamant in recommending that 1990's tax hikes should be made temporary as well. After all, when Congress raised its own salaries by $28,000, was this a temporary spending increase?

Not by Neglect Alone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is surely accurate to say that Presidential neglect contributes greatly to our domestic economic plight. However, neglect conveys a flavor of just not getting around to something. It would be more appropriate to remain mindful of the active role that Reagan-Bush planning and policies have played in bringing us to where we are. 
 It may be tempting to think that Presidents Reagan and Bush were merely foolish or shortsighted, but indeed the increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of the few and the increasing impoverishment of the many were not achieved through carelessness or accident. It would have taken more stupidity than I can credit to them to believe that decreased spending on education, health and social needs, the breaking of unions and similar policies would produce a larger dependent population and a smaller work force capable of producing and earning the wealth needed to support a healthy economy.
Let's not blame them merely for what they are failing to do now, but also for the years of what they have already done.

Help Small Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The state of the economy has produced an environment that allows our major corporations to downsize rapidly. The news media have been making much of this, though it has been going on for some time without fanfare. With the coming Presidential election, our politicians have noted the increasing number of unemployed. What has gone unnoticed is that many of the people losing jobs at large companies have been re-employed by small companies. Small businesses provide more jobs than big business. Yet we seem to do everything possible to stifle the creation of new companies. 
 Our lawmakers have enacted well-meaning laws to create such agencies as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Litigation and increasing health care costs have drastically increased the insurance costs required to run a business. It's small wonder that only the very brave start new businesses, and most, unfortunately, fail.
To me, as a small-business man, the solution is simple. We should establish an agency, directly tied to the President, to provide a pool of venture capital for new businesses. Legislation should eliminate tax liability to start-up companies for their first five years and limit tax liability for the next five years. The Government could even take a minority interest in these companies with a provision that the investment be disposed of after the 10-year grace period. The employees of these companies would, of course, pay the usual taxes.
The need for providing new jobs is crucial, and with enlightened government assistance, we can achieve this goal.

Forget Van Buren

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Milton Hindus (letter, Dec. 17) rightly restores to our reading list the autobiography of Martin Van Buren, a wise and literate man; and, we should add, radically misguided. 
 In listening to the wisdom of the elders, it is necessary to distinguish between those who warn us that problems are recurrent and those who say that the best thing to do about them is nothing. George Bush has placed himself squarely with Martin Van Buren and Herbert Hoover.
We don't know what cures economic and political diseases nearly as well as we know that they are recurrent. We do know that the function of leadership is to make an energetic, compassionate and informed effort to do better. The spirit of commonwealth requires no less.
The elders we fail to listen to at our peril are not beguiling and prudential men like Van Buren. Van Buren is better read as a 19th-century novel of manners than as a wise man for our times.

KURT WOLFF
A Portrait in Essays and Letters.
Edited by Michael Ermarth.
Translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider.
Illustrated. 223 pp. Chicago:
The University of Chicago Press. $24.95. 
 KURT WOLFF, perhaps the most discriminating publisher in this century, turned down one of the all-time best sellers, Axel Munthe's "Story of San Michele," because he found it "unbelievably trite, vain and embarrassing." Around the same time he received a letter from an "idiotic 'professor' " writing "from Trieste in bad German" offering translation rights to a novel. He refused and later surmised he had lost James Joyce's "Ulysses." Just before that, he had a letter from Oswald Spengler offering "The Decline of the West," but he returned the manuscript unread since he thought other, more academic publishers might handle it, and he did not like "the undistinguished handwriting of the letter." He remained proud of the first rejection four decades later, contrite about the others; but he talked about them all to a large radio audience when he was in his 70's.
By then he was a legend. As a university student in Germany he had begun to work for a small Leipzig publisher, and in 1913, when he was 26, he established the Kurt Wolff Verlag and then went on to found or acquire half a dozen other publishing houses, including Hyperion and Pantheon Casa Editrice, that expanded the horizons of publishing everywhere. In the 1940's, as a refugee in New York, he founded Pantheon Books, and when he left that house, started, with his wife, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint with Harcourt, Brace and World.
Before World War I a handful of independent, rebellious German publishers set the world's standards for good book making. Wolff moved in among them and soon rose above even them, known everywhere for the quality of design and manufacture of his popular-priced books, for the new authors he found, for the artwork he commissioned and then for the art books done by some of his illustrators. In a lifetime of publishing, a mere sample of his authors and artists would include Franz Kafka, Heinrich Mann, Robert Walser, Max Brod, Karl Kraus, Oskar Kokoschka, Franz Werfel, Lou Andreas-Salome, Arnold Zweig, Karel Capek, Frans Masereel, Joseph Roth, Stefan George, Georges Bernanos, Robert Musil, Paul Valery, Werner Heisenberg, Marc Chagall, Giuseppe di Lampedusa, Joy Adamson, Rachel Carson, Boris Pasternak and Gunter Grass. When he started Pantheon Books in his one-room apartment in Greenwich Village in the 1940's, Paul and Mary Mellon entrusted to him the publication of their Bollingen Foundation's series, not only a most diverse and intellectually demanding roster of new books, but one honored everywhere for their beauty. And Wolff took personal responsibility for everything he did. The breadth of his culture is scarcely believable, but there it is.
Since he died in 1963, at 76, little has been printed about him in this country. At last, the University of Chicago Press has gathered essays and letters from two small volumes published in Germany 25 years ago -- some of these essays Wolff wrote for broadcast on German radio -- along with material supplied by Helen Wolff, into a fine volume edited by Michael Ermarth and translated, often with spirit but sometimes with too much caution, by Deborah Lucas Schneider.
Some of the letters in "Kurt Wolff: A Portrait in Essays and Letters" to and from people like Kafka, Hermann Hesse, Pasternak and others are invaluable; Wolff's recollections of his authors are intoxicating. But most impressive is just Wolff -- his engaging voice, learned, unassuming, patrician, warm, good-humored -- and his testimony about how to make good books. There is no training that will make a publisher, he says; but one ought to have taste, literary discernment and a grand passion for the work undertaken, along with the patience of an all-forgiving lover, since, by definition, every creative artist is "unbalanced." His formula is too modest; the emotional and intellectual depth revealed in his writings and the scope of learning disclosed, as in a letter to Pasternak about music and philosophy, teach a great respect for what it takes to make a good publisher.
In practical terms, he thinks no one who is the head of a big company issuing hundreds of titles a year can be a publisher. Such people might know what merchants understand -- glands, feelings, what makes the flesh crawl -- but a publisher must be personally responsible for every page of every book. He must have an informed instinct for typography, design, paper, ink, binding, art -- the whole elusive craft that makes a book a splendid object. He must be possessed by intense passion for the author's work and have a mission to publish what people ought to read. Aristocratic? The adjective would not have bothered him at all.
Wolff would not option future works of his authors; such a practice reeked of peonage. To read his open negotiations with other publishers when an author wanted to change houses is to learn something about candor and decency not often seen in the world of modern publishing. Dr. Johnson said, somewhat ironically, that in the 18th century, by enabling authors to earn a living, publishers -- he knew that even then most were mere merchants and more than a few were very slippery -- had become "the patrons of literature," replacing the princes and lords of the past. Wolff was one of the few in the centuries since who was really princely. This little book is a kind of guide to right conduct for the next aspirant.
There were compensations. To have had the trust of the people who came to him with their work was the greatest of them. His recollections of some are thrilling, troubling, painful. A glimpse of a triumphant Max Brod introducing an exquisitely intimidated Kafka has the beauty and terror of a Goya painting, and one imagines he can hear Kafka telling Wolff: "I will always be more grateful to you for returning my manuscripts than for publishing them." His portrait of his friend Franz Werfel is filled with deep shadows; he captures the uncontrolled literary enthusiasms of the man, his unworldly assumptions about life, his volatility, his egotism and the sometimes treacherous reversals of loyalty that injured his friends and himself. The candor of this essay is as remarkable as Wolff's affection for the man he sees so clearly.
Then there is Lou Andreas-Salome, the bewitching Russian savante who was, as Wolff says, "Nietzsche's fiancee, Freud's pupil and friend, and Rilke's lover." The enchantment that overwhelmed Wolff as she talked sweeps over the reader who, like Wolff, can see before him the fabled figures she conjures up from her past; one raises one's eyes from the page and expects to meet the gaze of Wagner, Tolstoy, Turgenev.
But the best portrait of all is of Karl Kraus, the Viennese critic around whom all of German-speaking Europe divided in camps of what Wolff calls fanatic admirers and fanatic enemies, the second and larger group mostly made up of renegades from the first. The "hypocrisy, baseness and sheer idiocy" he encountered everywhere in print drove Kraus to "apocalyptic creations" that infuriated multitudes, driving them to excessive denunciations that only made them ridiculous. "Kraus invariably held the position of the uncompromising moralist," Wolff says, "leaving [his foes] no line of defense." That eloquent remark calls up the famous Greek definition of tyranny as a fine position because there is no retreat from it.
KRAUS'S intellect defined the age. No one can understand German literature and thought in this century, or the turbulent rise of Central European Jews into the cultural forefront of the Continent, without grappling honestly with his work. Yet, as the profound critical appraisals of Kraus by Walter Benjamin and Erich Heller fade into the archives after 50 years, he is unknown in this country except for occasional vilification. Thus Wolff's humane account is all the more valuable. As a sensitive, imaginative portrayal of how a great intellectual really lives it is as fine a piece of writing as Saul Bellow's presentation of Harold Rosenberg in that lovely long short story "What Kind of Day Did You Have?"
Yet the handling of this essay points out a serious weakness in this book: lack of commentary. The essay, for instance, contains a Kraus poem lampooning Werfel, which, to ridicule cultural pretensions, employs the governing metaphor of a convert to Catholicism who thinks baptism will wash away all his provincialism, including his Yiddish-saturated German. Unexplained, this looks ominous. If the editor had indicated Kraus's own history as a Jew who became a Catholic without ever experiencing religion and then, just in time to annoy the rising Nazis, abandoned both identities; and if he had given some account of the dominant modes of conversation in Vienna early in this century, with all the pugilistic posturing between the imperial capital and Werfel's hometown of Prague, the reader might see these verses for what they are: the rough and tumble of a Dryden or a Swift, not the sinister cruelty we might imagine in hindsight. Also, the translation of the poem, by the venerable Walter Arndt, is literal and thus incomprehensible; a good paraphrase in the diction of Dryden, or of Ira Gershwin, would have made things clear. As Wolff read this on the radio, it would have been understandable to a German audience; here, without notes, it is a muddle. That is only one case, if the most serious, of omission of needed notation. One other that deserves mention is the virtually total failure to identify German publishers Wolff refers to.
In the end, who will not envy such a man or wish that such a publisher might appear again? His life was glorious but tough. The German inflation of the 20's gutted his capital (he preserves the rueful witticism of a Weimar comic who, when, the German mark sank to five billion to the dollar, said "Well, that's about all the dollar is worth"). That mighty fact, combined with Wolff's conclusion, as Helen Wolff says in a biographical introduction, that there was a decline in public taste and "nothing new" to publish, moved Wolff to close down all his enterprises and spend the next 10 years in Italy and France.
When the Nazis engulfed France in 1940, the Wolffs came to New York and founded Pantheon. They were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, the creator of the Editions Pleiade in Paris; and the catalogues of Pantheon Books for a dozen years form a splendid monument to them all. But Kurt Wolff was nothing if not independent, and in 1959, after what Helen Wolff refers to as "disagreements," he left Pantheon, moved to Switzerland and published his last few books under the Wolff imprint.
A difficult man, it is clear enough from his own words -- for all his passion for good writing, his warmth, gentleness and loyalty. Even a reader at a distance can be made uneasy by his clarity, unyielding logic and lofty rules of conduct. But it is all so inspiring. This book has an odd effect. It could fill one with despair over the vulgarity, meanness and sheer ugliness of too many books now. But it doesn't. It brings admiration and gratitude. One wants more. Not biography. What is so fine is Wolff himself. To be talked to in confidence by such a human being lifts the spirit.

HEADLINE: Cultivating Their Own Gardens

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times who covers social welfare policy.

 BODY:
On a Sunday morning not long ago, the woman who is probably the nation's most lauded resident of public housing went on a visit that took her two miles across St. Louis and two decades back in time. Her destination was a mid-rise cluster of apartment buildings on the city's south side, part of the 1.4 million units of public housing overseen by the Government, to virtually no one's satisfaction. The woman threw her rental car into park and clicked her red high heels into the building's lobby, where she found an 11-year-old boy casually knocking holes in the plaster. She seemed to take it personally.
"Why you tearin' that stuff up?" she barked.
The face of the offender leaped with alarm then landed in a look of awe. "You the one with the President!" he said. 
 "Bertha Gilkey," said Bertha Gilkey.
"My momma loves you," he whispered, then ran to fetch her.
Around her, Gilkey surveyed a scene that would have surprised no one familiar with large public housing complexes: walls dizzy with grafitti, floors matted with trash, the stink of urine. It certainly didn't surprise Gilkey, since these are the very conditions that set her on her trajectory as a tenant manager 20 years ago, when she first moved toward wresting control of her housing complex from the St. Louis Public Housing Authority. Before concluding her visit, she kissed the little boy ("Gimme some sugar," she demanded), waved to his mother and, speaking for tenant managers everywhere, repeated a favorite vow. "We won't go back to living like this," she said. "We'd die first."
Bertha Gilkey still lives in public housing, but she doesn't live like that. At Cochran Gardens, one of the nation's oldest experiments in tenant management, she presides over 761 apartments that are noteworthy only in their lack of disarray: they have windows where boards might be, elevators that elevate and halls that mostly stay mopped. The state of big-city public housing is such that enforcing a bit of normalcy has turned Gilkey into a folk hero.
It has also made her a leading, if unlikely, symbol for those trying to promote a new conservative social policy. Jack F. Kemp, the Housing Secretary who serves as the Bush Administration's chief antipoverty planner, commonly cites Gilkey in an honor roll of civil rights heroes, alongside Abraham Lincoln. He argues that tenant management offers "one of the most powerful manifestations of revolutionary ideals since 1776." Last spring, President Bush added to the encomia, traveling to Cochran Gardens to extol tenant control and attack what he represented as its antithesis -- "government bureaucracy" and the "solutions of the 1960's."
Gilkey's Republican admirers say she embodies the virtues of what they call "empowerment." The term, which has become a conservative rallying cry, is a call to circumvent government bureaucracies and give poor people more autonomy -- by allowing them to manage their apartment complexes, for instance, or choose the schools their children attend. After that, discussions of empowerment tend to get vague. But Kemp insists that its principles can be used to recraft the nation's entire social welfare system, freeing the poor from a maze of bureaucratic oppression he likens to that of the old Eastern bloc.
A visit to Cochran Gardens leaves no doubt that tenant management has made that housing complex a better place to live. But a deeper look also suggests some of the contradictions -- and limitations -- of the Administration's antipoverty strategy. For while Gilkey is celebrated as an antidote to the 60's, she might just as easily be portrayed as its apotheosis -- a quick-to-picket black nationalist who knows how to get on the evening news. Though she is often cited as proof of how liberalism has failed, she draws abundantly on its legacy of social services and Federal Government grants. And while some call her work the cutting edge of antipoverty strategy, there is one fact about Cochran Gardens that Administration officials seldom acknowledge: virtually everyone there is still poor. At the heart of the Bush Administration's domestic policies is a program that has produced an average household income of just $4,922.
Administration officials say there are Bertha Gilkeys everywhere, capable of seizing control of their communities. Perhaps -- but it takes little time in the presence of the original Gilkey to feel the imprint of her extraordinary willfulness. This least likely of Republican role models began her career as a Black Panther follower, calls herself a die-hard Democrat and routinely erupts in such coarse verbal explosions that her friends call her "potty mouth." She rules a corner of urban America with a mixture of black nationalist invective, blown kisses and appeals to proper hygiene. Late one recent afternoon, she asked an employee to come in from home and unlock an office door; when the employee refused, Gilkey grabbed a hammer and beat her way inside. She needed all these talents, and more, during a week last fall when the St. Louis murder rate spun out of control and the bullets started bouncing off of Cochran Gardens' walls.
 On the night of Sunday, Sept. 29, four teen-agers from the south side of St. Louis climbed into a gray Oldsmobile Cutlass and headed for Cochran Gardens. Once there, they turned off their car lights, hit the gas and roared into a courtyard, firing into a group of youths. Hearing the shots from her sixth-floor apartment, Amanda Terry dialed 911 and ran downstairs to see what had happened. She found her 18-year-old nephew, Ricardo (Coco) Terry, laying on the ground with a bullet in his chest. For what felt like forever, she knelt beside him, feeling his faint pulse fade away.
By early Monday morning, Bertha Gilkey was in a frenzy. "Ain't nobody gonna stop that gang bangin' but us," she shouted, bursting into the office of another tenant official. The killing had capped several weeks of drive-by shootings between Cochran teen-agers and a group from rival public housing complexes on the south side. While Coco was the first casualty, the feud was part of a larger epidemic that had pushed up the city's murder rate over the previous year by more than 60 percent.
With the killing now in Cochran, Gilkey talked of organizing a citywide response. She wanted jobs from businesses, grants from the Government and help from the churches. Though her colleague nodded assent, Gilkey continued to rant, bouncing around the room like a pinball.
"We need a couple preachers -- who's that big tall dark preacher?" Gilkey said. She threw in a county political aide and christened her creation the Care Group Inc. Announcements of the next day's news conference went out even before the committee conscripts were notified. It was 3:30 P.M. when Gilkey remembered her lunch appointment with the chairman of the St. Louis Housing Authority, and placed an apologetic call, promising to buy next time. "McDonald's," she said mischieviously.
By the time the cameras rolled the next morning, Gilkey's platform had neither gained in specificity nor diminished in passion. She promised, on uncertain authority, to provide "troubled youth" with suspended jail sentences if they came in off the streets. She called for collections at black churches to start businesses like barbershops and extermination companies. "We're gonna teach 'em to kill bugs, not each other," was just one of the day's slogans.
But the ad hoc nature of Gilkey's pronouncements did not put off the local television stations, which elevated them to the top of the evening news. "Gilkey's coalition is very broad-based," a Channel 2 reporter said. To which the anchor responded: "Well she's a doer."
 At age 42, Bertha Knox Gilkey is always in a hurry and usually late. Among the things she spends the least time doing is returning phone calls; it can take months to reach her. After a dozen unanswered calls, an appointment is finally scheduled, for a Saturday afternoon at 4. She finally arrives at 5:15, and accidentally drops a file of the reporter's previous writings. "We wanted to see what you were all about," she says, almost defiantly.
Gilkey pauses, but not for long. "I didn't realize I was raped when I was 3 years old until I watched this movie," she says, as the awkwardness of first meetings gives way to a gusher of autobiography: The second of 14 children born to a sharecropper in Round Pound, Ark. . . . Raped at age 3 by a stepfather. . . . Given away to a grandfather so mean he beat her for eating too much. . . . Watching from the floor as her grandmother threw herself between her head and her grandfather's swinging boot.
"I was always told I was the ugliest," she says. "That I was the dumbest. I was the blackest. That I would never be anything. My sister was much lighter than me, thin lips. I got the thick lips, the orange hair. I got all the beatings."
One story tumbles after another, and Gilkey offers them revival style, pacing the room in stockinged feet, hands above her head. Then, drawing a blank, she brakes in mid-sentence. "It was really deep," she says, and snapping her fingers, asks, "What's your name, again?"
Gilkey arrived in St. Louis in 1960 at age 11, rejoining her mother after her grandfather's death. They soon became one of the first black families to move into Cochran Gardens, which had been built only seven years earlier, within walking distance of downtown. Gilkey still reminisces about the cluster of trim red-brick buildings so tidy the families used to wax the concrete halls. Then in the early 60's, jobless black families began moving in, and working-class whites began moving out. And the more Cochran became a home for the black poor, Gilkey says, the more it was neglected by the Housing Authority.
There isn't much disagreement that by the late 60's Cochran Gardens was a place to avoid. It may never have been as bad as Pruitt-Igoe -- the notorious symbol of public housing failure, 12 blocks west of Cochran, which grew so ungovernable in the 70's that the Housing Authority dynamited and bulldozed it -- but it was headed in the same direction. The local precinct commander still remembers the theft of an 18-wheeler loaded with orange juice. "Everybody in Cochran had Vitamin C," Gilkey says with a laugh.
Taking time out from her anti-crime campaign, Gilkey turns a visit to her mother, Emma Green, into a call-and-response of urban memory.
"Tell 'em bout when the police shot up our building!" Gilkey exclaims. "Found dead bodies in the elevator! And the rats! That big, momma! Tell 'em!"
Green recalls getting caught in a crossfire with two of her children. "I ended up moving. Bertha said, 'Momma, stay in the projects.' "
The word makes Gilkey cringe. "Development, momma," she insists.
But her mother continues, apparently oblivious of her lapse. "I said, 'What you trying to do -- be another Martin Luther King?' And she did it! I came back to the projects----."
"Development, momma."
"-- And it wasn't the same."
Although President Bush used his May visit to Cochran Gardens to criticize the "solutions of the 1960's," the tenant-management movement he advocates happens to be a prime example of them. In fact, tenant control in St. Louis grew out of the kind of racial confrontation that Republicans have profited from politically ever since: a 1969 rent strike. To protest rising rents and deteriorating conditions, public housing residents withheld their checks for nine months. Fearing possible violence, the city replaced its Housing Authority's director and board, and granted tenants new rights to share power, including the right to manage their own properties.
To buttress her argument that public housing agencies are rife with waste, patronage and indifference, Gilkey could scarcely ask for a better illustration than the one in St. Louis, which remains so mismanaged that H.U.D. is now threatening to take it over. Last year the city lost as much as $25 million in Federal rehabilitation funds because the authority had failed to file a complete application. Gilkey contends that such behavior is endemic: not having to live in the communities they manage, she says, the bureaucrats who preside over government housing have little incentive to perform. "The worst tenant management in the country is 90 times better than the Housing Authority," Gilkey says. "The worst!"
At the time of the rent strike, Gilkey was caught up in a different 60's set piece, calling herself a Black Panther and helping to get War on Poverty grants to run day-care centers in public housing. She attended a community college, was married, had two children and was divorced. When Cochran started its experiment with tenant management in 1976, she was elected its unpaid chairman.
Tenant management is itself an imprecise term -- the responsibilities of some groups can be as modest as picking new tenants or cleaning the grounds, while others run the whole show, including accounting and heavy maintenance. At Cochran, the tenants started with few duties and expanded. This year, the Housing Authority will turn over almost the entire $3.2 million it receives in rent and in Federal subsidies. In exchange, the tenant corporation is responsible for running virtually every aspect of life at Cochran, from elevator maintenance to meals for the elderly. For the last 15 years, the tenants have continually re-elected Gilkey as corporation chairman, and she now presides over a five-member board of directors and a paid staff of 47, including repairmen, groundskeepers and clerks. While about half the staff are tenants, this year Gilkey went outside Cochran to meet its growing responsibilities by hiring a professional manager, accountant and engineer.
Gilkey herself still draws no pay from Cochran, but years ago she started a consulting business, work that carries her on a relentless cross-country schedule, teaching other tenants to run their own developments. With an annual income of more than $30,000 -- her training sessions are paid for by government and foundation grants -- Gilkey must pay $786 a month to live in a three-bedroom apartment next to neighbors whose rent is as low as $19 a month. For the same money, she could be paying the mortgage on a nice house in suburban St. Louis. "Bertha has more integrity than anyone I ever met in public life," says Michael Jones, a former Housing Authority director whom Gilkey once picketed.
Among the things that distinguishes Cochran Gardens from other developments is Gilkey's remarkable talent for attracting public funds. In part this stems from simple perseverance. But Cochran also enjoys a downtown location that has made it impossible for urban planners to ignore, sitting just one block north of the Civic Center that anchors downtown redevelopment. As a result, there has been a deluge of funds not just for Cochran but also for the surrounding area. "Move it 10 blocks north," Jones says, "and you'd have had a whole different history."
Since 1978, all 12 of Cochran's original buildings have undergone expensive modernizations, which outfitted them with new roofs, elevators, boilers, appliances and floors. In all, Cochran has received more than $33 million in renovation grants, according to Federal housing officials, while the second-ranking St. Louis complex has so far gotten $15 million.
The complex is also chockablock with social services. A partial list includes a day-care center, a health clinic, a community recreational center, a Meals-on-Wheels program and a reverse-commute bus to transport job seekers to the suburbs. Thanks to Gilkey's influence, residents get a double benefit -- receiving both the services and some of the jobs that go along with providing them. When the city threatened to take the meals contract away from Gilkey's tenant affairs board and give it to a private vendor, she went to her political allies and had her lawyer appointed welfare director. She kept the contract.
Money has been important, but Cochran couldn't have made it by money alone. At least one other St. Louis site has undergone extensive renovations, only to wind up with more arson and grafitti than the set of "New Jack City." "The secret," Gilkey likes to say, "is not fixin' up the buildings without fixin' up the people first."
Part Angela Davis, she is also part Shirley Booth as Hazel, endlessly nagging her neighbors to take out the trash and make their beds. Standing before a group of tenants, she still gets spitting mad at the theory that high-rise architecture leads to anomie in the residents and urine in the halls. "White folks didn't do that when they were in the buildings," she says. She brings good news: Cochran qualifies for new Venetian blinds. But "poor housekeepers ain't getting no window blinds," she says. "They got to go through a housekeeping course."
 Walking down the street after two weeks on the road, Gilkey projects the image of a La Guardia in high heels, an all-purpose ward heeler dispensing threats, cold remedies, beauty tips, kisses and jobs. Leaving her fourth-floor apartment, filled with with plaques honoring her achievements, she warns a teen-ager to get to school and tells a neighbor to try Alka-Seltzer Plus. "I luhvvv you, Ms. Bohannon," she calls to a neighbor. "I luhvvv you, Ms. Jones." When a new tenant approaches looking for a job, Gilkey scribbles the phone number of an assistant who hires home health aides. "You got to really like working with the elderly," she says in a scolding voice. Then she sweetens. "Gimme some sugar," she says, leaning forward for a kiss. "I luhvvv you."
Gilkey's will is worked through a small but devoted group of female lieutenants, some of whom she has known since she was a teen-ager. For women like Vera Richie, 57, Cochran Gardens is both a profession and a never-ending pastime. By day, Richie works a paying job at Cochran, earning $6.19 an hour on a maintenance crew. After hours, she works as a building captain, getting a $75 monthly stipend to promote physical and social order. She also sells soft drinks out of her home to raise money for the building's cleaning supplies, and the last thing she does each night -- often at 1 A.M. -- is mop the halls throughout her six-story building. Richie's husband would like to move into private housing, but she refuses to go as long as Gilkey is in charge. "If she moves, then I am moving out," Richie says.
The average Cochran resident, however, views Gilkey's cause from a much greater distance. In the three years she's lived in the development, Jackie Goliday, 28, has never been to a tenant meeting. Living in a $31-a-month apartment with her three children, she disagrees with the assessment of most tenants that, as public housing goes, Cochran is a prize. She says the neighborhood is unsafe, maintenance is slow, and last winter her heat didn't work. While Goliday has never met Gilkey, she has seen her on television often, and does not hold her responsible for Cochran's shortcomings. "I think she's all right," Goliday says. "She seems like she's for Cochran."
Gilkey sometimes does seem to be confronting inner-city forces as powerful as tides, armed with little more than a broom. The file cabinets in Cochran's security office are filled with bland, almost detached accounts of urban chaos: apartments converted into crack houses; guns discharged from apartment windows; a late-night assault with a butcher knife. Several days after Coco Terry's death, security guards found a sawed-off shotgun and a loaded machine gun buried in the bushes beneath Vera Richie's well-mopped halls.
It is Gilkey's determination to stave off these forces that makes Cochran distinctive -- not her front-office efficiency. Citywide, the Housing Authority had a 1990 vacancy rate of nearly 25 percent, one that Federal officials called too high. At Cochran it was no better.
When talking about social control, Gilkey likes to emphasize how ruthless she is about evictions. She tells the story of Frances Gibbs, an early leader in the drive for tenant management who also happened to be her mother's best friend. Gilkey says she evicted Gibbs because several of her children were "carrying weapons" and "shooting dope," -- and was uninhibited by the fact that Gibbs was dying of cancer.
When this improbable story was checked with Gilkey's mother, she not only confirmed it, but offered another -- the eviction of Gilkey's favorite brother. First Gilkey had called the police to tell them her brother was selling marijuana. Then, while he was serving his sentence, she evicted his wife. "It wasn't personal," Gilkey says. "They knew the rules."
 Shootouts, evictions, jail sentences for her own brother -- this is the stuff legends are made of, and in Washington, the legend is now being burnished. Its truest believer is Jack Kemp, a Cabinet-level comrade who shares Gilkey's ebullience. While only 25 of the nation's 11,000 public housing developments are currently run, at least in part, by tenants, Kemp has increased the number of groups in training for self-management from about a dozen to more than 200. And he has lavished public attention on leaders like Gilkey and her ally Kimi Gray, who runs a Washington complex called Kenilworth-Parkside in similarly authoritarian style.
Kemp argues that tenant management has the power not only to transform housing but also to unleash a revolution in spirit -- one that will invigorate poor people to excel in school, seek jobs and start businesses. "Bertha Gilkey is living testimony to the idea that when people have access to power and control over their own lives -- and some assets to go with it -- that changes attitudes, alters behavior," Kemp said in an interview. "And it is a better answer than simply maintaining them on the Government, liberal plantation."
But the distinction between the old-style solutions Kemp attacks, and the new ones he proposes, may not be as great as he suggests. When today's conservatives attack "the 60's," they are really talking about two very different sets of programs -- and Cochran happens to be the product of both.
Part of what Kemp conjures when he talks about "the Government, liberal plantation" are traditional social programs. But the fact is, Cochran is awash in them. It is as easy to imagine Lyndon Johnson coming to Cochran to praise the Great Society as it is George Bush coming to bury it. Even Kemp's own tenure at H.U.D. has been marked by support for more social services in public housing. Away from the podiums, Kemp says as much. "Here's a President -- no matter his rhetoric," he says, searching for the right words. "We all agree, Head Start is a great program. This isn't throwing the baby out with the bath water."
The second 60's strategy on display at Cochran is community organizing, a technique straight out of the War on Poverty. Far from entombing this legacy of its most dreaded era, the Administration seems to be resurrecting it. As a community organizer in the 60's, Gilkey got Federal grants to help public housing residents set up day-care centers; as a community organizer in the 90's, she gets Federal grants to help public housing residents set up tenant-mangement groups. In both cases, the idea is for the Federal Government to bypass bureaucracies, find authentic community leaders and help them wrest what they need from the system. In both cases, the strategy is called "empowerment." In its promotion of Gilkey, the Bush Administration appears to be playing an ideological game of Twister: pointing to a 60's success story to argue that 60's solutions don't work, even while adopting them.
Of course, the big question isn't whether Cochran is 60's or anti-60's, but whether it offers a role model the rest of the country can follow. But what if the real secret of Cochran's success is simply that it has a dynamic individual in charge? What happens to a neighborhood without a Bertha Gilkey?
Kemp pounces on the charisma question. "There are millions like her," he insists. Among the appeals of this argument is that it allows conservatives like Kemp to attack liberal critics for embracing "the idea that just because somebody is poor they're going to be poor in perpetuity."
Of course, poor people do often advance, but the problem is that they usually end up fleeing public housing in the process. In Gilkey's case, her mother, brothers, sisters, ex-husband and children have all left, most of them begging her to do the same. It is often residents' ability to get away from the neighborhood -- by joining the Army, say, or going away to school -- that is key to their success. Upward mobility has already undermined one St. Louis experiment in tenant management: when the first tenant manager of Darst-Webbe Apartments moved out, no similarly strong leader could be found to replace her, and the experiment fell apart.
However many "Bertha Gilkeys" Gilkey herself says are out there, she makes it clear that there is only one in Cochran Gardens. (Few Cochran residents have even bothered to challenge Gilkey in board elections.) When one board member suggested an agenda change at a recent meeting, Gilkey spat out, "I'm the chairman, not you." As Cochran's new accountant presented a droning recitation of the development's finances, Gilkey alone sprang into a table-thumping fit at the sight of a footnote that she said could harm pending litigation. Change it, she demanded, and he did.
 With the Bush administration selling tenant management as an antipoverty program, perhaps the biggest question about Cochran is this: Why hasn't it ended more poverty?
Despite Gilkey's sideline as a one-woman employment agency, only 27 percent of Cochran's household heads have jobs. Forty percent are receiving welfare and twice that are getting some kind of government benefit. Eighty-five percent of the households are headed by single women. Gilkey says the figures, which came from the Housing Authority last September, leave out significant amounts of under-the-table income. Even so, a family of three would have to earn more than twice Cochran's average annual income of $4,922 in order to be above the poverty line.
Tenant management is part of an antipoverty vision that assumes the ghettos can be healed from within. But one problem that even the ablest tenant managers, like those at Cochran, have difficulty overcoming is the destructive effects of having so many poor people living in close proximity to one another. Joblessness, educational failure and gang activity can become norms. Gilkey shares the concern. "It's much better when you get the mix -- economic and racial," she says. "Everybody cannot not be employed."
Arguing that the revolution is only half-complete, Kemp calls for tax cuts to encourage businesses to locate in inner-city enterprise zones. But Cochran is already in an enterprise zone -- one called downtown St. Louis. If it were any closer, it'd be inside the convention center itself. Even in a recession, Cochran's reverse-commute program offers more housekeeping jobs at suburban hotels than it can fill. Of every 10 Cochran residents who start a job, according to the program's director, only one lasts 60 days.
Pressed, Kemp resorts to the argument that income isn't a good measure of poverty. "With all due respect, I think that's a very cynical way to look at it," he said. "The community is safer, the units are cleaner, there's a lot more hope and a lot more pride."
 The obituary printed in Coco's funeral program was terse. He liked basketball and video games, spent time in a children's home and attended high school, where he was a "participant in various activities." In the front rows, women in fancy dresses shrieked and swooned. In the back, teen-age men sat passively, dressed alike in sunglasses and hooded blue sweatshirts that said "Cochran Cripz." The ferocious female grief did not register on their granite faces.
A week after Coco's death, Amanda Terry, the aunt who'd raised him, answered her door shakily at 11 A.M., steadying herself with a cigarette and a Pepsi. For about 30 minutes, she tried to describe what had made him special, but the words failed her, and she trailed off into ambiguous shrugs. Just as a reporter was about to leave, however, she produced a spiral notebook full of words for Coco. "I can't stop crying," she had written. "I love you, Coco." She told her nephew: "It's like someone snatched my heart out and held it under water. I can't breathe."
On the night after Coco's funeral, Gilkey's one-week-old campaign to prevent more teen-age bloodshed was about to bear its first fruit: a street patrol of black men, led by Black Muslims, that promised to march regularly through the city's most violent blocks. An air of expectancy surrounded the evening, as the recruits filed into the Cochran Community Center. Upstairs, a black nationalist revival was under way, with Anthony Shaheed, the Muslims' leader, imploring the group to behave not "like grocery clerks or shuffling Negroes, but real black men." Gilkey, who also addressed the crowd, turned ecstatic in her declarations that these blacks would kowtow to no one.
"I don't shuffle!" Gilkey shouted, as everyone filed out.
"I don't buck dance!" Shaheed answered.
"We gonna make 'em be African," Gilkey said over and over. "Ain't but one gang -- that's called Africa!"
In the wake of the rally, the march itself seemed anticlimatic. It was past 11 P.M. when three buses carrying about 70 young black men finally came to a halt in a forlorn section of north St. Louis. "Hey-hey, ho-ho, all you crack heads got to go," the marchers chanted for about 30 minutes, as they moved double-file in the streets. Then they went door-to-door, passing out leaflets that promised jobs and listed Gilkey's work number. Dogs barked, porch lights awoke and a passing teen-ager taunted: "Crip to the heart, cuz."
In the midnight shadows on a mean St. Louis street, Gilkey's campaign seemed to have accomplished little. But in between the news conferences and pep rallies, missed appointments and nationalist reveries, something quietly got done: Gilkey helped the police catch Coco's killer.
She had known whom the shooters were really trying to kill, and so did the police, but they couldn't find him. After several days of searching, the police called Gilkey. She called back in an hour and said come get him. The teen-ager led the police to other witnesses, and an arrest followed the next day.
Detective Harvey Foster put it this way: "I contacted Bertha. She contacted him. At which time, he surrendered his body."
It's no surprise to learn that Gilkey states the case more forcefully. "We got a truce, and we got the murderer," she said. "The whole police department ain't been able to do that."

HEADLINE: REACHING FOR THE GOOD LIFE IN VIETNAM

BYLINE: BY PHILIP SHENON; Philip Shenon is chief of the Bangkok bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Lam Van lives the Vietnamese good life selling shiny new Dreams. Honda Dreams -- 8.5-horsepower, $2,000 motorbikes manufactured in Thailand -- are the most coveted status symbol on the streets of Saigon, the bustling, hustling Vietnamese metropolis that almost no one calls by its still-official name, Ho Chi Minh City.
"Everyone calls it Saigon," says Van, who owns a small motorbike shop. "We never stopped calling it Saigon." Business has been so good that the 31-year-old entrepreneur can afford to smoke black-market English-made John Player cigarettes, wear a gold Longines watch and join his friends most nights at the city's neon-flooded Superstar disco, where he rocks to bootleg recordings from Guns 'n' Roses and Madonna, his "No. 1 favorite" recording star. 
 North Vietnamese troops overran Saigon in 1975, humiliating the United States just as they had humiliated France two decades earlier. But if the North won the Vietnam War, it is the South that is finally winning the peace. The old men who run the Vietnamese Communist Party, most of them dour Northerners, still hold tightly to power. But it is the freewheeling Southern spirit -- one that is pro-Western and avidly capitalistic -- that is taking hold in the North and South, city and countryside, and transforming a nation of 66 million people.
The city of Vinh, 600 miles north of Saigon, is the Vietnamese Dresden, leveled by American B-52 bombers during the war and rebuilt by the East Germans in the late 1970's. The city's nondescript five-story apartment buildings, representing the worst of East Bloc architecture and construction, were a gift from the regime of Erich Honecker.
Vinh is cursed by location (as one of the southernmost major cities in North Vietnam, it was a natural target for American bombers) and by red gritty soil and typhoons that make agriculture a perennial gamble. It is the capital of Nghe Tinh, one of the poorest provinces of Vietnam and, perhaps because of its endemic poverty, the birthplace of several of the nation's best-known revolutionaries. Ho Chi Minh, the legendary North Vietnamese leader, was born 101 years ago in a thatch-roof hut a few miles northwest of Vinh. Even today, running water and electricity are a dream to most farm families in the province, and malaria has reached epidemic proportions.
Yet even in Vinh, a city that sacrificed as much as any to unify Vietnam as a Communist state, the concept of free markets has begun to take root under the five-year-old policy known as doi moi, or "renovation." It is the Vietnamese version of perestroika.
"Renovation has been good for us, all of us," says Huang Thi Xuan, who runs a pharmacy in the city's cacophonous market, a dingy, warehouselike building in which vendors gather each morning at dawn to sell clothing, household goods and food from long rows of stalls. Perched on a tall wooden stool in front of shelves stocked with medicines -- everything from modern antibiotics to the herbal tonics still preferred by many older customers -- Xuan says that before doi moi there were only 3 pharmacies in the market; now, there are 20.
"There is much more selection for the customers," she says, offering a customer a whiff of (noxious) deer antler powder, said by the Vietnamese to improve male potency. "People have much more money. We still need more customers if we are to prosper, but it is clear that our lives have improved."
Doi moi has encouraged the creation of private businesses, provided one of the most liberal foreign investment codes in Asia, ended price controls on major commodities and forced the devaluation of the Vietnamese currency, the dong, to bring it closer to its black-market exchange rate. American dollars and gold can now be traded legally. In its most recent annual report, the World Bank described doi moi as "dramatic" and "far-reaching" and said the reforms had created a "fast-growing but still small-scale private sector."
Unveiled by the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1986, doi moi was the brainchild of then-Party Secretary Nguyen Van Linh, a Northerner who spent much of his adult life as a Vietcong guerrilla leader in the South. Linh began experimenting with free-market reforms while he was the party chief of Saigon in the early 1980's. Although his efforts in the South earned Linh the enmity of party functionaries in Hanoi who believed that Vietnam should operate under a single collective economic system (Linh was booted out of the Politburo for a time), he was the architect of the boom that is now centered in Saigon.
When Linh stepped down last summer because of ill health, the post of Party Secretary went to Prime Minister Do Muoi, 74, an affable Northerner and a supporter of renovation. The more important news of the summer was that Vo Van Kiet, a 68-year-old Southerner and one of Linh's closest allies, became Prime Minister.
Vietnam today is not the unrelievedly grim and gray country of the mid-1980's, but neither is it like Thailand or Taiwan or the other economic tigers of Southeast Asia. Vietnam is still among the poorest nations on earth, in large part because of the American trade embargo that has been in place since April 30, 1975, when the last American troops evacuated from Saigon. The embargo has isolated the country economically, cutting Hanoi off from international development aid -- specifically that of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- and keeping away billions of dollars in foreign investment. The per capita income is estimated at $195 a year (53 cents a day). Malnutrition and disease are widespread.
Vietnam's economic troubles have been worsened by the cutoff of more than $1 billion a year in aid from the former Soviet Union, long Vietnam's closest ally. Although official figures are unreliable, the unemployment rate is believed to be as high as 20 percent. In the first three quarters of 1991, inflation ran as high as 7 percent a month, or nearly 125 percent a year.
Life for some has improved, but the suffering for large numbers of Vietnamese continues. Last year, more than 20,000 left the country without official sanction, many in rickety boats in search of a better life elsewhere. The exodus appears to be ending, however, the result of an agreement between Vietnam and the British authorities in Hong Kong (where the vast majority of the boat people have landed), allowing the forcible repatriation of Vietnamese found to have left for economic, not political, reasons. Other nations sheltering the refugees are expected to seek similar agreements with Hanoi. In May, 165 boat people arrived in Hong Kong each day; in all of November, there were 7.
The economic development of Vietnam is likely to receive a jump start soon from an unexpected quarter, the United States. With Vietnam actively assisting in ending the Cambodian civil war and in uncovering the fate of American soldiers missing from the Vietnam War -- two of the conditions set by the Bush Administration before it would restore normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam -- Washington has opened talks with Hanoi. American officials are also saying that the United States embargo could be lifted within several months.
Although a lifting of the embargo would be a great boost to the Vietnamese economy, the arrival of American and other Western capitalists would still pose a threat to Vietnam's leaders. They would be confronted anew with the question that has long bedeviled Hanoi: Can Vietnam abandon Marxist economic theory without loosening the tight social control that has always characterized Marxist regimes?
 Thai Airways flight 680 from Bangkok to Saigon is jammed, as it is almost every day, with business people seeking to cash in on what may be the last great opportunity in Southeast Asia.
George Brown, who was born Choi Chung 51 years ago in what is now South Korea and who adopted a Western name after immigrating to Australia in the 1970's, is returning to make a new life in Saigon.
"Vietnam is my second country," says Brown, who first lived in Saigon in the 1960's as a saxophonist in a Korean jazz group performing in clubs frequented by American troops. "I like Vietnamese food. I like Vietnamese women." Brown left Vietnam in 1974 for Sydney when it appeared that the war, and with it the opportunity to find work, was winding down. He returned to Saigon for the first time in 1988, just as Vietnam was beginning to welcome foreign investment, "and I cried to see so much poverty" he recalls. "The buildings had crumbled. Everything looked dead."
Last May, Brown returned again to Saigon, and he says, "this time, you could see a change in the people's eyes. People had hope again." Brown says he is convinced he will turn a large profit almost overnight from a Saigon restaurant he intends to buy from its Vietnamese owners. "There is so much opportunity in Saigon," he says, as the Thai jet makes its approach to Saigon over lush green rice paddies on the outskirts of the city. "You want to do anything, you can do it in Vietnam."
Through September of last year, the Vietnamese Government approved 98 foreign investment projects in Vietnam worth $974 million, compared with 109 projects worth $592 million in all of 1990. The figures do not include the many deals made by foreign investors outside Government channels.
"I think for every dollar that comes in officially, there are two or three others finding some other way into Saigon," says John Brinsden, who represents Britain's Standard Chartered Bank in Saigon. "People are arriving in this city each week with hundreds of thousands of dollars in their briefcases. And the investors coming to Vietnam now are solid people, with a record in business."
Most days, the slow-moving immigration line at Tan Son Nhut International Airport in Saigon is a stream of red, the color of the Japanese passports held by dozens of pin-striped businessmen from Tokyo and Osaka. There are also businessmen from Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and France.
Liberalized foreign investment laws aren't the only attraction. Vietnam has abundant natural resources, especially oil, and it boasts a labor force that is industrious, well educated and absurdly cheap. Young, college-educated Vietnamese are often paid less than $50 a month.
Along the road from the airport into downtown Saigon, there are billboard advertisements for foreign companies announcing their presence in the city: Sony, JVC, Nissan, Ricoh, Ogilvy & Mather, Agfa. The ads also serve as a reminder that nearly two-thirds of all foreign investment in Vietnam is going to projects in the South, not only because of its less outdated infrastructure (the result of 20 years of American military presence), but also because of the perception that the Southerners, with their capitalist roots, are better business people.
Last year, Japan replaced the Soviet Union as Vietnam's largest trading partner, and the Japanese already buy 80 percent of Vietnam's crude-oil output. Japanese firms have opened scores of trading offices in Saigon and, for the better part of a decade, have been scouting out business and Government contacts. When the American trade embargo is lifted, Japanese investment is expected to explode. "It may soon be too late for American investors," says Ninh Van Mien, senior manager of the Hanoi Electronic Corporation, which manufactures Japanese JVC-brand television sets at a newly built factory in the Vietnamese capital. "The Japanese have been in Vietnam for years, and it may be difficult for the Americans to catch up unless they come to Vietnam soon. In Vietnam we have a saying: the buffalo that is too slow to reach the watering hole must drink from the muddy water."
 Every foreigner eager to do business with the Vietnamese faces formidable hurdles. There is the bloated bureaucracy that, foreign investors say, is among the most maddening and sclerotic in the developing world. It can take up to six months for a foreign investor to get approval to open a simple business office in Saigon, longer still to hire Vietnamese employees through the Government employment office and to obtain adequate electricity and telephones.
The transport infrastructure outside the nation's major cities is all but nonexistent after decades of neglect (only about 10 percent of Vietnam's roads are paved), and it is virtually impossible to arrange the quick movement of goods or people around the country.
Because the American embargo bars the sale to Vietnam of commercial jetliners built with American technology, the Vietnamese national airline -- Hang Khong Vietnam, known among justifiably nervous foreign fliers as Hang On, Vietnam -- must make do with a fleet of Soviet planes so antiquated that even Soviet diplomats are reluctant to fly in them. Some Western diplomats and relief workers avoid Hang Khong entirely and add hours to the trip from Hanoi to Saigon by flying via Bangkok, using the Thai airline.
Within Vietnam, air and rail tickets must be written out by hand. Computers and word processors are a rarity, and foreign business people often complain of writer's cramp from filling out countless Government forms and questionnaires.
Most infuriating about doing business in Vietnam, investors say, is the ignorance of Government officials of basic business practices. Many bureaucrats do not seem to understand the concept of contracts, says Peter Cappelluti, an Australian who is the Saigon manager of Independent Seafoods, a West Australian shrimp-farming and vegetable-processing firm that was an early investor in Vietnam.
In 1989, Independent Seafoods had a contract with a Vietnamese coffee distributor to purchase 750 tons of coffee for resale to an English buyer. "We bought the coffee," Cappelluti recalls, "we signed contracts, we agreed to a price, and when it came time to ship the coffee, it was gone. They had sold it to someone else for a better price, and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it."
Foreign investors and Vietnamese business people alike complain that they are often caught in turf battles between the local and central governments, and between different agencies within the central Government -- each offering a different interpretation of Vietnamese laws and regulations, each seeking to take its own cut of a lucrative investment contract.
Last fall, an official newspaper reported that corruption involving senior officials had cost Vietnam more than $2 billion since 1989, and that more than 10,000 government and business officials -- including seven deputy ministers and hundreds of company and factory managers -- had recently been disciplined for corruption.
According to Do Duc Dinh of the World Economy Institute, a Hanoi think tank, corruption is "a huge problem, and we have discovered and punished some of the corrupt people, but there are many, many more." The clearest evidence of corruption, he adds, is in the vast selection of foreign goods in stores in Hanoi and Saigon. Government accounts say black-market merchandise is allowed in by officials bribed to look the other way or who themselves moonlight as smugglers. "Foreign cigarettes are banned for sale in Vietnam," says Dinh, "and yet you buy them everywhere. The Government must try to control this."
In 1989, the Government created the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment to encourage and to simplify the procedures for foreign investment. Although the committee has some authority to cut through red tape for foreign investors, Vietnamese officials concede that much more needs to be done.
"We're trying to make changes quickly," says Nguyen Mai, the committee's vice chairman and one of the few Government officials in Hanoi who wears a Western-style suit and tie to work every morning -- signs of his commitment, he says, to Westerners who wish to invest in Vietnam. "Teaching our officials about the principles of doi moi is like a foot race, and some of our officials are learning to run much faster than the others."
 Whether "the others" can be made to run faster depends a lot on how the Communist leadership adapts itself to a rapidly changing world. Even as Communism self-destructs elsewhere, the Communist Party of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam retains largely unchallenged control over the Government and economic policy, and its influence extends throughout the military and the educational system. As of 1990, the party had about two million members, and government bureaucrats at virtually all levels and in all parts of the country must be members of the party or must have demonstrated unquestioning loyalty to its policies.
To question the system is to risk imprisonment, or worse. The details may never be known with certainty, but as told by diplomats who have heard the unofficial accounts, a daring young Hanoi woman pedaled her bicycle slowly through the streets of the Vietnamese capital one morning last spring. The bicycle turned onto a street of grand ochre-colored French-built colonial villas, the homes of some of the country's senior military leaders, and into the mailbox outside each house she dropped a handbill calling for the overthrow of the Communist regime. The "bicycle rider," as she has been dubbed in diplomatic circles, was caught by the police and is said to be awaiting trial on charges of "hooliganism."
Although the Government tolerates some dissent from a handful of intellectuals, dozens of others -- prominent academics, theologians and journalists -- have been imprisoned. Scores of former officials of the old South Vietnamese regime are believed to be held in hard-labor "re-education camps."
In November, a court in Saigon imposed a sentence of 20 years at hard labor on Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, an endocrinologist who was Amnesty International's first member in Vietnam, for "subversive activities against the people's power." He was accused, in effect, of libeling the Communist Party.
Yet there may be reason to hope for improvement in the area of human rights -- a result of Vietnam's desire to polish its image for the benefit of foreign investors and potential aid donors. A week before Que's sentencing, Government prosecutors dropped criminal charges against one of the nation's most popular writers, Doung Thu Huong, who was arrested last spring for attempting to send abroad writings critical of the Government. In a letter to friends that was widely circulated in Hanoi last year, she wrote that the millions of Vietnamese who gave their lives for the nation's independence "did not do so in order to have a country like this."
Last month, Western diplomats in Hanoi reported that Vietnam would soon allow investigators from the International Committee of the Red Cross to go into those re-education camps where political prisoners have been held since the end of the war, a significant human rights advance. There were also reports that scores of inmates would soon be freed and allowed to immigrate to the West, apparently as a concession to the United States.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union has horrified Vietnamese leaders, pushing them to do what only a few years ago would have been unthinkable -- embrace their traditional enemy, China. Last year, Hanoi announced it would restore full diplomatic relations with Beijing after decades of hostility and sporadic warfare. Some Vietnamese officials have even begun citing China as an example of a nation that has successfully promoted free enterprise while holding on to a hardline political stance. They see serious flaws in the Chinese model, including rampant corruption and mounting public anger against Beijing's septuagenarian leaders, but the Chinese economy is booming, its gross national product up 6 percent in the first three quarters of 1991, an advance credited entirely to the private sector.
Other Vietnamese Communists dismiss the Chinese model entirely (the 1989 democracy movement in China proved its dangers, they say) and are far more interested in following the examples offered by affluent Asian neighbors like Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, which developed powerful economies under authoritarian, albeit non-Communist, rule.
Some Western and Asian diplomats in Hanoi believe that because the Communist Party led and won the battle to reunify the nation, the party retains a legitimacy in Vietnam that it lacks elsewhere, and that it could hang on for years. Others say change will come faster.
"I think there will be substantial political reform in Vietnam much sooner than in China," says a senior European diplomat in Hanoi. "The Vietnamese have a longer history of dealing with outsiders -- so much of their history has been spent under occupation -- and they are instinctively less wary of change."
A comparison is being drawn to Vietnam's troubled neighbor Cambodia. The Vietnamese-installed leaders of the former Cambodian Communist Party, now known as the People's Party, have released hundreds of political prisoners, allowed the formation of a limited multiparty system and removed virtually all controls on the marketplace. Despite recent anti-Government riots in the streets of Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, diplomats say the People's Party is likely to continue to dominate the Government even if free, internationally supervised elections are held next year under terms of the United Nations-sponsored peace treaty.
 Whatever path the Vietnamese decide to take, that decision will have to be made in Hanoi. The capital is a storybook vision of Asia, its quiet streets lined with tall, gently swaying tamarind trees that give it a slow-paced innocence entirely missing from Saigon. The air is scented by the inviting aroma of the noodle-and-beef soup called pho, sold from large steel pots at open-air street stands, and by the yeasty smell of freshly baked baguettes, the great contribution of France, Vietnam's former colonizer.
There is almost nothing to remind a visitor that Hanoi was for much of this century a city at war -- nothing, that is, except for the charred wreckage of an American F-111 fighter on display at the Vietnamese Army Museum and the air-raid siren that blares across the city each day at noon as a reminder of the need for Vietnamese vigilance. Hanoi is under the spell of the free-market reforms born in the South, and the results can be seen everywhere in the city, although they are displayed without Saigon's hard-edged glitz.
Only three years ago, stores in Hanoi were largely empty of the apparel and toys and electronic goods that people wanted, and most of the state-run shops and restaurants closed early, leaving the streets deserted after dark. Now the city's street markets are bursting with goods. The newly opened, privately owned restaurants compete with one another by staying open late into the evening, and Hanoi's most popular bars and dance halls are those with Japanese-brand video players to show the latest kung fu films smuggled in from Hong Kong.
Doi moi has also come to the northern countryside. The farmers of the Daton agricultural cooperative, 10 miles from the capital, have filled in most of the bomb craters left behind by American B-52's. For years, the farmers used the craters as fishponds or as watering holes for livestock, but no more.
"The land is too valuable now," says Tran Van Hanh, the cooperative's 34-year-old vice chairman, sitting in a musty meeting room decorated with a large, faded portrait of Ho Chi Minh. "We have filled in the craters so we can use the land for growing crops and making money."
Daton's farmers and tens of millions of other Vietnamese farmers have been freed under doi moi to pursue their version of prosperity. Before free-market farming was widely introduced in the late 1980's, Vietnam experienced near famine after a series of poor rice harvests. In major cities, frightened shoppers began queueing up well before dawn to receive their quota of subsidized rice. Yet by 1989, with the reforms in place, the country could feed its people and have enough left over to become the world's third-largest rice exporter.
Under doi moi, farmers have been provided with incentives to work their land privately and to raise new crops and livestock. Quotas have been lifted on the amount of the harvest that must be sent to the Government. Price controls on rice and other crops have been removed. The size of the rice harvest at the Daton cooperative has nearly doubled since the early 1980's; many farmers, responding to the new incentives, now plant three crops a year instead of two and tend the rice more carefully.
The Daton cooperative's chairman, Le Van Bui, a representative on Vietnam's 496-member National Assembly and a member of the Communist Party, has begun raising silkworms and pigs, in addition to rice, and he says that many of his neighbors have found themselves suddenly able to build new homes and to buy motorbikes and other once-forbidden luxuries.
The cooperative's farmers no longer talk in terms of the amount of rice they need to grow to feed their families. Instead, they discuss the number of pigs that must be raised in order to buy a television set. (Three pigs raised to slaughter equals one new television.)
"Because of doi moi, many farmers are growing rich," Bui says. "I do not think we can go back to the old system. Now, I don't care if you want to call this system Communism or capitalism, just so long as the people are getting rich."
 Vietnam's new obsession with making money goes hand in hand with its obsession for all things American. It is rare for an American visitor to encounter rancor, even in the North, where virtually every family lost someone in the war. Instead, there is a fascination among the Vietnamese about what the former enemy is really like.
North Vietnamese television opened a recent Sunday evening broadcast with the show "Learning English," followed by the television series "Highway to Heaven," dubbed in Vietnamese and starring the late Michael Landon, who has something of a cult following in Vietnam.
At Hanoi University -- the university of choice both for the North's most gifted students and the offspring of the nation's most powerful leaders -- a large sign in the overgrown courtyard reads "Do as Uncle Ho Would Do." It is unlikely, however, that Uncle Ho would have chosen the music heard in the hallway early one morning from a Japanese-made tape player: "Hound Dog" by Elvis Presley, who is almost as popular here as his Vietnamese counterpart, Elvis Phuong.
In one classroom, a group of fourth-year English students reading Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" struggle with the concept that American capitalism might have contributed to Willy Loman's doom. They find the play confusing and difficult to follow.
Asked to name their role models and favorite entertainers, the students respond with Clark Gable, Elizabeth Taylor and Julia Roberts. "Pretty Woman," which starred Roberts, was shown on Vietnamese television earlier this year. The students say they get their news from Vietnamese-language shortwave broadcasts by the Voice of America and the BBC. As to career plans, they would like to go into business or journalism. No one mentions joining the Communist Party.
Their teacher, Peter B. Zinoman, a 26-year-old American from Washington who is a doctoral candidate in Asian history at Cornell University, says he has trouble believing that his students are telling an American visitor the full truth. "I think they're saying what they think an American wants to hear," he says, noting that membership in the Communist Party is still the route to power in Vietnam "and they all want to be part of that."
Yet Zinoman, who has been in Vietnam for more than a year as a volunteer teacher, says he has been struck by how the spirit of capitalism and the hunger for prosperity born in the South has taken hold in Hanoi, and how these students have been swept up in it.
For Zinoman's students, as it is for many Vietnamese, the long war against the United States and the equally long animosity between the North and the South belong to the past. In Saigon, the city that was forced to sacrifice even its name to the memory of Ho Chi Minh, there is remarkably little bitterness directed toward the man, even among those who lost parents or children in battles with his armies from the North.
As he shines the chrome grill of one of the Honda Dreams at his motorbike shop, Lam Van says that even though his beloved eldest brother died as a soldier defending the Saigon regime, he harbors no bitterness.
"Why should I hate Ho?" he says. "It is time to forget hatred. We all want to forget the war and to live better lives -- more happiness, money, more motorbikes, too -- and we want the Americans to come back to help us to accomplish that." He grins as he points to another of the Honda motorbikes whizzing by outside his shop. Dreams, he says, are filling the streets of Saigon.

Amid Recession, a Recovery for Shelton

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
TWO years ago, the vacancy rate for Shelton's six million square feet of office and industrial buildings was 37 percent, the highest in Fairfield County.
This was a result of a building spree that began in the late 70's, when the city courted developers in an effort to shed its smokestack image and create a more viable economy. Hundreds of thousands of square feet of new commercial space came on the market in time for the 1987 crash. 
 For the next three years, half-finished and completed buildings went begging for buyers. With overbuilding widespread and prices dropping, companies sought more fashionable southern Fairfield towns in preference to Shelton.
But this year, Shelton's office vacancy rate dropped substantially, to 20 percent. Less than 530,000 of a total of 2.5 million square feet of office space remain vacant, and only 10 percent of almost four million square feet of light industrial space is empty. Shelton has absorbed more than 200,000 square feet in 1991, bringing its vacancy rate below those of its chief competitors, Stamford, at 22 percent, and Norwalk, at 22.8.
A deepening recession has heightened interest in Shelton's lower costs and taxes, expandable tracts of land, and most importantly, accessibility to a geographically broad labor market. "It's a first choice now," said James Fagan, vice president at the CB Commercial Real Estate Group in Stamford.
The Prudential Relocation Corporation moved its northeast headquarters this year from Merritt 7, a prestigious complex in Norwalk, to Enterprise Tower II in Shelton, merging a small New Jersey office into its new 35,000-square-foot space. Retention of employees was a key element.
"We couldn't tap into a stable labor market in Norwalk," said Richard Schwartz, senior vice president for Prudential Relocation. The turnover among clerical and middle management employees earning $20,000 to $60,000 a year was around 25 percent because of the long travel time to reach affordable housing.
Enterprise Tower II, a 10-story building with 290,000 square feet of space, was completed last spring. Some 150,000 square feet is available at rents of $13.50 to $15.50 a square foot. Its twin, completed two years ago, is connected by an atrium, and completely leased.
"We saved 20 to 25 percent in rent and got more amenities," Mr. Schwartz said. For the convenience of its tenants, the complex has its own cafeteria, dry cleaner, florist, hair salon, carwash, copy center, bank teller machine, limo and car rental service, helicopter service to Manhattan and travel service.
Robert Scinto of Greenwich, its developer, is the largest taxpayer in town. He paid $1.6 million into Shelton's coffers in 1990. A former Bridgeport plumber, he owns 28 office buildings with a total of two million square feet, most of it in Shelton. "What brought me here was Route 8," he said, referring to the north-south expressway from Bridgeport to Waterbury. "You can attract executives from Stamford and entry-level employees from Naugatuck." Driving time to Waterbury, Stamford, Danbury, Norwalk, New Haven or Bridgeport takes between 10 and30 minutes.
"LABOR costs are significantly lower simply because of housing," he said. "Condos in Naugatuck go for $49,900. You can pay people $300 a week and they are happy with it. When Cartier moved into Enterprise Towers they had 2,000 applicants for 60 jobs."
He will begin building a Finast Supermarket of 67,000 square feet on Bridgeport Avenue in March.
"We have our city approvals, and Finast advances construction funds for its own facilities," he said. Site work on a Sheraton Hotel, to be built within the 100-acre parcel on which Enterprise Towers sits, is under way."When banks are ready to lend, we will start construction," Mr. Scinto said.
Confidence in the continued growth of the Route 8 corridor was demonstrated by Zell-Merrill Lynch II, which bought a 162,000-square-foot office building at 2 Trap Falls Road for $5.25 million last month. The new investment fund with $500 million at its disposal was formed by Sam Zell, a real estate investor from Chicago. The sale was negotiated by Jeffrey Dunne and Mr. Fagan at CB Commercial.
John Morrow of CB Commercial arranged the purchase in July of the Philips Medical Systems building at 710 Bridgeport Avenue by Auguste-Thouard of Greenwich, the American arm of a major French real estate firm. The 450,000-square-foot office and industrial complex on 36 acres was sold for $22 million, with 300,000 square feet leased back to Philips for 10 years.
ALAIN LeBLEU, president of Auguste-Thouard, said "we have made only two acquisitions in the last two years and both of them are in Shelton." The company has acquired some $75 million worth of commercial real estate on Long Island, in Westchester County and Connecticut since it opened here in 1982.
In 1990 it bought the 155,000-square-foot former ITT building on 15 acres at 1 Research Drive. After a total renovation, the two-story building is 75 percent rented.
"We've done well here, and I don't see why we would not do more," Mr. Le Bleu said. "We plan to build an addition to the Philips complex to accommodate a second corporate tenant with a combination of office and industrial space. We are in the design phase, but we will not go ahead until we have a commitment from a tenant."
Mark Lauretti, Shelton's new Mayor; Alton Russell, the new chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission, Mr. Scinto and local officials and businessmen met in December to discuss the city's future.
"Route 8 is doing well, but downtown is badly in need of revitalization, with a better balance of housing and retail," the Mayor said. A new plan of development focusing on that issue will be presented at public hearings in March, Mr. Russell said.
Howe Avenue, the principal downtown street, overlooks the Housatonic River, separated from it by old brick factories, nondescript stores and a grubby, debris-filled site where the Goodrich Rubber Company burned in 1975. Until developers can be found to recycle the historically significant street of 19th century buildings into apartments, shops and offices, Shelton remains a divided city, its downtown shunned by employees, residents and customers of Route 8's modern office parks, houses, condominiums and shopping centers.

HEADLINE: The Bad Boy of Insurance Ratings

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

 BODY:
Executives at the Travelers Corporation were horrified. In August, analysts at Weiss Research Inc., an insurance-rating firm, assigned a "weak" rating to Travelers's life-insurance subsidiary. The rating, reflecting the company's outsized portfolio of troubled real estate loans, touched off a wave of telephone calls to Travelers from jittery policyholders and agents.
So in September, a team of Travelers executives boarded the company's private jet and flew to Weiss Research's headquarters here in an attempt to get the rating changed. As a pair of stretch limousines stood idling outside, the executives tried to persuade Weiss analysts that Travelers had ample capital to weather its difficulties. But despite two hours of tense negotiations, the analysts, who use an A-to-F grading system, agreed only to raise their rating to C-, from D+. 
 Assigning low grades to large, well-known life insurance companies has become something of a trademark for Weiss Research, which began rating insurers only two years ago. Giants like Aetna, Equitable and Kemper may enjoy above-average grades from the leaders of the insurance-rating field -- A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Duff & Phelps -- but not from Weiss. Concerned by the large losses that insurers have suffered on real estate and junk bonds and taking what it acknowledges is a more cautious approach than the others, Weiss says the financial condition of many large insurers is fair at best.
Not surprisingly, life insurance executives are outraged by Weiss Research and its outspoken president, Martin D. Weiss.
Relations between Mr. Weiss and certain insurers have become so strained, in fact, that last year the American Council of Life Insurance, the industry's Washington-based trade group, began a campaign to discredit him. The council provided reporters with streams of negative information about Mr. Weiss's track record, professional qualifications and ethics. Among other things, the council noted that Mr. Weiss had been cited 20 years ago for securities law violations.
 
A Nervous Chicken Little?
 "Weiss wants to create the impression that the problems of the life insurance industry are greater than they are so that he can sell more of his products," charged Henri Bersoux, an A.C.L.I. spokesman. "He makes Chicken Little look calm."
For his part, Mr. Weiss says the industry is using him to obscure the real issue, which is that it has serious problems. "The A.C.L.I. says that confidence in the industry is declining because of people like me," he said. "I say that confidence is down because of the A.C.L.I."
Indeed, while many life insurance executives view Mr. Weiss as alarmist, simplistic in his analysis and above all interested in enriching himself, some industry experts call him a welcome addition. They say that the older ratings agencies are far too close to the companies they review and that Mr. Weiss is one of the industry's few tough critics. Weiss Research is the only major agency that does not receive the bulk of its revenues from the industry; it rates insurers at its own expense and gears its reports to individual consumers, its primary market and source of funds.
"In light of what happened in 1991, with the failure of three huge life insurance companies, public awareness of the industry has got to be raised," said Michael Adams, a counsel to a House subcommittee that heard testimony from Mr. Weiss last summer. "Martin Weiss certainly serves that function."
Mr. Weiss "doesn't give all A's, and that's why he's gotten into trouble," added Jean Rosales, an economist at the Congressional Research Service. "He's just not as likely to fall for the common view that the big, old-line life insurers can't have problems."
The older ratings services insist that their reports are objective and valuable, notwithstanding that three are paid directly by insurers that ask to be rated while the fourth, A. M. Best, rates everyone but depends on insurers to buy its books, newsletters and industry guides.
"People are interested in our information and find it useful," said Roy Taub, head of Standard & Poor's insurance rating group. Many of those reviewed get high ratings, he said, because "it is the strongest companies that are willing to go through this process."
By contrast, Mr. Weiss uses worst-case scenarios to produce unduly pessimistic grades for some insurers, said Paul Wish, spokesman for A. M. Best. Mr. Weiss's use of a bell-shaped curve for grading -- with most companies ranked average and relatively few given top marks or failing grades -- also reflects flawed thinking, Mr. Wish said. "Why assume that only a tiny proportion of the industry can be outstanding performers?" he said.
 
Seeing Trouble Ahead
 Mr. Weiss insists, however, that he has been right on the money with his ratings. His favorite statistic: Of the five large insurers he rated D as of June 30, 1990, three failed within a year. By comparison, he says, of the 23 large insurers he had rated B or better, none had failed. And Mr. Weiss insists that his was the only rating agency to have predicted the troubles of the Executive Life Insurance Company well in advance of that giant company's failure.
In any event, the number of individuals ordering insurance-related reports from Weiss Research has risen steadily since Mr. Weiss started issuing his letter grades in 1989, after more than a decade of rating banks and of publishing financial newsletters. The orders have run as high as 13,000 a month lately. Customers pay $15 to receive over-the-phone ratings on individual insurers, $25 for a one-page summary, $45 for an 18-page report and $189 for a directory of ratings and data on 1,700 insurers.
Still, the Weiss organization remains relatively small. It has 70 employees, only 7 of whom work exclusively on insurance, including the head of insurance ratings, Ted Brownstein. By comparison, Moody's has about a dozen people rating insurers full time and A. M. Best, the biggest of the insurance raters, has well over 100. Weiss Research, being privately held, does not release financial data, but people familiar with the company say its annual sales are below $30 million. As for profits, Mr. Weiss says that his legal bills from fending off irate insurers have become so expensive that his rating business for insurance is only "marginally profitable."
There is nothing marginal, however, about the attention that Mr. Weiss has been garnering. A slim and energetic 45-year-old who is a master of public relations -- he has two publicists on staff -- Mr. Weiss and his dire predictions have been the subject of hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles.
To a certain extent, Mr. Weiss is simply benefiting from good timing. The failure last spring of industry giants Executive Life and First Capital Life, along with the collapse during the summer of Mutual Benefit Life, has raised public concern.
But Mr. Weiss and his analysts also have filled a niche. For years, consumers have complained that insurance reports have been geared more to industry professionals than to individuals. Weiss Research boasts that it is the only agency that serves the average consumer, publishing reports that use plain-English prose and simple charts.
"Weiss certainly has not displaced the other rating agencies, but being consumer oriented he is developing ratings that are finally intelligible to the ordinary policyholder," said Spencer Francis, controller of the National Guardian Life Insurance Company of Madison, Wis., which is rated A by Mr. Weiss.
 
Muted Criticism?
 The difference involves more than intelligibility, says Mr. Weiss. Being dependent on the insurance industry for a healthy portion of their revenues, his competitors must mute their criticism, he contends. That, he says, has created a situation in which the others rate companies by shades of excellence, and policyholders are left to decipher what is meant when an insurer is downgraded from the top of the "excellent" category to the middle.
"Even the least knowledgeable insurance agents told us that the A. M. Best ratings in particular were exaggerated," Mr. Weiss said, adding that scores of companies receive A's from Best.
Best, the granddaddy of the insurance rating business with reports on individual insurers dating back to the 1890's, has come under increasing criticism in recent years for being too dependent on the industry it rates.
In fact, say many experts, it was Best's faltering reputation that encouraged S.& P., Moody's and Duff & Phelps, all bond rating agencies, to start rating insurers in the late 80's. But Mr. Weiss, among others, says these agencies are not much better. (S.& P., Moody's and Duff & Phelps get paid from $18,000 to $25,000 by the companies they rate. Best charges a nominal fee to calculate a rating but its reports go into industry guides.)
If there is too much good news from the old timers, Mr. Weiss goes much too far in the other direction, his critics say. His goal, they say, is to make predictions that are gloomy enough to attract reporters' attention and bring him sales.
Critics also say that Mr. Weiss's background as an analyst of banks and savings institutions makes him unqualified to reach conclusions about insurers.
An anthropology graduate of New York University and Columbia University, Mr. Weiss began his career by working at the investment-newsletter publishing firm of his father, Irving Weiss. One of his first assignments was editing Money and Credit Reports, a newsletter that dealt with interest rates and the safety of financial institutions. Mr. Weiss says he trained for that job as a teen-ager, tagging along when the elder Mr. Weiss visited banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies.
 
On His Own
 In 1971, Mr. Weiss struck out on his own, founding Weiss Research to provide investment advice to wealthy individuals. In 1976, he expanded the business to include the publication of his own financial newsletters (his father's newsletters had ceased operating by then).
In 1980, after a two-year stint in Japan as a Fulbright Scholar studying decision making in Japanese financial institutions, Mr. Weiss returned to the United States to begin issuing formal safety ratings on banks and saving associations.
Nine years later, he began rating insurers. Unlike the other major agencies, which rely heavily on management assessments, Mr. Weiss focuses on the detailed financial results that insurers file with state insurance commissions. To generate a letter grade, he crunches all the numbers using a computer model developed by an actuary, Peter Chapman, and an insurance professor, Harold Skipper of Georgia State University.
The problem, from the insurer's point of view, is that Mr. Weiss's computer has assigned shockingly low grades to many companies that have long thought of themselves as being at the top of the class.
Insurers say that Mr. Weiss's formulaic approach often distorts the meaning of the data he uses. Last year, for instance, Mr. Weiss issued a news release in which he identified the Unum Corporation of Portland, Me., as the life insurer to have suffered one of the largest increases in troubled real estate loans of late. Although the statement was technically correct based on the data Unum filed with state regulators, Unum management insists that the numbers overstated the problem and that all Mr. Weiss had to do was talk with management and he would have reached a different conclusion. In brief, Unum executives say that Mr. Weiss misunderstood the structure of their company, which has many affiliates.
"This raises all matters of hell with policyholders when someone like Weiss does something like this," said Rodney N. Hook, Unum's chief financial officer.
Similarly, executives at the Cigna Life Insurance Company say Mr. Weiss gave a distorted picture of their company, which he rated C.
"Weiss's system is so mechanized he cannot distinguish among companies," said Michael Monroe, a Cigna Life spokesman.
Mr. Weiss is unfazed. To the contrary, in November he branched out again, this time into the securities industry. And if his initial ratings there are any indication -- Salomon got a D, Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer each got a D+ -- he will be attracting plenty of new critics before too long.
 
 
 
BIG GUNS SAY THERE'S A LOOSE CANNON
 Enraged by what they call his loose-cannon approach to ratings, insurance executives undertook a campaign last year to discredit Martin Weiss. The campaign began in earnest May 4, when Mr. Weiss appeared before a Senate hearing on insurer insolvencies.
Anticipating that Mr. Weiss would predict further turmoil in the industry, representatives of the American Council of Life Insurance descended on reporters with folders full of information attacking his credibility.
The material reviewed Mr. Weiss's mixed record as an economic forecaster as well as a legal problem he had with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1972. The case, involving the promotion of unregistered securities, resulted in Mr. Weiss's being banned from the securities business for four months.
Less than two weeks later, on May 23, Stephen Young, director of the A.C.L.I.'s New York office, wrote to reporters around the country, calling Mr. Weiss "a critic of marginal credibility who is being allowed to scare the living daylights out of people."
That was followed by a June 18 letter from Henri Bersoux, one of the A.C.L.I.'s spokesmen, who encouraged reporters to "use caution before assigning credibility" to Mr. Weiss. In the same letter, Mr. Bersoux said that Weiss Research had a financial incentive to "release negative news about specific companies."
That was followed by an appearance on ABC's "Nightline" by Richard Schweiker, the former Senator from Pennsylvania who is now president of the A.C.L.I. Mr. Schweiker said that Mr. Weiss had repeatedly blown it as a forecaster -- predicting in 1983, for example, that the prime rate would reach 30 percent -- and did not deserve to be trusted as an insurance rater.
Sue Ann Bailey, the spokeswoman for Weiss Research, said that many of Mr. Weiss's forecasts have been more accurate than the A.C.L.I. is letting on. As for Mr. Weiss's difficulties with the S.E.C., Ms. Bailey said, "Basically, the A.C.L.I. has dredged up a 20-year-old incident that has no bearing whatsoever on Martin Weiss's ability to rate insurers."
 
 
 
WHO WARNED OF A FAILURE?
 Ever since regulators seized the Executive Life Insurance Company of Los Angeles last April, policyholders and politicians alike have been examining the performance of the rating agencies in predicting the insurer's downfall.
Not surprisingly, all five major agencies claim to have been on top of the situation, signaling to policyholders the trouble that loomed. The truth: Some agencies were much better than others.
Weiss Research was the first to see the danger and to say so unambiguously. In June 1990, after Executive Life took a huge write-off in connection with its large portfolio of junk bonds, Weiss issued a D rating, meaning weak. Moody's also appeared to be on top of the situation, although it equivocated by issuing a Ba2 rating, meaning questionable.
By comparison, Standard & Poor's and Duff & Phelps rated Executive Life BBB and BBB-, respectively, meaning good. A. M. Best, the oldest and biggest of the agencies, issued an A rating, meaning excellent, although it said the company could be downgraded.
Weiss Research has boasted that it was the only agency to have truly "called" Executive Life's problems.
On the other hand, there does seem to be an element of truth to the charge leveled by many industry executives that Weiss Research is so negative in general that the agency is bound to predict failure correctly some of the time.
These critics cite the "fair" rating that Weiss Research awarded Executive Life in 1989. At the time, 60 percent of the insurers rated by Weiss received a similar or poorer grade. And they note that while Martin Weiss, the agency's pugnacious president, has become somewhat less of a Jeremiah in recent months, he still rates the majority of life insurers "fair," "weak" or "very weak."
The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, for example, enjoyed a "fair" rating from Weiss Research shortly before that giant New Jersey-based insurer failed last summer.

An article last Sunday about Weiss Research Inc., an insurance rating agency, misidentified the developer of the computer model used by the company. He is Ted Brownstein, head of Weiss's insurance operation. A large group of experts whose views were solicited by Mr. Brownstein included Peter Chapman, then an outside actuary and now a Weiss employee, and Harold Skipper, an insurance professor at Georgia State University.

Corporate Incentive To Teach

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
SCHOOLS clamor for dedicated teachers, while corporations send managers to the unemployment lines. Doesn't seem fair, does it?
The Chevron Corporation doesn't think so. To pare down payroll with a minimum of pain, the San Francisco-based oil company is letting employees with five years' experience, no matter how young, take early retirement. And, in a fillip stemming from equal parts philanthropy and self-interest, Chevron will pay $4,000 toward tuition if they go to school for teaching credentials. 
 "Considering the broad need for teachers, this really makes sense," said Gale H. Bitter, Chevron's coordinator of corporate contributions.
Indeed, the Citizens Scholarship Foundation of America, a nonprofit group based in St. Peter, Minn., that administers the program, is trying to drive that point home to other companies.
The foundation will find proselytizers among the 50 employees who have joined the program. Nathaniel Johnson Jr.,
 who had a degree in physical education, was seduced by the oil industry's seemingly limitless potential in the late 1970's. By last year, the sparkling future had turned dim. So, at 38, Mr. Johnson went back to school.
He now teaches physical education at Bakersfield High School, and loves it. "That Chevron paid part of the tuition was a wonderful bonus," he said.

HEADLINE: Lollipops and Languages

BYLINE: By Michel Marriott

 BODY:
IN Yolanda Hall's festively decorated classroom in a public school in Montclair, N.J., every morning begins with an enthusiastic exchange of greetings.
Mrs. Hall: "Buenos dias, ninos." 
 Class: "Buenos dias, Senora."
Standard stuff for a beginning Spanish class? Yes, but there is a significant difference here at Nishuane Primary School. The students, more than two dozen of them, are 4-year-olds. Each is enrolled in a Spanish immersion class in which not a word of their native English -- a language of which many of them still have a slippery grasp -- is spoken during the 30-minute class.
Yet, one by one, these prekindergarteners come to develop an appreciation and linguistic foundation upon which to learn a language other than their own, said Mrs. Hall, an Ecuadorian who has been teaching the four-day-a-week elective for the last five years.
"Children exposed to this program are completely familiar with the language when they go on to study it in later grades because they have internalized it," Mrs. Hall said. Then she added with a chuckle, "But most of them think my name is Senora."
 
Language Renaissance
 Mounting numbers of students from preschoolers to high schoolers are being exposed to foreign languages in what some educators are calling a renaissance of second-language interest in American classrooms. A widening awareness by educators and parents that the United States is becoming a multicultural nation and that Americans need to improve their ability to communicate with others if they wish to remain globally competitive is driving much of the resurgence, experts say.
At the same time, however, a recession-weakened national economy is discouraging many school districts from expanding curriculums to include foreign language instruction, particularly in elementary schools.
"In elementary schools, foreign languages are seen as special, likened to music and art," said Christine Brown, director of foreign languages for the Glastonbury, Conn., school district. "In difficult economic times it has been among the first to be jettisoned. Obviously, that is tragic."
Glastonbury has been teaching elementary school students foreign languages since the late 1950's, when American politicians were startled into improving public education as a result after the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957.
By contrast, Boston's financially strapped school system cannot hire enough foreign language teachers so that all elementary school students can study a second language. One elementary school turned to volunteers to teach students Japanese this year. "We are looking to expand so we are looking for funding," said Helen Cummings, director of foreign languages for Boston's schools.
Despite the tough times, in 1990 more than 4.2 million students in high schools alone were learning a second language, a 6.1 percent rise over 1985, according to a new survey by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, a foreign language advocacy group based in Yonkers, N.Y.
 
A Telling Trend
 But perhaps most telling of the emerging trends the survey describes is its first-time inclusion of foreign language study for elementary school students. Based on information from 22 states that responded to the survey for the 1989-90 school year, the council estimated that 4.2 percent of public elementary school students are learning a second language.
"This is a considerable increase from what it was 10 years ago," said J. David Edwards, executive director of the Joint National Committee on Language, another language advocacy group. That is encouraging, Mr. Edwards said, because foreign languages are more easily learned when students are young and less self-conscious about attempting to pronounce new sounds and new words.
Ms. Brown noted, "It is not only a linguistic gain here when children are exposed to a foreign language; you see that they start to appreciate other people, bringing down racism, prejudice."
A few state boards of education are beginning to realize this, said Myriam Met, foreign language coordinator for the public schools in Montgomery County, Md., near Washington.
Four states -- Arizona, Louisiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma -- require some foreign language instruction in elementary schools. In North Carolina, 22 percent of students from kindergarten to the sixth grade are studying a foreign language, the highest percentage among the four states, according to the council's survey.
Ms. Met says she is encouraged by what she sees. "Most other states likely will require it soon or provide substantial incentives to schools which do," she wrote for Educational Leadership, a professional journal, last fall.
In an interview, she said introducing youngsters to foreign languages makes sense, noting studies indicating that students with foreign language skills do better academically than those with no such skills.
Ms. Met said a recent study by the Louisiana Department of Education found that fifth- and sixth-graders who studied a second language scored higher on reading and mathematics tests than their counterparts who did not study a foreign language. In another study by the College Board, she said, students who took foreign languages for at least five years scored better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test for college admissions than those who had little or no second-language instruction.
Mr. Edwards said the relationship between early foreign language study and personal and academic success had long been known among private schools for the young. It has been in public schools, particularly those in the largely poor inner cities, where foreign language studies have badly lagged, he said.
In Orange County, Calif., Dawn Garces-Dochroedon, a working mother of two, is concerned that her 8-year-old twin sons are not offered a foreign language at their elementary school. Ms. Garces-Dochroedon, who is of Puerto Rican and Colombian heritage, says she wants her sons, Christopher and Justin, to become fluent in Spanish for cultural and family reasons -- their Mexican grandparents speak very little English, and she wants to improve their future employment opportunities.
"This is something they should get in school," Ms. Garces-Dochroedon said. "If I could afford it, I would send them somewhere for private lessons." Instead, she says she is shopping for other area public elementary schools that offer Spanish.

HEADLINE: Hooked on Ad Claims

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

 BODY:
AMERICANS are used to being inundated with slick commercials for beer, fast food and cars, so it was probably just a matter of time until a company like Gateway Educational Products tried the approach with one of its product lines, "Hooked on Phonics."
The insistent advertising campaign has worked, if one accepts the privately held company's sales claims. Gateway, which is based in Orange, Calif., says that more than 500,000 consumers have dialed 1-800-ABCDEFG to order "Hooked on Phonics," a $179.95 collection of tape cassettes, cards and workbooks.
 
But Does It Work?
 
 Whether the product works, however, is another question.
Gateway offers reams of testimonials to the program's success. But many of the nation's widely recognized reading experts have leveled blistering attacks on the company's claim that with its materials, virtually anyone from a child to an illiterate adult to a foreigner studying English can learn to read. These critics demand that Gateway offer scientific support, not testimonials and sales figures, to make its case.
In response, Carolyn Sisco, a company spokeswoman, says there is no need for tests. "Phonics is already a proven method to learn to read," she said. "All we have done is made it easier and more fun."
Gateway is certainly not alone in making alluring though unscientifically documented claims in mass media advertising; it's just that other companies are less willing to discuss them. For example, Early Advantage of Norwalk, Conn., which markets BBC Language Courses for Children, and Chesterbrook Educational Publishers of West Chester, Pa., marketers of "Where There's a Will, There's an A," did not respond to repeated requests to discuss their products.
Gateway's success has made its products, and advertising, a focus of unusually intense scrutiny. But the disconcerting truth is that very few vendors of educational products to schools or the public have statistically valid proof of how effective their wares are as teaching aids.
 
'Very Little Testing'
 "About 10,000 products are published annually and 99 percent of it is driven by marketing conditions," said Douglas Carnine, a University of Oregon professor specializing in curriculum development and school reform. "There's very little testing of whether it is efficacious."
Consumers are out of luck if they turn for guidance on such products to big-name groups like the National Parent Teachers Association or the National Education Association. None of them issue product reviews or guidelines for assessing product claims.
Consumers may be more bewildered than usual in Gateway's case, because the company freely admits that most high-profile reading experts have criticized "Hooked on Phonics" for promising more than it can deliver. But the company dismisses such critics as protectors of vested economic interests who are jealous of its success.
"The country is in an educational free-fall," said John Shanahan, Gateway's 51-year-old founder, who never misses an opportunity to say that tutors and schools, unlike Gateway, do not offer refunds when they fail.
Gateway promises that anyone can "read almost anything" by memorizing the letter combinations that represent the English language's 44 basic sounds and then practicing putting them together to sound out words. It says it has made the task simple and fun for nonreaders of all ages by putting exercises to music. It has applied the same approach to other products.
 
Few Seek Refund
 Mr. Shanahan says that nearly all of Gateway's customers are pleased. Fewer than 10 percent, he says, seek the refund guaranteed if the "Hooked on Phonics" program, for example, is returned within 30 days.
But last spring, a panel of experts convened by the International Reading Association of Newark, Del., which comprises 92,000 educators, concluded that the chances of learning to read using "Hooked on Phonics" were slim. Even academics who share Gateway's belief in the power of phonics are upset by its claims. "I haven't encountered one scholar who has said it is a good program," said Jeanne Chall at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. Professor Chall notes, for example, that consumers cannot test whether they understand the meaning of the words and sentences they have learned to sound out.
The problem, according to many reading experts and counselors, is that illiterate adults, and many parents, are too embarrassed to return educational products or to complain to authorities about false advertising when they fail.
"The people who order this are most likely to blame themselves when the product fails, because there's a lot of shame in not being able to read," said Kathleen Stassen Berger, a developmental psychologist who teaches at Bronx Community College. "Others will put it on a shelf, telling themselves they will try later, where it becomes a symbol of dashed hopes."
But Ms. Sisco, Gateway's spokeswoman, says customers report and survey results show that using the program leads to "progress in reading and spelling." Besides, Mr. Shanahan said, "The American people aren't stupid. If they don't like it, they send it back."
Mrs. Berger complained early last year to the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the council's self-regulatory arm. After discussions with Gateway, the division concluded that the advertising misleads consumers by claiming that the program is all the nonreader needs to learn to read. The division noted that many parents and teachers who submitted testimonials had used the program with other materials and with readers on hand to help the nonreaders.
Gateway disagreed with most of the conclusions. In an interview, Ms. Sisco said that Gateway encouraged parental involvement in children's education and would never discourage adult customers from getting help. But she said "a lot of people" had learned to read using the program alone. "We only say things in our advertising that customers have told us," she said.
Still, Gateway said that it wanted to cooperate and subsequently introduced new advertisements that satisfied the National Advertising Division. The potential for conflict was also reduced by the company's decision to sharply cut radio advertising in favor of "infomercials," paid half-hour television programming packed with testimonials. Critics like Mrs. Berger are upset but say they are unsure how to proceed.
Meanwhile Gateway is adding to its offerings a phonics-based reading comprehension package based on SRA Reading Laboratories, reading lessons published by a division of Macmillan-McGraw Hill. Don H. Parker, a 79-year-old former teacher who started developing SRA Laboratories 40 years ago, came to Gateway's attention when he sent an unsolicited endorsement of "Hooked on Phonics."

HEADLINE: The Course Not Taken

BYLINE: By Margo Kaufman

 BODY:
WHILE many people recall their college years with a mixture of satisfaction and nostalgia, some have regrets.
Given what they know today, these alumni look wistfully back at the course not taken, the class that could have changed their life -- if only they'd bothered to register. 
 "Astronomy is what pops into my mind," said Harlan Dalton, a law professor at Yale University. "Because no matter where you live there's always a magnificent night. I guess I think of the sky as a transcultural, transgenerational experience."
Some wishes are more basic.
"Nutrition," said Franco Harris, the former star running back of the Pittsburgh Steelers. "Since I really enjoy food, I would like to have taken a class that would have taught me to eat healthier." It might also have helped in his latest game plan -- marketing nutritious doughnuts. "It's a challenge to try and change the perception of the doughnut," he said.
Graduates regret skipping courses that could have made their lives easier. Cecile Holmes White, an editor on The Houston Chronicle, could have used Time Management 101 "to answer demands from 12 people who want 12 different things at once." And Jonathan Kozol, author of "Savage Inequalities," about the crisis in urban schools, yearns for a statistics course, "so I can understand the reports that come from the Bush Administration."
 
The Tough Ones
 Then there were the courses that seemed too tough. "I wish I had taken Spanish," said basketball superstar Wilt Chamberlain. "Actually I took it. But it's the only course in college I ever dropped. It was a 7 A.M. class. It was much too early to speak a language I knew nothing about. Now I live in California and Florida where there are lots of Latin types."
Carlfred Broderick, a sociology professor at the University of Southern California who says he took every class he wanted at Harvard, suggests that people's regrets reflect the major dichotomy in education. "There are people who wish they hadn't specialized, that they hadn't taken so much biology to get into medical school," Professor Broderick said. "And then there are the people who wish they had taken something that would give them a leg up in the dog-eat-dog world of business."
This is especially true in times of recession. "When I look back, I wish I knew all about art," said Marian Bach, a financial administrator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But I really wish I had done accounting or computer programming so that I could have a highly paid professional skill."
Still, folks want to expand their horizons. "I suppose the obvious answers are economics and personal finance," said Paul Erickson, a professor of communication studies at Emerson College. "But I really wish I'd taken a class -- a whole bunch of classes -- in voice." Professor Erickson is writing fiction and having a hard time "writing in a fiction voice." "Instead of learning to talk like a professor, I wish I'd learned to sing like myself," he said. "I'd be better and stronger today."
Not necessarily, says Gary Emery, director of the Los Angeles Center for Cognitive Therapy. "People like to fantasize an ideal self," Dr. Emery said. "They think, 'If I was back in college I could be doing anything.' Actually, they'd probably do the same thing all over again."
Dr. Emery maintains that having regrets is like having two lives. "It gives people a larger existence," he said. "It makes them think they could be someone else."
Hindsight being 20/20, many baccalaureates say they would have declared majors in life. "I wish there were a course on how to manage all of this -- being a parent, having a job and trying to maintain your sanity," said Kimberlee Whaley, who is trying to maintain hers as a professor of family relations and human development at Ohio State and the mother of two children, ages 7 and 2.
 
The Final Exam
 Professor Whaley has even envisioned a final exam. "You'd have to go through a typical day from getting up, packing lunch, your daughter suddenly has to go to the bathroom, forgetting the blanket on the way out. You'd have to go through the whole day and at night still remember your name."
"I'll tell you a class I would have benefited from," said Jon Winokur, author of "The Portable Curmudgeon" and "Mondo Canine." " 'How to Lie.' You learn by trial and error anyway, so that would have been very helpful. Also 'How to Deal With Automobile Dealership Personnel -- Sales and Service.' And of course, 'VCR Installation' -- that would have been graduate school."
A Washington University alumnus longed for "How To Make Good Answering Machine Messages Without Being Too Odd or Too Succinct" (and without using a toddler or pet, please). And a Northwestern University woman could have used "How to Dump Guys."
"I teach that course," said Jerald Jellison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California. "It's benignly called 'Interpersonal Relations' but there's a lecture on terminating relationships -- '50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.' The class is about practical ways to exert influence over other people."
Professor Jellison says course material derives from what he wished he'd learned in
college. "I wanted a course that would keep the bullies away, get important people to want me in their group and attract girls," he said. "If I had seen a course that taught these things, I would have crawled to it."
Not Ken Goldberg, a Chicago attorney. "I'm always hoping there's someplace that will teach people how to be a human being," Mr. Goldberg said. "I don't know if anyone would or could. But I would teach men how to mix a smidgen of compassion with a certain amount of machismo. I would tell women how to be gentle without being condescending."
And the final exam? "Driving in rush-hour traffic on both streets and expressways for a set period of time," he said. "An instructor would accompany you and give you points for how you treat the general population." There would be extra credit for rain, a pop quiz on driving in snow.
But other people's regrets are comparatively simple. "I wish I'd gone to college," said the soul singer Lou Rawls.

HEADLINE: Election Staffs Resemble Candidates

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
It is said that by some strange quirk of biology, dog owners and their pets come to resemble each other. The same, it seems, can be said of candidates and the members of their campaign staffs.
Six weeks before the New Hampshire primary, each of the major candidates for President appears to have put together a staff that imitates, for good or for ill, his own strengths and weaknesses. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, for instance, has a reputation for being well-organized and disciplined; so, too, do his staff members. 
 Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska has a tendency to re-invent himself. He ran for governor with little political experience, then abruptly left office after one term and a few years later decided to re-enter politics by running for the Senate. Recently his staff underwent a remodeling of its own when a new campaign manager was brought in.
Although campaign staff members tend to work in obscurity, the behind-the-scenes team that produces a candidate's slogans and puts the spin on his mistakes is crucial to his chances. In the last Presidential campaign, President Bush's staff, led by James A. Baker 3d and Lee Atwater, was widely credited with helping to engineer his victory.
 
Inexperienced Political Workers
 At this point, some of the country's most seasoned political workers are sitting out the Presidential race. Roger Ailes, for example, who helped mastermind Mr. Bush's campaign in 1988, is not expected to play a role in the 1992 campaign. Nor is Bob Squier, one of Washington's most prominent Democratic consultants. This means that several campaigns are being led by men and women -- mostly men -- with little experience in Presidential politics.
Heading into the primary season, here's what the campaign staffs for the major candidates look like:
 
Bill Clinton
 At this point, Governor Clinton has not only the most well-organized, but also the largest staff of any of the Democratic candidates.
Mr. Clinton had hired a media consultant, Frank Greer, long before many of the other candidates had even found a campaign director. Mr. Greer's media credits include several successful Senate and governor races, including L. Douglas Wilder's 1990 campaign for governor of Virginia.
Mr. Clinton's campaign manager is David Wilhelm, a Chicago native who has run races for several Illinois Democrats. The campaign director is Bruce Lindsey, an Arkansan and a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton's. Stan Greenberg, a prominent Washington poll taker, is tracking public opinion for the campaign.
Among the top advisers to Mr. Clinton are Robert Reich, a Harvard University economist, and David Osborne, the author of several books on reorganizing government.
 
Bob Kerrey
 A staff shake-up over the last two weeks has put the Kerrey campaign under new management.
Tad Devine, an aide to Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 campaign, is the new campaign director. He is replacing Sue Casey, a former aide to Gary Hart in his short-lived Presidential bid in 1988. Although Mr. Kerrey denies it, aides acknowledge that the shake-up was intended to boost a campaign perceived to be sagging.
Bill Shore, another former aide to Mr. Hart, is remaining as the campaign's political director. Bill Hoppner, Mr. Kerrey's chief of staff when he was Governor of Nebraska, is staying on as campaign chairman, but will be less involved in the day-to-day operation.
Joe Rothstein, a Washington consultant, is the campaign's expert on the news media and advertising. Polling for the campaign is being done by Harrison Hickman, a Washington poll taker.
Some of the top advisers to Mr. Kerrey are Mike McCurry, former communications director for the Democratic National Committee, and Bill Carrick, a Los Angeles political consultant.
 
Tom Harkin
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa entered the Presidential race with his liberal, New Deal-style platform already staked out and has hired relatively few outsiders to help sell his message to the public. He relies heavily on people who have worked for him in the past.
The campaign director is Tim Raftis, an Iowa native who ran Mr. Harkin's Senate campaign in 1990. The deputy campaign director is Kay Casstevens, Mr. Harkin's chief aide in the Senate.
Last month Mr. Harkin finally added a media consultant and a poll taker. The media consultant is Ken Swope, who produced some of the commercials for Mr. Dukakis in the 1988 primary campaign. The poll taker is Paul Harstad, another native Iowan.
Among his top advisers, Mr. Harkin has Toby Moffett, a former Congressman from Connecticut.
 
Paul E. Tsongas
 Paul E. Tsongas, a former Senator from Massachusetts, is running his door-to-door-style campaign from his hometown, Lowell, Mass., and his staff members reflect the campaign's homespun approach.
The campaign manager is Dennis Kanin, who ran Mr. Tsongas's Congressional and Senate offices and then left Washington with him to join the same law firm. The political director is Paul Schone, who was Mr. Tsongas's political director in his 1978 Senate race.
Mr. Tsongas's television commercials, some of which are already on the air in New Hampshire, are being produced by Michael Shea and Fred Woods, Boston media consultants. Tubby Harrison, who is also from Boston, is doing the campaign's polling.
Among his top advisers, Mr. Tsongas lists Lester Thurow, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
L. Douglas Wilder
 Governor Wilder of Virginia has increasingly been casting his Presidential campaign as an appeal to black voters, and the members of his campaign staff reflect this shifting emphasis.
Mr. Wilder recently hired Joe Johnson, a former aide to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to be his campaign manager.
Mr. Wilder's political director is Ron Lester, a poll taker. Joe Trippi of Virginia is the campaign's media consultant.
Mr. Wilder's main adviser is Paul Goldman, chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party.
 
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
 In keeping with his quirky, "insurgent" campaign, Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, has a quirky, "insurgent" staff, which seems to consist largely of unpaid volunteers. His campaign manager is Jodie Evans, who worked for him when he was Governor. Patrick H. Caddell, who helped mastermind the outsider's strategy that Jimmy Carter used to win the White House in 1976, is an unpaid adviser to the campaign.
 
George Bush
 Chosen more on the basis of personal closeness than ideology or even campaign experience, the President's campaign team was announced even before Mr. Bush had officially declared himself a candidate for re-election; indeed, he still has not done so.
The campaign chairman and chief political strategist is Robert M. Teeter, a poll-taker and a close adviser to the President. Frederic V. Malek, a businessman and former Nixon White House aide, is campaign manager and will have the nuts-and-bolts responsibility for the campaign organization. The general campaign chairman is Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher; he will not be active in the day-to-day operations, but will perform a more formal role.
Mary Matalin, a protegee of Mr. Atwater, who died last year of a brain tumor, will be the political director. Ms. Matalin is the former chief of staff at the Republican National Committee.
A top adviser to the campaign is Charles Black, a Republican consultant who is the founding chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Searching for Revival Signs In Oil Prices

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
As the United States enters 1992, the signs of economic revival are clearly visible on Wall Street, where stock prices regularly hit new highs.
Unfortunately, that completes the list of places where strength seems especially visible. Manufacturing, which in mid-1991 was hailed as the island of activity that would lead the revival, has since fallen on hard times. Consumers were cautious at Christmas, auto sales are miserable and the Government's leading indicators have once again begun to fall. 
 But maybe, just maybe, there was a sign of strength last week in the least likely place: oil. Crude oil prices, in a freefall since October, began to rise. A report showing a surprising drop in crude inventories was cited as a reason. But most analysts were inclined to dismiss the move as temporary. In the oil market, bearishness abounds.
The list of what is wrong with the oil market is long. First, there is too much oil. Kuwait production is rising surprisingly fast, and Iraq, which will meet this week with the United Nations' sanctions committee, will eventually start exporting oil that the world does not really need. The Saudis, who stunned a lot of people by ramping up production after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, now do not seem to want to cut back.
The demand picture is even more bleak. The weather is refusing to cooperate this winter, so natural gas prices are weaker even than last year. Last year was the third in a row in which American gasoline use fell, because of the recession and the fact that each year fewer gas guzzlers are still on the road.
The oil market is one in which everything usually seems either horrible or great. And it is often the case that "great" to an oil trader sounds terrible to everyone else. Only a year ago, all seemed rosy for oil traders, with the prospect of war threatening production in the Mideast. Then there was a run in prices last fall on the expectation that Soviet production would suffer as the country unraveled. Now there is general confidence that Russia and the other independent countries with substantial oil will produce all they can, holding down prices.
William L. Randol, First Boston's oil watcher, is among the bears on crude. He talks of falling seasonal demand in the second quarter, combined with rising Kuwaiti production, and says crude could drop below $15 a barrel. Oil prices had fallen to about $18.50 a barrel before beginning to rally just after Christmas. On Friday, the quote neared $20 before late selling knocked crude for March delivery back to $19.22.
The share prices of oil companies have also started to rise, perhaps reflecting simply a search for yield. Most provide dividends of 4.5 percent or more, which is better than banks will pay these days and a lot more than the average stock.
Normally, consumers have every reason to root against the oil companies. But just now, a sign of life in oil could be an indication that this economy is starting to revive.

Turning Pickup Trucks And Broken Hearts Into Pure Platinum

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
The Sunset Grill is one of the trendiest restaurants in Nashville -- in fact, it's one of the only trendy restaurants in Nashville. With its pale blue walls, sprigs of fresh flowers in slim white vases and pasta dishes that go for less than $10, the Grill is actually a pretty down-home affair compared to restaurants in New York or Los Angeles; but then trendiness was never much of a commodity in Nashville.
On a recent evening, Tony Brown, a senior vice president at MCA's Nashville division, sits at the corner table in the Sunset Grill's bar area. Arguably the most important record company executive in the country music industry, Mr. Brown, like the restaurant, lacks a high-powered air: he wears a white shirt, dark vest, black jeans and cowboy boots, and has a neatly trimmed beard. "I was watching MTV recently, and they were going through the top five records," he says. "The veejay says, 'No. 5 is Metallica. No. 4 is Guns 'n' Roses. No. 3 is some rap act. No. 2 is some other rap act. And No. 1 is' " -- Mr. Brown imitates the veejay's exaggerated Southern accent -- " 'Yee-haw! Garth Brooks!' " 
 In a recession year -- with the pop-music industry pouring millions of dollars' worth of hype into superstar releases like Michael Jackson, U2, Hammer and Guns 'n' Roses -- country music has quietly become a phenomenon, led by the success of Garth Brooks. In September, Mr. Brooks -- a slightly pudgy fellow with a twangy voice and a 10-gallon hat -- saw his third album, "Ropin' the Wind," debut at the No. 1 position on Billboard's Top 200 album chart. It was a first for a country singer. In late October, Mr. Brooks had two albums in the Top 10: "Ropin' the Wind," which has now sold more than four million copies (what is called quadruple platinum), and "No Fences," his 1990 album, which has sold at least five million. "Garth Brooks," his 1989 debut album, is still lingering in the Top 40, with sales above two million.
Country music may owe its high position on the pop chart to the fact that, earlier this year, Billboard revamped its system for tallying album sales. When the new formula, which computes the actual number of records sold instead of relying on lists compiled by record-store owners, went into effect in May, minority divisions of the music industry -- such as country and rap -- showed immediate gains.
But the boom goes well beyond the charts. Country music replaced Top 40 as the third most popular radio format this year, after adult contemporary and news/ talk radio. Following the success of such mainstream country performers as Reba McEntire and Clint Black, country music has seen a new generation of stars rise to the top in the last two years. Artists like Vince Gill, Alan Jackson and Travis Tritt -- all under 35 -- have albumsthat have gone platinum; this year, Trisha Yearwood, a 27-year-old singer under contract with MCA, became the first woman in country music to have her debut album certified gold (sales of 500,000) within a few months of its release.
Jimmy Bowen, the president of Capitol Nashville, Mr. Brooks's label, believes that the new generation of country singers is drawing a younger audience. "For years it was old -- old acts, old consumer," Mr. Bowen says. "But now the youth of America is saying, 'Wow, I think I like that music.' There are millions of Americans who can't relate to rap, most of the dance lyrics. They haven't all come to country, but they've come to a few of our acts."
The audience growth is also changing some stereotypes about country music. "I think there's a perception in a lot of major urban centers that country music has a kind of hick appeal," says Paul Corbin, the director of programming at the Nashville Network, a nationwide cable station owned by Opryland U.S.A., the umbrella organization that also runs the Grand Ole Opry. "But it really does speak a universal language."
As Top 40 radio becomes increasingly devoted to technology-driven sounds like dance and rap, conventional radio listeners are rediscovering country. Easy rhythms and acoustic guitars are a downright simple, almost anachronistic alternative to most of what is on MTV; the songs are lyric-oriented narratives that speak plainly about love, work and home.
 
Suburban Cowboys
Lookin' for Hits In All The Right Places
 "This batch is a bunch of young kids who grew up on country music," he says, "and have heroes in country. Half of them sound like Merle Haggard. This is no fad."
Tony Brown of MCA has another view: "Rock music depends on fashion -- it's part of fashion, it affects fashion," he says. "We're not. Country music will never ever be pop culture. You're going to have people that break through occasionally, but there are always going to be guys, like that veejay on MTV, who say, 'I ain't playin' that yee-haw music.' "
Unlike rock or pop, country music is defined by its traditions. One need only walk around Nashville to realize how much these traditions are still a part of the country music industry. Most of the record company offices are within a three-block stretch in a neighborhood known as Music Circle. There is a street named after the country guitarist Chet Atkins, and another named for Roy Acuff, one of country's grandfathers and, at 88, still a weekly performer and host on the Grand Ole Opry, the live show that has been broadcast on radio for 66 years. The MCA Nashville building, like many other record offices, is a house. It has one story, a front porch, shrubs on the lawn and plenty of parking out front.
Music Circle is also home to the Country Music Hall of Fame, a sprawling, modern structure where tourists can walk through the entire history of country music and see everything from lyrics handwritten by Johnny Cash to costumes once worn by the Judds. The Hall of Fame faces Music Row, a stretch of shops and museums where, in the best American tradition, stars like Hank Williams Jr. and Randy Travis sell ashtrays, thimbles and sweatshirts emblazoned with their names and faces.
With the exception of Opryland U.S.A.'s complex at the edge of the city -- the Opry theater (where the weekend radio programs take place), the Nashville Network's offices and a giant country music theme park -- and Ryman Auditorium, which was home to the Opry until the opening of Opryland in 1974, virtually the entire country music business has for years been lodged within this central district.
 
Nashville Cats
Been Playin' Since They Were Babies
 Among the new stars, there is a strong allegiance to the traditions and values of country music. Even the more mainstream performers, like Mr. Brooks, Alan Jackson and Vince Gill, whose music has a broad pop element, tend to lean toward the steel-string ballad style of country giants like George Jones and Merle Haggard. "We can't very well walk onstage and act like we've invented country music, because we didn't," says Travis Tritt. "I do a George Jones song every night in my set."
Marty Stuart, a singer and guitarist who backed stars like Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash in the late 60's and 70's, made a conscious decision to return to country's roots when he signed a contract with MCA as a solo artist in the late 80's. "I asked myself, 'What did you love about country music in the first place, when you were a little kid, that made you want to be a hillbilly singer?' " he says. "I went to the Hall of Fame and walked around. I said, 'I like that part about Hank Williams's suit. This is my favorite era of music.' I started collecting guitars and memorabilia and everything that had to do with my favorite time of country music. I thought, I'm going to show that you can combine that old world with this new thing and make it work."
But if a small-town atmosphere clings to Nashville, it also infuses the country music industry, which operates as a self-contained entity, isolated from the rest of the nation's music industry. While labels like MCA, Capitol and Warner Brothers have country-music divisions in Nashville, these branches function independently from their parent companies in Los Angeles or New York. And the independence extends to money: if Garth Brooks sells eight million records for Capitol, the profits feed back into Nashville, not into the bigger pop division in Los Angeles. The pop division, therefore, has no incentive to help the artist break out.
This division has a lot to do with country music's marginalization from the mainstream pop world. In the past, for a country singer to have a hit, the label had to, in effect, boot the artist out of the country ghetto and into the pop world at large. But this crossover usually entailed diluting a singer's country appeal to make the music more palatable to pop-radio programmers, and trading off the smaller but loyal country audience for the larger but fickle pop market. Examples of successful crossover acts are Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.
What is unusual about the current success of Garth Brooks is that no crossover has been attempted. With a few exceptions, Mr. Brooks's songs are played only on country radio stations; even his recent single "Shameless," which was written by Billy Joel, has not crossed over to Top 40 radio. And according to Jimmy Bowen of Capitol, no crossover attempt is planned. "I'm not trying to take Garth over to pop radio," Mr. Bowen says. "Who needs it? If those people want Garth, they'll come over here and find him. I'm not about to play the pop independent promotion game to go after an audience that's coming our way."
Adds Tony Brown: "It's expensive to take a record to the top. So why spend that money to have a pop hit when Garth's already selling more records than Guns 'n' Roses? We've never had an act like Garth, as long as I've been in Nashville. Garth doesn't need to cross over. He has crossed over, just because he's so huge."
Mr. Brown sees the crossover game as something of a no-win situation. "Country isn't like pop music," he explains. "If it's rootsy it's too rootsy for pop radio, and if it's contemporaried up a little bit, it sounds like a real bad version of pop music."
Mr. Brooks's success could be a turning point for the country music industry: it confirms that country can have widespread popularity without catering to the pop side of the business. Trisha Yearwood, whose self-titled album includes a duet with Mr. Brooks called "Like We Never Had a Broken Heart," puts it simply: "Garth Brooks debuting on the pop charts at No. 1 helps all of us. It's neat that we're having an appeal to pop audiences without having to compromise our music."
 
Ropin' the Bucks
Where Country Is Still Country
 While the current resurgence of country music may seem to have happened overnight, its roots actually go back to the mid to late 80's, when singers like Steve Earle, Dwight Yoakam, Lyle Lovett and K. D. Lang earned national acclaim as part of the "new traditionalist" movement. While none of these performers had huge commercial success, they tried, in their own ways, to dig past country's middle-of-the-road doldrums and reclaim some of the values that lay at the music's core.
Mr. Yoakam took the tough hillbilly twang of classic country records from the 40's and 50's and gave it a rock-and-roll spin; Ms. Lang revamped the balladry of Patsy Cline with a dose of post-feminism. Mr. Lovett delved into western swing and released an album, "Lyle Lovett and His Large Band," that paired traditional country on one side with big-band material on the other. The new traditionalists combined a fierce allegiance to country's roots with rebelliousness against its current stagnation.
At the same time, more mainstream country acts like Randy Travis, the Judds and Reba McEntire broke through commercially. As a result, a stagnant country industry experienced a strong influx of new talent.
Travis Tritt, whose single "Here's a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)" helped push his second album for Warner Brothers, "It's All About to Change," over the one million sales mark, believes that people like Mr. Travis and Mr. Yoakam paved the way for his current success. "I came along," he says, "at a time when the record label was starting to realize, 'Hmmm, we signed these new artists and they're making us money. Maybe we ought to open our doors a little bit.' "
The new traditionalists reaffirmed that it was O.K. for country to be country. This, more than anything, seems to be the lesson learned by Mr. Brooks and others in the new generation, and helps explain why Mr. Brown doesn't consider the current resurgence a fad. "I think the South is the last frontier," he says. "There's some weird people down here. We're just not as uptown. And I think that's the charm of the South -- that's the charm of country music."
The heart of the matter, he adds, is that "occasionally we're going to have somebody that gets as big as Garth Brooks, or as big as Johnny Cash. But I think that's a lot better than in pop music, where people get Garth on a year-to-year basis, then they're gone. Every time we have one -- hell, there'll be a statue of Garth Brooks in about five years."
 
 
 
THE GRAND OLE OPRY TIME MACHINE
 On a Saturday evening in October, at a time when he was selling more records than any other performer in the United States, Garth Brooks got up and played three songs on stage at the Grand Ole Opry. Behind him was a backdrop showing a wooden barn, the crossbeam of which read "WSM 650," the call letters of the AM station that broadcasts the Opry. In front of him were 4,400 people, whose flash cameras popped like firecrackers during his 15-minute performance.
The Grand Ole Opry has changed remarkably little since its inaugural broadcast in 1924. The Opryhouse is a modern, high-budget affair with two tiers of orange-cushioned seats and a plush red curtain that rises and falls between acts. But the Opry has never abandoned its roots. Announcers still read ads live on the air from very real sponsors like Dollar General Store and Goody's Headache Powder; in the lobby are programs from Opry broadcasts in the 20's and 30's. Set into the stage is a circle of floorboard from Ryman Auditorium, the previous site for the Opry, where country legends like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline performed in the 50's and 60's.
On any given Friday or Saturday night, audiences can still see Porter Wagoner, Roy Acuff or the 90-year-old bluegrass picker Bill Monroe on the Opry stage back to back with younger stars; there are two shows each evening, and all four are broadcast on WSM, a station that reaches most of the eastern United States. While some cynics refer to the Opry as an "old folks' home," its hipness has increased as younger performers have been added to the roster.
Marty Stuart, a guitarist and singer who recently released his second album, "Tempted," has a reverence for Opry traditions: "We may go on to be bigger in the world market, we may go on to sell more records, but right now you can see Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl and Garth Brooks -- that's one end of the string to the other, and everything in between."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A box in the Arts and Leisure section on Jan. 5 with a front-page article about country music misstated Bill Monroe's age and the date the Grand Ole Opry started broadcasting. Mr. Monroe is 80, and the Opry's first broadcast was in 1925. The article also misstated the date Marty Stuart first appeared with Lester Flatt; it was 1972. Because of an editing error, Mr. Stuart's album "Tempted" was described incorrectly. It was his second for MCA, but not his second overall.

HEADLINE: Welcome: Foreign Businesses, and Jobs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
AS the economy sags, a new psychological syndrome -- resentment of foreign companies -- has emerged. On the other hand, foreign companies are welcomed because they provide jobs.
There is no evidence in Westchester of hostility toward foreign companies, said Gregory A. Russo, chairman of the board of directors of the County Chamber of Commerce in White Plains. Moreover, Mr. Russo said, eight foreign-owned companies that have made Westchester their home base in the United States were saluted last month at the county chamber's annual meeting. 
 "It was the third year that we have cited the leading privately owned businesses in the county, but the first time that we have mentioned the foreign companies headquartered in the county," Mr. Russo said. "In light of the recession, we thought this year was a good time to spotlight the foreign companies that have made a significant contribution to the economy of the area," he said. "So along with honoring 50 of the leading privately owned businesses in the county, we've included the top eight foreign companies."
Mr. Russo, who is the partner in charge of the international accounting concern KPMG Peat Marwick's White Plains office, continued: "Although I have heard that there is some backlash against Japanese companies, possibly because of the trade imbalance, in my experience, Westchester has welcomed foreign companies with open arms. We have a good mixture of international companies who have chosen to settle here. They run substantial operations, and the biggest thing they add is jobs."
Almost all jobs in foreign companies, ranging from the 20 employees at Minteco USA in White Plains, a metals and minerals trading company with a Peruvian parent, to the 400 employees at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines USA in Elmsford, are held by Westchester residents, including a number of executive positions.
 
U.S. Firm 'With Japanese Parent
 "It's nice to be honored, but we consider ourselves to be an American company with a Japanese parent," said Thomas H. Shay, director of corporate communications at Fuji Film USA in Elmsford. "In addition to the 200 people we employ at our headquarters here, we have four factories and distribution centers across the United States that generate about 1,000 jobs, which are almost all held by American citizens."
When asked if Fuji had seen people's atttitudes worsening here toward companies with Japanese connections, Mr. Shay said, "On the contrary, we've been doing business in the United States for 20 years and for the last 5 1/2 years in Westchester, and we've been very warmly received in both Manhattan and in Westchester. We consider ourselves an active member of the Westchester community, and we give numerous Westchester projects our full support."
Much the same sentiment was expressed by Dr. Aldo E. Belloni, a chemical engineer who is president of Lotepro Corporation in Valhalla. Lotepro's parent company is Linde A.G. in Munich.
"Backlash? Resentment because we are successful and come from Germany? We have experienced none of this. This is an ideal environment for us," Dr. Belloni said. "We are a company of industrial engineers and contractors who build plants for the production of industrial gas for large established companies, such as Union Carbide in Tarrytown. We opened our first office in Manhattan in 1962 to be near our largest market, which is in the United States and in Canada."
 
More Space for Less Money
 Six years ago, Lotepro moved from Manhattan to Valhalla because, Dr. Belloni said, "We were able to obtain the larger space we needed for our operations at a more economical price in Westchester." "Our work force has grown to include 150 people, all Americans."
When Minteco USA opened its office in Manhattan in 1975, it was as a representative of a state-owned metals and minerals trading company in Peru.
"However, in 1980, we became a full trading company, registered in the United States," said Ivan Kostich, who is Minteco's office manager. "And now, although we deal in metals and minerals from markets all over the world, our primary source is still Peru."
Nine years ago, the company, which now employs 20 people, moved to offices at 10 Bank Street in White Plains.
"There is a wonderful approach to life in Westchester," Mr. Kostich said, "and the county has become a very interesting international community with a good mix of businesses from all over the world. And we have to have easy access to the airports because we do a lot of business with Korean and South American companies."
 
Better Space in Westchester
 Also in the building at 10 Bank Street are the commercial and technical offices of ILVA USA, whose parent company, ILVA S.P.A., in Genoa, is Italy's leading steel producer and one of the world's largest organizations that produces and exports steel in the international marketplace.
According to an ILVA spokesman, the company, which has sales offices in major cities in the United States, moved 20 of its employees to Westchester from Manhattan in 1989 "because we found better space here, and yet White Plains was easily accessible for us to the airports and to New York City, where our executives go several times a week."
Two-and-a-half years ago, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines USA moved the overall operations of its headquarters in the United States to a building in the Robert Martin Park in Elmsford.
"With 400 employees, 99 percent of them American, we found better accommodations here than we were able to find in New York City," said Toon H. Woitman, the area manager. "And we were able to negotiate a very favorable 99-year lease."
 
Easy Access to Transportation
 Westchester, Mr. Woitan said, is not only an extremely convenient location for KLM, with easy access to highways and railroads, but, he added, "We found a very important bonus here in the form of a well-educated labor force we can draw from, which is essential for our type of business."
Because all of KLM's 800-line telephone calls and other things are handled in Westchester, electronics were also important, Mr. Woitan said. "We have a state-of-the-art building, and the business climate around us is excellent and interesting. Many of our neighbors are also international companies."
The County Chamber of Commerce intends to recognize the contributions of foreign companies along with Westchester companies every year, Mr. Russo said. "We hope that more foreign companies will choose Westchester for their corporate homes. They make a very strong contribution to the community, and we are delighted to have them as neighbors."

HEADLINE: All About/Basketball Shoes;
High Tops: High Style, High Tech, High Cost

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
When Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls basketball team began advertising basketball shoes a few years ago -- the Air Jordan line by Nike Inc. -- he was selling high-tech style as much as performance. Unlike their low-tech, black-and-white predecessors, today's basketball shoes are made of light-weight leathers and synthetics dyed in a dazzling array of colors with vivid, high-contrast, graphic designs. They are also constructed with sophisticated cushioning devices and fitting systems.
And they are expensive. PF Flyers and U.S. Keds, the standbys of a generation or two ago, rarely cost more than $10 or $15 a pair -- roughly $20 now. Today's popular styles can cost as much as $160. 
 High style -- and higher prices -- have made basketball shoes big business. They are now the largest niche in the $7.6 billion wholesale market for sport shoes. According to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, an industry group in North Palm Beach, Fla., wholesale sales of basketball shoes -- high tech as well as canvas -- totaled about $1.7 billion in 1990. Most of those sales -- about 85 percent -- were for just five brands: Nike, Reebok, Converse, L.A. Gear and Adidas.
The market for basketball shoes has been growing rapidly, too. Between 1986 and 1990, the market grew at a rate of about 19 percent a year, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence, an industry newsletter in Glen Mills, Penn. Last year, largely because of the recession and market saturation, the market expanded by just 4.1 percent.
But industry analysts are hopeful that 1992 will show strong growth. "With excitement building around the Olympics, I expect 1992 to be a peak year for basketball shoes," said Dick Silverman, associate publisher of Footwear News, a trade newspaper in New York.
 
Venerable Converse
The Canvas Sneaker Fades Away
 When it comes to breeding, Converse Inc., the North Reading, Mass., athletic-shoe maker, is the original. Converse has been making its popular All Star canvas basketball sneaker since 1917. In 1923, it renamed the shoe the Chuck Taylor All Star after Chuck Taylor, a popular basketball player of the time who joined the company as a spokesman in 1921. Converse has sold more than 500 million pairs of All Stars.
But despite Converse's early start, the market is now dominated by Nike, of Beaverton, Ore. and Reebok, of Stoughton, Mass. Nike, which sells about $500 million worth of basketball shoes a year, has about 40 percent of the market. Reebok, which does not disclose sales figures for specific shoe categories, has about 16 percent of the market. Converse retains 9 percent of the market.
Nike and Reebok spent about $130 million each in 1991 on television advertising for their products, in what was called the "sneaker wars." The commercials feature players from the National Basketball Association and claim the companies' high-tech shoes gave the players an edge.
"I can't deny that a lot of this is about marketing," said Peter Ruppe, Nike's manager for basketball marketing. "But the key thing is to make a great product."
While the companies' advertising appeals may be pitched to athletes, 80 percent of the sporting shoes purchased are never used in play. "A large majority of these shoes are being worn as street wear," Mr. Silverman said. "The companies don't want to own up to that," he said.
Even so, play-related advertising sells shoes. According to John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, which surveys retailers, in 1990, 37 percent of all basketball shoe buyers based their purchases on advertising; 25 percent based their decisions on technology and 23 percent were motivated by fashion. Only 10 percent bought basketball shoes on the basis of information about quality and price.
 
Nike Nonpareil
Wear the Shoe, Be Like Mike?
 Even its competitors admit that when it comes to marketing and promotion, Nike is without peer. Mickey Bell, executive vice president of Converse, credits Nike with changing the rules of the game in the early 1980's by focusing on marketing rather than manufacturing issues.
The breakthrough came when Nike signed rising superstar Michael Jordan and introduced the Air Jordan line in 1985. "That changed everything," Mr. Bell said. Building brand recognition by tying it to a single star athlete fueled Nike's success.
Along with Mr. Jordan, Nike features National Basketball Association stars like David Robinson, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen to sell its Air Force and Air Flight lines. It pays John Thompson, coach of Georgetown University's Hoyas basketball team, $200,000 a year to endorse its shoes.
Mr. Ruppe acknowledges that Mr. Jordan, who is paid about $6 million annually by Nike, was the "paradigm" for today's advertising. Television ads featuring Mr. Jordan and film maker Spike Lee continue to win awards and drive Nike sales. Nike's overall slogan is "Just Do It." But its other slogan, "It's gotta be the shoes!" is now frequently heard on the nation's basketball courts after a stirring play is made in a pickup game. Mr. Ruppe said that Air Jordans, which sell for about $130, make up about 10 percent of its basketball shoe sales.
For the fall of 1992, Nike will offer 17 models of basketball shoes, ranging in price from $50 to $130. The most popular model sells for about $75.
Reebok, which only entered the basketball shoe arena in 1986, has challenged Nike with its own high-visibility marketing campaign. Its slogan is "Life is Short, Play Hard." Rather than tie its brands to a specific athlete, Reebok tries to "talk the talk and walk the walk" of the average basketball player, according to John Morgan, vice president of the performance division.
Most recently, Reebok tied its fortunes to its Pump technology, along with a new line of outdoor sneakers called Blacktop. The hugely successful Pump shoe, which incorporates an inflatable bladder into the upper portion of the sneaker, helped Reebok gain market share at Nike's expense.
The company has sold more than 6 million pairs of Pumps, bringing in more than $750 million in revenues since they were introduced in 1989. Reebok offers nearly a dozen models of basketball shoes ranging in price from $50 to $160. Mr. Morgan said the company's mainstay is its $55 shoe, which accounts for 40 percent of its basketball shoe sales.
 
Shoe Technology
The Science of Fine-Tuning
 "Fit is the battleground," said Nike's Mr. Ruppe. Nike continues to tinker with its Air technology, which uses lightweight stretch material along with its patented midsole system, to provide better cushioning.
Nike is intent on reducing the weight of its shoes and improving the cushioning without adding features like bladders. The hope, Mr. Ruppe said, is to offer a high-performance shoe for a lower price "to make it accessible for kids who can't spend over $100." A long list of new technologies is being incorporated into basketball shoes.
"The shoes are genuinely better. It's not just marketing hype," Mr. Horan said. "No N.B.A. player would want to go through a season with Chuck Taylor All Stars today."
Converse will introduce its React System in 1992. According to Mr. Bell, React incorporates a "responsive gas-charged fluid" that flows through compartments within the shoe. The system includes an ankle wrap that adjusts to fit an individual's ankle and a heel module to stabilize against shock.
"Technology is the missing link we needed in basketball," Mr. Bell said. "We had great price, great ads, but we were missing technology." Reebok, whose Pump line sales are already slowing down, is still committed to the technology.
"We're evolving it to the cutting edge," Mr. Morgan said. The $160 Double Pump shoe, with two bladders and a switching device to allow the wearer to inflate different sections of the shoe, will appear this year.
 
 
 
YOUNG, MALE AND WILLING TO SPEND

Andrew Albert, a 33-year old newsletter publisher from West Orange, N.J., plays pickup basketball at least once a week. He owns two pairs of basketball shoes: a pair of Adidas sneakers for outdoor play and a pair of Nikes for inside the gym.
Mr. Albert is typical of many older players who have made basketball a lifelong pursuit -- and who buy their shoes on sale. He paid $57 for his Nikes. "I wouldn't spend $100 on shoes," he said. "Anything over $60 and I break into a sweat."
While Mr. Albert is an important customer, he is not the most important for the manufacturers. According to John Morgan, vice president of the performance shoe division of Reebok International Ltd., the most frequent purchasers basketball shoes are male and between the ages of 12 and 20. "They buy 70 percent of the shoes," he said.
These young buyers do not wait until the prices are marked down to spend their money. According to John Horan, publisher of a trade industry newsletter, teen-agers are willing to pay $90 or more for their shoes. "A 15-year old isn't very sensitive to what is happening in the economy," he said. "If they have to cut lawns or rake leaves to get the shoes, they'll do it."
The most important sales outlets for basketball shoes are the national and regional speciality-shoe chains like the Foot Locker, Athlete's Foot and Athletic Attic. These stores, which sell at full retail price, are often located in malls. That makes them particularly attractive to the 14-to-17-year-old group. Following these stores in importance are the sporting goods stores and discount chains.
Nike and Reebok produce most of their shoes in South Korea, Taiwan, China and Indonesia. With their minimal production costs, basketball shoes are quite profitable. The wholesale cost of the $130 Air Jordan is $68.75, said John Ruppe, Nike's manager for basketball-shoe marketing. The cost of making them is about $30.

HEADLINE: Computer Companies Say State Tax Hampers Them

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
PAUL M. COFONI, vice president of Computer Sciences Corporation and manager of its center in Norwich, sees big growth for his industry in the next few years, he said. But he is not sure whether any of that growth will be in Connecticut, he said, because the state puts a 6 percent tax on computer services.
During the next three years the total spent nationwide on computer services will grow to $15 billion from $7 billion, Mr. Cofoni said. "If we're successful, and we know we will be, we'll have a major share of that," he said. But he cannot predict how many of those new jobs will be in Connecticut, he said, or whether the 500 jobs the company has in the state now will still be around. 
 Mr. Cofoni and executives of other computer service companies in the state said they were concerned that the state's tax on services would hamper their ability to compete. The only other state that taxes computer services is Texas, at a rate of 1.5 percent, they said.
 
'It's Very Easy to Move'
 A. Searle Field, Deputy Commissioner of the State Economic Development Department, said he knew of six companies, with a total of 3,000 to 4,000 employees, that were considering leaving the state because of the tax, which was imposed in 1975. More worrisome, he said, is that few other companies will bring their computer centers, with thousands of new high-paying jobs, to Connecticut if the tax is in place.
"With computers and telecommunications, it's very easy to move to another state," Mr. Field said. "And there's going to be a significant cost to the state if we lose these jobs."
Mr. Field said computer and telecommunications services are lumped into a category with seven other types of business activities for tax purposes. Together they generate $68 million in tax revenues, he said, so the loss of taxes would not be significant in a $7 billion state budget.
The income tax and sales taxes paid by people in the jobs will more than outweigh any loss from the services tax, he said, noting that Computer Sciences employees in Norwich are paid an average of $40,000 a year. But if the companies are forced out, those taxes, and the payroll of $20 million, are lost, he said.
Mr. Field said he expected legislation to be submitted next year to exempt computer and telecommunications services from the tax. But State Senator William A. DiBella, Democrat of Hartford, a member of the Commerce and Finance Committees, said he was not sure how well it would fare.
"I don't think, when we see the analysis of the fiscal impact, that it's going to fly," Mr. DiBella said. "I have no problem looking at it, but I'm very skeptical. There are hundreds of other industries that are job creating as well. We can't exempt them without looking at the fiscal impact."
 
Heavier Tax on Airplanes
 Mr. Field said staff members of the Economic Development Department have been meeting with other state officials on proposed tax changes that would make Connecticut more competitive in attracting new business. Although the effort was inspired by the tax on computer and telecommunications services, he said, the meetings have also looked at the way Connecticut taxes airplanes that are kept in the state.
The tax on airplanes is so much heavier than those in surrounding states, Mr. Field said, that owners have taken to storing their planes at airports in Westchester County and in places like Westerly, R.I., Worcester, Mass., to avoid the tax. That means the state loses that tax, plus levies on sales of fuel, parts and repairs, he said.
"In good times there's no need to examine every nickel and dime in a corporate budget," Mr. Field said. "But when times get tough, they start focusing on every marginal expense and finding ways to cut them. We have to position the state for long-term success."
Joseph F. Brennan, lawyer for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said the group is working with the Economic Development Department on possible modifications to the state tax structure that would help businesses. In addition to the tax on computer and telecommunications services, the group is examining how manufacturing equipment is taxed, and other ways to stop the loss of manufacturing jobs in the state, he said.
The association is looking at "areas we feel would go the longest toward improving the business climate," Mr. Brennan said. He said the organization's government affairs program will probably be released in January. But he noted that computer services have been taxed in Connecticut since 1975, so he was not sure how much of an effect the tax was having.
Mr. Cofoni said the situation for computer services is critical now because of the potential for growth. Until now, most companies have handled their own data processing and computer system development, so the services were not taxed. But many Fortune 500 corporations, and most smaller companies, have hired outside computer service companies or are planning to do so, he said. A specialized company handling computer services for several clients can afford better, more efficient computers and make better use of its staff, he said.
 
'Get Out of the Blocks'
 Computer Sciences, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., is among the leaders in the field, along with companies like I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems, Mr. Cofoni said. But the field is exploding, he said, and any company could take the lead.
"For us to be successful, we need to get out of the blocks real quick and have a profitable operation on the first few contracts we win," Mr. Cofoni said. He said he was having discussions with 17 potential clients.
"We're projecting a half-billion dollars of growth in 1992 and a billion dollars a year by 1995," he said. "What that can mean is substantial numbers of jobs here in southeastern Connecticut."
In an area that is heavily dependent on military contractors and is thus suffering because of Federal cutbacks, that growth could ease the transition to a diversified economy, Mr. Cofoni said.
"This is the time to catch it," he said. "If we wait, five years from now it will be too late. The market is emerging too fast."
If Connecticut does not repeal the tax, Computer Sciences probably will not expand its Connecticut operation and might be forced to close it, the company has told Norwich city officials. Mr. Cofoni declined to say if the center would shut down, but he warned: "Management has to reserve all of its alternatives. I can't rule anything out."
 
'A Hit Like No One Else'
 The situation is devastating, Mr. Field said, because the levy on computer services is separate from the state's corporate profits tax, which was recently lowered to 10 percent from 14 percent as a way of making the state more attractive to business.
A business with gross revenues of $100,000 might make a $4,000 profit, and pay $400 in corporate tax, he said. But a computer services company pays the 6 percent tax on the entire $100,000, or $6,000, which would leave it with a $2,000 deficit if it operates with the same profit margin.
"That's a hit like no one else gets," Mr. Field said. "Companies don't have the kind of profit margins to cover that. They have a 3 or 4 percent profit, especially in times like this. It's a case where we're clearly at a competitive disadvantage."
Mr. Field declined to name the other companies he said are considering moving out of Connecticut, but he said the Governor has talked about putting together a package of grants and inducements to attract more computer service jobs to Connecticut if the tax situation is resolved.
"We have the opportunity in front of us to see significant growth," Mr. Field said. "And we're not talking about simple data processing here. That kind of thing can be done in other countries for $1 an hour, and we can't compete with that. These are jobs in design, in research and development, high-paying jobs. That is what the manufacturing of the future will consist of."

HEADLINE: A Shelter Reaches Out to 'Children in Crisis'

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
A FEW months ago the parents snapped. They deposited their three children -- 2, 4 and 6 years old -- on a neighbor's doorstep, saying only, "Please take care of them." Then the couple, residents of an affluent town in lower Fairfield County, took off.
The youngsters ended up in three different foster homes across the state. If they had been 12 and older, they could have found help together at the Youth Shelter on Prospect Street in Greenwich, which provides around-the-clock crisis intervention and is a temporary home for teen-agers with family problems. 
 As of March 1, families with younger children will have the same services available at a new shelter called Kids in Crisis, which will be housed temporarily at the Greenwich site. Ultimately, both shelters will operate from a single building in the Stamford-Greenwich area.
The new program for children up to 11 will be the first of its kind in the United States, said the executive director of the private, nonprofit Youth Shelter, Shari Shapiro, who had told the story of the vanishing parents.
The need for expanded service came to light in a study conducted recently for the Youth Shelter by the Junior League of Greenwich.
"What came back from over 125 professionals -- day care workers, pediatricians, social workers, child care providers -- was that there's an overwhelming need to help children in crisis, birth to 11," Mrs. Shapiro said. "We had an amazing response. We had pediatricians who put children in hospital beds to keep them safe, or would not release a newborn because the home was not a safe place for that child to be."
 
A Tragic Story
 Mrs. Shapiro told a tragic story that might have had a different ending if the Kids in Crisis center had been in place:
"A young mother in Norwalk with a 2-year-old and a 2 1/2-month-old baby and suffering from severe postpartum blues called the Youth Shelter. She gave counselors there her phone number but not her address. We were very frightened that she was going to harm herself or her children. We traced her address. But a call came from her boyfriend. She had just slit her wrists.
"So much of what we do is working with the family as a whole. Those children under 12, there's no safe place, and no one they can call 24 hours a day. There are virtually no foster homes in lower Fairfield County -- at a time when the needs are increasing."
In October the Federal Department of Housing and Human Services awarded a three-year grant totaling $600,000 to the State Department of Children and Youth Services to develop Kids in Crisis, known in the official argot as a regional crisis nursery. A joint venture of the Junior League of Greenwich and the Youth Shelter, Kids in Crisis will need $694,000 annually, Mrs. Shapiro said, and setting up the combined shelters at a new site will require $1.5 million.
 
Bustle of Activity
 On a recent morning the Youth Shelter bustled with activity. A man delivered boxes of donated food, telephones rang, counselors conferred with each other and laughter occasionally filled the hallways. Sign-up sheets for chores and television time hung on a kitchen wall. The smell of frying eggs and sausages permeated the air. While most of the inhabitants had gone off to school, two girls remained for tutoring.
One of the girls came from an affluent family, the other from a poor one. One was articulate and outgoing; she had been at the shelter for six weeks, having gotten an extension on the normal three-week stay. The other, who arrived just a week before with only the clothes on her back, had little to say. But both said they were driven out of their homes by overwhelming family problems, and they had become friends.
"When I got here last week, she gave me a big hug," said the new girl, a 15-year-old, one of eight children. "I was already welcomed when I walked in the door." She said that because of problems with her father, she and her mother had been seeing a social worker who referred them to the Youth Shelter. "It's the only place I can go right now," she said, seated at the big dining table.
The other girl, also 15, who had just led a visitor on a tour of the house, came to the Youth Shelter from a foster family, she said, but her problems originated with her mother.
"My mother abused me, and I couldn't take it anymore," she said. "When I was 11, I ran away a few times and came to live with my grandparents in Newtown. Then I went into the hospital for depression, because my mother said she was coming to take me back. I was in for 40 days, out for a week and 3 days, and back in for 17 days. I tried to kill myself."
"I didn't know that," said her new friend.
The other girl continued: "When I went back to the hospital the second time, I was assigned a social worker. From there I went to the Waterbury shelter. I left there and went to a foster home in Danbury, and from there to a foster home in Ridgefield. Then I went back to the hospital and here. It's the best shelter. It's clean, the staff pay attention to you."
Two counselors are on duty 24 hours a day in the locked shelter. "That's what I need, someone to listen to me," said the newcomer.
Both girls have hopes for the future, they said. The new arrival hopes "to go back home and straighten things out with my father, get to know him, work things out," she said.
The other girl said: "I hope to get into a foster home in Ridgefield. And if that doesn't come through, I hope to go to a group home in Westport called Project Return." She no longer wants to kill herself, she said.
Lin Lavery, chairwoman of the Kids in Crisis project, said, "When you heal the child, you heal the community." To help raise the money for the expanded program, she enlisted the actor-director Ron Howard, who lives in Greenwich, to appear in a fund-raising video.
"We really wanted to get across what we do," Mrs. Lavery said. "We wanted someone who was a family person, who represents the image of a healthy family, a commitment to family."
Mr. Howard, father of four, donated a morning to appear in the three-minute video, which will be offered to television stations as a public service message. But before making the commitment, he and his wife spent two hours at the Youth Shelter.
"I had never been to one of these places," he said in a telephone interview. "I didn't know what to expect. We were very impressed with it. We met some of the kids who were there. I thought it was very impressive in its humanistic environment. I was surprised in an area in Fairfield County how busy they are and the range of people they have -- in age, economic background, racial background."
Mr. Howard does not appear in many public service announcements, he said.
"I try to steer clear of it," he said. "You have to have some sense of what you're talking about. I have a good feeling about this. They are dealing with a very intense reality in terms of these kids. Their function is not to take people out of their homes but to provide a place where people can go and solve their problems.
"It takes a lot for people to collect themselves in a rational way. I hope my children never need a place like this. But if my children are feeling backed into a corner, it's very important to know that it exists."
The Youth Shelter is facing a dramatic growth in the demand for its service, Mrs. Shapiro said, thanks to a growing public awareness of its availability and increased pressures on families from the economic downturn. She pointed out that when the shelter opened in 1980, 125 teen-agers were helped during the year. By 1989 that number had jumped to 892. In the last fiscal year 1,418 young people sought asylum.
"We're working with families that are very, very wealthy as well as those who don't have a penny to their name," Mrs. Shapiro said. "A crisis can happen in any family."
The Youth Shelter -- which serves Darien, Greenwich, New Canaan, Norwalk, Stamford, Weston, Westport and Wilton -- works with 78 agencies to help families cope with their problems.
One girl who was confined to a wheelchair repeatedly fled from her home to escape her fast-track, alcohol-abusing divorced parents, shelter staff members said. Counselors from the shelter worked with the girls' parents, referring them to an appropriate agency to seek help with their problems.
"It's critical that people know who we are: the parents, the kids, the clergy, the police, schools -- every way you can imagine -- friends, relatives and grandparents," said Mrs. Shapiro. To get the word out to youngsters, an annual Youth Press Conference is held in the fall, for students from school newspapers and journalism and video classes in all eight towns.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Getting Off to a Fast Start in Great Neck

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
THE six-week-old North Street Grill in Great Neck is the Island's hottest new restaurant. It has the look, ownership expertise and exciting menu that make it the last word in 1990's dining.
The multi-level restaurant that has emerged on the site of the old Maude Craig's is a stunner. It is earthy, sturdy and southwestern, yet light, airy and modern. 
 Imposing stained-glass light fixtures typify this fusion. They glow with a blend of Art Deco and American Indian geometric designs. The dining room is dominated by them, along with the high ceilings, wood timbers, skylights and a bustling open kitchen.
The culinary superstar behind this new enterprise is Brendan Walsh, who earned his chef stripes at Arizona 206 in Manhattan and Coyote Grill in Island Park. Mr. Walsh is part owner of North Street Grill and oversees its kitchen, as well as the one at Coyote Grill.
The menu hints at Mr. Walsh's Southwestern style, with a salsa here and a chili-spiked hollandaise there, but the offerings are a far cry from straight Santa Fe fare. The food is up-to-the-minute American with an overlay of Italian trendsetters like focaccia, polenta, wood-oven pizza and innovative pastas.
All is not perfection at this storybook-sounding restaurant, although it should be noted that it is only a few weeks old. Service is shaky and some dishes are disappointments.
On a busy Saturday night, service was a study in smiling neglect. Our waiter was amiable, but we were left to pour our own wine. We also failed to receive bread. That was unfortunate, because the chewy focaccia strewn with onions and peppers, and the crusty country-style bread, both baked in the restaurant's wood oven, are too good to miss.
Additionally, the young people who delivered the meal were fuzzy about who ordered what and plunked dishes down at random. Even on a slower weeknight, when service was attentive, there was still a breakdown at delivery time.
Shortfalls from the kitchen included a watery pasta of penette with red beans and white-clam sauce. The dish arrived with no beans, no taste and no apologies. Less of a strikeout but garnering no accolades was the rib eye steak, which turned out to be a chewy shell steak look-alike.
These losers are not typical of North Street Grill. There is a nightly parade of winners, beginning with the herb- and garlic-flavored olives and the bouquet of two-foot-long crunchy breadsticks.
Do not miss the individual appetizer pizzas, with their crisp crusts pleasantly charred from the wood oven. My favorite had grilled eggplant, roasted peppers and a fillip of garlicky aioli.
Alluring seafood openers are house-smoked salmon, shrimp and sesame fritters paired with a creamy wasabi mustard and sea scallops skewered with a ribbon of pancetta and presented over crisp slices of marinated kohlrabi.
Three salads made fine beginings. A fall-away tender confit of duck accompanied by greens and a paper-thin homemade potato chip fan is the menu's most expensive appetizer at $9.50. More economical is the $4.50 market salad of impeccably fresh greens in a light balsamic vinaigrette. Also winning kudos was the wilted salad of julienned strips of endive crowned with walnuts and goat cheese.
A main-course choice with salad at its heart is lovely baby greens encircled with grilled vegetables. A splash of herb-infused olive oil was its delicious complement.
Fish fanciers will reel in a keeper with either the crusty pan-seared salmon resting on a bed of lentils or the wood oven-roasted channel bass ringed with ratatouille and annointed with black olive paste.
At the top of the list for meat lovers is a house-made chicken chorizo sausage served with white beans and bitter greens. A half chicken rubbed with herbs and perched atop a bread salad consisting of greens, toasted croutons and dried cranberries also scored.
Beef tenderloin, unlike the rib eye steak, was tender perfection. It was enhanced by a tomato-chili hollandaise and a nest of chopped asparagus.
Every entree has its own well-matched vegetable accompaniments. Nevertheless, there are $4 a la carte side dishes. The best is the array of crunchy baby vegetables. Potato pancakes were soggy, and sweet potato home fries were thick slices slathered with sauteed onions and peppers that did not fit the menu description.
Only an apple cobbler disappointed at dessert. Served piping hot rather than warm, its scoop of maple ice cream became an instant puddle. Ice creams are homemade, and the best is the fresh mint with its intense herb flavor.
Chocolate lovers swooned over a moist cupcake encircled with dollops of creamy chocolate pudding, as well as a rich slab of frozen chocolate mousse cake that melted on the tongue.
Wine and food are given equal billing at North Street Grill. More than 100 mostly American wines are available by the bottle, and 10 more can be ordered by the glass. Although a smattering of Italian, French and Long Island wines are on the list, its focus is on the small, high-quality, boutique wines of the West Coast.
Names seen only rarely on East Coast lists abound at North Street. They include Chappelet, Edna Valley, Chalk Hill, Arrowood, Dalla Valle, Page Mill and Frog's Leap. Wine can be ordered for as little as $15 a bottle and $3.75 a glass.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Doctors Form Network

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN a move to meet the health needs of a rapidly growing segment of the county's population, Spanish-speaking doctors have formed the county's first Hispanic medical society.
Dr. Felix Davila, a White Plains internist, has spearheaded the drive among Westchester doctors to help Hispanic residents who -- because of a language barrier, financial need or a lack of understanding of a new culture -- may not have access to medical care. 
 The first Westchester Spanish Medical Conference, held in White Plains in November, drew nearly 150 county doctors. Dr. Davila, who emigrated to the United States in 1965 from Nicaragua, organized the meeting and said that in addition to yearly dinner conferences, he planned to continue sponsoring gatherings and workshops yearlong to expand the efforts begun in the fall.
"Many Hispanic people are poor, do not have medical insurance and are overwhelmed by the cultural differences," Dr. Davila said. "They represent special needs that we must begin to address."
 
An 89 Percent Increase in 10 Years
 Hispanic residents account for about 1 in 10 of Westchester's population, and the census shows that their numbers have increased in the county by 89 percent over the last decade and by 337 percent since 1970.
"As the Hispanic community at large grows, we need to begin to unify the Spanish medical community," Dr. Davila said. "We need to get to know each other, network among ourselves and make referrals so that patients and doctors can come together."
According to the census, of the county's 874,866 residents in 1990, 86,194 were Hispanic, compared with 45,566 in 1980 and 25,506 in 1970.
Although there are no official counts of Hispanic doctors working in the county, Dr. Davila said there were "too few doctors to serve this population."
 
Shortage of Bilingual Staff
 Olga Mackenrow, an advocate for Hispanic residents with the County Department of Health, said that in addition to a shortage of Spanish-speaking doctors, there were also too few bilingual health-care workers at county-run medical clinics and hospitals. She cited instances at the County Medical Center in Valhalla of cleaning people in the building being asked to translate for patients because doctors and nurses did not speak Spanish.
Mrs. Mackenrow and Dr. Davila are encouraging Hispanic doctors to treat, on a sliding-scale basis, low-income patients without insurance or those on Medicaid, because, she said, "Many other private physicians refuse to treat them."
The county's Department of Health, too, is taking a hard look at the health needs of the county's Hispanic population, Commissioner Mark S. Rapoport said. The problems of Spanish-speaking people, he said, "loom very large on the horizon."
Dr. Rapoport cited national statistics showing that in 1989, 36.2 percent of Hispanic children lived in poverty, compared with 14.8 percent of white children.
"Westchester," he said, "does tend to mirror that."
 
Emotional Problems Also Addressed
 Doctors who attended the November conference and are beginning to identify the special concerns of Westchester's Spanish-speaking residents said it was important to assess not only the health needs of their patients but also their emotional problems.
"When a patient comes looking for help, we need to treat not just the disease but all aspects of life," said Dr. Elena L. Pena, a Mamaroneck psychiatrist from Salamanca, Spain.
"Many times, when a person immigrates," she said, "they are convinced that the place they left is all good, and the place they have come to is all bad, because they do not understand the language and because they have lost their emotional and religious supports from the past."
The language barrier, she said, was "especially important with psychiatry, because you miss a lot when you have to translate, and you can lose trust between the patient and the doctor."
 
'It's Not the Rich'
 Dr. Pena cautioned against generalizing about Hispanic patients, saying that there have been waves of immigration from different Spanish-speaking countries, with an early group of professionals emigrating from Cuba and recent groups coming from Central and South America.
The newest Hispanic immigrants are the working-class poor, Mrs. Mackenrow said. "It's not the rich ones now," she said, "but those who have come to make a better life for their children."
Dr. Manuel Sanguily, who emigrated from Cuba in 1960 and now works as a family practitioner in Tarrytown, said that because of his early experiences in the United States, he wanted to help the new groups of Hispanic immigrants.
"I feel very aware of my roots again," he said. "Yes, I am an American now, and I vote, but I am also Hispanic. The Spanish-speaking population settling in Westchester and trying to be part of the mainstream needs doctors like me who understand firsthand what they are going through."
 
'It's Time to Be Vociferous'
 "They need that arm over their shoulder, the handshake, that abrazo," Dr. Sanguily said. "It means that I'm your friend, and I am here to take care of you, to show you the way."
As important as it is to be sympathetic health-care providers, Spanish-speaking doctors must also learn to be more assertive in taking a leadership role in the medical community, Dr. Sanguily said.
"It's time to be vociferous," he added, "not to feel shy or inferior, even if our English is not as good as theirs.
Dr. Sanford A. Kaplan, president of the 1,800-member Westchester County Medical Society, described the newly formed doctors' group as a "much-needed avenue for bonding" among the Spanish-speaking medical community.
"It is important that Hispanic physicians develop an independent identity so that they can strike out in the socio-economic area and become leaders," Dr. Kaplan said. "They shouldn't feel that their background or where they came from inhibits that ascension to leadership. We welcome them."

HEADLINE: Rules Forcing Towns to Pick Big New Dumps or Big Costs

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUVERNE, Ala.

 BODY:
New Federal and state rules are forcing the closing of hundreds of old community garbage dumps and prompting the development of many fewer, but much larger landfills that only the biggest cities and the largest garbage companies can afford to build and operate.
And residents of thousands of small communities, like this one south of Montgomery, will be forced to choose the revenue and heavy truck traffic of a new nearby landfill or the huge increase in costs of transporting their garbage far away. What is definite, though, is that the new regulations are proving to be a bonanza to the nation's largest garbage companies. 
 "A little county like ours can't afford to build a new dump," said Dwight Faulk, the probate judge and chairman of the Crenshaw County Commission. "So we have to have a company do it for us. These laws were set up for big business to monopolize an industry."
 
Boon to Large Companies
 Industry executives agree. "There are only a handful of companies that will have the capabilities to provide the type of environmentally sound facilities that the public is demanding," said John C. Shirvinsky, vice president of public affairs for the Chambers Development Company, a Pittsburgh-based garbage company that operates 14 huge landfills around the country.
Rarely have environmental regulations produced as many political distractions for the communities they are written to protect, or meant as much to the bottom lines of the industry they are intended to regulate.
 
Upgrade or Close
 The intent of new Federal regulations, which were issued in October, was to eliminate toxic waste problems caused by community-owned dumps that leaked. The Government now requires new landfills to be built with plastic and clay liners, liquid collection and treatment systems, and other expensive environmental equipment that has raised the cost of opening a landfill to $10 million or more. Old town dumps that fail to meet the new requirements must close by 1993.
The new Federal rules, and a few older state laws including those established by New York and New Jersey, mean most of the 6,500 community dumps across the country will be forced to close within the next few years, the Environmental Protection Agency has said. In their place will be 1,000 or so immense modern landfills owned primarily by a dozen or so companies and intended to serve entire regions.
In effect, the Government may be helping to establish regional monopolies, and that worries some officials.
"It's not difficult to project a situation in the future where very few firms could have regional or statewide control on the management of public wastes," said Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation in New York, which will have fewer than 100 landfills by 1995, down from 518 in 1983. "If that occurs, it might be necessary for some kind of public utility regulations so that the public is not ripped off."
Garbage industry executives insist, though, that there is enough competition to protect homeowners and businesses. "There will not be so few landfills that a city has only one option for disposal," said Philip S. Angell, the special assistant to the chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, the nation's second-largest disposal company, in Houston. "There also will be a broader range of disposal options -- recycling, composting, incineration."
The big money in garbage, nevertheless, still remains in dumping it. Despite recycling and new incinerators that turn trash into steam, electricity and ash, the amount of garbage headed for landfills amounts to 130 million tons a year, according to the National Solid Wastes Management Association, the industry's trade group.
 
Battle in Alabama
 The nation's big garbage companies now earn $30 to more than $100 a ton to haul and dispose of the refuse. Managing garbage has grown into a $30-billion-a-year industry, and revenues are expected to double within five years, industry analysts say.
Industry executives warn potential investors that the path to a new landfill is strewn with political obstacles, and only 1 of 10 proposed landfills is actually built. But they also acknowledge that companies nimble enough to overcome local opponents and beat their competitors in building a new landfill can realize profits of 25 to 50 percent on revenues of more than $100,000 a day.
Thus, garbage companies are now battling for control of a region's garbage. And in few places is the fight more aggressive than in Alabama.
Only 10 or 12 of the state's 102 community and county landfills meet the new requirements of the Federal law and the rest will close by the end of 1993, according to state officials.
Garbage companies, led by Waste Management of Oak Brook, Ill., the nation's largest, and Browning-Ferris, are battling for their share of the nearly 13,000 tons of garbage dumped in landfills by Alabama every day. The two companies, and several smaller companies, have proposed replacing the state's community dumps with 15 large regional landfills.
The proposals have angered some residents who say they believe such large landfills are unnecessary to replace the unobtrusive small dumps. In Blount and Walker Counties, north of Birmingham, county leaders have been threatened with death for inviting Browning-Ferris to propose new regional landfills, residents and state officials said.
Environmental groups warned that the new dumps provide far more capacity than Alabama needs and aresituated to take advantage of Alabama's superior network of railways, waterways and highways to accept garbage from other states.
"We're being set up to become the garbage dumping ground of the nation," said Linda Guy, the president of the Alabama Environmental Coalition, a state environmental group. "If all these new dumps are built, we'll have capacity for 30,000 or 40,000 tons per day, three times what we produce."
 
Protecting Counties
 Executives from Waste Management and Browning-Ferris objected to Mrs. Guy's assertion. State law, they said, protects counties by requiring companies and communities to negotiate a contract that specifies the dozen or so counties that a new regional landfill would serve.
"It would be political and economic suicide for Waste Management or any other company here to import garbage from New York or New Jersey or any other state," said Steve Bradley, a Waste Management spokesman in Birmingham. "Alabama just won't tolerate it."
But Alabama is seeing garbage companies fiercely trying to derail another company's proposal for a new landfill. For decades, Crenshaw County's 14,000 residents used the garbage dump just north of Luverne. It cost Crenshaw County $80,000 a year to haul residents' garbage and operate the landfill, and families paid an average garbage fee of $10 a month, said Mr. Faulk, the probate judge.
About two years ago, Mr. Faulk said, county leaders recognized that the new Federal and state rules would require the county to either spend millions of dollars modernizing the old dump or build a new one at an even higher cost. Late in 1990, Crenshaw County's five commissioners signed a contract with a Florida company to close the old county dump at a cost of $100,000, and build a $10 million 200-acre landfill on the same land four miles north of town to serve residents from Crenshaw and nine neighboring counties.
The company, Three Rivers Construction of Marianna, Fla., was eager to gain a contract and promised benefits that have become common in Alabama and other states. Crenshaw County residents could dump their garbage free in the landfill and Three Rivers would pay the county $1.50 a ton for other garbage disposed there, a potential source of income to the county that eventually could be worth $300 to $800 a day. For the fiscal year 1991, the county's entire budget was $1.2 million.
The proposed landfill, which is awaiting state approval, stirred protests from residents who worried it was too big and would cause dangerous levels of truck traffic.
 
'People Wouldn't Stand for It'
 "If we just closed the dump and didn't build a new one, that meant we'd have to take our garbage out of the county to another dump where tip fees are going to be $20, $25, or $30 a ton," Mr. Faulk said. "Add the trucking costs and you can see that the cost of garbage disposal would go to $300,000 or $400,000 a year. People wouldn't stand for it."
But the project's biggest opponent has been Waste Away, a Montgomery-based garbage company and a business partner of Waste Management. Waste Away has a competing proposal to build its own $12 million landfill 35 miles east of here and wants the garbage from Crenshaw and surrounding counties to be dumped there to make the project more profitable. Crenshaw County would pay at least $24 a ton, plus hauling costs, to dump there.
At a public hearing last month in the Crenshaw County courthouse, Waste Away sent a team of lawyers and engineers to attack the Crenshaw landfill. One of Waste Away's engineers said the proposed Crenshaw County landfill site was unsuitable and could become a threat to the environment and public health. Charles Patterson, a lawyer for Waste Away, said a second landfill in the region would generate such competition for garbage that waste would come into the area from out of state. "We don't need another regional landfill," Mr. Patterson said.
Mr. Faulk and other commissioners were livid after the hearing. "What you are seeing here is raw power and greed," he said.
Sarah Clark, another commissioner, added: "The commissioners of Crenshaw County did what was best for Crenshaw County. If the people of Crenshaw County want to pay $30 a month for garbage pickup, it's up to them."

HEADLINE: Escape From Cuba: An Affair For Family and Friends, Too

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Ten days ago, at a ceremony in Havana, German Pompa Gonzalez was awarded a medal for "exemplary service" to the Cuban Revolution for his performance as a helicopter pilot. This morning, he sat in the living room of his sister-in-law's modest house in a Miami suburb, a wanted man back in his homeland but a hero to thousands of Cuban exiles here.
Mr. Pompa's journey to freedom began on Friday at dawn, when he awoke, dressed quietly in the uniform of Cuba's national airline so as not to wake fellow crew members still asleep in a staff dormitory and boarded the Russian-made MI-8 helicopter in which he normally ferried tourists around Cuba. 
 Three hours later, after picking up his wife and 32 more relatives and friends in a pasture and flying 200 miles across the Florida Strait, he landed his craft at Tamiami Executive Airport south of here and kissed American soil.
"We were flying barely two yards above the water, and there was always the danger that Castro's radar would detect us and force us down," Mr. Pompa, a 27-year-old lieutenant in the Cuban Air Force with two years of combat service in Angola, said of his daring flight. "Nevertheless, I felt a tremendous sense of equilibrium and calm. I knew that one way or another, it would soon be over."
After requesting political asylum, Mr. Pompa and all but one passenger were released from an Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center Saturday to the custody of relatives. Cubans are treated differently from those of other nationalities, like Haitians, and are eligible for legal residency in the United States in a year. This morning, Mr. Pompa and 13 other relatives, including his brother Gustavo and various cousins, awoke in Opa Locka in the two-bedroom house of his wife's sister Mery Diaz, a former political prisoner who arrived in Florida two years ago.
There, he learned, to his distress, of news reports from Havana that the Cuban Government was demanding the return of both the helicopter and its pilot. In addition, there were new uncertainties. "We need to put a roof of our own over our heads," Mr. Pompa said. "How do we find jobs? Who's going to give us orientation on how you live here?"
Ms. Diaz's house, whose principal decorations are a few religious pictures and a pair of small television sets, is normally home to five people but was filled to overflowing this morning. Mr. Pompa's wife, Maria de la Caridad Carrazana, emphasized that neither her sister nor their parents, who remain in Cuba and whose house is now reported to be under surveillance, knew of the escape plan in advance.
 
Idea Came From His Wife
 Mr. Pompa said it was his wife, dissatisfied with life under Communist rule, who initiated the idea of a mass escape by helicopter, the first of its kind since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in January 1959. "She was the planner, and I was the instrument," he said.
"I lived for many years cherishing the revolution," said the 44-year-old Ms. Carrazana, who has four children from an earlier marriage. "I loved it and worked for it and sacrificed for it, but the Cuban people have no rights any more, and nothing to eat or enjoy as diversions. Before too long, Cuba is going to be thrown back to the conditions it was in when Christopher Columbus discovered America."
As Mr. Pompa's brother and 20-year-old stepson Emilio, an automobile mechanic, examined a car parked in front of the house, another sister-in-law, who had not seen Ms. Carrazana since she left Cuba as a former political prisoner, entered and embraced Ms. Carrazana. "Girl, you look good, considering what you've just been through," she said.
"And why shouldn't I," Ms. Carrazana retorted. "Now we can begin to live. Now my grandchildren are going to know what it is like to say what they want, to celebrate Christmas and New Year's and the Three Kings' Day, to buy a soft drink or a bicycle when they want. In Cuba, there's no freedom, there's nothing."
Sustained for many years by billions of dollars of subsidies from the Soviet Union that have been gradually cut off over the last five years, the Cuban economy has gone into a tailspin. Food and fuel have long been rationed, but on Jan. 1, the Government imposed new restrictions on the consumption of gasoline and electricity, leading to cutbacks on bus routes, store hours, television programming and other aspects of daily life.
At the same time, Mr. Castro, alarmed by events in the Soviet Union, has vowed never to implement the policies of perestroika and glasnost that brought about the fall of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the collapse of the Soviet Union, saying that Cuba would rather drown in a sea of blood than embrace capitalism.
Ms. Carrazana said that a personal turning point came with October's Communist Party Congress, which party officials and the state-controlled press had hinted might bring some political and economic change. But when Mr. Castro made it clear that he had no intention of instituting any such change and called for greater sacrifices and renewed revolutionary ardor, the populace felt a sense of betrayal and disgust, she said.
 
'Things Only Got Worse'
 "Everybody was waiting, waiting, waiting for the Congress, thinking they would put things in order," she said. "But things only got worse. When the new laws came down, they just tightened the system."
She said the family's plan to flee Cuba began about three months ago, when her 24-year-old daughter Inova Lara, a model, "came to me and said, 'Mommy, I can't stand it here any more. I'm going over in a raft, and I'm taking my child with me.' "
That prospect, Ms. Carrazana said, alarmed her. More than 2,000 Cubans successfuly crossed the Florida Straits to freedom aboard rafts, inner tubes and small boats last year, but many more are believed to have drowned, died of exposure, or been eaten by sharks as they drifted on the sea.
 
Plan for Mass Defection
 Ms. Carrazana said she made her daughter swear not to leave Cuba on a raft, promising to organize a mass defection that would take the entire family to the United States. But when it came time to approach her husband with the idea, she confessed, she felt some nervousness.
"He liked the system, and had always been what they call a revolutionary combatant," she said. "But I began to talk to him about conditions and planted the idea of leaving, and he did not oppose it."
Mr. Pompa, it turned out, had also grown disenchanted with the Castro government and wanted a new life. "The reservations I had about leaving were practical, because this was a difficult thing, after all," he explained this morning as Ms. Carrazana sat in his lap, her arms around him. "But I told her not to worry, that I would find a plane and get all of us out."
Friday's flight, he said, was actually the third attempt to fly the group out of Cuba. On Dec. 30, he said, the group rode a bus from Havana to the beach resort of Varadero, where he works, but the escape had to be canceled when Mr. Pompa discovered that a fuse had been removed from the helicopter, apparently to disable it.
Then, on New Year's Day, Mr. Pompa discovered that the helicopter he flew had been shifted to Havana for festivities associated with the anniversary of Mr. Castro's assumption of power. He worried then that his plan to escape had been uncovered, but said that the rest of the group remained optimistic.
d a lot of luck, and we are grateful to God for that," Ms. Carrazana said. "We were a large group, but there were no informers among us, and we were also fortunate to have the means to get out. I think 88 percent of the Cuban people would like to do the same, but it is not easy to escape."

HEADLINE: The Quandary in Japan;
Bush Will Be Given Concessions on Trade, But Not the Broad Changes the U.S. Wants

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 5

 BODY:
For weeks, Japanese newspapers have been filled with reports of trade concessions Japan will offer President Bush on his visit this week, most of them aimed at increasing Japanese imports of American autos.
But for all the expected promises, the measures are likely to create a troubling quandary for American officials: many of the steps have nothing to do with opening the Japanese market or freeing trade, the professed aim of the President's trade policies. Instead, they add up to Government orders simply to buy more American products to head off worsening trade tensions. 
 The difficulty this creates is that President Bush and his trade negotiators have long maintained that they do not want special favors so much as fundamental changes in the Japanese economic system to remove barriers against imports. The United States has said it wants tougher enforcement of Japan's antimonopoly laws, measures to open the tightly knit industrial groups that are said to discriminate against outsiders, and steps to stimulate the domestic economy so that Japanese companies can focus more on their home market than on exports.
 
2 Agreements Planned
 Japanese and American officials have said two documents will be completed during the President's stay, which starts Tuesday. One, the Tokyo Declaration, is intended to serve as a blueprint for relations between the two countries in the post-cold war era spanning political, security and economic issues. Officials on both sides said that document was essentially completed.
The other agreement, which was still being hammered out over the weekend, will be an "action plan," which is expected to include Japan's specific responses to American complaints about trade.
Among the measures that are expected from the Japanese are an easing of some testing standards and pollution-control regulations for imported cars; a tax break for buyers of imported autos, and Government pressure on Japanese auto companies to change their distribution policies to make it easier for dealers to sell imported autos.
In addition, under Government pressure, every major Japanese auto company has announced a campaign to buy more American autos and auto parts. For instance, the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest auto maker, last month announced a program that it said would increase its imports of foreign autos, auto parts and machinery to $1.23 billion annually by fiscal 1994, which ends March 31, 1995, a 150 percent increase from the current fiscal year's level. Nissan said it also planned a fourfold increase of its procurement of American-made parts for its United States plants, to $2.8 billion in fiscal 1994.
 
$1 Billion for Research
 Japanese and American officials have also said Japan is considering offering more than $1 billion in financing for an expensive research center with a supercollider to be built in Texas.
The trade tensions have been worsened by the American recession, election-year pressures in the United States and a new surge in Japan's trade surplus.
After declining for the last four years, Japan's trade surplus shot up last year and is expected to hit another record this year, to more than $100 billion. Adding to America's renewed irritation is the fact that about three-fourths of Japan's $45 billion trade surplus with the United States last year is made up of autos and auto parts.
But to hear the Japanese describe their responses to President Bush's anticipated demands, they are more like offerings of aid from the conquerors to the vanquished, a lifeline to save the United States from economic decline.
In a series of comments recently, Kiichi Miyazawa, the Prime Minister, emphasized that Japanese companies must lend a hand out of "compassion" for the ailing American economy and the auto makers. Nothing has been said by Mr. Miyazawa or others about lowering barriers.
"I would like to do whatever I can to help the United States recover from its economic and social ills with the cooperation of the Japanese people and industry," Mr. Miyazawa said Saturday.
Earlier he remarked, "It came as a considerable shock to the Americans that General Motors had been defeated by Japanese autos, though Japanese cars alone might not be responsible" for G.M.'s decline.
Japanese officials have also firmly rejected comments by President Bush and other officials in Washington suggesting the American recession resulted at least in part from the closed Japanese markets.
"We have very strong doubts about a correlation between U.S. unemployment and access to markets in Japan," a Foreign Ministry official said at a briefing for foreign reporters last week. "It is a bit too simplistic."
Similarly, the Japanese Government has already begun to mount a defense against expected American demands for new negotiations to tackle outstanding trade problems. American officials have said they plan to "reinvigorate" a three-year-old set of negotiations on what are believed to be structural aspects of the Japanese economy that discriminate against foreign companies and keep out imports.
One longstanding issue that the United States is expected to address is keiretsu, or groups of Japanese companies with interlocking ownerships and business relationships. The United States has long insisted that these tightly knit groups, which are said to exclude outsiders, should be forced open to eliminate the barriers they present to newcomers.
 
Degree of Openness
 The Foreign Ministry has just released a brochure that argues keiretsu are completely open, and that in some regards they make Japan more open to imports than the United States. The ministry even chose to describe how they work not by referring to the most well-known keiretsu, like Mitsubishi, Toyota and Sumitomo, but to American companies, including American Telephone and Telegraph, Sears and G.M., which have cooperative relationships with subsidiaries or other companies.
But in a contradictory afterthought, the brochure adds that Americans might benefit from studying the keiretsu system. That comment probably best captures the Japanese attitude toward these economic and trade matters as they prepare to play host at this meeting with President Bush.
More than ever, the Japanese look at the lingering American recession, the country's industrial ills and the President's need to come to Japan to press for concessions as a sign that the time has come for America to do more to emulate the Japanese system, rather than demand changes.

HEADLINE: New Interest in Missing Servicemen May Imperil Move Toward Hanoi Ties

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Expectations that the United States and Vietnam would soon establish diplomatic relations, more than 15 years after the end of the Indochina War, may be set back by a resurgence of interest in one piece of unfinished business that will not go away: the fate of missing Americans.
The revival of the issue has been spurred by a series of statements over the last six months -- from apparently bogus reports of sightings of live Americans to unsubstantiated information that Soviet officials interrogated Americans in Indochina after the time Vietnam said it had freed them. 
 While most American officials discount such reports, their persistence has led to the establishment of a committee in Congress that will begin to draw together new threads of the story in hearings over the next few weeks.
This week, State Department officials are expected to meet with Maj. Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, the former Soviet intelligence official who reported the interrogations in October. The former K.G.B. official, who has been interviewed in Moscow by American Embassy officials, is expected to testify at a closed session of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.
 
To Interview Former Agents
 The panel will begin this week to interview former intelligence agents or servicemen who had access to secret information in the 1960's and 1970's and who have reportedly offered to testify that more was known about the fate of missing Americans than subsequent Administrations acknowledged.
Some members of Congress predict that the panel's findings will move the American-Vietnam relationship into domestic politics.
Representative Robert G. Toricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would guarantee that the issue is brought up in this Presidential election year.
"The steady accumulation of information and persistent expressions of doubts about the fate of missing Americans has now shifted the burden of proof to the Vietnamese," said Mr. Toricelli, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who first discussed the issue with officials in Hanoi in 1984. "If George Bush persists in moving toward recognition now, he is putting himself at considerable political risk. I wouldn't have said that six months ago."
In October, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States was prepared to begin talks with Hanoi to establish relations.
He said progress would depend on Vietnam's willingness to furnish information about 2,273 Americans who are listed in records as prisoners of war or missing in action.
On Friday, the State Department reiterated that lifting economic sanctions and opening diplomatic relations depended on Hanoi's cooperation in making a fuller accounting of the missing. It also said it had supplied a list of names of missing servicemen to officials of several former Soviet republics. Richard A. Boucher, the deputy spokesman, said Kazakhstan had offered to allow United States officials to visit a high-security military installation at Sary-Shagan, 150 miles northwest of Alma-Ata, the Kazakh capital, to investigate a report that Americans had been taken there from Vietnam.
Those who believe that missing Americans are still alive say progress on accounting for has them slowed in the last year.
"In fact, 1991 was the worst year in accounting for cases," said Ann Mills Griffiths, who heads the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest of many advocacy groups.
Referring to the Vietnamese, she said in an interview: "Did they in fact withhold Americans after the general release in 1973? We know there are glaring discrepancies they could resolve by giving us access to files. They could resolve these if they had the political will to do so."
Officials say that about half the Americans unaccounted for are assumed to have been killed. Of the rest, only a few dozen, at most, may have been left behind or seized on clandestine operations after the American withdrawal in January 1973.
But doubts persist among those who, according to opinion polls, think more were left behind and that some may have survived.
Most Americans close to investigations discount stories of live sightings, saying it is inconceivable that with all the Vietnamese defectors and refugees in the West, some incontrovertible evidence would not have been produced.
Hanoi, stung by the allegations that it held American prisoners after the 1973 withdrawal and the fall of Saigon in 1975, told a visiting American Congressman on Friday that investigators should come and see for themselves that the charges are not true.
"They flatly denied these, as expected," Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said in a telephone interview from Bangkok after leaving the Vietnamese capital. "They are still hopeful of better relations with the United States. But a lot depends on how convincing the Kalugin evidence is."
In October, General Kalugin, who said he sent interrogation teams to Vietnam from 1975 to 1978 but did not go himself, began telling Western reporters that he knew that Americans had been turned over to his teams for questioning before being returned to Hanoi's custody.
In a telephone interview from Moscow, General Kalugin expanded on his allegations that certain unidentified Americans known to possess advanced knowledge of high technology were interrogated by his teams. The Vietnamese, he said, lacked the expertise to interrogate these prisoners. He insisted that at least three Americans he knew of had subsequently been freed by Hanoi and then traced in the United States by the K.G.B in the hope that they would be useful in the future. There are no American reports of such returnees.
On Saturday, the press agency Tass quoted a spokeswoman for foreign intelligence, Tatyana Samolis, as saying the Russian authorities had made a thorough study of K.G.B. files and found only one contact with an American prisoner, in 1973. The Central Intelligence Agency on Friday also disputed General Kalugin's assertions, saying that two of its agents had been interrogated in Vietnam, but that one was released in 1973 and the other in 1975.
Nevertheless, General Kalugin's statements have been seized on by advocacy groups who believe that the United States knew about such cases but kept silent to avoid compromising intelligence.
Representative Solarz calls these accusations "wholesale McCarthyism."
"The notion that any Administration was aware that people were being held against their will and covered it up is a monstrous accusation, which if one thinks about it, has to be premised on the notion that there were traitors in key positions," he said. He says the story that Americans could have been slipped back into society, as General Kalugin says, is "extremely suspect."
The growth and influence of the advocacy groups alarm those who believe that the only way to resolve the issue is through closer relations with the Vietnamese, said John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project in New York. He called the lobby for the missing "a tiger that is now out of control."

HEADLINE: Irving B. Kravis, 75, Who Was Specialist In Comparing Prices

 BODY:
Irving B. Kravis, a noted economist and educator who specialized in international price comparisons, died Friday after becoming ill at the Philadelphia airport on his way to receive an award.
He was 75 years old and lived in Haverford, Pa. His family said he was suffering from lymphoma and Parkinson's disease. 
 He was chairman of the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania from 1955 to 1958 and from 1962 to 1967, and he was associate dean of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the university from 1958 to 1960. Including those posts, he served a total of 37 years on the university's faculty. Mr. Kravis earned his bachelor's and doctorate degrees at the university.
Sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, he conducted pioneering studies comparing consumer prices in foreign countries and the average number of hours of work required to buy certain items.
In large part for this work, he was posthumously made a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association on Saturday at a meeting in New Orleans to which he was traveling when he became ill.
He received a Ford Foundation fellowship and a Guggenheim fellowship and was a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a consultant to the Organization for European Common Development.
He was awarded a Bronze Star for service in World War II as a first lieutenant in China with the Flying Tigers.
Surviving are his wife, the former Lillian Panzer; a sister, Lillian Zingg of McLean, Va.; two sons, Robert, of Glenside, Pa., and Nathan, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Marcia, of Philadelphia and Ellen Hamberger of Silver Spring, Md., and six grandchidlren.

Repairing Battered Industries
Some leading American industries were left reeling last year, from autos and real estate to retailing and banking.

HEADLINE: John Elliott, 95, a Correspondent Who Foresaw the Threat of Hitler

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
John Elliott, a foreign correspondent whose prophetic criticisms of Hitler led him to join the Allied effort and become a postwar occupation official in Germany, died on Saturday at the Fernwood House nursing home in Washington. He was 95 years old.
He died of natural causes, but a specific diagnosis was not given, a nephew said. 
 Reporting for The New York Herald Tribune, Mr. Elliott wrote in 1931 that "the specter of dictatorship menaces the German republic." He described Hitler, then a rising dissident, as a "fiery crusader" and "magnetic" orator. But he also called the Austrian-born Nazi leader a demagogue who "aspires to be a dictator" and "is not even a citizen of the country whose fate he may someday hold in his hands."
 
Reported on Jews
 His predictions came true. In 1934 he wrote a chilling assessment of the new totalitarian regime that began "Germany today is a military state" and went on to detail the Nazis' rigid control over the country. In 1935 he reported extensively on the growing persecution of Jews, quoting one official who called for mass castration. Mr. Elliott labeled such proposals an "extermination policy."
The German police seized newsstand copies of his newspaper in 1935, angered by his denunciation of Nazi "butchers" for executions in a purge. Under pressure, he moved to Paris. He reported on the Spanish Civil War and the outbreak of war between Germany and France, filing dispatches that were sometimes heavily censored by foreign officials. Twice in 1941 the Vichy Government suspended him from reporting.
He left journalism to become a major in the United States Army's psychological warfare branch in London, where he edited propaganda leaflets that planes dropped on Germany. After the war he was appointed deputy director of the Civil Administration Division of the occupation government in 1947, chief of its political activities in 1948 and chairman of the official newspaper, Neue Zeitung, in 1949. In the 1950's he helped create Radio Free Europe.
 
Worked for U.S. Agency
 Returning to the United States, he worked briefly on The Herald Tribune's financial news staff in Washington, then joined the Agency for International Development for about a decade before retiring about 1967.
He was born in Morristown, N.J., and earned bachelor's degrees from Princeton and Columbia Universities. He also studied at the University of Montpellier in France.
His wife, the former Edna Muriel Law, died in 1984. He is survived by two sons, John of Bethesda, Md., and Robert of Ross, Calif., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Seattle Journal;
City Fights to Keep Its Losing Team

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 5

 BODY:
For the first time in its inglorious history, the Seattle Mariners baseball team has a problem that has nothing to do with its performance on the field.
The club posted its first winning record last year after fielding an unmatched series of losers for 14 years in a row. In the process, it shattered all home attendance records, attracting more than two million fans -- close to what the pennant-winning Atlanta Braves drew. 
 But the economics of major league baseball are such that Jeff Smulyan, the Indianapolis broadcasting executive who purchased the team in 1989, says he cannot make a profit with gate receipts alone. This summer he asked Seattle to come up with more than $10 million a year to help cover the expense of operating the team -- or else.
The else, he hinted, might be moving the team to the Tampa Bay area in Florida, where the Suncoast Dome sits empty in St. Petersburg without a major tenant, and the area's leaders, hungry for baseball, have assured Mr. Smulyan that a move would be profitable. Another possibility was bankruptcy; Mr. Smulyan, who owns Emmis Broadcasting, was given until February to pay a $39.5 million bank loan on the team.
But even as Seattle civic leaders were seeking money, Mr. Smulyan abruptly threw in the towel. In early December, he announced that the team was for sale, at $100 million, and that if a local owner did not come forth by March 27, he would be free to move the team or sell it to an outside owner. Seattle officials say he cannot do this, though, because of contracts he signed with the city.
At least nine other cities, from Houston to Pittsburgh to Chicago, have gone through similar agony in the last five years, as player salaries have escalated and owners have held out the threat of moving in order to squeeze more money from civic coffers.
One simple statistic tells the story of modern baseball: the New York Mets recently signed Bobby Bonilla to a five-year contract that will pay him $29 million -- an amount equal to the entire payroll of numerous other teams, many winners among them.
Mr. Smulyan's deadline has forced on this city a question that will become more common throughout the country as professional baseball becomes the province of the very rich: What is a sport worth to a city? Beyond the economic benefit, to restaurants, T-shirt hawkers and hotels, is the sense of regional pride, Seattle officials say.
The Mariners may have been a pathetic bunch of losers for 14 of their 15 seasons, but they were losers whose every strikeout, wild pitch and managerial temper tantrum was followed by fans from the North Slope of Alaska to the Flathead Valley of Montana.
The most obvious potential buyer is William H. Gates 3d, the founder of Microsoft Inc., the world's largest software company, with headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Wash. Based on his stock holdings alone, Mr. Gates has recently become perhaps the wealthiest man in America -- worth more than $6 billion.
On radio talk shows and in letters to newspapers, fans have all but begged Mr. Gates to save the team. But Mr. Gates is not interested. He doesn't like baseball, says Martin Taucher, a spokesman for Mr. Gates.
So, with the March 27 deadline looming, the group of Seattle leaders charged with trying to find a local owner recently approached the Japanese. Seattle and Japan have long shared Pacific Rim trading and cultural ties that have held strong even through the worst of recent criticism of Japan by American political leaders.
But the thought of foreign ownership of an American team might be too much for baseball, the national pastime, after all, to bear.
What will probably emerge, say the Seattle officials, is a combination of Japanese and Seattle investors, with the local investors controlling the franchise. But it is far from a done deal.
The alternative can be found in the other Washington, the nation's capital, which was the last city to lose its baseball team. In 1972, the Washington Senators moved to Texas. There are still enough mourners to fill a stadium.

HEADLINE: In Japan's View, U.S. Car Companies Should Be Blaming Only Themselves

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 4

 BODY:
When President Bush and the chairmen of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler arrive Tuesday to cite the dismal sales of American cars here as a symbol of what is wrong with Japan, they may meet a rude surprise: Tokyo is preparing to cite the same example to make its case about the shortsightedness of American business.
For years, the Big Three auto makers have been the most conspicuous case of what happens to companies that try to sell in Japan exactly the same products they sell in America, with few concessions to Japanese tastes, Japanese habits, or even the width of Japanese roads. 
 With few exceptions, the American car giants have failed to make the kinds of large investments and commitments to new products that have brought modest success here to some of Europe's leading car makers, as well as other American companies like I.B.M., Eastman Kodak and Motorola.
 
Wrong Traveling Companions?
 As a result, many Japanese -- and more than a few American executives with long experience in Japan -- are suggesting that Mr. Bush is coming with the wrong traveling companions, playing into Japan's argument that the problems facing the American auto industry emanate largely from Detroit and Washington, not Toyota City and Tokyo.
"The solution is straightforward," Yutaka Kume, the president of the Nissan Motor Company and the head of the leading trade group for Japanese auto makers, said several months ago. "If the Big Three are to expand in the Japanese market, they first and foremost have to offer a car that is the right size and the right feel for Japanese consumers. They have to improve their marketing."
Most important, he said, "they have to realize that no one else will help them sell while they are sitting on their hands."
Few question that numerous trade barriers remain in the automotive market, particularly in auto parts, where Mr. Bush can present a strong case that many American companies have been unfairly excluded from the market. But even those American business executives and diplomats who complain about the obstacles to doing business here say they have a hard time working up much sympathy for the Big Three, even if three-fourths of the trade deficit with Japan has its roots in automobiles.
"If the Japanese changed their whole system tommorrow morning, and if American companies, especially the car companies, pursued every opportunity that opened up, the trade deficit would go down about $10 billion," Earle H. Harbison Jr., the president of the Monsanto Corporation, said here recently. "And that would still leave you with $40 billion."
In 1990, American-made cars accounted for less than five-tenths of 1 percent of the 5.1 million cars sold in the Japanese market, the world's second-largest. Japan, in contrast, holds nearly a third of the American market. That discrepancy, combined with the recession and Mr. Bush's trip, has prompted renewed talk in Congress of market limits on Japanese cars.
While Administration officials say they want Mr. Bush's trip to generate major concessions from Japan, some say there is another agenda at work: To force American auto makers to focus on Japan and Asia, and to make up for underinvestment there.
"We think the market in Japan is not yet open," Michael Farren, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said the other day. "At the same time," he acknowledged, "the Big Three probably should have been doing a trip like this 10 years ago, maybe 20."
Long ago, Detroit began designing cars for European buyers, yet none of the Big Three has its own design center in Japan. (G.M. has just opened a small one to design parts.) While virtually all of the Japanese auto companies have built car factories in the American Midwest and opened design centers on the West Coast, no American auto maker has seriously considered an assembly plant in Japan.
 
Moves by Ford
 Over the last two decades, all three Detroit auto makers have made big investments in Japanese car manufacturers, chiefly to produce parts or finished cars that could be sold under American badges in the United States. Yet only one, Ford, has arranged for its partner, the Mazda Motor Company, in which it owns a 25 percent stake, to manufacture cars at its plant in Hiroshima that Ford can sell here -- with the steering wheel on the right-hand side, for driving on the left side of the road. And only Ford has followed Mercedes-Benz and BMW, the most sucessful foreign car makers in Japan, in building their own dealerships.
What the American auto makers do not lack in Japan is experience. General Motors has been here for decades, and Ford opened a plant in Yokohama in 1922 to assemble Model T's. Ford became the best-selling car in Japan, but soon after the military Government came to power in the late 1930's, the company was forced to leave.
For years after the war, the American car makers were excluded from the Japanese market, as Japan tried to build its own auto industry. When they finally were let in during the 1960's, Japanese tax policy and a web of anti-import regulations still worked against them.
But the American makers failed to get back in during the 1970's and 1980's, as the formal restraints fell away. Rather than sell directly, the American makers turned to sales agents.
 
Outnumbered in Dealerships
 The result is that the American car makers are vastly outnumbered in dealerships, a critical disadvantage in a country where Toyota salesmen periodically ring virtually every doorbell, talk to owners about what they want in a car, and often send greeting cards when a member of a "Toyota family" is married and show up at funerals when a good customer dies.
In 1990, General Motors cars were sold at nearly 700 outlets in Japan, while Ford had roughly 300 showrooms. Chrylser had the smallest network, with roughly 50 outlets, which have sold less than a thousand cars a year. However, the Honda Motor Company, which has no utility vehicle of its own, has begun selling Jeeps made by Chrysler, which are increasingly popular among young Japanese.
But it is the bottom line that Mr. Bush is expected to discuss, and not surprisingly his focus on autos has unleashed a torrent of resentments.
Japanese industial leaders insist that they have already contributed to the American economy by complying with American demands that they move their plants to the United States -- something that the Big Three thought in the early 1980's would level the playing field.
"Someone should remind President Bush," a senior Nissan executive said the other day, "that while Detroit is laying people off, the Japanese makers are creating jobs, jobs, jobs." All told, experts say, more than 50,000 Americans have jobs related to Japanese auto production in the United States. Since 1986, car exports to the United States from Japan have declined by nearly 800,000 units, while production in the United States has soared by more than a million.
 
'Concessions' to Be Issued
 The Japanese are preparing to issue "concessions" on autos that they hope will put a good face on the visit -- dropping, for example, a minor regulation that requires brakes to be tested once cars reach Japanese shores, and easing some environmental and safety regulations. More important, American makers could soon have access to bigger sales networks: Nissan just dropped requirements that its dealers seek permission before carrying other maker's cars, a contractual arrangement that froze foreign products out of thousands of showrooms.
But the problem is not that Japanese will not buy foreign cars, it is that they will not buy American cars. Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen each sold about 36,000 cars a year here in 1990 (sales were down about 15 percent last year) not an enormous number, but more than three times better than the most successful American producer, General Motors, which was hoping to hit 10,000 units in 1991.
Success did not come easily to the Germans: They had to retool their factories so that cars could be ordered with the steering wheel on either side -- a change that General Motors has resisted because of the cost. Other modifications for the Japanese market are also available -- like a button that brings in the side-view mirrors when the car is driven down a narrow Tokyo street. And the German makers spent tens of millions of dollars building their own dealer networks, with prime locations in Japan's biggest cities.
But the American car makers say it does not pay to design cars for the Japanese market, at least until they sell more of them. "Obviously, we want to do better," Richard Johnson, who heads General Motors' operations here, said during the Tokyo Motor Show several months ago. "But only as we increase volume can we afford to develop cars for this market."
But the reality is that the American auto companies are probably less financially prepared to expand their market here than at any time in the last decade. With plants across America being closed and capital budgets cut deeply, General Motors is unlikely to open new plants in Japan and hire Japanese workers.
At the Tokyo Motor Show last fall, General Motors seemed to deepen its problems here: It did not show the Saturn, the innovative small car designed to take on the Japanese in the United States. To save money, G.M. decided to forgo a system that would allow Saturn's steering wheel to be moved to the right side. It will be another two years before the Saturn comes to Japan, by which time, notes Shoichiro Irimajiri, one of Honda's top executives, "it will be a very, very old design."

HEADLINE: Muslim Guards: Security Unit Maintaining Pride

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Silent and stonefaced, they stand in their crisp suits and bow ties in some of the nation's toughest neighborhoods and assemblages, their hands folded neatly, their eyes scanning for the slightest sign of disruption. More often than not, they work without pay. They carry no arms.
Still, the guards from the Nation of Islam, who have been called to clean up crack-infested streets and protect black politicians and celebrities, wield a weapon that often eludes the police in black neighborhoods: respect. 
 "They are more effective than police," said Spike Lee, the film director, who has used members of the Nation of Islam to guard his sets for movies, including "Do the Right Thing," "Jungle Fever" and "Malcolm X."
"The police and black people have never gotten along," he said, "and the community just has great respect for the Nation of Islam."
But not everyone shares that respect, saying that the group often crosses the line between intimidation and violence. And some other groups have cashed in on it, mimicking the guards' distinctive style of dress -- a phenomenon that has added to the widespread confusion about security at a basketball game at City College where nine young people were fatally crushed when a crowd got out of hand.
At that game, a small cadre of guards from an agency known as X-Men Security Inc. were among those hired. A common impression among survivors of the stampede was that the X-Men were from the Nation of Islam and some of the guards may have been.
 
Crushed to Death
 But at a news conference last week, Minister Conrad Muhammad, the New York representative of the Nation of Islam, said that while some of its members worked for private security companies, the Nation itself was "not involved" with security at City College on Dec. 28, when nine people were fatally crushed as a crowd surged forward to enter the college gymnasium for the game that featured a roster including rap stars. Eight of the victims died that day, and the ninth died days later in a hospital.
He then repeated a refrain that many black politicians have echoed with increasing fervor in recent years. "It is the Nation of Islam that could play a major role in preventing such tragedies," Mr. Muhammad said.
Area residents who watched the ambulances arrive at City College said the same thing on the night of the tragedy.
"In this community, the only ones people listen to are from the Nation of Islam," said a man who looked blankly into the frenetic scene at the gym. "They are the only ones people respect."
And the director of the City College security office, Charles Delaney, told City University officials on Friday that he had been pleased when he thought the student government group that organized the basketball game had arranged for 20 Black Muslim guards to buttress his own Pinkerton guards.
Since its founding in the early 1930's, the Nation of Islam has gained influence in the black community because of its aura of power, discipline, pride and commitment to economic self-help. Providing protection to the community and its leaders through its official security arm -- the Fruit of Islam -- has been a tradition as well.
Louis Farrakhan, a leader of the Black Muslim sect, gave the guards broader visibility when he provided a retinue for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign for the 1984 Democratic Presidential nomination.
Usually the patrols are free. But as the Nation of Islam has been deluged with pleas for help with security from neighborhood, civic, tenant and religious organizations, it has also agreed to accept what its calls donations.
Through the years, students and journalists have complained of rough treatment by the guards, who frisk people and enforce strict access rules at news conferences, concerts and other events. Some even say they have been beaten.
But members of the Nation of Islam and those who hire them insist that there is an emphasis on avoiding violence.
"They don't make threats; they talk to people," Mr. Lee said. "They understand black people. They say: 'Look, brother; look, sister. You don't need to do that.' "
The New York City Police Department declines to evaluate the Fruit of Islam guards' performance. "That is not something we would comment on, especially in light of recent events," a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, said.
The group's prestige within the black community has spurred others -- private security agencies and individuals alike -- to copy the suit-and-bow-tie look to help their own enterprises.
Dapper guards who function independently of the Nation can be found flanking people ranging from the Rev. Al Sharpton to Queen Latifah, the rap star. As a result, people often confuse the other private agencies, like the X-Men, with the official Fruit of Islam guard.
"Our reputation has transcended our organization," Mr. Muhammad said in an interview on Friday. "We have been in the community for more than 60 years and have earned a reputation. Others know if they look the part, they stand to benefit from that."
Others point out that using the Fruit of Islam for security when they are not a state-licensed security agency can present problems.
"Without the licensing, you don't know what you are getting, and there is less accountability," said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "That is a fact that people should be concerned about with all private security agencies, including the Nation of Islam."

HEADLINE: Democrats Call Bush's Health Proposal Inadequate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Two Democratic candidates for President today criticized health-care proposals being developed by the Bush Administration, saying they would not do enough to control health costs or to protect the millions of Americans who lack health insurance.
One of the Democrats, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, asserted that the Administration did not have "the guts to go after the wasteful health-insurance system we've got, the wasteful health-care system we've got." 
 The other Democrat, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said the Republicans' idea of using tax credits to help people buy health insurance was "not a step in the right direction" because it did nothing to slow the rise in health costs. He said health costs were "growing at a fantastic rate."
 
Record Health Costs
 The Commerce Department and the Department of Health and Human Services estimate that spending on health care will account for a record 14 percent of the gross national product in 1992. They estimate that such spending will reach $817 billion this year, up from an estimated total of $738 billion last year.
In his State of the Union Message in January 1990, President Bush said he was "committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control." But since then health care prices have risen about twice as fast as the Consumer Price Index for all items.
Administration officials say that Mr. Bush, as part of his budget request to Congress later this month, is likely to recommend tax credits and other tax benefits to help individuals, families and small businesses buy health insurance. Insurers say that health insurance premiums reflect the price of health care and have risen rapidly in recent years, so that fewer and fewer businesses can afford such insurance. Thirty-four million Americans have no health insurance.
Mr. Bush is also expected to propose new restrictions on various Government benefits for the most affluent people, Administration officials say.
Governor Clinton said that in the absence of a comprehensive plan to control health costs, he would oppose Mr. Bush's proposal to increase Medicare premiums for high-income people. The Administration would "charge the elderly more for the same old health care," without making fundamental changes in the health-care system, Mr. Clinton said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
 
Issue in Campaign
 "If this were part of a comprehensive plan to really take care of the health-care problems of this country and control health-care costs and get control of the deficit, I'd be for it, but it isn't," said Mr. Clinton.
In a separate interview on the CNN program "Newsmaker Sunday," Senator Kerrey showed how he intends to highlight health care as an issue in the Presidential campaign.
"I am angry with our health-care structure," Mr. Kerrey said. "I'm taking on the insurance industry. I'm taking on the American Medical Association. I'm saying it is time for national health insurance to create eligibility as a consequence of being an American." He said he would "break the link between employment and eligibility for health care and simply say if you're an American, you have health care."
Some small-business groups responded favorably to the idea of tax credits and tax deductions for health insurance, saying they were an efficient way to reduce the number of uninsured.
Aaron Trippler, executive director of a nonpartisan research group, Health Care Solutions for America, said that nearly 10 million more people would buy health insurance if they could take tax deductions for the full amount they spend on premiums.
"Current tax policy allows corporations to deduct the entire cost of health insurance for their employees, while individuals purchasing their own insurance are not allowed any deduction at all," Mr. Trippler said. "The net cost of providing individuals the same tax deduction that corporations get would be about $8 billion a year. If President Bush and Congress are looking for a reform that can be implemented quickly and efficiently, this is the answer."
Samuel K. Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, echoing other Administration officials, indicated today that Mr. Bush was likely to propose further cuts in military spending.
"There probably is some opportunity to reorder, on a logical basis, the defense priorities," he said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Mr. Skinner said the President remains firmly committed to the overall limits set in the 1990 budget agreement. He said that Mr. Bush might try to shift money from the Pentagon to other purposes, but would prefer not to renegotiate the whole budget agreement, as many in Congress now want to do.

HEADLINE: As Society's Need Increases, So Does Volunteerism

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Moved and frightened by social problems that seem as persistent as they are public, increasing numbers of Americans are volunteering to work with the poor and the sick, charities and volunteer organizations report.
In New York, the Mayor's Voluntary Action Center said 11,000 people inquired about volunteer opportunities last year, up 28 percent from 1990. In Kansas City, the Heart of America United Way Volunteer Center saw a 16 percent increase in 1991. And the Volunteer Center of the Texas Gulf Coast in Houston said 24,000 people inquired last year about volunteering, a 20 percent increase over 1990. 
 Those reports indicate that the rise in volunteerism found by a 1990 Gallup Poll, the most recent survey done on the subject, has continued. That year, 54 percent of the 2,727 American adults surveyed said they had done some volunteer work. That was a sharp increase from the 1988 survey, in which 45 percent of those surveyed said they had volunteered.
In the process, experts say, the image and purpose of volunteerism is being transformed. Instead of primarily being retirees providing supplementary services -- the "gray ladies" who push book carts through hospitals -- volunteers are now more likely to be people of any age performing direct and essential tasks: nursing AIDS babies, teaching illiterate adults to read or taking on the responsibilities of being a mentor to a juvenile offender.
The new breed of volunteers includes people like Dana Silver-Kathe, a 30-year-old costume designer from Tustin, Calif., who rises at dawn to help feed 200 homeless people; Gene Edwards, a 26-year-old hotel food-service manager who talks late into the night with people who call the Dallas Suicide Crisis Center; and Eveline M. Turner of the Bronx, a 67-year-old retired stenographer who hugs, talks and sings to babies whose parents have abandoned them at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx.
"In the 60's people tried to make a better world through political change, outside the system," said Carol Stone, president and chief executive officer of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County in California. "Now they are working within the system and working hands-on, one-on-one with the people who need help."
 
Recession Is a Factor
 The heads of agencies that work with volunteers said that some of the recent increase can be attributed to the recession, which has led many newly unemployed people to offer their services while others who have been forced to reduce their monetary contributions have decided to give their time instead. And they credit the publicity surrounding President Bush's "Thousand Points of Lights" campaign.
But they said its deeper cause is the continued local, state and Federal budget cuts that began in the 1980's and reduced financing for many social programs, even as problems like homelessness, AIDS and child abuse were becoming more widespread. The cuts have forced many agencies to rely on volunteers to staff and even run some of their programs. Together, the result was an increase in both the supply of volunteers and the demand for them.
"Everywhere we looked, from our televisions to our streets, we saw people in need," said Janet Harrison of the Volunteer Center of Los Angeles. "With the recession, people feel especially vulnerable, that they're not so different from these people and they want to do something to help."
Walter Richard Black, recruitment director for the Volunteer Center of the Texas Gulf Coast in Houston, said that in the past two years the number of nonprofit agencies seeking volunteers from his agency has increased from 400 to 520. Richard Reid, executive director of the Volunteer Center of Northwest Chicago, said last year his group placed volunteers in 140 agencies, a increase of 40 percent over 1990.
Another change prompting the rise in volunteers, he said, is the new sense of openness about subjects that once had been taboo. "Just this year an agency was set up to help incest survivors," Mr. Reid said. "A few years ago society wouldn't even admit that went on. Now it's on Oprah and Donahue. People recognize a problem, see the need for a solution and try to help."
 
An Aggressive Search
 Agencies have not waited by the phone for an newly sensitive and enlightened public to call. They have attracted volunteers through an aggressive and sophisticated use of the news media, direct-mail techniques and television.
In June, the Points of Light Foundation began broadcasting public service announcements on network and local stations that provided an "800" number viewers could call to reach volunteer organizations in their towns. So far, 25,000 have called, said Barbara Lohman, a spokeswoman for the Washington nonprofit group that has public and private financing.
"Few people just volunteer -- they have to be asked," said Patricia Cundiff, director of the Heart of America United Way in Kansas City, Mo. "In this day and age, the way people are asked is through a newspaper articles, public service announcements and even made-for-TV movies. Every time one of those is on, our phone rings off the hook."
Organizations have also recruited volunteers by nurturing relationships with schools, many of which have community-service requirements for graduation, and corporations. Ms. Stone said that 12 years ago her volunteer center in Orange County was helping one company run a volunteer program. Now, it is helping 160.
The Corporate Volunteers of New York, a coalition of businesses that run volunteer programs in New York City, reported that the number of companies involved has increased 40 percent, from 35 companies to 49, in the last three years.
 
Young and Employed
 The role of businesses in encouraging people to volunteer has helped attract two groups that have not traditionally volunteered: the young and the employed. Mr. Black of the Texas Gulf Coast volunteer center said that in 1986, 48.9 percent of his volunteers said they were employed outside the home; last year, 60 percent did. During that same period the percentage of people who identified themselves as homemakers fell to 4 percent from 21 percent. "This is very encouraging because it means many people, especially women, are finding time to volunteer despite the added responsibilities of a job," Mr. Black said.
Young professionals have been attracted by programs at work and by organizations like New York Cares, which was founded in 1987 to recruit younger volunteers who want to work directly with people in need.
"We have been besieged with volunteers," said Kenneth Adams, the group's executive director. "The number of people who have become involved in projects is twice as much as it was last year."
The organization, which has 8,000 members, most of them between 25 and 35 years old, has served as a model for similar groups in 10 other cities, Mr. Adams said.
"Young professionals thought volunteering was something blue-haired ladies in candy-striped suits did," he said. "And a lot of traditional groups never reached to them because they thought they weren't interested. I think the desire has always been there but now groups like ours are providing the opportunities."
The volunteers help homeless children learn how to read, visit children dying of AIDS, rehabilitate abandoned buildings and feed the homeless, Mr. Adams said.
Kate Sanderson, a 33-year-old staff manager at New York Telephone, said she volunteered in October to serve as a big sister for a 12-year-old girl from the South Bronx because "I got tired of reading about problems; I wanted to do something about them."
"I thought my main role would be helping her with her school work," Ms. Sanderson said. "I've found that what she really needed was someone to give her respect, to listen to her. Like a lot of people, she needed a friend."

HEADLINE: Russians Urged to Act Fast

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Leading American economists are advising Russia and the other former Soviet republics to move more swiftly than Eastern Europe has in tackling economic changes, especially as they attempt to sell off 45,000 state-owned factories to private owners. They are also recommending that the United States and international agencies help to finance the changes, at least for a while.
"Privatization in Eastern Europe has been a debacle," Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Harvard University, said at the three-day annual meeting of the American Economics Association here, which concluded today. The topic of economic reform and aid to former Communist nations overshadowed discussions about the sluggish economy in the United States. 
 "This is one area where Russia can learn from Eastern Europe's mistake," said Mr. Sachs, who is an adviser to the Governments of Russia and Poland. "Every Eastern European country has failed, and failed significantly, to find new owners for state-owned enterprises." Trying to sell off one enterprise at a time, as in Britain or Mexico, has proved "achingly slow and completely unrealistic."
 
A Cold War Relief Effort
 The economists favored Western aid to help maintain living standards in the transition to a market economy.
"The cold war is the third war to end this century, " said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank. "After World War I, major nations looked inward and there was no serious effort to reintegrate the vanquished powers into the world economy. After World War II, the opposite happened. The question now is which pattern is going to followed."
Few Westerners can appreciate the daunting scale or enormous difficulties of an undertaking that makes Britain's large-scale privatizations in the 1980's seem trivial by comparison. Britain took seven years to sell off 43 state-run companies; Poland has 3,000 such concerns and the former Soviet republics have nearly six times that many. The question now is how to privatize efficiently and equitably in countries with no stock or bond markets, no private banks and no accounting systems.
Despite the enormous political and economic dangers, the economists were surprisingly optimistic about the long-term economic prospects if the changes are carried out successfully.
"These are not economic basket cases," said Stanley Fisher, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist at the World Bank. "Russia has the potential to be a powerful economy in 10 years with a strong trade balance."
The economists see rapid privatization as critical in establishing ownership control over enterprises now operating in a vacuum. Without privatization, the lifting of price controls is not likely to stimulate a broad industrial recovery, skilled workers might emigrate and much of the industrial base could be looted.
 
'A Race Against Time'
 "You really have a race against time," Mr. Sachs said. "Russia could very quickly find itself in a profound industrial crisis. Right now, there are no proper incentives anywhere in the economy, and it is a very, very dangerous situation."
Furthermore, if privatization is postponed, money-losing enterprises would continue to swell the huge Russian Government deficit. That deficit, already 25 percent of the gross national product, is the main reason for the current inflation.
"On most countries, I tend to be a gradualist -- but not Russia," said Mr. Fisher, a specialist on macroeconomic stabilization who was a key adviser to the Israeli Government in its battle against hyperinflation in the mid-1980's.
To get thousands of companies transferred to new owners, Mr. Sachs advocated that Moscow, in addition to giving away 25 percent stakes in publicly run companies to workers and managers, turn enterprises into private corporations quickly; permit workers, managers and local authorities to appoint the directors, and allow those boards to distribute more stock, perhaps giving majority control of the company to private hands.
The boards could swap shares for debt held by banks, trade shares with other enterprises or sell more shares to workers and managers. Thus, the privatization would proceed in a decentralized fashion.
Mr. Sachs also wants Moscow to set up pension funds and mutual funds that could buy shares and monitor the performance of the companies. A key advantage of the plan would be that some positive effects could be felt before the transfer of ownership from the Russian Treasury to the private sectors was completed. "You don't have to have 100 percent private ownership before enterprise can operate like private entities," said Mr. Summers, who endorsed much of Mr. Sachs's plan.
Mr. Summers added that implementing the plan would be more complicated than Mr. Sachs had suggested. Many money-losing enterprises have more debts than assets, for example, so even giving them away would not compensate their new owners for the cost of shutting them down.
 
Points of Agreement
 "It's a mistake," Mr. Summers added, "to overstate the effectiveness of newly created boards and mutual funds in providing oversight for the enterprises."
Still, the economists agreed on several points. To begin with, advice that argues in favor of restructuring before selling off enterprises is wrongheaded. "To believe that the Russian state, which cannot stop the money presses, could restructure thousands of companies is far-fetched," Mr. Summers said. The grossest error is to argue that an enterprise cannot be privatized if it is highly unprofitable.
Another key lesson from the privatization of Eastern Europe is that insiders, namely workers and managers, must be given their due. Comparing workers and managers in state-owned firms to rent-control tenants who get discounts during co-op conversions as the price of their support, Mr. Sachs said: "Ironically, free-market reformers in Eastern Europe have fought very hard against shares going to workers on a discounted basis. As a result, they are bereft of political allies."
Finally, shares must be salable, to give workers and managers an incentive to increase the value of a company as well as to create a secondary market for shares. "The fact that these stakes could be sold would be an incentive to maximize their value," Mr. Sachs said.
The second half of privatization, Mr. Summers stressed, would be to encourage new, small business by removing economic and legal obstacles.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Proposed for U.S. Autos

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Tax incentives for Americans who buy domestically made cars could help stimulate sales and save "a dying industry" in Detroit, a research organization has proposed.
Calling on the Government to intervene as an advocate for the Big Three auto makers, a report by the Economic Strategy Institute advocates diverting some money from military research and development into a low-interest loan for a cooperative research and development project. The report suggested that the project be sponsored by the auto makers. 
 The institute, a Washington-based group that conducts research on trade issues, is partly financed by the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. But the group's president, Clyde Prestowitz, said its report on the auto industry was not directly paid for by the auto makers.
The report comes as political and industry leaders are calling for the Government to intervene in the declining fortunes of the United States automobile industry.
Proposals for action by the Government include a personal income tax deduction for one year to consumers who buy American-made cars from the Big Three auto makers; negotiations with the Japanese Government to create projects to encourage American exports to the Japanese market, and requirements that Japanese plants operating in the United States, known as transplants, increase the amount of American labor and materials they use.
The report estimates that the plan would cost the Federal Government $22 billion over five years, including the income tax credit for purchases of domestic cars in 1992, an investment tax credit that would be available for five years to businesses that buy fleets of domestic cars, and a $10 billion loan for auto industry research and development.
The report said the spending would be offset by $24 billion in tax revenues generated by the Big Three's increased domestic share of the auto market and higher sales of domestic materials to the American factories operated by Japanese companies.
Gary C. Hufbauer, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington and a free-trade advocate, called the report's proposals "a mixture of reasonable and outrageous." He said in an interview that a tax break for domestic automobile purchases would encourage consumption instead of investment and would represent a misspending of scarce tax money.
He disagreed with the report's warnings that the Japanese factories in the United States spell the demise of the domestic auto industry.
"Transplants," he said, "have been galvanizing the industry and providing jobs."

HEADLINE: Albany Legislators Face Tough Session With Combustible Mix

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Although it never really seemed to leave town, the State Legislature returns to Albany this week to convene a session that many participants predict will be the most difficult in recent memory because of an uncommonly combustible mixture of political ingredients.
Not that the last few sessions have been love fests: the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo set consecutive records for budget tardiness in each of the last two years, which also brought the downgrading of the state's credit rating in 1990. 
 But this year the increasingly polarized debate over how best to protect the state from the ravages of recession will be complicated by a host of new variables that include redistricting, election-year posturing, a leadership change in the Democratic-led Assembly and a political makeover in the Republican-controlled State Senate.
The lawmakers will arrive in Albany for Mr. Cuomo's 10th State of the State address on Wednesday following a monthlong special session that failed to produce an agreement on closing the state's twin budget gaps -- $875 million in this year's $30 billion budget and nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year that begins on April 1.
As a trial run for this year's session, the December negotiations served only to highlight the deep political and ideological divisions that have paralyzed the budget-making process here during a brutally deepening recession.
The conflict between the Democrats who control both the Assembly and the executive branch and the Republicans who control the Senate has corroded even the fleeting good will that usually attends a legislative session's opening. Dampened by Mr. Cuomo's decision not to run for President, the mood inside the Capitol's stone walls has been as gray as the weather outside.
"It's going to be one of the most bitter and exasperating sessions of my lifetime," said Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties. "If the gap is what the Governor says it is, and it's probably going to be larger, I can't imagine what torture is going to be involved in getting that thing resolved."
The main factor fueling such dire projections has been the decision by the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., to take a more muscular stance after three years of relative conciliation with the Democrats.
Threatened from the right by a rejuvenated conservative anti-tax movement, scared by the anti-incumbency sentiment registered by voters last November and encouraged by the new acceptability of welfare-bashing, the Republicans are finding it increasingly comfortable to play the role of the official opposition.
"I think you can expect a very aggressive Senate trying to impose its view on the entire legislative process," Mr. Marino said last Friday.
On the other side of the Capitol's third floor, a newly elected Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin of Queens, has taken over after last month's conviction of Mel Miller on Federal fraud charges. The affable Mr. Weprin faces the challenge of making his own mark while holding together a diverse and fragile Democratic coalition that had been fused largely by Mr. Miller's forceful personality.
 
To Fill Leadership Posts
 Mr. Weprin's savvy will be tested quickly this week when he announces his choices for four or five leadership positions, including the powerful Ways and Means Committee chairmanship that he had held. He also must field candidates for special elections in January and February to fill six vacant Assembly seats, four of them in highly competitive districts.
In November, all 211 legislative seats will be up for grabs, meaning that action and compromise in the session may often be displaced by positioning and oratory. If the anxiety level is not already high enough, all legislators will be consumed with the distraction of a redistricting process that could change their constituencies almost overnight.
"People who thought they were safe will find themselves in marginal districts," Mr. Weprin said. "It's going to make everybody wary."
Then there is Mr. Cuomo. Freed of the political burdens of running for re-election or for President, the Governor has already threatened to hold the Legislature politically accountable for its actions and has made it clear that he will use his veto power over reapportionment as leverage.
Mr. Cuomo, whose third term does not expire until 1994, is also expected to recycle a tactic he used masterfully in 1987 by waging an all-out campaign for reforms in laws on legislative ethics, campaign finance, ballot access, open government, budget making and legislative initiative.
He plans to reinforce his call for a constitutional convention to be held in 1995 to carry out such changes. Such a session would require a legislative vote this spring enabling a public referendum in November.
If Mr. Cuomo follows past practice, the Legislature will be cast as the heathen foe of this crusade. That could deepen the tensions created by a budget impasse that Mr. Cuomo blamed for blocking his Presidential candidacy.
 
'To Push All the Buttons'
 "Now that he's not running for office and we are, he's going to push all the buttons that make us uncomfortable," said one legislative aide. "He's going to be Mr. Outside, Mr. Reform, Mr. Anti-incumbent who gets the Legislature for whatever he perceives we did. It will be payback time."
Mr. Cuomo has denied being motivated by vengefulness. But the gathering storm over legislative ethics and fiscal reform is only one of the battles that may widen the fault lines between him and the Legislature.
His most pressing concern is the state's credit rating, already the third lowest of all states, ahead of only Massachusetts and Louisiana.
He has accused the Senate Republicans of ignoring warnings from Wall Street rating agencies that the state's credit could be downgraded at any moment if the budget impasse is not broken. But the Republicans have been holding out for deep cuts in Medicaid and welfare programs.
If state officials are successful in wringing more than $1 billion in savings from Medicaid and welfare programs, attention will turn to Mr. Cuomo's proposal for the state to assume the share of Medicaid costs paid by local governments. That measure eventually would provide significant financial relief to New York City and other local governments.
 
Other Pressing Issues
 While Medicaid is the primary issue on the fiscal agenda, it is not the only one. The Legislature must consider how to finance a $10.5 billion request by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for a new five-year capital plan to improve commuter rail and subway service. It must deal with a growing prison population that requires 6,000 new beds. And it must consider delays in opening community mental health and drug treatment programs it has already spent money to create.
As is often the case when budgets are being cut, such fiscal troubles raise the prospect that the state, in its desperation to save cash, will make penny-wise and pound-foolish decisions that generate added costs down the road.
In past years, Mr. Cuomo has used his State of the State speech to unveil ambitious proposals with big price tags. But this year, as last, the speech is expected to concentrate on low-cost initiatives, including the Governor's reform proposals and a series of economic development projects that would be jump-started with money and loan guarantees from the state and its public authorities.
"Right now, I wouldn't want to have to find a centerpiece," one Cuomo aide said late last week. "I'd be in real trouble if someone gave me a million dollars to find one."

HEADLINE: GARRISON JOURNAL;
At the Fish Library, a Chronicle of Death and Taxes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARRISON, N.Y., Jan. 3

 BODY:
When Alice Curtis Desmond died in 1990 leaving an $18 million estate and no heirs, the trustees of the library she founded and liberally supported in the decade before her death anticipated a settled future. So did her lawyer and her nurse.
But when the will was read, the trustees and many of the 6,500 residents in this bucolic Hudson River estate town were dismayed to learn that the millions the 93-year-old banking heiress had left to the library would be all but eaten up in paying taxes on the $2 million apiece she left to the nurse and lawyer. 
 By making those two bequests tax-free, Mrs. Desmond had effectively disinherited the community library she founded with her ex-husband, a four-term Congressman, Hamilton Fish Sr., using $2.8 million of the money she inherited from her parents and her first husband, Thomas C. Desmond, a former New York State Senator and financier to whom she was married for 49 years.
The library, a two-story Georgian structure, contains exhibits that reflect the unusual political and economic contributions both the Fish and Desmond families have made to the Hudson Valley region, including rooms devoted to the Fish family papers and first editions of Mrs. Desmond's 22 published books, primarily biographies and children's books. Mr. Fish died last year at the age of 102.
The library received the remainder of Mrs. Desmond's estate after a number of other bequests, but since Mrs. Desmond's gifts to her lawyer and her nurse and a $250,000 gift to her doctor were tax-free, the taxes on those gifts had to be paid by the estate. The estate was also liable for an estimated $5.7 million capital gains tax. The tax exemption provision doubled the size of the employee bequests and eliminated the money left in trust for the library.
This conflict of death and taxes inexorably led to court. The library trustees sued, contending that Mrs. Desmond's lawyer of 18 years, D. Clinton Dominick, who became her guardian, financial adviser, director of her personal holding company, a trustee of the library and the draftsman of her will, had unduly influenced her. They also said her nurse, Barbara Suchy, who handled all Mrs. Desmond's correspondence in her final years, had also exerted undue influence and isolated her from library board members and friends.
Her lawyer insists that Mrs. Desmond was a feisty and self-willed woman shaken by her unhappy relationship with Hamilton Fish and determined to keep her money from supporting Fish family endeavors. "But for Ham's marrying wealth, the idea for the library would not have become a reality," Mr. Dominick said in a statement to the court. "But for Ham's shabby treatment of Alice, her enthusiasm for the library might not have waned."
In a fitting climax to this melodrama, a judge issued his ruling in an unusual New Year's Eve session. Judge Joseph G. Owen of Orange County Surrogate Court ordered the lawyer and the nurse to pay their own estate taxes, restoring approximately $2 million dollars to the library. The judge also revoked Mr. Dominick's trusteeship and gave an additional $2.5 million in recent income to the estate be paid to the library.
"It's quite clear Mrs. Desmond didn't have a clue as to the effect this tax exoneration clause would have on the library," said Michael F. Teitler, a partner at Teitler & Teitler, the Manhattan law firm representing the library. "The judge didn't throw stones at anybody," Mr. Teitler. "He just looked at the record."
The parties in the dispute have 30 days to appeal the order, but only until Friday to file their estate tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. If they do, his client will be satisfied, Mr. Teitler said, adding that "$4.5 million is well within the library's objectives."
Mr. Dominick refused to comment on specifics of the case, which he described as a "delicate matter." Ms. Suchy was unavailable for comment.
The library trustees were relieved. "We certainly knew her intent," said Patricia Adams, chairwoman of the library's executive committee. "This was a woman without any real heirs. The library was her baby."
In her last book, an autobiography titled "Yankees and Yorkers" published in 1985, Mrs. Desmond concluded: "I hope eventually to make the Alice and Hamilton Fish Library one of the finest public libraries in New York State, specializing in the history of the Hudson River Valley. I will die, but my library will live on."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
At Dollar General, What Recession?

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The recession has not brought hard times to all retailers. The Dollar General Corporation, which sells inexpensive necessities like toothpaste, bleach and paper towels to low-income consumers, is growing at a pace that is the envy of merchants with more affluent customers.
Last week, it reported "the best Christmas selling season in the history of the company," said Cal Turner Jr., the chairman and grandson of the Tennessee tobacco farmer who founded the company 52 years ago. Sales at stores open more than a year are up 10 percent through December. Last month, sales roared ahead 25.2 percent. 
 Analysts expect the planned opening of 100 new stores a year to lift the company's sales by about 13 percent this year. Net income is expected to grow by 20 percent.
 
A Rise in the Minimum Wage
 While purveyors of yachts, diamonds and fur coats complain that a luxury tax has hurt sales, Dollar General is focusing on the impact of a different federally mandated change. Many Dollar General shoppers earn rock-bottom wages, and the increase last spring in the minimum wage created a windfall for the company. "We believe our customers spent a good portion of that increase in our stores," said Bruce A. Quinnell, the chief financial officer of the Nashville-based company.
With 1,500 stores in 23 states, concentrated in the Southeast and parts of the Midwest, Dollar General is one of the few large chains to focus expressly on serving low-income people. "Dollar General has become one of the smartest retailers in how to provide retail services to people of modest incomes," said George Rosenbaum, chief executive of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago research firm. "It's a tough but underdeveloped market."
"I call it bottom-of-the-barrel retailing," said J. Gary Dennis, an analyst with J. C. Bradford & Company, a Nashville brokerage firm. "When the people that shop at Dollar General shop at Wal-Mart, that's kind of the top of the ladder for them."
Dollar General has prospered by using its intimate knowledge of the needs of its customers, about 80 percent of whom have incomes of less than $25,000 a year.
Credit cards are not accepted; most customers do not have them. Few even have checking accounts, Mr. Quinnell said. "They can't afford to pay the fees," he said.
What Dollar General customers want is low prices. As a result, the company's stores stock 1,500 items that cost $1 or less. In fact, for years, the stores sold only items that cost $1 or less.
"That's the best price point that the good Lord ever made -- $1," Mr. Turner said.
Now, knit shirts cost $5. Rustler blue jeans are $9. A $25 dollar pair of work boots is the most expensive item in stock. Work gloves are 75 cents.
 
The Basics for Less
 The stores do not stock large sizes of shampoo or multiple packs of razor blades. While bigger packages are usually cheaper in the long run, they cost more up front than many people are able to pay.
Paper towels, at two rolls for $1, are the company's top-selling product. Pine cleaner, at two bottles for $1 dollar, and motor oil, a can for 75 cents, are other big sellers.
The company has clearly benefited from the recession and a shift in values that is making mainstream shoppers more bargain-conscious and spurring sales at big discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the K Mart Corporation. But Mr. Quinnell said Dollar General customers are bargain shoppers out of necessity, not choice.
To keep prices low, about 25 percent of the company's merchandise is seconds or is bought at close-out.
 
Sites in Small Towns
 The company also holds expenses to a minimum. When asked the average amount customers spend on each visit to Dollar General, a statistic most retailers can recite in their sleep, Mr. Quinnell dismissed the question. "That's a statistic that costs money to accumulate and has no value to us, so we don't spend the money to get it," he said.
Most of Dollar General's no-frills stores are in towns with less than 25,000 inhabitants. By opening about 100 stores a year, Dollar General plans to add 1,000 stores by the end of the decade. Net income is expected to grow 20 percent.
In geography and customer base, the company has much in common with Wal-Mart, a dangerous position for a retailer, given Wal-Mart's tendency to devour market share at the expense of weaker competitors. But even though both companies sell inexpensive merchandise, and have many customers in small towns, analysts say the companies have a different focus.
Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst with the First Manhattan Company, said, "I don't think Wal-Mart is all that concerned about them." People drive long distances to stock up at a Wal-Mart, he said, but Dollar General shoppers may dart into the store to buy a tube of toothpaste.
Many Wal-Mart stores have more than 100,000 square feet of space and carry a wide range of products. A Dollar General store has an average of 5,600 square feet and carries only 5,000 items. "He's a mass marketer," Mr. Turner said of Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's founder, "we're a focused bargain store." Wal-Mart executives declined to comment on Dollar General.
"We perform very well in the shadow of Wal-Mart," Mr. Quinnell said. In fact, the company has moved dozens of stores closer to Wal-Mart's in recent years, after finding that sales suffered if Dollar General stores were more than a mile away from a Wal-Mart. By Mr. Turner's calculations, Dollar General's sales per square foot exceed those of neighboring Wal-Mart stores.
In the fiscal year that ended in January 1991, Dollar General earned $14.6 million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $653 million.
 
Interest From Wall Street
 The company's growth has caught the attention of Wall Street. The stock closed Friday at $24.75, up 50 cents a share and up from a 52-week low of $7.625, in over-the-counter trading.
Analysts are divided on how the company's stock could still rise. In a recent report, Alice A. Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said Dollar General stock should reach $25 to $27 in the next nine months.
But Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities said: "They have had their run for the year. It's fully priced."
Dollar General stumbled badly in the mid-1980's, when it went on an acquisition spree, increasing the number of stores to 1,300, from 800, in 15 months. A weak management team bungled the rapid expansion, and earnings plunged in 1986. "We weren't executing well on the basics," Mr. Turner said.
The company has been rebuilding since 1987. After a bitter family feud, Mr. Turner's brother, Steve, the president, left the company in 1988. Professional managers were brought in, and the company has improved its buying and focused on lowering distribution costs, closing one warehouse and automating others.
With traditional retailers facing poor sales and fierce competition, Mr. Rosenbaum, the Chicago market researcher, thinks more and more merchants may examine the market for low-income customers. "Here is a large population where service is underdeveloped," he said. "This certainly is an alternative that has to be considered."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Breaking Welfare Dependency for Young Mothers

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
WHEN Padora Vincent gave birth as a teen-ager three years ago, she personified a growing national problem. Today, she may exemplify one possible solution.
The Census Bureau reported last month that more and more new mothers, teen-agers in particular, are unwed. Among blacks, 9 of 10 teen-agers who had babies in 1990 were unmarried -- the highest rate of any major ethnic or racial group. Regardless of whether the social stigma of premarital pregnancy has declined, teen-age motherhood typically bodes badly for the children. Many grow up poor. Some get another chance later in life. Their mothers often don't. 
 Ms. Vincent, who lives in Harlem with her 3-year-old daughter, is enrolled in an experimental program designed by the nonprofit Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. It is intended to help young mothers on welfare, most of them high school dropouts with one or two children.
The program is called New Chance. Its goals are ambitious: to advance educational, vocational and parenting skills, prepare participants for jobs with career opportunities, reduce welfare dependency, delay further childbearing and promote self-sufficiency. It is being tested at 16 sites, including Harlem and the South Bronx, in 10 states.
"I feel like this is a second chance for me," said Ms. Vincent, who joined the Harlem program last January, took her general equivalency diploma exam last month and hopes to find a job "helping people."
What distinguishes New Chance from many such programs is that regular attendance is required in its high school equivalency diploma classes, most services for mothers and their children are delivered at a single site, participants may receive those services for up to 18 months and 12 months of follow-up services are available.
Financed largely through state and local welfare and job training agencies and monitored with private grants, the program is expensive. It costs from $5,500 to $9,500 for each participant, including child care. But this does not take into consideration the public assistance the women and children would have received anyway or the cumulative costs of not having provided a new chance. Given new national welfare mandates, which define ends with greater confidence than they do means, the first progress report by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation seems promising.
"We have a consistent message: That you can succeed and we expect you to succeed," said Evette Williams, who runs the New Chance program at the New York City Board of Education's Mid-Manhattan Adult Learning Center on West 120th Street. Only about 1 in 10 of the participants was raised as a teen-ager by both parents. On average, the women were 17 years old when they had their first child.
Another New Chance model is run by the National Puerto Rican Forum in the South Bronx. Others are operating in, among other places, Pennsylvania, California, Florida and Illinois. Still another was started in Carle Place, L.I., but was closed because of financing, recruiting and other problems.
One problem common to many participants has been their lack of self-esteem. A New York City case manager said many of the women were "quite confident about their ability to handle themselves in the sometimes dangerous streets of the city's poverty areas; what creates anxiety for them is a plush Fifth Avenue office," where they might someday work.
Shawn McCalla, who is 22 years old and lives in Harlem with her 20-month-old son, enrolled last spring, earned her diploma in three months and plans to enter City College next month to study child psychology. "I know for sure I can do it," she said. "If it wasn't for New Chance, I never would have realized the opportunity I could have."
Rose Wallace, who adapted the New Chance model to the Mid-Manhattan Adult Learning Center, where she is now assistant principal, said the program's goal is to "take young people and move them from public assistance -- the crutch that they've been using -- to economic independence."
New Chance is not geared for everyone. Moreover, it may be difficult to replicate for groups bigger than the 100 or so initially served at each site. And, while New Chance is costly, an investment of that magnitude may prove to be required and even prudent.
"It has had a lasting impact just in terms of what some of our students have achieved," Mrs. Wallace said. "One got her G.E.D., learned typing and worked in our data center. She received a $1,000 scholarship and was accepted at City College. We have one at LaGuardia and another at Bronx Community College, some working, and one who completed a licensed practical nursing program.
"That," she said, "has to be considered long-term success."
Last Monday's Metro Matters column reported on Unity Park, a project of the New York City Outward Bound Center branch at South Bronx High School, and the despair of some students after one of three ash saplings they had planted was felled by vandals. Through Bronx Green-up, a program of the New York Botanical Garden, Planters Choice nursery in Newtown, Conn., donated a replacement so that three ashes can rise, like a phoenix, from the South Bronx.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rise in Long-Term Rates Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The winter is usually a bad time for the bond market, with interest rates tending to rise, and some analysts expect this year to be no exception, even with the weak economy and low inflation.
"January and February has always been a tough time for the bond market," said James Kochan, fixed-income strategist for R. W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "I think between now and the quarterly refunding auctions in February, there will be a bit of a back-up in long-term interest rates, even though the fundamentals look very good." 
 Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said, "Rates are not going to rise significantly and are not going to stay up, but we think there is an upward bias to long-term rates for the first three months to six months of the year."
 
War-Related Pattern
 Early last year, bond yields rose along with tensions in the Middle East in January, fell sharply on the sudden success against Iraq in the fighting in early February, but turned higher again when it seemed likely that a quick victory would be followed by economic recovery.
This winter, Washington is on the market's mind. The fears that rose in November about what Congress and the Administration might do to stimulate the economy are coming back and are unlikely to abate until after the clear outline of a recovery package has been sketched.
"I can't see the market improving significantly until the questions in Washington are resolved," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "And it could be February or March before that happens."
 
Large Supply of Debt
 In addition, market participants will probably be forced to cope with a very large supply of new debt securities.
The Treasury is the largest. But the drop in rates in the last month has been big enough for states, municipalities and corporations to saturate the taxable and tax-exempt markets with billions of dollars in new issues.
This week, for example, the Treasury will sell $9.5 billion worth of new seven-year notes in addition to auctions of three-month, six-month and one-year bills. The municipal bond calendar is topped by the expected sale of $775 million worth of securities for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. And in the corporate bond market, the World Bank has announced it will sell $1.5 billion worth of new 10-year securities. Investment bankers said other taxable issues were also likely to be priced.
"I don't think the market has really focused on the fact that there is a lot of supply," Mr. Held of Smith Barney said.
After rallying sharply for much of December, bond yields gave back a bit of ground last week, and by Friday stood at 7.47 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond.
 
Limited Upside
 The likelihood that news on inflation and the economy will remain favorable to the bond market means that any rise in long-term rates from current levels will be limited, analysts said.
Richard Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said his firm projected that bond yields would ultimately fall to 7 percent, and that any backup in rates now should be viewed as a buying opportunity.
Mr. Kochan of R. W. Baird agreed: "If bond yields got back to around 7.60 percent, the market would look quite attractive," he said.
Fresh statistical evidence of just how weak conditions were as 1991 ended is likely to be provided this week, economists said.
Two key reports are expected Thursday and Friday, when the Government is scheduled to release producer-price and employment data for December.
Because of a sharp drop in energy prices, many analysts are projecting that producer prices actually declined during December, after a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in November. But excluding food and energy prices, wholesale prices probably rose by one-tenth of 1 percent, analysts said.
 
Jobless Outlook
 Nobody is projecting the employment report will register as stunning a decline in non-farm payrolls as the 241,000 drop recorded for November. But analysts are looking for another drop, one that probably will be accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate, currently at 6.8 percent.
Economists at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company are forecasting that non-farm payroll employment fell by 90,000 last month.
The labor report, in conjunction with recent auto sales numbers and the slide in manufacturing activity suggested by the big drop in the Decmeber survey of purchasing managers, should reinforce the notion that the economy is in the second leg of a recession and not in a sluggish recovery.
"Currently, declines in demand and employment seem self-perpetuating," James F. O'Sullivan, a Morgan economist, wrote in the bank's weekly letter to clients, "making it highly unlikely that the slump in the economy will be limited to just one or two months."

HEADLINE: Bills and Notes This Week

 BODY:
The tentative schedule of Treasury financings this week includes the regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills today, followed on Wednesday by an auction of new seven-year notes. On Thursday, the Treasury plans to auction new one-year bills.
By late in the day on Friday, the outstanding three-month bill was bid at 3.85 percent and the six-month bill was bid at 3.88 percent; the one-year was at 3.94 percent. In when-issued trading -- between when a new security is announced and the time it is issued -- the seven-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.49 percent. 
 Among Government agency securities expected for pricing this week is a $500 million financing due today by the Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae. The securities are short-term floating-rate notes that mature on July 9, 1992.
Sallie Mae said the notes would be priced at a spread to the bond equivalent rate of the 91-day Treasury bill with the interest rate adjusted the day after each weekly bill auction.
Also, the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, said it planned to price tomorrow a $1.3 billion debt offering.
The following fixed-income issues are scheduled this week:

Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors;
Automobiles: What Detroit Car Makers Can Do While Waiting for the Recovery

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
The huge cutbacks announced by the General Motors Corporation just before Christmas capped what had already been a grim year for the American auto makers, and 1992 does not look much brighter.
After layoffs, plant closings and other cost-cutting steps, most industry executives say they can do little now but wait for a stronger economy. Their 1992 models are already in production, and 1993 models are set as well. The hope is that growth picks up and consumers flock to the showrooms. 
 Of course, there are other matters to attend to.
The Big Three must continue to hold down costs. They must rebuild morale. They must continue to work on vehicle quality and to reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market.
But the longer the slump lasts, the more likely that new-model-development programs will be delayed months -- or even years -- to save money. General Motors, for example, has already postponed its compact light-truck replacement to 1995, from 1994.
G.M. is in a particular bind. Having announced the elimination of more than 70,000 jobs in the next few years, it must still choose which 21 plants to close. Even that, some say, may not make G.M. competitive with Toyota and Nissan.
"G.M. is working great as a financial institution; it needs desperately to get back in the car business," said Thomas O'Grady, a consultant with Integrated Automotive Resources Inc.
Industry analysts expect the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation to be profitable this year, provided the economy improves. They say G.M.'s profitability hinges on the write-offs it takes to cover plant closings and employee buyouts, perhaps more than $2 billion.
Most economists do not expect a buying rebound until spring, at the earliest, and, even then it might not amount to much. The WEFA Group, a consulting firm, predicts a 9.6 percent gain in car sales in 1992 and a 9.8 percent gain in light-truck sales.
Total vehicle sales in North America will rise to about 13.6 million units, WEFA predicts, up about one million from this year but short of the robust levels of the late 1980's.
But WEFA warns that if lower interest rates fail to stimulate the economy, the expected 1991 sales of about 12.5 million cars and trucks "may look good."

Picking Up the Pieces in Six Struggling Business Sectors;
Real Estate: The Developers Are Still Sifting Market's Rubble

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Few industries in recent years have collapsed as completely and rapidly as commerical real estate. Property values are down across the board, vacancies are at all-time highs and with the national economy caught in the grips of recession, the prospect that the demand for space will grow much this year is only a pipe dream.
The commercial real estate industry is trapped in a depression marked by a virtual absence of lenders willing to take any risk. Even the usually optimistic developers and property market analysts are now admitting that things are likely to worsen over the next 18 months, especially for the staggeringly overbuilt office market. 
"One good thing about this downturn is that almost everyone in the real estate community, at least on the East Coast, realizes that we're in a downturn and is working like mad to get us out of it," said J. Philip Rosen, a lawyer with Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
The crisis is rooted in the vast overbuilding of the 1980's brought on by a flood of capital and favorable tax laws. Real estate executives will spend the 1990's trying to bring property values in line with other assets, to work off supply and to regain credit. Some investors are looking for bargains in the rubble, but most lenders are expected to remain cautious.
A recent survey of 100 real estate professionals by the Real Estate Research Corporation concluded that the value of office towers and hotels nationwide would not increase for four or five years.
Respondents said most office markets would worsen until at least 1995, but that the prospects for some -- like Seattle and San Francisco -- looked brighter than others. New York and Boston were among those seen as the worst prospects.
Apartment buildings, which have suffered less in the last two years, were expected to start regaining value this year. Industrial and retail shopping center properties were expected to show recovery in 1993. Land and hotels were expected to remain soft until the second half of the 1990's.

Treating Education Ills As Courtroom Drama

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Format gets in the way of content on "Learning in America: Education on Trial," the three-part series that begins tonight at 10 on Channels 13 and 49. Each hour is set in a courtroom and features real lawyers and a real judge. Viewers are to serve as jurors, via a toll-free number, and their verdict will be revealed in the next morning's USA Today.
In tonight's program, "Do We Need a National Report Card?," the witnesses -- Dr. Saul Cooperman, who used to be the New Jersey Education Commissioner; Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado; David Smith, a teacher in an East Harlem secondary school, and Ann Lynch, a former president of the National Parent Teacher Association -- are examined and cross-examined in what turns out to be a fitfully informative hour. 
 The opposing lawyers, Prof. Christopher F. Edley Jr. of Harvard and Prof. John E. Coons of the University of California at Berkeley, seem to be auditioning for "L.A. Law" (from whose cast the host, Richard Dysart, is appropriately drawn) and Judge Connie L. Peterson of Denver's Second Judicial District is there as part of the scenery. The verdict: guilt by association. The adversarial nature of a trial encourages point-scoring, not analysis, and the courtroom play acting seems strained, not to say fake. The issues addressed tonight and in the next two programs -- whether America's public education system is fatally flawed, and how much money should be spent on schools and how it should be allocated -- deserve better. The odd aspect of this show is that it comes from MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, a name associated with rewarding discussions without gimmicks.
 
Learning in America
Education on Trial
A three-part documentary series; directed by Gary Halvorsan; produced by MacNeil/ Lehrer Productions; John O'Toole, executive producer; Richard Dysart, host. At 10 tonight on Channels 13 and 49.
 
'Florio Under Fire'
Channel 5
Tonight at 9
John Roland's interview with Gov. James J. Florio of New Jersey, at 9 tonight on Channel 5, resembles the traffic flow on the state's turnpike: Governor Florio is heading in one direction, Mr. Roland in another. In keeping with the title of the report, "Florio Under Fire," Mr. Roland keeps asking about the Governor's diminished popularity. Governor Florio, not unnaturally for a politician with a 23 percent approval rating, prefers to talk about the long-term problems that his state is suffering along with much of the rest of the country.
Actually seated before a fireplace, wearing a sweater over a tieless shirt, Governor Florio seems reasonably relaxed, all things considered. He remains articulate, if somewhat chastened, and it is unfortunate that Mr. Roland, having made the point repeatedly that the political condition of the Governor is parlous, did not give more attention to details of the programs, especially on education, that Governor Florio seemed eager to discuss. But then it never has been easy to make a U-turn on a turnpike.
 
'Innovation'
Channels 13 and 49
Tomorrow at 10 P.M.
Tomorrow night, at 10 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, "Innovation" begins a three-part series called "The Future Is Now" that looks at the latest in computers, robotics and so forth around the globe. At a VCR factory in Yokohama, Japan, 70 robots do the job of 200 workers (unemployment is not Japan's problem). A house in Boulder, Colo., can be heated for 75 cents a winter. A Berkeley laboratory is developing a long-lived, inexpensive light bulb.
Jim Hartz makes a cheerful master of ceremonies. Financed by NEC, which describes itself as "a worldwide leader in computers and communications technology," the program is as upbeat as a trade fair.

Detroit Fans Cheer for the Quarterback Without the Union Label

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich.

 BODY:
THE last guy anyone in Detroit would have considered a football hero became an unabashed, unmitigated, unquestioned hero yesterday. In this town that wears the union label so proudly, he was considered a strikebreaker. In this town that has boasted such quarterback stars as Bobby Layne and Earl Morrall and Tobin Rote, the guy who came to camp this summer as the team's No. 3 quarterback, who has played in things like the Potato Bowl while attending a community college, who wasn't even drafted by the National Football League after his senior year in college, this guy is today's hero here.
And in this grizzled, battered town, this blue-collar, lunch-bucket town, the guy with the dark, tousled hair and the gentle eyes and the unprepossessing build of, say, a high school chemistry whiz, this guy was cheered wildly by the 78,290 football fans in the Silverdome. 
 What Erik Kramer did to deserve all this was lead the Detroit Lions to a spectacular 38-6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional playoffs, placing them in the National Conference championship game Sunday against Washington and giving them a chance to go to the Super Bowl and win their first football championship in 35 years.
Kramer led Detroit simply by completing 29 passes in 38 attempts for 341 yards and three touchdowns. He did it after he was goaded and baited and derided by the Cowboys. The Cowboy defense stacked up on the line, virtually daring him to throw, and anticipating that he would give the Lions' ace runner, Barry Sanders, handoff after handoff.
Earlier in the week, a pair of Cowboy defensive players, Tony Casillas and Jack Del Rio, were outspoken about Kramer, calling him a scab for having crossed the picket lines to play for Atlanta during the strike-interrupted season in 1987.
Del Rio kept up the verbal barrage during the game, or part of it, anyway.
"I didn't hear him make any more remarks after the first quarter," said Kramer.
On the first series for the Lions in the first quarter, Kramer took the Lions 68 yards for a touchdown on five plays, all of them passes, concluding with a 31-yard toss to Willie Green.
"I took the remarks that were made about me as a challenge," said Kramer. "They didn't show me respect; they didn't show our team respect. When I woke up this morning I didn't even feel any jitters. I just wanted to get to the stadium to play."
When it was all over, Kramer said: "It's been a dream season, and this was a dream game. Now we gotta keep it going."
Kramer got his chance this season in the Lions' eighth game, also against the Cowboys. Their first-string quarterback, Rodney Peete, suffered a torn Achilles' tendon on the first series of plays and was lost for the rest of the season. The Lions called on Kramer, who had moved past Andre Ware on the depth chart. Kramer had played three games in the strike season right out of college, had then spent two seasons in the Canadian Football League, and at this time last year, after spending most of the season on the injured reserve list of the Lions, was out of a job. He had traveled a long way to get to this point, from Pierce Junior College in California to North Carolina State to disappointments in the pros.
But against Dallas in that first game, Kramer responded handsomely. He threw two touchdown passes and the Lions won, 34-10. He went on to play a large role as the Lions won six of their next eight games going into yesterday's playoffs. "He's won some games for us," Lions Coach Wayne Fontes said of Kramer. "He's made the big play."
In regard to his once having crossed the picket line, Kramer says: "I had to do it. It was probably the last opportunity I'd have to play in the N.F.L. It was a hard thing to do, but you have to do what's best for you."
Kramer, meanwhile, has demonstrated resilience and poise and skill this season -- his teammates call him "Brass" for his independence and coolness under pressure -- and in a curious way he seems to personify aspects of this city, the part, anyway, that consists of doggedness.
"Times are tough around here, as tough as most people can remember," said Ted Wagner, reduced to part-time work on the assembly line at the Ford Escort plant here. "So that's why a lot of us overlook it that Erik Kramer was a scab. He's our quarterback, and it's the Lions. We're rooting for him."
Motown, from "The Motor City," depends hugely, of course, on one particular industry, automobiles, which is reeling. In a depressed national economy, cars have been hit as hard as any product.
In this area, though, as in many others, sports has often been a great rallying point. And while the Lions have been down for a long time, they remain beloved. Then suddenly this season they began to win again, behind Kramer.
Nevertheless, nobody, even in Detroit, had thought of Kramer in the class of Elway or Marino or Kelly. Or Samuel Gompers.
Ted Wagner shrugged when asked about the non-union quarterback. "Right now," said the part-time assembly-line worker, "we're hoping for two things here. We want the Lions to win and for George Bush and the Big Three" -- representatives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- "to come back from Japan with good news about trade barriers. If that happens, there will be such a warm glow around here you'll see flowers growing in February."
And, oddly enough in this union town, maybe echoes of cheers, too, for Erik Kramer, who once crossed a picket line.

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Season on the Links: More Prosperity Is Just Around the Next Dogleg

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
After a season that gave us the most dramatic Ryder Cup ever played and the thrilling power of John Daly, 1992 will have to go some way to keep from being regarded as an anticlimactic year in golf.
Of course, the same could have been said last January about 1991, the year that followed the social upheaval of Shoal Creek. In fact, 1992 promises a great deal, including Daly's first encounter with the wide fairways and short par 5's of Augusta National, Phil Mickelson's professional debut, and the classic venues of Pebble Beach and Muirfield, where the United States and British Opens will be played. 
 Despite a recession that is pummeling corporate America, the year also promises continued prosperity for golf professionals, as the PGA Tour, the Senior PGA Tour and the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour will play for record purses. Indeed, if anything threatens the appeal of the game in the United States, it is too much prosperity.
 
Fairways Paved With Dollars
 After years of striving to improve conditions for its members, the PGA Tour in particular has evolved into a sleek series of $1 million-plus tournaments where a single victory in a year, or even a solid string of top 10 finishes, is enough to guarantee a free ride on the next year's road to riches.
Any Darwinian would agree that in such an environment, there is diminished motivation to win and keep winning. In fact, the 1980's brought a sharp decline in the number of tour players achieving multiple victories in one year. And without consistent winners, the PGA Tour, even as the general quality of its play gets better and better, is in danger of suffering from a shortage of stars.
The sport has been through other periods when it lacked compelling figures, most notably in the 1930's before the emergence of Sam Snead, and in the mid-1950's as Arnold Palmer was entering his prime. The problem is that despite unprecedented exposure and financial opportunities for players, the star-making machinery in American golf doesn't work as well as it used to.
First, potential stardom in any sport is diminished when circumstances conspire to keep the best from regularly competing against the best, which is the current situation in world golf. Given the fact that top players like Ian Woosnam, Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal play primarily on the European PGA Tour, most victories for Americans on the PGA Tour essentially carry an invisible asterisk.
At the same time, parity has undeniably found its way into the well-monied heart of the PGA Tour. In 1991, for only the second time in tour's history, no player won more than two tournaments. On a tightly bunched final money list that was led by Corey Pavin with $979,430, the players who finished 15th through 26th were jammed between winning totals of $597,438 and $546,984. Further evidence of the tight competition was the record number of first-time winners: 13 in 43 events.
 
Good, Bad and Boring
 There are unquestionably more good players than ever on the PGA Tour, which kicks off its 1992 season on Thursday with the Infiniti Tournament of Champions in Carlsbad, Calif. But because these players appear so close in ability, never have so many good golfers engendered so little excitement. To most observers, the PGA Tour lacks the aura of greatness it had when Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Johnny Miller and Tom Watson were playing their best golf.
"It's gotten very hard to separate yourself from the masses on the regular tour," said Nicklaus, who believes that technological advances in the golf ball and golf course setups that neutralize the shotmaking elements of power and creativity, have made it more difficult for the most talented players to assert their natural advantage. "I think we've got to allow young talent to develop and we've got to have some superstars. We've got to create some situations where Americans excel again."
Off their performance the last two years and by general consensus, the American players with the best chance to do just that are Fred Couples, Paul Azinger and Pavin, each 32 years old, and Payne Stewart, who is 34.
Of those four, Pavin has the most career tour victories with nine, while only Stewart, with the 1989 P.G.A. and last year's United States Open, has won major championships. On paper, these are substantially inferior records when compared with those of the superstars of yesteryear at comparable stages in their careers.
That alone does not preclude that one or more of the foursome won't achieve greatness -- or that Curtis Strange or Australian golfing expatriate Greg Norman won't rediscover the path of excellence they've strayed from. Or that a group of 30-and-under players led by Steve Pate, Davis Love 3d, Billy Andrade, Daly, Andrew Magee and Robert Gamez won't produce a player for the ages.
 
Quality is Eroding
 But the evidence seems to indicate that the current structure of the tour works against Nicklaus's concept of "separation." Some critics even see decadence outracing excellence.
"I think the quality of play in the U.S. has eroded because life is too easy on the American tour," said Mark McCormack, the founder and chairman of International Managment Group, which profits when the players it represents become stars. "Everybody is too pampered. The courses are too manicured. Players don't care about winning enough. They care about making a good check."
Officials of the PGA Tour take strong exception to McCormack's statements, particularly the idea that American players have become complacent with lucre and are less motivated to win.
"If that's so, why are scoring averages going down, cut scores going down, and winning scores going down," said Tim Finchem, the deputy commissioner of the PGA Tour. "The only reason is that everybody is trying to win."
Finchem also contends that the fact that the foreign tours have more multiple winners each year does not mean that their stars are better or more motivated than the Americans, but instead shows that those tours are easier for top players to win on.
"Essentially, the other tours are where the PGA Tour was 20 years ago, where a few people won a lot of golf tournaments," Finchem said. "To go back to that, we'd have to restrict competition, which we believe would be bad for the game. We simply have more guys who are capable of winning golf tournaments, which makes them harder to win."
Perhaps the PGA Tour regulars and their public will have to change their criteria for defining stars in order to continue to have some. But before things get to that point, perhaps an extremely talented and driven player will come along in the United States to remind us of what a star really is.
If that happens in 1992, it will be remembered as a very good year.

Naivete's Not the Problem

 BODY:
Older Americans are being bilked of their life savings, as documented in a recent report in The Times. The victims, most of them widows, tell, for example, of trusting "a nice young man" who ingratiated himself and then disappeared with most of their bank account. Even sadder were the tales of family thievery. Driven by drugs and the recession, children in soaring numbers prey on elderly parents.
The solution seems obvious: Wise up the gullible old folks. But older adults are no more naive than younger ones. What they lack is not savvy but support, the friendship and confidence they need to sound the alarm. One bilked widow in Asbury Park, N.J., told authorities that she was so lonely "she'd pay the devil to visit her." 
 Most seniors, no matter how isolated, have some contact with others -- the Meals-on-Wheels deliverer, a visiting relative, a neighbor. These people can often detect the first sign of troubles. When they do, they should blow the whistle, loud.

HEADLINE: Don't Look for Jobs in Japan

 BODY:
Americans buy much more from the Japanese than the Japanese buy from the U.S. Everybody knows that these huge trade deficits force Americans out of work. That's why President Bush is leading an entourage of big-shot executives to pressure the Japanese to import more goods and thereby create "jobs, jobs, jobs."
But what everybody knows just isn't true. Trade deficits don't cause unemployment; indeed, the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit. If that statement seems to contradict common sense, just recall the 1980's, when the U.S. rang up $100 billion trade deficits yet operated near full employment. Bashing Japan might make good campaign rhetoric, but it's unlikely to lower the unemployment rate one tick. 
 Mr. Bush's promise to create jobs is based on the false premise that generating exports or cutting imports is an effective way to create demand for U.S. workers during the current recession. But the U.S. doesn't need the Japanese to create demand: the same economic kick could be delivered if the Federal Reserve Board were to further lower interest rates or Congress were to reduce taxes and raise Government spending.
Indeed, trying to create jobs by manipulating the trade deficit would be absurdly difficult, requiring the restructure of Japanese society before the recession runs its course in the next couple of months.
Besides timing, the attempt to drive down the trade deficit would likely be self-defeating. If Americans were to buy fewer Japanese cars -- which would, in turn, require selling fewer dollars to buy yen -- the value of the dollar would rise. That would make U.S. exports more expensive, cutting sales. Employment in Detroit auto factories would rise. But employment in the airplane, agriculture and computer software industries would plummet by comparable amounts. Mr. Bush wouldn't be creating jobs, he'd be swapping jobs between Detroit and Iowa.
There is a constructive spin Mr. Bush could put on his Asian mission, but it wouldn't pack much wallop. By blocking imports, Japan prevents its trading partners from selling what they make best. That forces them to produce more of what they make less well, lowering their living standards a bit. The biggest losers, however, are Japanese consumers -- who, for example, pay astoundingly high prices for domestically grown rice that can be produced far more cheaply by the United States.
So while Mr. Bush can't accurately promise that knocking down Japanese trade barriers will produce more jobs, he could rightly promise that it would raise U.S. living standards a tad. That's not an exciting message, but at least it's honest.
The unpleasant truth is that U.S. trade deficits are home-grown. They occur because Americans overconsume -- buying more goods than they produce. The excess consumption comes from foreign suppliers -- if not from Japan, then from Korea, Germany or Canada. As long as Americans persist in outspending their income, cutting the trade deficit with Japan to zero would solve nothing.
There is a serious consequence of insufficient saving, but it's not the trade deficit. A country that saves too little invariably invests too little in new machinery and technology. Over time that means slow productivity growth and stagnant incomes.
Mr. Bush chose the wrong problem and offered the wrong solution. The trade deficit isn't related to the number, or productivity, of American jobs.

Redskins' Revenge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Washington Redskins are winning; "Native Americans" are losing.
While the politically correct fret that the word "redskins" may be taken as an ethnic slur, they ignore a far more serious assault on the character and traditions of our aboriginal Americans. 
 With the cooperation of greedy tribal leaders and their fast-buck white lawyers, tribes from the Chippewa in Wisconsin to the Barona in California are being victimized and corrupted by promoters of organized gambling.
It began in seeming innocence a decade ago with bingo games on the reservations. Then half the states in the U.S., under the delusion that good ends could be achieved by bad means, legalized gambling. (It's called "gaming" or "off-track betting" or "casino promotion of tourism"; never use a dirty word like "gambling.")
Because Indian reservations retain a form of sovereignty that limits control by state governments, shrewd gambling operators saw a way to get around local restrictions and steal a march on the local casinos. The Supreme Court held in 1987 that states that permitted gambling could not deny its triumphs, glories and spoils to Indian reservations.
That opened the floodgates to those who wanted to exploit the special status of Indians. Today, gambling dens fronted by Indians are a billion-dollar-a-year business and mushrooming; tribal lands are illuminated by neon; tribes reaching out for more suckers are litigating with state officials about whether one-armed bandits are illegal slot machines or merely "technological aids" to bingo players.
The corruption of the original American ethnic group is taking place under the cover of a public relations campaign to show how gambling is good for impoverished Indians. Profits go to the tribes, goes the story, which then build schools and hospitals and lift the unemployed families off welfare.
Baloney; malarkey; oompah. The few facilities gambling built are Potemkin villages. Casino gambling will help the average Indian as much as the New York State Lottery has provided great new facilities for the average schoolchild. The great benefit of gambling profits to the public has always been a sham; it has proved itself to be the most regressive and shameful tax on any state's books. New Jersey and Nevada, those paragons of state virtue, have led the way.
With the notable exception of ABC News, investigative media have shied away from this national scandal. Many have been intimidated by immediate charges of racism by Indian "leaders" who benefit most from the deals like those being set up across the country by Grand Casinos Inc., a company whose over-the-counter stock is being promoted by non-Indians.
What a perversion of affirmative action; is this the proper answer to the massacre of innocent Indians at Wounded Knee?
In fact, the corruption of gambling is ripping many tribes apart. The Mohawk fighting along the U.S.-Canadian border last year was based largely on control of gambling money. The introduction of slot machines all but insures further mob penetration and moral degradation.
Big-time gambling is an organized vice deserving of no government promotion or identification with a single ethnic group. All lotteries are con games, manipulating our something- for-nothing lust. (I throw away any junk mail with a picture of Ed McMahon on it.)
Is there no tribal leader courageous enough to come forward to tell Indian children they come from the stock of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and that their role models need not be George Raft and Meyer Lansky?
Are there no genuine friends of a poverty-stricken group willing to put aside tut-tutting about misperceived slurs long enough to call attention to the real cultural and moral crisis facing the Indian nations today?
We cannot deny Indians their right to compete with states in attracting suckers of all races. The answer is to get both state governments and Indian tribes out of the gambling business. Public promotion of betting is wrong; it corrupts people and politicians; it should never be the goal of public policy.
If we fail to stop the casinoization of the reservations, we will surely change the name of the football team to honor the next generation of aboriginal Americans. We'll call them the Washington Croupiers.

For THOMAS P. WALSH, becoming director of public safety for the newly organized Times Square Business Improvement District, is a homecoming of sorts. A former New York City police officer who rose to become the department's highest-ranking officer for the southern half of Manhattan, he began his career 35 years ago on foot patrol on West 44th Street. Now he is back in the neighborhood, in charge of recruiting, training and supervising 40 public safety officers for the district, which went into operation last week.
"My first post was in 1957 on 44th Street between Broadway and Ninth Avenue," said Mr. Walsh, who retired in October as patrol borough commander for Manhattan South. " 'Little Abner' was playing then, so was Ethel Merman in 'Happy Hunting.' The biggest problems had to do with sex and prostitution and that has improved immeasurably. 
 "But the crack epidemic has knocked everyone around," he said. "Back then we didn't even have narcotics, then as time went by, we saw heroin and stuff but nothing that has affected conditions the way crack does."
Mr. Walsh, who was the principal planner and chief enforcement officer for the parades celebrating the end of the Persian Gulf war and the visit of Nelson Mandela, and who has overseen three New Year's Eve police operations in Times Square, said he has high hopes for his new job. "I am here to make the crossroads of the world more refined, helping to attract more tourists and citizens to the Great White Way, to make it the showplace it should be." And, he added, "I will be on the streets everyday."

Industry's Turmoil Is Shaking Out Other Fields

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
SINCE newspaper advertising began a steep decline about 18 months ago, many peripheral businesses and organizations that are nourished by the newspaper industry have gone on short rations.
For instance, as budgets have been tightened, newspapers have been cutting back sharply on sending employees to weeklong bouts of training. In December, The Philadelphia Inquirer eliminated all conventions, seminars, group meetings and outside training, except those related to the opening of a new printing plant. 
 "It is always unfortunately one of the obvious first costs upon which the publisher's eye falls," said Robert J. Haiman, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.
A typical weeklong course on the finer points of reporting and writing at the Poynter Institute costs about $1,200, not including air fare.
The institute's programs are still oversubscribed, Mr. Haiman said, but instead of 80 applications for 16 available slots, there are now about 35. And he said that while those attending a writing seminar in the past would have been motivated by a desire for self-improvement, the current crop of journalists seemed to be driven by a more economic motive -- attracting readers to their papers.
The American Press Institute, a training center outside Washington that provides a wide array of programs aimed at middle and upper management, has seen its typical class shrink to 25 from 32.
William L. Winter, president of the institute, said publishers were still willing to spend scarce dollars for training, provided there appeared to be a payoff.
For instance, when a seminar for circulation managers drew few participants last year, the institute canceled that seminar and substituted one called "New Product Development" on ways to sell advertising.
"It was oversubscribed in two days," Mr. Winter said.
The advertising drought in the newspaper industry has only heightened the intense rivalry among the four big trade magazines: Editor & Publisher, News Inc., Newspapers & Technology and Presstime.
For decades, the weekly Editor & Publisher had the industry almost to itself, and it remains the dominant publication in total advertising.
Still, times are tough for E.& P., as it is known. Steven A. Townsley, E.& P.'s advertising manager, said advertising pages from industry vendors like press manufacturers and image advertising from newspapers had fallen about 30 percent in 1991.
E.& P.'s extensive classified pages have long been the industry's bazaar, with voluminous listings for services, used equipment and jobs.
But Mr. Townsley said classified volume was down about 30 percent, and the only category showing growth was "positions wanted."
The newspaper recession has hit E.& P. just as it has come under assault from two upstart monthly publications that emerged at the crest of the 1980's newspaper boom: Newspapers & Technology, which began publication in 1988, and News Inc., which started in 1989.
Newspapers & Technology focuses on the production and distribution of newspapers, and is sent free to about 21,000 newspaper executives who use -- and buy -- equipment.
News Inc., which -- like E.& P. -- is more broadly focused and covers journalistic issues -- has adopted a strategy of increasing advertising by offering packages in which, for instance, an advertiser buys four ads and gets two more for free.
Not surprisingly, both E.& P. and Newspapers & Technology sneer that News Inc. is padding its linage figures. Jack Berkowitz, publisher of News Inc., sneers back that his competitors are behind the times.
Just who is winning this race is not easy to determine.
While Mr. Berkowitz acknowledged that News Inc. was not yet profitable, he said that paid ad pages rose significantly last year and that it had supplanted Newspapers & Technology as the "No. 2 book" in ad pages.
"Oh, gimme a break; that's not true," said Mary L. Van Meter, Newspapers & Technology's publisher, who said that her ad pages were up by 20 percent for 1991 and that the magazine was well ahead of News Inc. for the year. She also said her magazine was profitable.
Presstime, a monthly underwritten by the American Newspaper Publishers Association, only began selling ads in 1984. James E. Donahue, the publisher, said sales were off about 20 percent last year, after declining in 1990 and 1989 as well.
Indeed, the publishers association and other trade and professional organizations are feeling the pinch.
Joe Lorfano, an association spokesman, said the number of member newspapers had declined to 1,324 from a peak of 1,430 during the 1980's. While membership declined by two papers in 1989, there has been a net loss of 94 papers since 1990, when the newspaper business began to turn sour. About a third of those papers either closed or merged, while the rest resigned from the association.
The association's annual convention, which is attended by vendors who pay stiff registration fees, is one of the group's principal sources of income.
But last year's convention in Vancouver, British Columbia, attracted about 1,400 people, compared with more than 3,000 in New York in 1987.
The American Society of Newspaper Editors is feeling an even tighter squeeze. Lee Stinnett, the executive director, said that membership was down about 10 percent since the peak in the late 80's and that attendance at last year's annual convention was off 50 percent from a year earlier.
"We've been burning up our modest reserves because we've taken the philosophy that we don't want to make drastic changes in our fee structure for fear of discouraging people from attending and joining," Mr. Stinnett said.
Indeed, the society has been operating at a deficit for the last three years and Mr. Stinnett said the reserves were almost exhausted.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Voted forStatus Quo, not One China;
A Stinging Defeat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Contrary to your Dec. 24 editorial on the Dec. 21 Taiwan election, the ruling Kuomintang Party "victory" was not "a vote for one China." How could it be? The Kuomintang-dominated Government banned the opposition party's platform of an independent "Republic of Taiwan" even from election posters. The Government arrested a score of pro-independence leaders on election eve. 
 The Kuomintang spent millions of dollars buying votes throughout the island, as many election observers attested. The Government subdivided Taiwan into myriad tiny districts tailored for Kuomintang candidates.
The Kuomintang also controls the electronic media. The triumph of its propaganda can be seen in your acceptance of the Kuomintang line on the election outcome.
The election was a stinging defeat for the Kuomintang's policy of reunification with the mainland. In 1990, using the same districting tactics, the ruling party was able to garner more than 90 percent of the vote in elections for local officials. This time, despite control of the airwaves, vote buying, gerrymandering, crackdowns and propaganda, it came up with only 70 percent of the vote.
The 24 percent of the population that voted for the Democratic Progressive Party also gave the lie to the Government claim that only 6 percent of the people support independence. The figure is far higher. On an island where advocating "one China, one Taiwan" can bring charges of sedition and a stiff jail sentence, pollsters are unlikely to get the truth to questions about independence.
The "One China" policy is a fantasy the Kuomintang uses to justify its a grip on Taiwan maintained by a vast security network and the ever-present threat of detention and imprisonment. It is also the policy of the totalitarian government on the mainland, whose claim to Taiwan is dubious at best.
Forty-five years after the Nationalist Party massacred 20,000 people and a generation of the island's leaders in a 1947 revolt, the Taiwanese still hunger for compensation and justice. The delight with which the Taiwanese evade taxes and regulations, and the enormous underground economy are expressions of the contempt in which the Kuomintang is held across the island.
With a Government that permits the islanders little say in their national affairs, and the electoral cheating the Kuomintang uses to stay in power, it is only a matter of time until the ruling party itself brings about the result it is trying to forestall: Taiwan independence.

HEADLINE: Behind the Iron Hand at Tenneco

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
In his first months at Tenneco, Michael H. Walsh has practically run a seminar on how to act swiftly to alter the course of an industrial giant in distress.
Even so, it will take a few years before anyone can applaud Mr. Walsh for administering at Tenneco Inc. his successful industrial shock therapy, which he most recently demonstrated at the Union Pacific Railroad. 
 Tenneco's troubles of too many plants and workers, huge debt payments, a bloated bureaucracy and fast gains by foreign rivals provide a classic profile of big American manufacturing and service companies hobbled by the managerial sins of the 1980's.
 
Follows G.E. Example
 Mr. Walsh's philosophy of urgent, tough actions to jolt businesses into keeping up with fast-moving markets has become fashionable with corporate directors. A new generation of chief executives has arisen, of which Mr. Walsh is at the forefront, that patterns itself after John F. Welch Jr., who revitalized the General Electric Company in the last decade.
"What we really did here was sit down and say, 'Look, here are the facts of life, here are the ranges of options we've got, and we've got to act quickly,' " Mr. Walsh said. "I don't think it's being tough or not tough. I think it's dealing with reality or not dealing with reality."
The drive and speed of Mr. Walsh's style is exemplified in his play as well as his work. He rides his stationary bicycle with such intensity in a half-hour drill most mornings that he recently developed back spasms.
For managers at Tenneco, which turns out products ranging from aircraft carriers and J. I. Case farm equipment to Walker mufflers and Monroe shock absorbers, Mr. Walsh's harsh medicine has forced them to search for ways to shed 6,000 of the company's 92,000 workers by the end of this year. They have already squeezed annual operating costs and capital budgets by a combined $500 million. Mr. Walsh, who is president and chief executive, preserved another $200 million by ordering the yearly dividend sliced in half.
 
Awaits the Payoff
 These moves, combined with sales of assets and preferred stock that raised more than $1 billion in cash, have put Tenneco's finances on firmer footing now than when he arrived Sept. 1. But to Mr. Walsh, a voluble one-time Federal prosecutor who sizes up events in blunt terms, the payoff for Tenneco must come in lower costs, higher profits and bigger market shares for each of its six operating companies.
If executives do not achieve specific targets, "they damn well better be able to demonstrate why they haven't, and what the corrective actions are going to be to get on track -- and in a hurry," he said evenly. "At Tenneco, we've been too understanding of excuses; that's why targets haven't been met."
Mr. Walsh is demanding improvements for 1992 regardless of what happens in the global and national economies. Last month, he gathered the dozen senior managers who head the six Tenneco companies and worked out specific goals for each company to pare costs and raise profits and sales.
He plans to convene the same group every month to review the results in close detail, such as how much less scrap Tenneco's Packaging Corporation of America is throwing out at its many box plants.
Tenneco executives have other symbols of Mr. Walsh's austerity. He closed the executive dining room at the company headquarters in downtown Houston and canceled a private Tenneco suite at the Helmsley Park Lane Hotel in New York.
 
Possible Loss of Over $1 Billion
 Tenneco's losses for 1991 might exceed $1 billion when they are announced late this month. The culprits were the high costs, weak sales and idled plant capacity at J. I. Case, the largest of the operating companies.
With dealer inventories bulging and Case's output down 34 percent in the third quarter, Mr. Walsh ordered plants shut and a winnowing of product lines that resulted in a $413 million write-down of assets in October. Case's operating losses for the first nine months of 1991 were $439 million, assuring the unit of its sixth -- and biggest -- loss in the last nine years.
Mr. Walsh would not comment about his profit goals for 1992, but analysts said Tenneco should earn a lackluster $300 million on revenues of $15 billion.
They added that the tough message to cut costs and bolster profits was sorely missing at Tenneco in recent years under James L. Ketelsen. Mr. Ketelsen, 60, had been Tenneco's leader since 1978 after a stint at running Case.
 
Forced to Cut Prices
 Analysts said his spending to revive Case with new products and his efforts to buoy Tenneco's share price with a $3.20 yearly dividend and the repurchase of 5.4 million shares for $300 million ignored a rising debt burden. Long-term debt exceeded 56 percent of capital at the end of 1990, before the debacle at Case unfolded.
"Tenneco was a company with severe financial problems that didn't realize it," said Eli S. Lustgarten, a machinery analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "The company is bleeding, losing a lot of money, and Walsh needs to get profits to a level that will satisfy both shareholders and lenders."
Mr. Ketelsen might have sealed his demise a year ago when he stoked production rates at Case in the face of flagging sales for tractors, combines and other farm machinery, Mr. Lustgarten said. Whether it was intended or not, the effect was to fatten 1990 profits at the expense of 1991 results.
Case was forced into huge price discounts last spring to find buyers for the equipment, and Mr. Ketelsen's backing among Tenneco directors splintered. They turned to Mr. Walsh, who had spurned their earlier offer to run Case, according to people familiar with the search. Mr. Walsh became president Sept. 10, chief executive on New Year's Day and will add the chairman's title when Mr. Ketelsen retires in May.
In addition to Case, the world's second-largest maker of farm equipment after John Deere, Tenneco owns a big natural gas pipeline, the world's largest shipyard, and three companies each with sales of more than $1 billion in auto parts, chemicals and packaging.
Mr. Walsh came to Tenneco with mostly glowing reviews from Wall Street for squeezing costs, gaining market share and bolstering profits in five years as head of the Union Pacific Railroad.
For example, one study showed that the only task for more than 200 clerks at the railroad was correcting errors committed in one of every five bills sent to customers, Mr. Walsh said. By reducing errors to fewer than one in every 20 bills, the railroad saved several million dollars in clerical salaries and benefits.
Mr. Walsh likes spicing his interviews and speeches about business problems with these kind of anecdotes as well as aphorisms borrowed from popular icons in business and sports.
Besides Mr. Welch at General Electric ("Either control your own destiny, or someone else will"), among Mr. Walsh's favorites are Vince Lombardi ("It's a game of inches") and Tom Peters, the management adviser and author ("Every company in America is trying harder, but only a few are actually getting better").
A star running back in his Oregon high school days, Mr. Walsh attended Stanford University on a football scholarship. Multiple shoulder separations and operations forced him to give up the sport.
 
Defender and Prosecutor
 After getting an economics degree at Stanford, Mr. Walsh worked in the Johnson Administration in the first class of White House Fellows. He attended Yale Law School, won an appellate court competition and later became a national director of Common Cause, the volunteer political action group.
He started his law career in San Diego in the company of rapists, murderers and drug dealers as a public defender, then rose to the post of United States Attorney for the Southern District of California at the age of 35. Mr. Walsh abandoned his law career three years later when the Cummins Engine Company persuaded him to manage part of its international manufacturing operations.
There he dealt for the first time with the cost and quality problems of a global American industry. "He never did anything brilliant at Cummins, it was just good blocking and tackling," said Mitchell Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. Mr. Walsh rose to head Cummins's global parts business and was an executive vice president before he departed for Union Pacific in 1986.
"You can make a pretty good case that you have to be an idiot to take this job, particularly with what I left at Union Pacific," he said about his move to Tenneco. "But you have to see the opportunity. Even given the difficulties at Case, there are significant strengths to build on in each and every business."
Details of Mr. Walsh's employment contract will not be made public until Tenneco mails proxy statements to stockholders this spring. He has only said that the rewards are linked to Tenneco's financial results. Union Pacific paid him $1 million in salary and bonuses in 1990.
Mr. Walsh's rush to avoid a financial crisis at Tenneco this fall preserved more than $2 billion, but his challenges are much broader. Before going to company directors and Wall Street with a long-term growth plan, he must grade the executives he inherited and calculate growth prospects for companies that compete in industries in which he has little experience.
At the same time, he must lead a global organization through a wrenching contraction that may go much farther than the cutbacks at Case. The shipyard in Newport News, Va., for instance, is likely to see fewer Pentagon orders. And some new projects that Mr. Ketelsen had bankrolled are already gone.
For now, Mr. Walsh is making few predictions of additional changes this year, except that he has no plans to sell any of the businesses.
"It will be a very difficult turnaround, but you have to give the board credit for bringing in somebody of the caliber of Mike Walsh," Mr. Lustgarten of Paine Webber said. "He's an executive with the capability and perseverance to do it."
