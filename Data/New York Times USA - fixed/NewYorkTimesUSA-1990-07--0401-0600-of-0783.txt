HEADLINE: Diplomacy Fails to End Store Boycott In Flatbush

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Little but the seasons have changed in front of the Korean-owned Family Red Apple grocery store in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
The black-led boycott of the store that began last winter has stretched bitterly -and effectively - into the summer, with no resolution in sight, despite lawsuits, court orders and quiet efforts by the Dinkins administration to mediate the conflict.
''The city can't do anything about this,'' a demonstrator said this weekend outside the nearly deserted store on Church Avenue. ''This is in the hands of the people.'' A few feet away, picketers stood behind a police barricade, as they have done almost every day for close to six months, chanting, ''Boycott! Boycott!'' Their presence and their voices are as much a part of the street scene now as the sound of traffic. 
''Things stand more or less where they were when this all started,'' said Richard A. Izzo, the lawyer for the store owner. ''Business is very sparse. As far as I can see, the city has done nothing to resolve this.''
 
Trying Quiet Diplomacy
The New York City Commission on Human Rights is leading the efforts of the Dinkins administration to end the conflict, which began after a confrontation between a black shopper and store employees. The commission has tried quiet diplomacy, speeches by the Mayor and public forums, but so far nothing has worked.
In the meantime, administration officials have begun working on ways to avoid future boycotts, by examining what Dennis deLeon, the city's Human Rights Commissioner, said is the underlying cause of the dispute: a lack of economic opportunity for all.
Demonstrators have complained about a paucity of black-owned businesses in the area, and the commission is studying lending practices as well as ways to improve relations between customers and owners.
At the same time, a fact-finding team appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins, which includes blacks and Koreans, is looking into the cause of the boycott.
''There are no magic wands or 30-second agendas,'' said Robert F. Sherman, the director of the commission's community relations institute. ''It's a tricky situation.''
At the core of the boycott remains the sharply disputed confrontation last January between the black shopper, Giselaine Felissaint, and store employees.
Mrs. Felissaint, a Haitian immigrant, contends that she was assaulted by three employees on Jan. 18 during an argument over a purchase. The employees deny the charge, and say that she became unruly after being asked to pay for some items.
 
Manager Is Charged
The demonstrators have demanded that the three men be arrested and that the store close because of the incident and because of what they said was a history of poor treatment of black customers by store management. A second Korean-owned store across the street is also being boycotted.
The demands have not changed even though the manager of the Family Red Apple, Pong Ok Jang, 32 years old, was charged with assault on July 7. Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, said it appeared that no one else would be charged in the incident, but said ''the investigation is continuing.''
George Dames, a boycott leader, said: ''The stores have become a symbol of what has happened across this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black people. It was not an isolated incident. And people are realizing that it doesn't have to be tolerated.''
Mr. deLeon said his office tried to convince Mrs. Felissaint to seek to end the boycott, but she has refused, pending the outcome of the criminal case. She has also sued the store's owner, Bong Jae Jang.
Mr. deLeon said the city then sought to have the leaders of the Haitian community ask for an end to the boycott, an effort that failed, partly because the boycott has taken on a life of its own, independent of Mrs. Felissaint.
 
'Grass Roots Style of Protest'
The commissioner said his staff has talked with 50 black and Korean neighborhood advocates, clergy and business leaders, and dozens of other Flatbush residents were interviewed by the fact finding team during a public forum last month. The black leaders of the boycott are a diverse group, making negotiations difficult, he said.
''It's a very grass-roots style of protest,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''Word spreads by word of mouth and identifying a single leader is difficult. There are a number of leaders and the landscape is always shifting.''
Mrs. Felissaint's lawyer, Colin A. Moore, said that the boycott ''has become a political movement'' in which the ''boycotters are fighting for respect for black people.''
But Mr. Moore said he did not think closing the stores would resolve long-term problems at the root of the conflict and the others that have erupted in the city between various immigrant and ethnic groups over the years.
''Nobody wins if the store leaves,'' he said. ''All you have is an empty store. The attitudes don't change. But ending the boycott right now should not be the objective. The objective should be removing the root causes: disrespect, economic powerlessness and a criminal justice system that is not there to assist the black community.'' Meanwhile, the boycott drags on. On June 27, Justice Gerald S. Held of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn ordered the police to enforce an injunction he issued in May against the picketers. But the city has appealed the order, saying that the police should be allowed to use discretion.
Not everyone in the neighborhood supports the boycott. This weekend, the picketers were defied by occasional shoppers, who were heckled, sometimes with humor and sometimes with harshness.
 
Tension, Attention Fading
''I'm suprised at you, sister,'' a man told a woman as she left the store. ''You are hurting my heart.'' She stared at him and said, ''I'm ashamed of you.''
Once in recent weeks, an elderly woman approached the barricade and distributed religious fliers.
''You have to forgive,'' she said. ''We've been forgiving for 400 years,'' a young man said. ''They attack one black woman, they attack them all.''
Racial slurs have been exchanged on both sides. But in recent weeks, tensions, the number of picketers and media attention have all decreased.
The boycott has continued to draw ''outsiders,'' from a Roman Catholic priest from Harlem, who supports the boycotters, to followers of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who support the store.
 
'A Lot of Integrity'
Charles Jenkins, the director of one of the rights commission's Brooklyn offices, has monitored the boycott from the beginning, visiting the picket line and talking with both sides.
''I never thought it would last this long,'' he said. ''There is a lot of integrity on the part of the demonstrators. They believe what they're doing is right. They're not looking for money. They're not looking to be bought off. They believe it's a correct issue and they're going to dig in and fight.''
Mr. Izzo laughed at that portrayal and said a few boycotters have intimidated the largely black neighborhood of immigrants. One of their motives, he said, is ''pure and simple racism.''
''I don't mean the residents of the community are racists,'' he said. ''I mean the organizers of the boycott.''
Mr. Dames responded that there are many Korean-owned stores in the area that are not being boycotted. ''Racism has nothing to do with this,'' he said. It's a question of respect.''

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Unexpected Shift In a Labor Rate

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AN era might be ending, unexpectedly. Americans have been jumping into the labor force in ever-increasing numbers since the 1960's, so that today about 66.4 percent of the working-age population holds jobs or seeks them. The problem is that the labor participation rate, as it is called, was the same 66.4 percent a year ago. Having risen year after year, it might finally be leveling off -and just when the Labor Department and many economists did not expect it to be.
The labor participation rate is not an easily grasped concept. Although it is calculated monthly along with the unemployment rate, the latter attracts much more attention. That probably should not be the case, for the rate at which people enter the labor force determines how many end up unemployed. And right now, the leveling off of labor participation is probably creating an unemployment rate that is artificially low at 5.2 percent. 
''With labor participation leveling off, it is easier to keep the unemployment rate down,'' said Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. And, of course, a low civilian unemployment rate - it declined in June from May's 5.3 percent - might make the American economy seem to be stronger than it actually is.
The reason for this false impression lies in the difficulty in distinguishing between jobless people inside and outside the labor force. The Labor Department uses a monthly survey of 60,000 households, representative of the population, to determine the difference. If someone of working age reports having a job or actively looking for one, then that person is counted as a participant in the labor force. As of June, there were 126.5 million participants, with 6.4 million of them unemployed.
But if the answer comes back that a jobless person is not looking for work, then that person is excluded from the labor force, no matter what the reason for not seeking work. The common reasons include being in school, at home raising kids, in early retirement or unlikely to find an appropriate job. Currently, 63.1 million working-age people are outside the labor force. And surprisingly, the fastest-growing contingent is young, 16 to 24 years old.
By the laws of demographics, they should not be the dropouts but the leaders in making the labor participation rate rise in the 1990's. Women over 25 had led the rise since the late 1960's, driving the rate from 59 percent to today's 66.4 percent as they converted in huge numbers from homemakers to wage earners. And now the young people should take over. They are fewer in number than the ''baby boom'' generation, so a greater percentage of these 16-to-24-year-olds should be drawn into the labor force to fill all the job slots.
Partly in expectation of this shift, the Labor Department had projected that the overall labor participation rate would continue to rise, reaching 69 percent in the year 2000. Instead, this upward movement is being held in check, above all by the 16-to-19-year-olds, whose participation rate has plunged more than three percentage points since January, to 52.9 percent. The participation rate of the 20-to-24-year-olds is also down over the last seven months, by one percentage point. Meanwhile, older groups are all holding their own, and the rate for women 25 and over has edged up again.
What is happening to the young people? No one knows yet, but labor economists offer possible explanations. One is that the wages paid to young people have fallen by more than 20 percent over the last 15 years, when adjusted for inflation, and young people are not willing to work at low pay, unless the jobs lead to promotions. Too many do not.
''Young people are more willing to live with their parents than they were 20 years ago,'' said Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist. ''If you are able to earn only $5 or $6 an hour, you are more likely to get by living with your parents, rather than enter the labor force.''
Another explanation is that young people are dropping out because a sluggish American economy is creating fewer and fewer new jobs for them. Similar weak job creation flattened the overall labor participation rate during recessions in the early 1980's and mid-1970's.
A flaw in this explanation is that the nation is not considered to be in a recession today, although the growth of the economy is weak.
Whatever the causes, a labor participation rate that is no longer rising might have a silver lining. When the economy does become strong again, business will have a pool of idle workers to draw into jobs as production rises, without having to bid up wages unduly, some economists reason.
And maybe Americans would be better off if labor participation declined a bit. After all, it is higher than in other industrial countries, except Sweden. ''I would look positively at a leveling off,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''We certainly don't want 100 percent of the population working.''

HEADLINE: World Farm Subsidies in Trade-Talk Spotlight

BYLINE: By DAVID ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
When international trade talks reconvene in Geneva on July 23, the negotiators will resume their long-stalled discussions of agriculture subsidies.
That in itself was probably the main accomplishment of the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries in Houston last week. The attention paid to farm policy by the leaders of the richest countries in the world, who rarely focus on so mundane a topic, gave the deadlocked trade talks the political impetus that had been missing.
But the countries themselves are little closer to a resolution of their differences on the issue, and many officials and leading economists here and in Europe question whether the gaps can be bridged before the current round of trade talks ends in December. 
''The proof of the pudding of what was done in Houston will be in the tasting in Geneva,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, an economist who specializes in trade policy at the Institute for International Economics, a private research organization.
''So far,'' he added in an interview, ''none of the sides have changed their positions.''
All seven industrial countries at the summit - the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan - subsidize farmers to one degree or another with tariffs and quotas on imports, export supports and internal price supports.
For example, the United States has import quotas on sugar, peanuts and dairy products and makes price-support payments to growers of many crops. Europe subsidizes its farmers to a much greater extent, and rice imports are prohibited altogether in Japan.
These barriers distort the world market for foods and feed grains. The world price for sugar is about 10 cents a pound, for example. But it costs five times that much in American supermarkets and even more in Europe, mainly because inexpensive imports are blocked and sugar producers are guaranteed a high price by their governments.
As a result, developing countries, which have little to sell but agriculture products, have trouble entering the world markets and gaining the resources they need for their economies to grow.
President Bush pushed his counterparts in Houston on the issue, he said, because his trade advisers had convinced him that the trade negotiations would break down if the industrial countries did not agree at least to cut their farm subsidies if not abolish them.
''Agriculture is the underpinning of the whole round,'' said William E. Brock, a special trade representative in the Reagan Administration, who was in Houston as a private consultant to lobby for change. ''Half the countries in the world will take a walk if agriculture is not part of the agreement.''
 
Crucial Issues at Stake
If the talks collapse, the industrial countries will not get a settlement on issues that are of primary importance to them: freedom for banks and insurance companies to open branches in developing countries, overseas markets for services like telecommunications, construction and engineering, and standards to protect intellectual property. American officials calculate, for example, that American businesses lose $50 billion a year to piracy of trademarks, patents and copyrights.
If the trade talks are successful, said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, ''there will be an economic renaissance for the 21st century.'' If they fail, she added, ''the world will have dangerously decreased economic prosperity.''
Still, the European countries, as much as they would gain from more open markets for their manufactured products and services, have been reluctant to relinquish their farm subsidies. And the Bush Administration could never sell Congress and American farmers on cutting subsidies as long as they are prevalent elsewhere.
 
Europe's Social Farm Policy
The Common Agriculture Policy, which governs the European Community on the issue, maintains high domestic prices for farm products with quotas and tariffs. That leads to more production than Europe can consume. The surplus is dumped on the world market, and export supports are paid to farmers to compensate them for the lower world price.
Farmers are a potent political force in the 12 countries of the community, which has more than 10 million farmers, compared with only two million in the United States. Moreover, the Europeans consider their farm policies to be social and ecological policies as well as economic ones.
''I've been in your cities,'' a European official told an American reporter, ''and I don't want our cities to get like that, crowded with all the people who have moved off the farms. We don't have plains and prairies and deserts like you. Our farms are our countryside.''
 
Efficiency Another Factor
The Europeans have another reason to resist lowering their subsidies. Their farms are much less efficient than those in the United States and Canada, and they would not prove competitive in a free market. If controls were lifted, the European official said, ''our farmers would go bust.''
Perhaps the most inefficient farms are in Bavaria, where the farmers are an important part of the political coalition of the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. He is facing a crucial election in December, just as the trade talks will be winding up.
The summit leaders agreed that their countries would make ''substantial progressive reductions'' in their farm supports. But their final communique as a whole was evasive and left to the Geneva negotiators the central questions of how large and how fast the reductions would be made.
Optimists read the summit agreement to mean that the United States has relinquished its position that all subsidies should be abolished according to a specific timetable and that the Europeans have conceded that some reduction in supports is necessary.

HEADLINE: Discussions Are Held On Fast Data Network

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation, the MCI Communications Corporation and officials at a group of Michigan universities have quietly begun discussions with the Federal Government about creating a nonprofit company that would operate a high-speed computer network that could one day reach every home in the country.
Some competitors worry that I.B.M. and MCI will gain an inside track in the race to build such a network, which is expected to replace the various specialized but much slower networks in use today.
 
Similar to Highway System
The proposed network would function like the nation's interstate highway system, carrying not just computer data but television images, telephone conversations and other forms of communication.
Just as the highway system created economic activity everywhere it was built in the 1950's, the computer network is expected to create businesses that take advantage of its technology. 
The proposed network is thus seen as a significant business opportunity. Traffic on the National Science Foundation Network, or Nsfnet, a specialized network started three years ago by I.B.M., MCI and the Michigan universities, is increasing by 25 percent a month.
I.B.M. and the Washington-based MCI say their motivation is to make the United States stronger. But their proposal is raising complex issues like who will operate the data networks and how they will be financed. A number of corporations, including computer manufacturers, regional telephone operating companies and providers of long-distance telephone service are eager to participate in developing high-speed networks.
The discussions with the Government center on the network's management, whether by the Government or private corporations, as well as its structure.
 
Essential to Competitiveness
Many industry executives and public officials view the networks as essential to promoting industrial competitiveness in areas ranging from broadcasting to scientific research.
I.B.M., MCI and the universities quietly sent a proposal to Government officials urging that they set up a nonprofit corporation to operate a national network that would carry data at more than 700 times the speed of today's fastest networks.
Some competitors in the computer and communications businesses are concerned that creating a corporation involving I.B.M. and MCI might stifle small commercial operations that have begun providing network services regionally.
''The regional computer networks are very uptight about this,'' said one computer industry executive, who spoke last week on the condition that he not be identified. ''They are very scared about this issue.''
 
Other Efforts Under Way
The initiative by the three organizations, which are joined in a partnership operating the National Science Foundation Network, is one of several being explored to design and deploy high-speed computer networks.
A bill pending in Congress introduced by Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, would create financing for developing a high-speed computer network called the National Research and Education Network to link the nation's supercomputer centers.
A consortium effort, organized by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a nonprofit research organization based in Reston, Va., has also drawn together corporations, universities and Government agencies to experiment with computer hardware and software that can transmit data at extraordinarily high speeds.
I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., insisted that it was not trying to pre-empt other efforts to develop advanced computer networks.
''Nsfnet has been so successful that we're struggling to determine this kind of growth,'' said Allan H. Weis, I.B.M.'s vice president of engineering and scientific computing. ''We want to make sure that there is consensus. If we did something and it was structured improperly, it could hurt the growth of the network.''
 
Motivations Questioned
But others are puzzled about I.B.M.'s motivations for proposing a separate corporation to control the operation of data superhighways when advanced development of the systems is just beginning.
''It is still a wide-open question of how to structure a future network,'' said Fred J. Howlett, the division manager for high-speed data networks at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. ''The legislative momentum behind funding a high-speed computer network is strong right now. If there is any indication that corporations might go ahead without Government support, it wouldn't be helpful to the legislative effort.''
I.B.M. has a significant advantage in the emerging computer network market because of its early investment in Nsfnet, a number of industry executives said. And several suggested that the company might be considering computer networks as a future market for expansion.
 
Concerns From Success
The issue has generated concern in part because of the tremendous success of Nsfnet, which is the backbone of a nationwide scientific, educational and commercial network known as Internet. The network now has several million users and consists of more than 60,000 large and small computers. It carries more than 3.2 billion packets of data each month, officials at the National Science Foundation said.
Nsfnet is also cited as a example of how a small amount of Federal financing can have a tremendous effect.

HEADLINE: Corrections Detroit Set For Talks With U.A.W.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 15

 BODY:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about negotiations between the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers referred incorrectly to the union membership of workers at United States plants owned wholly or partly by Japanese car makers. At some plants, hourly workers are indeed represented by the United Automobile Workers. Also, a chart with the article misstated the average hourly wage paid last year to workers at Honda of America. It was $15.32, including 77 cents for profit-sharing.
Contract negotiations between the Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers union, which have historically been fractious, show signs of being much tamer this year. But the apparent calm may be deceiving.
Both sides in the bargaining, which opens on Wednesday, concede that they have less leverage than ever to wrench painful economic concessions from one another or to force a big work stoppage. An important reason is that their common adversary, the Japanese auto industry, grows more formidable by the day and would undoubtedly gain ground as a result of protracted labor strife. 
Moreover, labor and management have been trying to cooperate more. One example is innovative factory-floor programs that give hourly workers more responsibility and turn foremen into coaches. The bitterness engendered by a long national strike could undermine such efforts.
 
'Maturing' of the Process
''It's quieter this year, and I think it would be fair to say that this might be because of a maturing of the negotiating process,'' said a member of the U.A.W. staff who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
''Normally at this time you'd see the union demanding job security, and the companies would be saying they were in big trouble,'' said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. ''The two sides would be screaming at each other.''
Nevertheless, Stephen P. Yokich, U.A.W. vice president, has been quoted in local newspapers as saying: ''It's easy to strike. It's getting a settlement that's hard.''
Experts point out that a strike might still occur when the current contract expires on Sept. 14, particularly if talks snag on the important unresolved issues of health-care costs and job security.
The auto makers desperately want to reduce the cost of health benefits, which has grown into the single biggest expense in building cars and trucks. The union wants to halt the loss of jobs caused by the shutdown of underused plants, especially at the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation. To the extent the U.A.W. cannot stop the loss of jobs, it wants the auto makers to improve the financial umbrella for those who are laid off. Since 1987, G.M. has spent more than $600 million on jobless benefits for workers who have permanently lost their jobs.
 
Big Three Pay More
Dan Luria, a fellow at the Industrial Technology Institute, a research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., predicted that a new three-year contract covering nearly 500,000 United States auto workers at G.M., the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler would give workers a wage increase in the first year and lump-sum bounses in the second and third years. The raise may mean an increase in auto workers' salaries of 15 percent to 20 percent over three years, he said. The 500,000 workers are about half of the U.A.W.'s overall membership, which also includes workers at non-Big Three parts plants and aerospace and farm equipment companies.
Currently, auto workers at the Big Three have a higher average hourly base wage than those at Japanese car plants in the United States, according to Harbour & Associates, a consulting firm based in Troy, Mich. Hourly workers at the Japanese ''transplants'' are not covered by the U.A.W. contract.
Workers averaged $15.94 an hour at G.M. in 1989, $15.73 at Chrysler and $15.48 at Ford, compared with $15.16 at the Mazda Motor Corporation's United States operations, $14.95 at the Toyota Motor Company, $14.55 at the Honda Motor Company and $14.23 at the Nissan Motor Company. The Japanese car makers also have an advantage in productivity. Whereas G.M. averaged 4.99 workers per car per day, for example, Nissan averaged 2.94.
The union will try to resist demands by the auto makers that workers be forced to pay higher deductibles on their medical insurance and to begin to pay a percentage of their medical bills beyond the deductible, Mr. Luria said. Instead, the union may be willing to accept rules that encourage members to join health maintenance organizations and preferred-provider organizations, in which doctors and hospitals provide care at a lower price.
More militant union members, known as the New Directions movement, have been less active since recent local elections in which many of their candidates were defeated. 50% Chance Seen for Strike The industry has not had a protracted strike since a seven-week walkout against G.M. in 1970. The U.A.W. staged a short walkout against several G.M. plants in 1984. Edward J. Sullivan, an economist for the WEFA Group, rates the chance of a strike at about 50 percent.
''Existing job-security measures are viewed as inadequate protection against the structural changes facing the industry,'' Mr. Sullivan said, referring to the rise in the past five years of American-based auto plants owned by Japanese car companies.
In a poll in the spring by The Detroit Free Press, more than 50 percent of auto workers said their top priority was ''strong job guarantees and outsourcing restrictions.'' Outsourcing is the practice of subcontracting some manufacturing work to foreign and domestic factories with lower labor costs. More than half those polled said they had been saving money in the event of a strike.
The negotiating process will work this way: Beginning on Wednesday, negotiators for the union will meet separately with negotiators for each of the Big Three in talks that will last through August. Close to Labor Day top union executives will pick one of the auto makers as its ''target'' and attempt to negotiate a master contract with that company by the Sept. 14 expiration date of the current contract.
Ford's chairman, Harold A. Poling, said early this year that he would not mind if Ford was chosen as the target; that way Ford negotiators could structure an agreement that would favor their interests. Ford, which has very little unused capacity, might be quite willing to agree to strong job-security provisions in return for concessions on health-care costs.
If an agreement is reached, the master contract will be taken to each of the other auto makers. But this ''patterned bargaining'' could break down if the other auto makers demand special concessions that acknowledge their competitive position. Chrysler has said that its weaker financial position requires that it have a contract different from G.M.'s and Ford's.
If agreements are not reached, union members may walk out or there may be a short contract extension in hopes of averting a strike.
 
Need to Be Competitive
In the contract signed with the U.A.W. in 1987, G.M. agreed not to shut any plants permanently, although it was allowed to idle plants indefinitely if sales were slow. A short time later G.M. began ''idling'' big assembly plants, and few people expect that they will reopen. G.M.'s move exposed a loophole in the contract, but it also made clear the reality that auto makers cannot continue to build cars for which there are no customers.
Ultimately, company and union leaders realize that the only way to keep members working will be to sell more cars and trucks, which means being more competitive with Japanese auto makers. The Japanese companies in the first six months of 1990 captured a record 28 percent of the new-car market in the United States, up from 24 percent a year ago.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 20, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about negotiations between the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers referred incorrectly to the union membership of workers at United States plants owned wholly or partly by Japanese car makers. At some plants, hourly workers are indeed represented by the United Automobile Workers. Also, a chart with the article misstated the average hourly wage paid last year to workers at Honda of America. It was $15.32, including 77 cents for profit-sharing. Section A; Page 3, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Little Change Expected for Rates

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The bond market, which has so far this summer received help from both the President of the United States and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, may have a more difficult time finding new friends in the weeks ahead. But without further assistance, credit market analysts said, interest rates were not likely to decline much from current levels, and might even rise.
''I am not totally bearish, but we have had a good move'' in rates, said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''Right now the market is very vulnerable to any bad news. To improve further we need further evidence of a weak economy or a budget deal out of Congress.'' 
Bad news has indeed been a fairly scarce commodity lately, and has been especially rare when it bears a Washington dateline.
 
Statements Welcomed
In late June President Bush encouraged the credit markets by forswearing a long-standing pledge not to seek tax increases as a way of securing a substantive package to cut the Federal budget deficit.
The strong suggestion last Thursday by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, that the central bank was prepared to ease credit conditions -a hint that apparently became reality the following day - was equally welcome. In view of the Fed's fabled reticence in disclosing its intentions, Mr. Greenspan's remarks were in some respects even more surprising than the President's flip-flop on taxes.
Mr. Greenspan's comments on Fed policy, in Congressional testimony, was ''one of the most unusual ways the central bank has eased in postwar history,'' said Alan Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company.
 
Funds Rate Down to 8 Percent
The easing move, which analysts said had pushed the target for the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market down to 8 percent from 8.25 percent, helped to push short-term rates down sharply and caused bond yields to ease.
On the strength of the Fed's move, yields on the 8 3/8 percent two-year Treasury notes fell by more than 25 basis points during the week, to 8.10 percent late Friday. Bond yields also fell, but not as much: by the end of last week the Treasury's benchmark 8 3/4 percent bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.44 percent, compared with 8.50 percent on July 6.
Despite the decline in market rates, reaction to the easing move bore a strange resemblance to what happened in late December, the last time the Fed eased policy. Now, as then, gold prices rose sharply in response to the rate decline, and the dollar weakened.
 
Higher Than in Early July
And while long-term interest rates fell last week, they still remain higher than they were in early July, when the market was expecting an easing move by the Fed.
''The market's response to the Fed's move has been less than overwhelmingly enthusiastic,'' said John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. In part, Mr. Lonski and others said that traders might view the Fed's decision to ease credit as being politically induced, which could weaken the central bank's credibility as an inflation fighter.
In the near term, however, the Fed's slight easing move is not likely to help stimulate the economy, nor rekindle inflation, the analysts said. In fact, barring any further sign of an economic slowdown or progress on the Federal budget, the easing step taken last week is likely to be a one-time event rather than the first in a series of moves.
''For the time being, the Fed will stop here,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''And as a result I am not so sure that bond yields will drop any lower than they are right now.''
Even though Mr. Greenspan cited a tightening of credit by financial institutions as a reason for the Fed move, the analysts said the drop in the Federal funds rate was not likely to persuade banks to lower their prime lending rate, which has remained at 10 percent since early January.
 
Pressure on Banks Cited
''Banks are under exceptional earnings pressure, and have every incentive to maintain margins right now,'' said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh.
Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company said that ''banks will take as long as possible before they lower rates.''
Aside from monitoring developments on the budget front, the main focus this week will probably be on Mr. Greenspan's semiannual review of the economy and monetary policy to be given Congress. Aside from amplifying the reasons for the Fed's easing last week, some analysts said they were hopeful Mr. Greenspan would provide some sign of how the central bank might respond if Congress puts together a budget package that cuts the deficit by roughly $50 billion.
A variety of economic statistics are also scheduled to be released, the most important of which are the consumer price data for June, which are expected on Wednesday. In advance of the report, most Wall Street analysts are forecasting a rise in the Consumer Price Index of a modest two-tenths of a percent for June, due in large part to continued softness in energy prices.
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, most forecasters see a June rise in the index of three-tenths of a point, following a similar increase in May.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
For Networks, the Punch Line Is a Bigger Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE sound stages are being re-activated here this week as production begins on the fall season's television series. And the large majority of those stages will be filled with people telling jokes.
In television these days, there's no business like the ho-ho business. Comedy will dominate prime-time television in the coming season as never before. The three networks and Fox Broadcasting will offer 20 new comedy shows this fall, adding to schedules already crowded with situation comedies. 
Of the 93 entertainment programs (not counting news, sports or movies) in prime time next fall, 50 will be comedies. NBC will have a record 16 half-hour comedy shows. ABC will have 14 and Fox and CBS will each have 10.
Many forces are driving the comedy explosion, which is led by the fundamental popularity of the genre. Nine of the 10 top-rated series last season were half-hour comedies.
Comedy is proliferating all over television. Cable channels from MTV to ESPN are including some form of comedy. The pay-cable channels, like HBO and Showtime, recognizing that they can no longer depend as heavily on movies, have upgraded their commitments to comedy.
Steve Hewitt, the senior vice president of original programming for Showtime, said his network had all but abandoned special music programs for comedy. ''A totally unknown stand-up comic gets triple the rating on our service that we get even for a major music star, such as Barry Manilow,'' he said.
And Warren Littlefield, senior vice president of programming for NBC, said: ''We don't need social scientists to tell us the entire country is stressed out. The country is dying for laughs.''
About the only place where comedy does not seem to be thriving is on the two cable comedy channels introduced this year. So far, neither HBO's Comedy Channel nor MTV's HA! channel is offered on enough cable systems to attract any attention.
Good ratings always translate to good business in the television industry, but comedies are appealing for several other economic reasons. The most important: Comedies drive the domestic syndication business.
For years, hourlong dramatic shows have largely been a bust in syndication, but comedies continue to sell well, sometimes spectacularly. Hundreds of millions of dollars in sales have been racked up by ''The Cosby Show'' and ''Cheers.'' But even mediocre comedies, like ''Webster'' and ''Gimme a Break,'' have made large profits in syndication.
For the networks, which cannot share in the profits from syndication, comedies make economic sense because they hold their audiences so much better than hourlong dramas in reruns, when the commercial time is pure profit.
''In a year-round business, comedies make much better sense,'' Mr. Littlefield said.
Viewers are clearly far more willing to laugh at ''Murphy Brown'' a second time than watch ''Jake and the Fatman'' solve a mystery again.
Comedies also tend to attract the audiences that advertisers most want to reach - younger, urban viewers.
''History tells us that the network that dominates in comedy wins in both network ratings and demographics,'' Mr. Littlefield said.
The demographic strength of comedies has been a key to the success of Fox, which widened its audience by more than 70 percent over the last year largely on the appeal of its hit comedies, ''Married . . . With Children,'' ''In Living Color'' and ''The Simpsons.''
Indeed, Fox has made the coming season's boldest scheduling maneuver by deciding to take on NBC's perennial leader, Bill Cosby, with the phenomenonal upstart Bart Simpson. The move makes sense financially. There are advertising advantages for ''The Simpsons'' in the Thursday-at-8 time period that are not available in the time period it will be leaving, Sundays at 8:30.
Movie advertising has become a growing and increasingly lucrative category for the national networks. Film studios now rely more heavily than ever before on television advertising to introduce expensive movies. The most important night in movie advertising is Thursday, because most films open on Friday.
On Thursday nights during the last few years, NBC's enormously potent lineup, including ''Cosby,'' ''Cheers'' and ''L.A. Law,'' often seemed like one long series of coming attractions.
So, as successful as Fox has been, it has not been a major factor in that movie advertising bounty - until now. ''The Simpsons,'' with an audience profile that skews young and hip (in other words, the movie audience) is the ideal vehicle for Thursday night advertising.
Fox executives said last week that the opportunity to snatch some of that heavy Thursday movie advertising was a ''serendipitous'' coincidence in their audacious decision to move ''The Simpsons.''
Considering that Fox also owns a movie studio that advertises on Thursday nights, that sounds like a lot of serendipity to swallow.
But the Fox executives delightedly acknowledged that ad sales to the movie studios on coming episodes of ''The Simpsons'' went extremely well this summer - almost as well as sales of Bart Simpson T-shirts.

During the second quarter, the company strengthened its reserve for possible loan losses by providing $186 million, an action that was prompted by increases in non-performing loans primarily due to deterioration in New Jersey's real estate markets and overall economic environment. In addition, in the second quarter, the corporation's allowance for other real estate owned was increased by $19 million.
 
The company said that partially offsetting the additions to the reserves were non-recurring gains of $68 million from the sale of its credit card accounts and receivables, as well as the sale of securities backed by automobile and home equity loans originated by the company's lead bank, Midlantic National Bank.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Promise of Yalta: Redeemed at Last?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 16

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's acceptance of NATO membership for a united Germany brings the West closer to achieving the failed promises of Yalta in February 1945 for freedom, democracy and self-determination for all of Central and Eastern Europe.
Now, as then, it could not have happened without the Soviet leader. After the conference at the Crimean resort in 1945, Stalin drove home the gains of Soviet troops on the battlefield and brought half of Europe under Communist rule. Now, his successor has released it, agreeing to withdraw 350,000 soldiers from East Germany over the next three to four years. 
''It looks as if the key step has been taken,'' said an aide to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher after Mr. Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said at a news conference in another Soviet resort today that they had made the breakthrough, though he pointed out that all the British Government knew today came from news reports.
 
Stranger Than Fiction
But truth in East-West relations these days is often stranger than fiction, and so far predictions of how Europe and NATO are to be shaped have required frequent revision as deeds recently held impossible and unthinkable are routinely carried out.
For example, Mr. Gorbachev agreed last week to accept NATO's invitation to come to the lion's den and address them in Brussels. Starting July 1, a NATO member nation, West Germany, has been paying - and will pay 1.25 billion marks ($780 million) by the end of December - for the Soviet Union to station its troops on German territory, and will continue doing so for a transitional period that could last for several years.
When it ends, Soviet troops will withdraw from the eastern part of Germany. But American and presumably French and British forces - fewer than the 362,000 from these countries that were in West Germany at the end of last year - are to remain when East and West Germany reduce their combined armed forces from 667,000 to 370,000.
The United States, Britain and France have ritually supported the goal of German unification for 40 years. But the German-Soviet agreement brings closer the day when unification begins to bite - that is, when the Western allies and the Soviets will have to hand back to the Germans the residual claims on sovereignty, occupation rights and control over Berlin's affairs that they have exercised since the war's end.
By agreeing to German membership in NATO, Mr. Gorbachev is making a historic gamble, one driven by forces of history, politics and internal economic contradictions that may have outrun his ability to control them. He is also relying on the declaration by the NATO leaders at the London summit meeting this month that their alliance, created when the wartime community of Soviet and Western interests collapsed, means his country no harm and will work together with Moscow to insure a lasting peace.
But the West, too, has made a gamble - on the loyalty and commitment to Western democratic values of the Germans, who they believe will be led by Chancellor Kohl after unification and all-German elections on Dec. 2. Mr. Kohl's NATO allies left to him the negotiations with Mr. Gorbachev on what ceiling to impose on the armed forces of a united Germany. Today, with Mr. Gorbachev in the Caucasian resort of Zheleznovodsk, Mr. Kohl named a figure of 370,000, far below the existing strength of the West German forces alone, at 494,000. Pending fuller disclosure and examination of the fine print of the Soviet-German accord, reactions from other European capitals today were guarded. ''Germany's membership in our alliance will increase stability for all,'' a NATO spokesman in Brussels said.
 
Little Surprise
A well-placed French official said he was not surprised by the Soviet move, because Bonn, which he said had been urged on by Washington, had made a significant concession to Moscow by agreeing to set a limit on the armed forces of a united Germany.
Among the things that European policy makers and diplomats said they were not sure Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev had solved were the conditions of the transitional arrangements governing the status of the Soviet forces in East Germany pending their withdrawal. Mr. Kohl said that no nuclear arms or foreign troops should be based on the territory of eastern Germany.
''He probably means forever,'' a NATO diplomat in Brussels said today, ''but we have only said that we would consider that for the transition period.''
Another unknown was what kind of economic help Mr. Kohl promised Mr. Gorbachev to help his plans for economic change, now mired in chaos, indecision and bureaucratic resistance. Mr. Kohl sought but did not get Western agreement to provide loans and money, though he got approval to go ahead with his own plans for at least $3.5 billion in payments and loan guarantees this year.
Soviet agreement to German membership in NATO should bring progress in the six-power negotiations on the external implications of unification that resume in Paris on Tuesday. At those talks, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and his counterparts from Britain, France and the Soviet Union will meet with the foreign ministers of the two German states to discuss the remaining obstacles.
This time they have also invited a Polish representative who is expected to press Warsaw's demand that the wartime allies keep some of their residual rights in Germany until the united German nation ratifies a formal treaty renouncing any intention of altering the border with Poland. The two German Parliaments jointly agreed last month to negotiate such a treaty.
 
Ending Occupation Rights
Finally, the allies will have to end their occupation rights in Berlin, replacing them as the Western powers have already in West Germany with bilateral pacts on the status of forces. Since the war, for example, no West German-owned airline has had the right to fly out of West Berlin, and the routes have been monopolized by British, French and American companies, some with German minority partners.
The biggest remaining obstacle to German unity is successful conclusion of an agreement between Washington and Moscow on reducing conventional forces in Central Europe, a goal that should be made much easier by agreement on a German troop figure.
The conventional force talks in Vienna have been going slowly recently, British officials say. But if the talks now proceed to a American-Soviet conclusion, they can move rapidly to discuss limits on other European countries' forces, and allow the ''two plus four'' talks to report to the 35-nation summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe scheduled in Paris on Nov. 19-21.

The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that it would eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs, or nearly 13 percent of its work force. The cutbacks represent the most striking example of the economic effect of declining Pentagon spending and the intense competition in the commercial aircraft business.
McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military contractor and the No. 2 builder of jetliners behind the Boeing Company, is facing the cancellation of several of its largest combat aircraft programs, including the F-15 fighter, and a cut in orders on other programs, like the Air Force's C-17 transport.
But analysts said McDonnell Douglas had aggravated the problems of a declining military budget by mishandling many programs. It has encountered severe cost overruns and schedule delays, for example, on both the C-17 and the Navy's new A-12 attack plane. Moreover, the company has long struggled unsuccessfully to make a profit in the commercial aircraft business, despite a healthy backlog of orders from airlines. 
Although the layoffs at McDonnell Douglas are attributable as much to the problems in the company's commercial business as to the bleak outlook for its military programs, the company's action fits a pattern of steady cutbacks in the aerospace and military contracting industries. With the exception of Boeing, whose commercial aircraft business is booming, virtually every company has seen its profits tumble, and even Boeing announced recently that it would eliminate 5,600 jobs this year because of a downturn in its military business.
Under pressure to trim the Federal budget deficit, Congress has been cutting the Pentagon budget for the past several years. Much deeper cuts are expected because of the reduction in the Soviet military threat.
The Grumman Corporation has eliminated 6,000 jobs in recent years, to about 27,600, with cuts of 7,400 jobs on Long Island offset by some growth in other regions. The Lockheed Corporation has reduced its work force this year by 5,500, to 77,000, with most of the cuts in California and Georgia. And the Northrop Corporation expects to have cut 5,500 by the end of this year, mostly in California.
McDonnell Douglas said it would lay off 9,000 workers in Southern California, including 8,000 at its plant in Long Beach, where it builds its commercial aircraft and the Air Force's C-17. The job loss in Long Beach will be about 1,000 greater than the company had previously said it expected there by the end of the year.
The company said it would cut another 4,500 jobs in St. Louis, where the company is based and where it builds military aircraft like the F-15 fighter. In Arizona, where the company builds military helicopters, 800 jobs will be lost. Another 1,000 jobs would be cut in 25 other states where the company has operations. Attrition and other cuts could bring the total work force reduction to 17,000 by the end of the year, the company said.
 
Smaller Cut Possible
The company also said, however, that the job cuts might total as few as 14,000, or about 11 percent of the work force. McDonnell Douglas has 131,000 full-time employees plus more than 4,000 contract workers.
McDonnell Douglas said several weeks ago that it was developing a plan to cut $700 million in expenses to survive in both the commercial and military markets, and workers have been anticipating widespread layoffs since then. Barbara Anderson, a spokeswoman for the company, said the layoffs would fall most heavily on ''indirect'' workers, or those not directly involved in the design and manufacture of the company's planes and other products, and would include both white-collar and hourly employees.
''We tried to do everything else,'' John F. McDonnell, the company's chairman, said at a news conference in St. Louis. ''But in the final analysis we had to come to this.''
 
Profit Problems
McDonnell Douglas's problems in the commercial jetliner business go back for decades. Although the company's sales have always been brisk, it has never been able to keep costs low enough and its production line operating quickly enough to turn a consistent profit. It sold its DC-10 jetliner for two decades without making any significant profit on it, said Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. The company has pinned much of its hope for the future on its new MD-11, a 325-seat jumbo jet, which should be delivered to airlines starting late this year or early 1991.
The layoffs are sure to be an economic shock to the communities where McDonnell Douglas does business, especially in St. Louis and in Long Beach, where the Douglas Aircraft division is the largest employer. The company said it would offer resume services, job fairs and counseling to workers who lose their jobs.
Layoffs of the scale announced today are certain to increase pressure in Congress and on the state and local level for funding to retrain workers who lose jobs in military-related fields and to encourage large and small contractors to explore new markets. But Congress is not likely to begin restoring funds to programs like the F-15 or McDonnell Douglas's AH-64 helicopter or the AV-8B Marine Corps jet, all of which are likely to be canceled in coming years, Congressional aides said today.
Outside the gates of the sprawling Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach today, employees seemed resigned to coping with the company's problems. Asked what he might do if he lost his job, one engineer on the company's new MD-11 commercial jetliner, replied with one word: ''Boeing.'' The engineer, who declined to give his name, said he had already sent a resume to Boeing, which is based in Seattle, and has hired thousands of workers from California in recent years.
But a Boeing spokesman said that employment in the company's commercial aircraft division was dropping slightly and that the company was no longer hiring large numbers.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. ACTS TO CUT RATES UP TO 50% ON CALLS ABROAD

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission, concerned that the cost of providing international telephone service has been falling far faster than the prices that callers pay, has begun an effort to force down rates by up to 50 percent within three years.
The agency has concluded that action is needed because telephone monopolies in nations other than the United States are keeping international rates high even as improvements in technology and operating efficiency have sharply reduced the cost of providing service. For example, while operators are no longer needed for most international calls, rates are still based on such expenses.
 
Payments Could Be Limited
The F.C.C. says that under a program it proposed last Thursday, American consumers could save several billion dollars a year.
Under this program, the agency would encourage foreign telephone companies to reduce their charges. It could limit payments from the United States to those that refuse to cooperate. 
''We certainly don't want to become unwitting handmaidens to a regimen that does not allow price changes,'' said Alfred C. Sikes, the chairman of the F.C.C.
But the F.C.C. effort will probably be opposed vigorously by foreign governments, which charge high rates for international telephone service to subsidize domestic phone calls and other services. Less ambitious efforts by the United States to reduce international telephone charges have met strong resistance abroad, said Earl S. Barbely, the director of telecommunications and information standards at the State Department.
International rates are set through negotiations between American and foreign telephone companies. The companies agree on one price to pay each other for receiving international calls. American companies, for example, pay 78 cents a minute to Deutsche Bundespost, the state-owned German company, for calls from the United States to West Germany, and the German company pays the same for calls made from Germany.
But the F.C.C. thinks the agreed-upon prices have not fallen nearly as much as the cost of handling calls. It wants prices to come down so that American carriers can charge their customers less.
 
German Charges a Problem
Telephone traffic between the United States and West Germany offers a good example of what troubles the F.C.C. American long-distance carriers charge as little as 62 cents a minute for calls to West Germany. Deutsche Bundespost, on the other hand, charges $1.91 a minute, and that does not include 32 cents a minute in taxes. The American carriers, which are competing with each other to offer the lowest rates, can ill afford to raise their rates. Their state-owned German counterpart, with no competition, charges whatever it pleases.
But even the 62 cents a minute that the American carriers charge may be twice the cost of handling the call. The problem, as the F.C.C. views it, is that agreements with foreign telephone companies have been based for decades on the much higher costs of operator-assisted calls. Even though they now offer direct-dial service, American carriers continue to make to foreign phone companies payments equal to half the inflated cost of operator-assisted calls. In the German example, they pay the German phone company half of $1.56, or 78 cents a minute.
 
Losing Money on the Calls
In short, the American long-distance companies are losing up to 16 cents a minute on such calls. They are able to sustain these losses because they receive 78 cents a minute from Deutsche Bundespost on calls made from West Germany. If the amount they had to pay the foreign company declined, so could their rates.
Given the disparities in rates, people in the United States spent 367 million minutes on calls to West Germany in 1988, while people in West Germany spent only 166 million minutes on calls to the United States, said Gregory C. Staple, a Washington lawyer and author of a recent study on international telephone rates sponsored by the International Institute of Communications in London.
The result, according to the F.C.C., was that American telephone companies paid $153 million in 1988 to the Deutsche Bundespost because it received 201 million minutes more of calls than it sent.
Reductions in the prices telephone companies pay each other could shrink the nation's annual trade deficit in telephone service, which was $2.4 billion last year and one of the fastest-growing components of the United States trade deficit.
The F.C.C. program, distributed for public comment last Thursday, would permit the agency for the first time to limit payments by American carriers to foreign partners that refuse to cooperate in reducing rates. It would also guarantee nearly automatic approval by the Federal agency of any international rate reductions under existing agreements, and make easier the approval of new agreements with rules that reduce international rates.
The comment period will probably last through November, after which the commission will amend its proposal if necessary and vote on whether to adopt it, said William J. Kirsch, the F.C.C.'s senior attorney for international issues. The Federal agency's five commissioners usually adopt proposed programs because they oversee the drafting of proposals.
Mr. Sikes said the prospects for similar changes overseas were good because the British regulatory authorities, the European Community and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were all investigating whether current practices might be anti-competitive and represented improper trade restraints. A recent series of articles on international rates in The Financial Times, the British newspaper, has influenced policy makers in Europe and made them more receptive to the long-standing American position of encouraging competition, he said.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has favored F.C.C. intervention to cut international payments because the number of its outbound calls is double that of its inbound calls, so a cut in payments reduces the company's costs by more than it reduces revenues, said Thomas R. Luciano, the deputy director of international settlements for A.T.&T. The company has also found that international telephone traffic from the United States is more affected by price than other countries' traffic, so that reduced prices dramatically raise volume and may increase A.T.&T.'s revenues, Mr. Luciano said.
A.T.&T.'s competitors have also supported change.
But the existing system has drawn few complaints overseas because it benefits consumers at the expense of businesses, which account for two-thirds of all international calls, Mr. Barbely said. Few countries relish the prospect of raising the price of, say, stamps to reduce the telephone bills of multinational corporations, he added. Foreign countries have considerably slowed efforts by the United States Government since the early 1960's to introduce more competitive practices to international telecommunications.
''Every time we did this, we got yelled at by the rest of the world for stealing some of their revenues,'' Mr. Barbely said.
Indeed, high international telephone rates have been an unintentional form of American foreign aid for years. About $1.5 billion of the American trade deficit in telephone services consists of net cash payments to the state-owned telephone companies of developing countries, many of which sorely need American dollars to pay for imports and other expenses. $10 Billion in Profits The existing system has led to annual profits of as much as $10 billion for the world's telephone companies, on annual revenues from international traffic of $30 billion, Mr. Staple said.
One country that has reduced prices sharply under American pressure is Japan. The average price of a call from Japan to the United States has dropped by 80 percent in the last 10 years, and has been cheaper than the average call from the United States to Japan for nearly two years, said Toyokazu Kawaguchi, the assistant director of the Washington office of the Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company, the main Japanese provider of international telephone service.
But the United States ran a $91.4 million telephone service deficit with Japan in 1988, the F.C.C. said. The deficits continue because Japanese businesses and individuals gather and send back large quantities of information from the United States, while Americans collect much less information in Japan, Mr. Kawaguchi said.

HEADLINE: Bush Scraps Intelligence Board, Appointing a New Panel of 6

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
President Bush today scrapped the White House's 15-member advisory board on intelligence issues and replaced it with a 6-member panel composed largely of veteran intelligence officials and scientists.
Mr. Bush named as chairman of the new group John G. Tower, the former Republican Senator from Texas, who lost a bruising political battle in 1989 to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Defense. Mr. Tower's new position does not require Senate confirmation.
The President's action, which had been expected, removes from the board a number of political conservatives and people outside the intelligence community who had been appointed by President Reagan. 
The new board retains the same broad mandate to advise the White House on ways to improve the quality of intelligence, but some outside experts have said they expect it to focus on how the nation's espionage agencies can adapt to a future in which other national security issues rival the Soviet Union as targets.
 
Retired Admiral Appointed
Mr. Bush named as vice chairman of the board Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, retired, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and head of the National Security Agency, the espionage agency in charge of electronic eavesdropping. Other members are Lew Allen Jr., vice president of the California Institute of Technology and National Security Agency director from 1973 to 1978; Dr. William J. Perry, a former deputy director of research and engineering at the Pentagon, who is now a private businessman in Menlo Park, Calif.; John M. Deutch, a physical engineering professor and provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and William G. Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs magazine.
Mr. Tower, now a private consultant in Dallas, currently holds a seat on the intelligence panel. The others appointed, all for two years, are newcomers to the board.
During Mr. Reagan's tenure, the intelligence panel was an active and, on occasion, a much-resented watchdog over the intelligence establishment, issuing critical reports on such lapses as the defection to Moscow of a former Central Intelligence Agency employee, Edward Lee Howard, in 1985. But it was all but moribund under Mr. Bush.
Administration officials have said that Mr. Bush considered the panel too unwieldy and was considering abolishing it, as had President Carter, but that he was persuaded to reconsider by the panel's departing chairwoman, Anne L. Armstrong, and by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
 
Turbulent Time Foreseen
The new appointments suggest that the board will become much more of a force in setting intelligence policy during what promises to be a turbulent time for American espionage.
After several years of robust growth, Federal spending for intelligence is falling, and may drop more rapidly as the threat of a military confrontation with the Soviet Union recedes. But at the same time, the agencies face an array of costly new demands, including monitoring Soviet compliance with several new arms-control treaties, collecting more information on world trade and threats to American economic security, and increasing its collection of intelligence on developing nations' nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.
Mr. Tower was Mr. Bush's first nominee for Defense Secretary, but the Senate rejected him after a bitter battle that revolved around accusations that he had a drinking problem. Mr. Tower denied that he had ever been an alcoholic and at one point pledged that he would not consume any alcoholic beverages while Secretary of Defense.

The German-NATO Drama: 9 Fateful Months

 BODY:
Oct. 7, 1989: Gorbachev, visiting East Germany on its 40th anniversary, declares to Eric Honecker, the longtime, hard-line leader: ''Life punishes those who delay.''
Oct. 18, 1989: As pressures for reform in East Germany increase, Mr. Honecker steps down. His successor, Egon Krenz, supports limited reforms. 
Nov. 9, 1989: The breaching of the Berlin Wall begins as it becomes known that East German curbs on travel are ending. Throngs of East Germans cross to West Berlin, and most return to East Berlin. On the next day, East German soldiers begin tearing down sections of the wall.
Nov. 15, 1989: Gorbachev declares that German unification ''is not a matter of topical politics.'' Even discussing it, he says, is interfering in the internal affairs of the Germans.
Feb. 13, 1990: At an East-West meeting of foreign ministers in Ottawa, the four major World War II Allies - the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union - and East Germany and West Germany agreed on a framework for negotiating the reunification of Germany, which was divided in 1945.
First, the two Germanys are to discuss domestic aspects of unification. Then they are to meet with the four Allies on security matters - notably the question of whether a reunited Germany would be in NATO, as West Germany and its allies wish, or would be neutral, the preference of East Germany and the Soviet Union. Asked whether a united Germany could belong to NATO, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union shrugs.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
As Bush Hails Decision, Many See Bonn Gaining

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
President Bush today hailed the Soviet Union's decision to accept a united Germany as a member of NATO, describing it as an act of statesmanship. He said the move resulted, at least in part, from measures adopted by the alliance at its meeting in London 10 days ago.
''We think this solution is in the best interests of all the countries of Europe, including the Soviet Union,'' he said in a written statement.
But officials of the Bush Administration and others in Washington were keenly aware of the symbolism in the fact that the agreement was worked out by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a meeting in the Caucusus, albeit along lines that the United States had strongly endorsed, with Mr. Bush more than 5,000 miles away. 
Not only were Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other American policy-makers remote from the scene of the action; Mr. Baker, at least, was taken completely by surprise, learning of today's developments from news accounts when his plane stopped for refueling at Shannon Airport in Ireland. For weeks, he and his staff had said they expected no break in the German impasse until the fall.
 
A More Felicitous Forum
A senior figure in the Administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, conceded that ''it would have been much nicer if the deal Gorbachev and Kohl seem to have struck could have been announced when all the major powers were represented, but that doesn't change the fact that we got what we wanted - a unified Germany in NATO.''
Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, a major Democratic spokesman on foreign affairs, said: ''This makes it clearer than ever that the Germans are leading Western policy toward the Soviet Union. I'm not saying that it's George Bush's fault, and I'm not saying that we have become a non-power.
''But this is an example of the new multi-polar world that's going to make us learn a new meaning for the word 'consult.' These days it doesn't mean us going to Europe and telling them what to do. The constraints are largely economic. We haven't solved our fiscal problems, we need to borrow money, and you can't say to your creditors, 'this is what you're going to do.' ''
With the decline of the Warsaw Pact and the approach of reunification, Germany appears poised to become an even greater economic power than it already is, and Japan, a world economic power, is starting to flex its political muscles, too.
 
Quayle Is Upbeat
At a luncheon with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Vice President Dan Quayle emphasized the positive, asserting that President Bush had been ''way out front'' on the German question and declaring that ''relations are at an all-time high between Germany and the United States.''
While few diplomats or analysts would question either assertion, the new closeness of the two nations has given Mr. Kohl a more-or-less free hand to set the timetable and some of the terms for German unification, and granted him a much larger role among world leaders.
''The transformation is quite phenomenal,'' said a Republican Senator who asked not to be quoted by name. ''Kohl used to come here as a kind of supplicant, but now he comes into a room up here and senior people defer to him. He's polite and good-humored, of course, but he dominates conversations.''
German unification was to have taken place on the terms worked out in the ''two plus four'' negotiations, involving the two Germanys plus the Allied powers of World War II - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France. That arrangement was to have constituted Moscow's veto, or Washington's, if the pace seemed too fast or the conditions too onerous.
But Mr. Gorbachev said today that four-power rights would lapse when Germany was reunited, and many diplomats here said the two plus four talks had been rendered all but moot.
''Not even a fig leaf is left'' to conceal the idea that West Germany has essentially negotiated its own terms, a West European Ambassador here said.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser under President Carter, said that while ''this is clearly the final act of Soviet accommodation to the new realities,'' Mr. Gorbachev ''may be giving ground so that he can partly recoup later'' by insisting that all foreign troops, not just Soviet ones, leave the soil of Germany.
''My instinct is that precisely that question will arise, certainly before 1995,'' Mr. Brzezinski said.
There is now broad support in Washington for the idea that the United States must push hard for the rapid integration of Europe - in economic, political, military and other spheres -to make Germany's triumphs Europe's triumphs and avoid any backlash against German economic power.
Under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Britain has resisted an accelerated timetable for European integration, with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd restating British reservations about a single currency and a central European bank only last weekend. That could mean a further loosening of the old special relationship between London and Washington in the coming months.
''This is an alliance victory,'' the West European ambassador said. ''It is a Bush victory. The United States must not lose its nerve now, with these signs of German strength, and pause to reconsider things. It must play the game to the end, not back off, and not give anyone any reason to suspect that this is a German-Soviet deal of which the United States secretly disapproves.''

HEADLINE: Facing Grim Data on Young Males, Blacks Grope for Ways to End Blight

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 13

 BODY:
Ronald Taylor, a black sociologist at the University of Connecticut, went back to the old neighborhood in Hartford the other day for the first time in years and was jolted by the sight of young men hanging out and selling drugs on once-familiar streets.
''I was frightened,'' he said. ''And I was embarrassed that I was frightened. These men are my own people, and I don't recognize them.''
Recent studies show that the situation is even bleaker than the one that shook Professor Taylor. It is a situation that inner-city residents know all too well: the United States is rapidly losing much of a generation of young black men to drugs, homicide and prison. 
Black men are several times more likely to be victims of homicide than any other demographic group, and they finish last in virtually every socioeconomic category, from the high school dropout rate to unemployment. A study in February found that more college-age black men - nearly one in four -are in prison or on parole than are in college.
 
Responses to Alarm
Alarmed by numbers like that, Professor Taylor and about 200 other scholars, ministers and community workers from across the country gathered here this week for a conference to exchange research and ideas on the problems of black men in America and to lay the groundwork for an organization dedicated to research and advocacy work for black men.
While this was billed as the first such nationwide gathering, a flurry of other meetings on the topic in recent months has brought together hundreds of people in places like Harlem, where a conference at the Apollo Theater was carried live on a black radio station in New York, and Atlanta, where Morehouse College, a leading black men's college, last spring created both a research institute and scholarly journal on the subject. At its national convention in Los Angeles last week, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People conducted a workshop called ''The Endangered Black Male.''
''Black men are coming together, and when they talk about the problems, yes, it's very personal,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and a consultant to the national conference here. ''This is a social movement to deal with social ills. It has gotten more and more momentum as the statistics have gotten worse.''
 
'Outside Our Experiences'
Black scholars, many of whom have spent their careers studying the topic individually, said they found themselves frustrated and overwhelmed as they discussed the twin plagues of crack dealing and black-on-black crime that have ravaged so many inner-city neighborhoods.
''It's hard for even the black community to comprehend,'' Professor Taylor said. ''It's outside our experiences. We know how to deal with poverty, oppression and discrimination, but the world seems to have changed rather dramatically. People are trying to figure out what the hell to do.''
A principal reason for the conference was to create a clearinghouse for the study of the nation's 14 million black males. Conferees, envisioning an advocacy and research organization that would shape public policy and sponsor annual symposiums like this one, named the group the National Coalition of African American Men and chose as its provisional chairman Dr. Richard Majors, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and one of the conference organizers.
Outlining the coalition's mission, Dr. Majors said, ''There is a lot of ignorance, myths and stereotypes about black men. The bottom line is not only educating the public but empowering and improving the lives of black men.''
 
'We're Victims, Too'
Women, a distinct minority at the conference here, said they were drawn to the sessions out of fear for their loved ones and a shared sense of vulnerability. ''If a black man is in prison, on the street corner or dead from drugs, we're victims, too,'' said Dr. Gloria Alibaruho, a sociologist and consultant at Morehouse. ''We're without husbands, brothers and sons.''
Discussions that started out addressing a socioeconomic problem often turned into personal testimonies as participants shared stories of the countless small insults that come with being black men in largely white America.
Arthur Fletcher, chairman of the United States Civil Rights Commission, told the group, ''At 64 years old and after 40 years of fairly solid achievement, I can still walk into a conference and they're surprised that I can contribute to the discussion.''
In dealings with the police and the criminal justice system, the scholars said they felt a sense of oneness with the black men who occupy a disproportionate share of the nation's prison cells.
''We're overrepresented as offenders and as victims,'' said Jon R. Gray, a black circuit court judge in Jackson County, Mo., who presided over one session. ''It tears me apart. The problems have long since festered. I'm becoming more and more cynical.''
 
The Path to Prison
Marc Mauer, author of the study that found that a fourth of black males between the ages of 20 and 29 are in prison or on parole, gave one explanation of how they get there.
''There may be a black or Hispanic man looking disheveled on the street, who has been drinking,'' said Mr. Mauer, one of the few white speakers at the conference. ''It is much more likely that the black or Hispanic man will be arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct than a white man in a three-piece suit who, instead of being arrested, might get a ride home. This leads to the disparities we see down the line.''
During one crowded session, about 150 scholars in suits and ties and cardigans shook their heads and whispered knowingly to one another as Don Jackson, a black former sergeant in the Hawthorne, Calif., police department, described what he said were the perceptions of many white police officers.
''Almost everyone in this room looks like a criminal to police officers so inclined,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''That's the kind of training they get.''
Ida R. Mukenge, a sociologist and associate dean at the Morehouse, said that black academics and others had been focusing on the plight of black males for some years but that it was only recently that funding for such work had become available from foundations and government and that the news media had grown interested in the subject ''It is true that there are a lot of groups and people working in this area,'' Dr. Mukenge said, ''but I'm not concerned about the effort being too diffuse. There is enough work to be done and enough points to be attacked.''
 
Work at Morehouse
Dr. Mukenge is executive director of the school's Morehouse Research Institute, which was established in 1988 to focus on problems facing black males and to analyze Government policies and programs directed at black men. The institute, which held its first conference in March, is intended to help black organizations and others take better advantage of the current attention on the problems of black males, she said.
Out of the meetings here came several possible routes to reversing the grim statistics, and few of them were revolutionary. Many in attendance called for pressure on the Federal Government to make dealing with the plight of poor blacks a priority and to change welfare and economic policies that they said undermine the black family. Others urged changes in the criminal justice system like alternative sentences to avoid sending nonviolent offenders to crowded prisons.
If there was a consensus, it was one of self-help. In hallway conversations and in seminars, people called for alternative, African-oriented schools to give black boys a sense of black history and self-esteem before they get pulled into an abyss of drugs and crime.
''We've got to stop waiting for white folks to put us in their history books,'' said Jacob Gordon, a professor of African American Studies at the University of Kansas and an organizer of the conference. ''The Jews have done a good job of this. We've got to create Afrocentric academies and create our own history books.''
Other recommendations included parent-training programs for young blacks, mentor programs to pair middle-class professional blacks with inner-city youth and changing attitudes in lower-class black neighborhoods.
''For too long we have tolerated too many of our boys making the passage from boyhood to manhood by defining manhood as sexual promiscuity, toughness and thrill seeking,'' said William Oliver, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Delaware. ''In the lower-class black community, there's almost a Wild West mentality. We're not saying there isn't a role for government, but ultimately we've got to save ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Estimate on Deficit Is Raised Sharply

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Apparently trying to generate an atmosphere of crisis, the Bush Administration sharply raised its official estimate of the Federal deficit in the next fiscal year today and predicted dire consequences from automatic spending cuts if a budget agreement with Congress is not reached.
''If those negotiations fail, it will have major implications for virtually everything the Federal Government touches,'' said Richard G. Darman, the budget director.
He said that without an agreement, the across-the-board reductions required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law would cause, among other things, a halving of military forces, the closing of many air traffic-control installations, the end of meat inspection for nearly five months, a halt in new cleanups of toxic waste sites and cancellation of vaccinations against childhood diseases for one million children.
Nonetheless, Mr. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said at a news conference that the Administration would accept the automatic cuts if Congress did not approve a budget that met President Bush's approval. 
 
Talks Expected to Resume
Administration officials and Congressional leaders have been meeting on the budget since May but have not made substantial headway in deciding what to cut or which taxes to raise. They are expected to resume bargaining later this week.
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, said today that the talks were close to deadlocked, but the top Republican on the panel, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, said progress was being made.
Today's new estimate of the deficit, and a less optimistic economic forecast, did not differ substantially from material made public last month, after Mr. Darman presented it to Congressional negotiators.
But the documentation of the effects of across-the-board spending cuts, which was not required until late next month, and the harsh language the officials used seemed to be calculated not only to increase pressure on Congress but to stir public anxiety. Vice President Dan Quayle said in an interview with The New York Times today that the purpose was to have a ''sobering-up effect'' on many lawmakers.
 
The Bailout Factor
The Administration projected that without changes in taxes or spending, the deficit for the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1, would be $168.8 billion, not counting spending for the savings and loan bailout, and that it would rise to $231.4 billion with the bailout funds.
That is about $10 billion higher than the unofficial estimate Mr. Darman gave Congress last month and far above the $100.5 billion official estimate the President sent Congress in January.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, which is supposed to reduce the deficit in annual increments, sets a deficit target of $64 billion for the next fiscal year. If the target is missed by more than $10 billion, automatic cuts are required in almost all programs except Social Security and grants to poor people, like welfare and food stamps.
Even excluding the savings and loan cleanup, the target would be exceeded by more than $100 billion, today's figures show. Mr. Darman said that would mean a reduction of 38.4 percent in domestic programs and 25.1 percent or 41.3 percent in each military program, depending on whether the President exercised his option to exclude military personnel from the cutback.
 
From High to Low
The President and the Congressional leaders want to exclude the savings and loan program from the budget-balancing law's calculations. Most analysts believe that would be justified, since the program makes the annual deficit appear artificially large in some years and artificially low in others. In the early years of the bailout, the Government will spend billions of additional dollars to buy the property of failed savings institutions. In later years, much of that money will be redeemed when the property is sold.
Congress could avoid across-the-board spending cuts by raising the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law's target. But the Administration officials suggested that the President would veto such a measure.
Mr. Darman and the other officials blamed what they characterized as an irresponsible, intransigent Congress for the size of the deficit and the lack of progress in negotiations.
 
Economy Shows Weakness
Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin also noted that the economy had been weaker than expected, producing less revenue, and that higher interest rates required more spending to pay bondholders.
The Administration is now projecting that the economy will grow by 2.2 percent in the calendar year 1990 and 2.9 percent in 1991, compared with January projections of 2.4 percent and 3.2 percent. It is predicting that consumer prices will rise by 4.8 percent in 1990 and 4.1 percent in 1991, compared with the January forecast of 3.9 percent and 4 percent.
At the Capitol, Democrats accused the Administration of not having leveled with the public until now about the severity of the deficit problem. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the staggering effect of a huge across-the-board spending cut was ''what we've been saying since January.''
Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he welcomed today's announcement because ''one problem in the negotiations has been the lack of a sense of crisis.''

HEADLINE: Bill on Farm Spending Meeting Stiff Opposition

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The 1990 farm bill, which heads toward the floor of both the Senate and the House this week, is meeting unaccustomed opposition from the Bush Administration and from newly aroused city and suburban legislators who seek to cut or redirect large Federal subsidies to agriculture.
The Secretary of Agriculture, Clayton Yeutter, said today in a letter to the Senate that he would recommend that President Bush veto the bill if its cost was not reduced.
The basic spending levels of the final bill, the Government's farm blueprint for the next five years, have been drawn in the committees, and floor action to alter them significantly seemed unlikely, people in Congress and the farm industry said.
The farm program, continuing the essential thrust that began with its reworking in 1985, is to cost the Treasury a bit more than $10 billion a year in the first half of the 1990's, about the same as the past three years. Drought, by raising market prices, could reduce Federal payments, while bumper crops could raise them. 
 
'The Bill Is Excessive'
In a 13-page letter to the President of the Senate, Vice President Dan Quayle, Mr. Yeutter said: ''From a budget standpoint, the cost of the bill is excessive. The bill authorizes appropriations for a number of new programs and authorities which could result in over $3 billion of additional outlays.''
The Senate is expected to begin debate on the farm bill this week. The House bill is to reach the Rules Committee this week, with floor action planned for next week.
Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee, said in response to Mr. Yeutter's letter that the Administration was trying to kill the farm bill so it could free its hand in international trade talks intended to cut agriculture subsidies around the world.
 
'Cooked Up New Numbers'
Mr. Leahy said the Administration had ''cooked up new numbers'' in estimating the bill's effect on the budget, The Associated Press reported. ''The Administration's veto threat is a thinly veiled effort to kill the farm bill so the Administration can cut a back-room deal in Geneva, out of sight from American farmers.''
Mr. Yeutter's letter did not mention the trade talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade being conducted in Geneva.
The threat of a veto showed that a third group that wants to alter the farm bill, farm-state Democrats, faces a daunting task as they revive efforts to increase support for agriculture.
Those Democrats face the opposition not only of the Administration but also of some members of Congress who are trying to break the traditional farm-state monopoly of the legislation on behalf of consumers and taxpayers.
The main challenge is being mounted by a group of about 20 House members headed by Representatives Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, and Dick Armey, a Republican from the Dallas area.
 
Seeking an Income Limit
Contending that the 1985 farm bill skewed payments toward the wealthy, with less than 4 percent of farmers now collecting 40 percent of the benefits, Mr. Schumer said the coalition sought to apply an income limit in all programs. Federal support would be denied those with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $100,000, a move that would save $900 million a year.
Individual members will also try to abolish specific supports like those for sugar, peanuts, honey, wool and mohair. Another goal is to reduce export subsidies.
Representative Schumer takes some heart from recent House action attaching an income limit to a water bill but acknowledges his forces face an uphill fight to overhaul a system that provides so much direct income to farmers. ''This is the first time the ag bill has been challenged,'' he said.
In the Senate, there is less eagerness to cut farm programs because every member has some farmers as constituents. Most of the rebels are in a small group of so-called prairie populist Democrats who are unhappy with a bill that would freeze most subsidy levels while failing to produce a policy that would distinguish them from Republicans for this fall's elections.
Mark Ulven, a legislative assistant to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said this group would seek to raise target prices for at least some portion of a farmer's harvest and might also revive an effort that failed in committee to tie prices to the Consumer Price Index.
Yet he acknowledges that at a time of general budget constraints this is a long-odds proposition. ''The climate is much different than it was in 1985, when the farm economy was still crippled by recession,'' Mr. Ulven said. ''The entire mood is shifting.''

HEADLINE: MacArthur Grants Are Awarded to 36

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
The MacArthur Foundation of Chicago, widening the range of its coveted annual awards to gifted people, named a juggler, a photographer and a preserver of disappearing varieties of seeds among its 36 winners of fellowships yesterday.
While some of this year's winners are well known, including the author and critic Susan Sontag, others are aspiring but unknown artists or young scientists, and a number are rural or urban community organizers.
All will receive awards from $150,000 to $375,000 over five years and can spend the money as they choose. The amounts are determined by the winners' ages, with the youngest receiving smaller sums.
The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation created the fellowships in 1981, saying it wanted to free ''exceptionally gifted individuals'' from economic constraints to develop their potential. The awards are frequently called the ''genius awards.'' Recipients are recommended by 100 anonymous nominators, recruited around the country to serve for a year, and their selections are reviewed by a panel of 13 experts. The foundation does not accept applications or recommendations from other sources.

HEADLINE: Vision Becomes Reality for Europe

 BODY:
President Gorbachev yesterday showed great courage in accepting a unified Germany in NATO. And Chancellor Kohl of West Germany demonstrated high statesmanship in agreeing to limit the future all-German army to troop levels below those now possessed by West Germany alone, and to grant credits to Germany's longtime adversary.
This arrangement will help to assure two critical goals: A united Germany will not feel strong and alone, and the Soviet Union will not feel threatened and isolated. These constitute the essential building blocks of a stable and peaceful Europe. 
Leaders often show realism by not trying to hold back the wave of history, or sometimes by riding it. But statesmen go further and recognize where history is heading and smooth the way, at times at great political risk to themselves.
As East Germans rushed westward, Mr. Kohl seized the moment to press for unification, though some Western leaders criticized him. Mr. Gorbachev had the wisdom not to resist, though many of his comrades condemn him. But important accommodations by both men and help from NATO leaders, especially President Bush, now allow an end to Germany's postwar division.
Mr. Gorbachev agreed to restore full sovereignty to a unified Germany, including the right to choose its own allies. And he said he'd pull out the 380,000 Soviet troops that remain in East Germany within four years. In return, Mr. Kohl said he'd cut all-German troop levels to 370,000 from the combined West German total of 480,000 and the East German complement of 135,000. He also pledged to forgo German nuclear capability.
The Chancellor promised as well to provide substantial credits to Moscow. The White House dismisses those credits as a bribe for Soviet withdrawal. But a parlous Soviet domestic scene could jeopardize the transition to a stable and secure Europe.
While Washington plays down this economic dimension of European security, it understands the military and political facets. Mr. Bush led the way in NATO 10 days ago in forging a vision of Europe, whole and free, from the Atlantic to the Urals.
Now Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Kohl have found the way to begin transforming that farsighted vision into reality. They have agreed to what was unimaginable less than a year ago: a united Germany anchored in NATO and a united Germany that does not threaten the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: No to a Balanced Budget Amendment

 BODY:
The balanced budget amendment that the House will vote on today is impractical, unenforceable and wouldn't end Federal deficits. But it would litter the Constitution with a vacuous promise, and invite greater cynicism in budget-making.
Deficits are arbitrarily defined and easily manipulated. Achieving a specific level, like zero, has no special economic significance. And trying to hit that target could play havoc with valuable Federal programs and a declining economy that might need deficit spending. 
Yes, Congress should keep deficits from spiraling upward. But there is no immediate crisis, and the deficit - compared with the size of the economy - has already been cut in half under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. More needs to be done. The prudent way is to amend Gramm-Rudman to make it work better, not spoil the precious Constitution in a quixotic search for a quick fix.
The proposed amendment would require a three-fifths vote in both houses to run a deficit. That, say the sponsors, would provide the flexibility to run deficits when they are needed but stymie unnecessary borrowing. But nowhere does the amendment come to grips with political reality. Evasion would be simple. Congress could move programs ''off budget,'' like funds for the savings and loan crisis.
The amendment also would require Congress and the President to agree on revenue and expenditure estimates. But politicians have a common interest in fudging such projections and pretending to pass a balanced budget. The amendment's only safeguard against self-serving projections is the proposed three-fifths vote to raise the debt ceiling. That way legislators eventually would be forced to confront the issue. Yet garnering enough votes would be easy since to vote otherwise would bring the Government to a screeching halt.
As for states that have balanced budget amendments, they also have separate capital accounts. That allows them to borrow money for long-term investments in infrastructure. There is no separate capital account in the Federal budget. So a requirement to balance the budget would create a horrific incentive for Congress to avoid costly investments in railroads, education and research.
Congress has been unable to make the Gramm-Rudman budget law work fully as intended. But amending it to plug loopholes would be far easier, and better, than drafting a skimpily worded constitutional amendment.

HEADLINE: Lower Landfill Fees Will Cost New York Plenty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The New York City Board of Estimate, in its preliminary decision to reduce the fees charged private carters who remove recyclables before dumping at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island (news article, June 27), is seeking a short-term fiscal gain at the price of long-term economic losses at the Fresh Kills landfill.
There is no valid reason to subsidize private carters to motivate them to recycle; Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration has authority under Local Law 19 to require recycling of commercial collections, but has delayed action. The administration's motive is apparently the short-term gain of approximately $17 million in the 1991 fiscal year from more dumping at the lower fee. But this imposes a high-run cost associated with the accelerated depletion of the capacity at Fresh Kills.
Extending the useful life of the Fresh Kills landfill is a crucial element in any coherent solid-waste-management strategy. The Dinkins administration should not be remembered for its failure to protect New York City from the costly, and potentially overwhelming, problem of disposing of its waste when the Fresh Kills landfill is full.
The Dinkins administration can slow the depletion of the landfill by accelerating recycling, taking more aggressive waste-reduction measures and building new incineration plants. Specifically, the administration should issue regulations requiring commercial recycling and should raise, rather than lower, the tipping fees as recommended in the Citizens Budget Commission report issued in January, ''The State of the Uniformed Services.''

HEADLINE: Education Consumers Should Have a Choice;
Still Far to Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''School Vouchers: Dangerous Claptrap'' (Op-Ed, June 29), Bill Honig presents a myopic view of school reform in California.
Contrary to Mr. Honig's internal measurements, California schools are not yet making the grade. At Pacific Telesis each year, we test thousands of candidates for entry-level jobs. Fifty-six percent fail to pass what amounts to about a junior-high level equivalency test.
Our experience is consistent with that of other members of the California Business Roundtable, an organization of the 75 largest private employers in the state.
While our schools are ailing, it is imprudent to dismiss a proposal from an institution like Brookings without thorough debate and consideration on its merits. It is premature to claim that all necessary reforms are in place and working in California.
California needs better performance-based student assessment techniques. We need to create affiliations between businesses and schools that help students smoothly from the classroom to a career. We need better teacher training and certification, and increased pay for those reaching professional status. We need more technology integrated into curriculum and administration. We need more parental involvement and a society that puts a premium on quality education.
I'm not wedded to the voucher plan proposed by John Chubb (of Brookings) and Terry Moe (Stanford), but I am committed to seeing some form of choice become part of educational reform. Perhaps progress has been slight in California, but the real issue for those who depend on the quality of our school system to compete in our global economy is how far we have left to go.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
L'Etat, C'Est Moi

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
During the cold war the United States often supported undemocratic governments in the third world on the ground that they were pro-Western. Now that the cold war is over, and won, what should this country do when a third-world government we have favored turns nasty?
The question is raised in intriguing form by what is happening these days in Kenya. President Daniel arap Moi is cracking down hard on all who criticize his one-party state. Lawyers, journalists and politicians have been detained for speaking in favor of multiparty democracy - or defending the rights of those who do. 
Kenya has for decades been a, perhaps the, Washington favorite among African countries. While others tried various forms of Socialism, Kenya had a capitalist economy. It was also seen as a Western bulwark when the Soviet Union interested itself nearby in the Horn of Africa.
Kenya is the largest recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa. The Bush Administration has it down for $53 million in the next fiscal year.
President Moi has always been an authoritarian figure, but he has become increasingly intolerant of opposition. He reacted angrily this winter to public criticism over the unexplained death of the Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko, whose charred body was found in the countryside.
Early this month prominent Government critics were taken into indefinite detention without charge. Among them were two former Cabinet ministers, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, who have called for multiparty democracy. Mr. Matiba's home was attacked last month by 15 men armed with clubs and machetes; his wife's skull was fractured.
Another detainee is the editor of The Nairobi Law Monthly, Gitobu Imanyara. Mr. Imanyara visited the United States not long ago and spoke with human rights groups about the situation in Kenya. In the three years of his magazine's existence, it has become the leading voice for free speech and due process of law. But it has now been effectively silenced, because anyone selling it is arrested.
The police have also cracked down on what they call ''subversive music.'' They have arrested dozens of people for selling or listening to audio tapes with messages in favor of democracy. One of the tapes, referring to the murdered Foreign Minister, was called ''Who Killed Dr. Ouko?''
Few Americans will know the people detained or brutalized in Kenya. But the pattern of tyranny is familiar. As in so many other places, a leader has begun to lose public confidence because of economic and other failures - symbolized by the massive shantytowns near rich neighborhoods of Nairobi. He has met grievances by brutal measures to hold onto power.
What should the United States do in those circumstances? The U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, Smith Hempstone, has given an uncommonly forthright answer to the question. He has spoken out against one-party rule and said the United States will favor African countries that move toward multiparty democracy. For that, Mr. Hempstone was denounced by a newspaper in an editorial headed, ''Shut Up, Mr. Ambassador.''
Last week a prominent Kenyan human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, sought refuge from the police in the U.S. Embassy. Mr. Hempstone took him in and succeeded in arranging for him to go to London.
What remains to be seen is whether Washington will support its Ambassador. On July 5, the day after the political arrests in Kenya, the Defense Department signed an aid agreement for $5 million in arms to Kenya. If the Bush Administration is serious about backing up Mr. Hempstone, it will surely stop that agreement.
The developments in Kenya show that there should be no ideological division in this country now on issues of human rights. Ambassador Hempstone, a former newspaper columnist, is a conservative. I think liberals will agree with him that America's voice should be heard when governments we have supported act tyrannically.
The Kenya case also makes a point about the universality of human rights standards. Americans who have been engaged in the effort to bring democracy to South Africa should take the same view in Kenya. The campaign against apartheid is also a campaign for a free political system, justice, no detention without trial.
U.S. aid now goes to many brutal regimes, from Guatemala to Zaire. Why should it, when the cold war reasons are gone? Human rights must play a larger part in our decisions on whom to help, and Kenya is a good place to start defining the terms.

All-Natural Food For the Dog Who Has It All

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: WESTPORT, CONN.

 BODY:
''It's Shelbie's birthday?'' asked Jordana Bloom, petting a customer at her gourmet health-food store. ''It's your birthday, Shelbie? Did you tell Jeannette it's Shelbie's birthday?'' Jeanette Champsaur, star saleswoman at Lick Your Chops, was up front finishing a high-protein, high-fiber order for a new customer, Wizzy Wig. ''Shelbie's three?'' asked Ms. Bloom, petting the customer some more. ''Let's get her birthday gifts started.'' Would Shelbie like a freshly baked whole wheat biscuit with carobs? Perhaps some imported New Zealand mutton for Shelbie? ''Jeanette, it's Shelbie's birthday!''
''Oh, this is the birthday dog?'' said Mrs. Champsaur, smiling at Shelbie, a midget version of Lassie. 
Meanwhile, Ms. Bloom had news for Wizzy Wig. ''This is our Lick Your Chops health club membership,'' she said. ''You did get one?''
''No,'' said Wizzy Wig's owner, Vicki Vance. ''No, I didn't know about the health club.'' When it comes to the gourmet pet-health-food industry, there's so much important going on that it's hard keeping track of new developments. ''I'm starting a bird section this fall,'' said Susan Goldstein, who opened her first Lick Your Chops store a decade ago and now oversees six in the Northeast. ''I have a bird. I feel I understand his needs. We'll be coming out with a new bird product. It's still in the R-and-D stage.''
The nation may or may not be in recession, but in well-to-do suburbs like Westport, the philosophy remains ''You are what your dog eats,'' and there are plenty willing to pay three times more for all-natural dog food. Supermarket dog food? ''Garbage!'' said Tirzah Barrett. ''Junk! You open a can, it's something you wouldn't eat. This is all natural. I always buy the best food for my dog.
Let's get you a warm cookie,'' she said to Kuulei, her poodle.
 
Next door to Ann
Taylor on Main Street here, the shop smells like a bakery and looks like a cafe.
Indeed, recently an elderly couple came in and asked for the special senior food, New Zealand mutton and rice. ''They didn't realize,'' said Mrs. Champsaur, ''it was for senior dogs.''
''Excuse me, where are the quackers?'' asked Chris Yanik. She meant the dog cookies shaped like ducks and made of whole organic eggs, Vermont cheese, rye flour, herbs and virgin olive oil. ''Gone?'' She picked peanut butter bones, carrot canes, banana spice, 10 for $6.65. ''That's cheap,'' she said. ''My dog loves the products and I love my dog and that's basically it.''
Ms. Bloom, a Dartmouth graduate, has little patience for those who question dog health food. ''It's easy to dismiss as frivolous,'' she says, ''but it's not. This is a mission. There's a lot of meaning to what we're doing. We're converting customers and animals.''
As the founder, Ms. Goldstein often says herself, ''Our belief is animals should have life force foods. Our meats are U.S.D.A. inspected and meet human standards. All the lamb is from New Zealand, the only place that guarantees there's no pesticides on the grazing land.'' When she started, she'd sell ingredients, so owners could cook homemade meals.
''I'd recommend a butcher, suggest fresh steamed chicken dishes.'' She was surprised not everyone had her dedication. ''Our clients didn't want to cook up meals.'' It's hard after a full day at the office to cook the dog dinner. ''It is,'' said Ms. Goldstein, ''It is.'' And that is why she she now offers 50 Lick Your Chops items.
It gets more complicated. ''We were the first to recognize you have to go beyond all natural,'' she said. ''We really interface with the animal person, we really dialogue.''
To upsurge interfacing, they started Pet of the Month and Birthday clubs. ''Out of control,'' said Ms. Bloom. ''We need a whole birthday staff for dogs and cats.'' They get 200 nominees for each Pet of the Month. ''Pierre's a very smart dog and understands many words,'' read one. ''Pierre is well known in our town.''
Westporters from a young age learn to want the best for their dogs. James Pechi, 8, comes in the shop daily for his dog, Princess. ''He takes the $3 his mother gives him to get pizza and soda for lunch and spends it on his dog,'' said Ms. Bloom. ''We worry about him, but he says, 'It's O.K., I'm not hungry.''
''Excuse me, can I help you,'' said Ms. Bloom. It was Elizabeth Nelson, who needed tangle-free shampoo for her dog, Rumple.
''We have exactly what you're looking for, don't move,'' said Ms. Bloom, going to the back to get it. While Ms. Nelson waited she and Rumple socialized with a bichon frise named Brinkley. Gourmet pet-food shops attract a nice breed. Ms. Nelson paid for the shampoo and a peanut butter star for Rumple, and before leaving, she bent down and kissed Brinkley good-bye.

HEADLINE: Lowlands Low No More As S.I. Favors Swamps

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Not so long ago, wetlands were considered disease-harboring nuisances -in other words, swamps.
On Staten Island, like elsewhere, wetlands were routinely filled and built on, used as dumping grounds for car wrecks and construction debris or converted for agriculture. Now, many Staten Island residents are fighting to preserve the borough's remaining wetlands, asserting that they have both environmental and great economic value.
Continued filling of freshwater wetlands for development may lead to much more flooding in southern Staten Island - already a flood-prone area -and require spending at least $1 billion to build storm sewers to duplicate the wetlands' natural storage ability, New York City environmental officials say. 
In addition, Staten Island, the least-developed borough, is the only part of the city where there are significant opportunities to preserve open space.
 
Many Landowners Dislike Label
And the island's 2,000 acres of freshwater wetlands, the largest concentration in the city, provide some of the increasingly rare habitat for birds to rest during migration along the Atlantic seaboard. The wetlands range in size from Outerbridge Pond, which is less than an acre, to the 242-acre Oakwood Beach wetland on the south shore.
But many Staten Island property owners say that by designating their land as wetland, the state has drastically reduced its value and made it almost impossible to sell. Owners of wetlands need a hard-to-obtain state permit to build.
As a result, they are demanding government compensation for their land, a sum that could reach a total of $400 million, according to a state estimate. At stake are more than 7,000 parcels owned by several thousand people.
''We want to preserve wetlands as much as anybody,'' said Daniel L. Master, representing the Staten Island Board of Realtors at a recent state hearing on wetlands. ''But basically we want people's property rights upheld.''
 
State Considers Some Filling
The conflict has been boiling for several years. It recently got hotter when a state draft of an environmental impact statement proposed allowing degraded wetlands on Staten Island to be filled and used for building, if ones in better condition are preserved.
Environmentalists assert that that ''trading-off'' approach flies in the face of the state's policy of no net loss of wetlands, and is a sellout to Staten Island developers. Even the most degraded wetlands are useful, and can be at least partly restored by nature if left undisturbed, they say.
If the state permits the approach in Staten Island, the environmentalists say, it could be applied to other parts of the state where development pressures are strong.
''If wetlands are traded off and built upon, every Staten Islander will suffer, struggling with overcrowed schools, roads, transportation, services,'' said Ellen O'Flaherty Pratt, a member of Protectors of Pine Oak Woods, a local environmental group. The group supports government purchase of the wetlands, she said, but thinks the estimated $400 million price tag is exaggerated.
A spokesman for the regional office of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, William Hewitt, said the proposal could be modified or eliminated before the environmental impact statement is made final.
 
Using Wetlands as Storm Sewers
Much of southern Staten Island lacks storm sewers. The city is trying to avoid spending at least $1 billion on such systems by using existing wetlands to collect storm water. The Bluebelt project, as it is called, involves five separate wetlands systems consisting of many properties in the southern part of the island.
The city supports a no-net-loss policy for Staten Island wetlands, said Albert F. Appleton, the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner. But this ''doesn't necessarily require us to save every last postage-stamp-size wetlands,'' he said. ''My concern is with the overall function of the storm system.''
Wetlands, which are most often moist or swampy lands, offer vital habitat to fish, birds and other wildlife. They also provide flood control by leaving places for rainwater to collect. Wetlands also help to purify water by slowing it down before it reaches the sea, giving time for solids to sink and subjecting organic pollutants to microbes in the mud.
Only about half of Staten Island's 4,000 acres of freshwater wetlands found by the first Dutch and English settlers remain. Those that have not been drained and cleared for agriculture or filled in for urban uses have been degraded, to some extent, by the increasing stormwater runoff from paved areas and by urban contamination.
 
Owners Fear Crushing of Values
Broad debate over the future of Staten Island's freshwater wetlands dates to 1976, when the Department of Environmental Conservation began compiling an inventory. A 1975 state law regulates wetlands larger than 12.4 acres, although smaller parcels may be included if deemed of unusual local importance.
By 1981, about 600 acres had been identified. Based on public comment about wetlands that had been missed, the department produced another map in 1986 more than doubling the total acreage. A final map in September 1987 designated about 2,000 acres of wetlands, of which 800 are privately owned, mostly in small lots.
The 1986 designations upset many property owners. They argued that the market value of their land had been crushed; some said they had purchased property after 1981 without any idea that the land would later be considered wetland.
Their views received a sympathetic hearing in Albany. The Legislature gave the Freshwater Wetlands Appeals Board, an existing five-member body, the authority to hear Staten Island landowners' grievances. Owners whose property was not included in the original 1981 mapping could seek a reversal of the designation or dispensation for hardship. In some cases, that could mean permission to build. What Is a Hardship? Environmental groups say the appeals board has become a tool of developers in the two years it has been issuing decisions. And the Department of Environmental Conservation is fighting the board in court over what should be considered a hardship.
Of 175 appeals filed, two-thirds are still pending. Of the few cases decided, about half have gone in favor of the landowners, said Maxine Spierer, a board member from Staten Island.
Ms. Spierer denied the board favored building over conservation. ''Nobody is going to be 100 percent happy with our decisions,'' she said.
What might make many owners happy is if the state or city bought their wetlands. Mr. Appleton said the city is ''giving that very serious consideration'' for holders of ecologically important lands, particularly smaller property owners.
But there was ''less intention,'' Mr. Appleton said, of compensating real-estate speculators and professionals who he said should have known what they were getting into when they bought property after the state's 1981 wetlands designations.
Mr. Appleton's words might be some comfort to Dan Carone, a part owner of a Staten Island travel agency, who said he paid $48,000 for a 100-by-110-foot lot in Annadale in January 1986.
A few months later, the state told him his property was a wetland, Mr. Carone said. He continues to pay several hundred dollars a year in taxes on the property, which he had intended for his retirement home, said Mr. Carone, 53 years old.
''Give me what I paid for the property,'' he said. ''Just get me out of this mess.''

HEADLINE: 'Smart, Driven' Woman Overcomes Reluctance

BYLINE: By M. A. FARBER

 BODY:
The lithe, blond woman known as the Central Park jogger surrendered yesterday some of the privacy she has coveted since the night when she was dragged off a running path in the park and nearly beaten to death.
So intense has been the jogger's desire to preserve her anonymity and, as a friend said, ''simply get on with her life,'' that she only recently, and reluctantly, decided to testify against those accused of raping her - an option largely left to her by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case and could have subpoenaed her.
''She was not happy with the world seeing that she's not 100 percent,'' said an acquaintance in whom the 30-year-old woman has confided.
The attack on the jogger - and, in separate incidents that night, on other people in the park - was one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980's. Some saw, in the jogger's case, the random but pervasive violence in big city life. Others saw the particular vulnerability of women. Because she is white and the defendants are black, some saw a racial element in the case, whether in the attack itself or in the vigorous prosecution of the defendants. 
 
Spoke Expecting Her to Die
In the days following the April 1989 attack on the investment banker, when doctors indicated she might die or be left with considerable brain damage, much was written and broadcast of a personal nature about her.
As doctors at Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem, where she was initially treated, responded to requests from information about the victim's injuries and progress, as John Cardinal O'Connor visited and Frank Sinatra sent roses and thousands of ordinary people offered their sympathies, the victim's family and employer, friends and former teachers helped reconstruct a life that was both grand and ordinary.
Born in Bergen County, N.J., she had moved as a girl to Upper St. Clair, Pa., a bucolic Pittsburgh suburb, where her father, now retired, was a senior manager with Westinghouse and where both he and his wife were members of the local school board. An accomplished ballet dancer, the young woman went to Wellesley College, where she was active in the Catholic student center and helped organize a nutritional program for battered women. By graduation in 1982, she had won the economics department's top student prize, earned a Phi Beta Kappa key and was nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship.
 
Brilliant, and No Cheerleader
''She was brilliant, probably one of the top four or five students of the decade,'' recalled Len M. Nichols, chairman of Wellesley's economics department. ''She had the ability to ask the question that she wanted to ask and that was far advanced for her age and the other students didn't resent that.''
''I call that diplomatic skills, but she wasn't a bubbly cheerleader type,'' Professor Nichols said. After two years with a management consulting firm in Boston - and a summer working for the State Department at the American Embassy in Zimbabwe - she enrolled in the Yale School of Management, where, in 1986, she received a master's degree in business and international relations. She joined Salomon Brothers as an associate investment banker in the corporate finance department and, by 1988, was a junior member of the firm's fast-paced energy and natural resources group.
For some time she shared a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on East 75th Street with a Salomon employee she had met in a training class, Patrick Garrett. By early last year, however, she had subleased a cooperative on East 83d Street that she was considering buying.
 
Vegetarian and Maybe Anorexic
A vegetarian who was much concerned about fitness, the woman, who carried about 90 pounds on a five-foot-five-inch frame and was once diagnosed as possibly anorexic, was a compulsive runner, at least since her days at Wellesley. It was commonplace for her to run four to six miles at once, or even, on weekends, to run to work on Wall Street and back home.
Friends who have known the woman over the years have described her as extremely competitive, temperate, occasionally stubborn but demanding of herself, generous and, when time permitted, fun-loving.
''She was - she is - real dedicated at achieving what she wanted; she's what I'd call quietly aggressive,'' a former classmate at Yale, who asked not to be identified, said yesterday. ''I wouldn't be surprised if she ended up at a place like the World Bank.''
The attack on her in Central Park -she was, according to some of the defendants' statements, tied up, raped repeatedly and beaten on the head and body with a brick, a lead pipe and rocks - occurred between 9 and 10 P.M. But, for her, running even at that hour, alone and in an all-but-deserted area of the park, was not unprecedented.
 
Offered to Help Prosecutors
The victim - whose survival has been ascribed in part to her strong will - was treated for seven weeks at Metropolitan Hospital, where she was discovered to have no memory of the attack. During the latter part of her stay at Metropolitan, she understood for the first time the reason for her hospitalization. She offered her assistance to the District Attorney's office.
By the time she was transferred in June, 1989 to Gaylord Hospital, a medical rehabilitation center in Wallingford, Conn., much of the public interest in the case had shifted to the sometimes conflicting accounts of the defendants and to the question of their admissibility in court. In mid-November, when the jogger was released from Gaylord, the hospital issued a statement saying that her further recovery was ''highly dependent'' on the privacy accorded her. Assuring that privacy has since become the passionate objective of her family and of those who work with her or know her socially.
 
'Works a Full Day'
The jogger has not spoken to reporters and her parents declined to be interviewed for this article. Her two brothers, a lawyer in Hartford and a prosecutor in Dallas, did not return messages left at their offices.
''She wants anonymity, especially since she got out of the hospital and resumed her life,'' said Lisa Borowitz, a spokeswoman for Salomon Brothers, where the jogger returned to work in late November and was promoted to vice president in corporate finance in January. ''Her focus now is still on the recovery process. She just wants to continue along with her game plan.''
Ms. Borowitz said the woman ''works a full day,'' although fewer than the extended hours that were customary for her before the attack. Telephone calls made to her through the firm's switchboard - apparently whether business-related or not - are routed to Ms. Borowitz's office in ''corporate communications.''
Ms. Borowitz declined to describe the kind of work the jogger is now doing at Salomon Brothers, or to say whether she dealt directly with clients. Nearly each day the victim takes a break for rehabilitation - particularly, it is understood, for deficits related to stress and speed, and for double-vision. Despite the reservations of friends, she is again living alone, this time in an apartment near the financial district. And, with friends or colleagues, she is back to running, as much as five miles a day.
Not in Central Park.

Wynn Waits for Woes to Settle

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER

 BODY:
Whether or not the contractual dispute between Don King, the promoter, and James (Buster) Douglas, the heavyweight champion, is settled out of court, Steve Wynn still has problems.
In his suit, King named Wynn, the owner of the Mirage in Las Vegas, Nev., as a defendant and accused him of wrongfully interfering with his contract.
But as much as the case put Wynn in jeopardy in the courtroom, it continues to hamstring him in his ability to convert his $32 million purse bid for Douglas's title defense against Evander Holyfield on Sept. 21 into a reality.
''The industry talk is that Wynn hasn't a dime of coverage on his $32 million, because the closed circuit and pay-per-view people won't do anything until the trial is over or a settlement is reached,'' said one boxing insider. 
Lou Falcigno, a closed-circuit exhibitor who recently allied with other exhibitors to form a pay-per-view organization, said neither he nor his exhibitors had put up money to secure closed-circuit rights.
Wynn, however, said: ''We haven't asked for anything from them. We're selling it direct to cable operators.''
Asked whether any pay-per-view systems had advanced him money, Wynn said, ''It's not a proper thing to discuss.''
But Falcigno said, ''Historically, the pay-per-view guys are even less inclined than closed-circuit exhibitors to put up money.''
Falcigno said that because the trial has frozen Wynn in place, Wynn needs more lead time to mount a successful promotion.
''You need easily three months to do a fight correctly,'' Falcigno said.
Then, referring to the Mike Tyson-Alex Stewart match Sept. 22 on Home Box Office, he added: ''The fact that there's a free show the next night doesn't help either. Because where are the boxing reporters going to be? Some of them will be in Atlantic City for Tyson-Stewart and won't be writing in advance of Wynn's fight.''
Falcigno said that if Wynn holds to his Sept. 21 date, he is going to have ''serious problems'' - problems Wynn apparently recognizes.
But so far Wynn hasn't been able to persuade the Holyfield camp to agree to the date he prefers, Oct. 25.
''We're not moving the date a month ahead,'' said Shelly Finkel, an adviser to Holyfield. ''Why should we? They're the ones that went to court. They're the ones that caused the problem. We're ready to fight on Sept. 21.''
Falcigno said he can't imagine Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva, not giving Wynn the lead time that is an economic necessity.
''It wouldn't do him any good to have his fighter part of a failed promotion,'' said Falcigno of Duva. ''People would say, 'Holyfield can't sell any tickets.' I doubt Dan wants that.''
Wynn appears to think the problem will be resolved.
''We have the right to ask for an extension for cause, and we'll get it,'' he said. ''The trial is the reason we need to reschedule.''
But Duva doesn't share Wynn's opinion.
''Wynn wants to use the trial as an excuse,'' he said. ''He could have been working on the promotion. It's an internal Mirage problem because I don't think they know what to do. The Mirage has talked about Oct. 3, Oct. 19 or Oct. 25 as a new date. The later dates are completely unacceptable. We have no percentage of the upside revenues, so what's the difference?''
''Our objective,'' said Duva, ''is to win the fight. Evander's chances increase the earlier the fight, because he's in shape right now.''
 
Options for Foreman
A compromise is in the works to keep George Foreman as part of the doubleheader co-featuring Tyson against Stewart in Atlantic City on Sept. 22.
Foreman, who was resisting HBO's dictate that he fight Francesco Damiani, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion, in a 10-round non-title fight, has been offered the option of a different opponent, possibly Wimpy Halstead. Foreman will probably accept it.
Ron Weathers, Foreman's adviser, said that while Foreman would receive less than the $2- to $2.5 million he was to get for fighting Damiani, the $1.2- to $1.6 million for boxing Halstead, or a reasonable facsimile, likely would satisfy him.
Foreman has a tuneup bout against Ken Lakusta on July 31 in Edmonton, Alberta, and Weathers is looking into a bout against Jean Chanet, the European champion, at Wembley Stadium in London later this year.
As for Damiani, don't be surprised if Foreman ends up fighting him on prime-time network television in November. If the bout does happen, on ABC, it would be for that W.B.O. title that HBO would rather he not pursue - not after the cable service spent $22 million to unify the heavyweight division.
 
Showtime Intrigue
Negotiations are heating up for a Showtime doubleheader of Michael Moorer (W.B.O. light-heavyweight champion) vs. Charles Williams (I.B.F. light-heavyweight champion), and Thomas Hearns (W.B.O. supermiddleweight champion) vs. Juan Gimenez. But that card would lead to more intriguing future bouts: Virgil Hill (W.B.A champion) vs. the winner of Moorer-Williams, with Hearns to fight the winner of that bout.

HEADLINE: Aggression in Men: Hormone Levels Are a Key

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
WHEN men are domineering and intensely competitive, it may be just another case of raging hormones, specifically the male sex hormone testosterone, researchers say.
Scientists have long linked abnormally high levels of testosterone to an unusually early involvement with sex and drug use and to certain violent crimes, like particularly vicious rapes. But now a series of new findings show that high testosterone levels play a role in the normal urge for the upper hand.
Those men who are most likely to try to dominate in a social situation, be it in a prison yard or a board room, are likely to have higher testosterone levels than their peers, new data show.
Scientists caution against placing too much stock in the importance of hormones like testosterone in human affairs, since so many other factors, from childhood experiences to social status, shape the expression of a given behavior like dominance or competitiveness. 
''This doesn't mean that people can't be dominant or aggressive without high testosterone,'' said Dr. Robert Rose, a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota medical school. ''A woman, of course, can be as competitive as a man, even though her testosterone levels are much lower.''
Scientists emphasize that the effects of hormones on human behavior are small relative to social and psychological factors, showing up most clearly in studies of large numbers of people. And Dr. Rose is among a group of scientists who are skeptical that the hormone is a strong and direct cause of specific human behavior. He cites a series of studies, most involving small numbers of people, that have posted contradictory findings.
''In animals behavior like mating, nesting and aggression is much more tightly linked to hormones than is true in humans,'' Dr. Rose said. ''In humans hormones only set the stage, while social factors determine if and how they are expressed.''
Still, a growing body of new evidence portrays a distinct role for testosterone among men jockeying for power.
High testosterone levels have long been known to typify the dominant males in groups of primates like baboons, and in unusual groups of men like prison inmates and hospitalized psychiatric patients. But the recent research has found the same differences in men who seek social dominance in normal realms of life.
''Hormonal secretions create a propensity for certain behaviors,'' Dr. Rose said. ''Testosterone seems most strongly linked to competitiveness and dominance.''
The findings apply only to men. After puberty, testosterone levels in men are about 10 times higher than in women.
''The highest testosterone level in women tends to fall within the low range for men, so that the hormone is a far greater factor for men than women,'' said Dr. Richard Udry, head of a center for population study at the University of North Carolina, who is studying the effects of testosterone on sexuality. But researchers agree with Dr. Rose that other factors can make women just as competitive as men.
The newest and strongest evidence about the effect of testosterone comes from a study of 1,706 men in the Boston area, aged 39 to 70. The men were selected at random as part of a larger study on aging. Those who agreed to participate were interviewed in their homes and given psychological tests, and blood samples were taken.
Those who had higher levels of testosterone and related hormones had a personality profile that researchers described as ''dominant with some aggressive behavior.''
''The picture we get is of a man who attempts to influence and control other people, who expresses his opinions forcefully and his anger freely, and who dominates social interactions,'' said John B. McKinlay, a psychologist at the New England Research Institute in Watertown, Mass., who was on the research team.
The study, which will be published in Psychosomatic Medicine, is considered significant because it is the first to examine so many randomly chosen men. Most studies of testosterone in humans have been on small numbers in select populations, like prison inmates.
Other studies, Dr. McKinlay noted, have found that men high in the trait of social dominance tend to rise to positions of leadership in business and other organizations. But for many others, some traits associated with testosterone present an obstacle to success.
Exactly how a man's high testosterone level is expressed depends in part on his social class, another new study has found. For men of lower social and economic status, it is likely to show up as a readiness for fights, a history of minor crimes, and chronic trouble with parents, teachers and peers in childhood. But that is not true at higher social and economic rungs, where the display of dominance is more subdued, researchers say.
 
Study of Vietnam Veterans
The findings are from data collected by the Federal Centers for Disease Control from 4,462 Vietnam veterans who were studied starting in 1985 to assess long-term effects of military service. The men's social and economic standing was rated as high if they fell into the top half of the United States population in both income and education level, and low if they fell into the bottom half.
An analysis of data on their testosterone levels was reported in the current issue of Psychological Science by James Dabbs Jr., a psychologist at Georgia State University.
''The overall picture among the high-testosterone men is one of delinquency, substance abuse and a tendency toward excess,'' Dr. Dabbs said. ''They have more trouble with people like teachers while they are growing up, have more sexual partners, are more likely to have gone AWOL in the service and to have used hard drugs. But that was so mainly for men who had low income and little education.''
There is disagreement over the social effect of testosterone on high status men. Dr. McKinlay sees these results from the study of veterans as dovetailing with his own on testosterone and social dominance, with high status men having different outlets for their impulse to dominate.
''How hormone levels are expressed depends on social factors,'' he said. ''You can drive a fast car instead of stealing them, for instance. Social dominance could be channeled into organizational leadership if you have the opportunities.''
 
An Obstacle for Some
On the other hand, Dr. Dabbs believes that many men with high testosterone levels are too impatient and aggressive to find their ways to positions of responsible leadership. Men with the highest testosterone levels were two and a half times more likely to be low-status as high.
The traits of some men with high testosterone may not suit them to rising in organizations where cooperation and consensus are valued, Dr. Dabbs noted. He cited other studies showing that among rapists, high levels are found in those who committed the most vicious attacks, and that among young men, schoolyard bullies have high levels of the hormone.
''Those successful in the business world use the machinery of social power, and many men with high testosterone may not be patient or docile enough to learn that mastery,'' he Dabbs said. ''They'd rather be out doing something physical. They're showoffs and swaggerers, anti-social and selfish.''
In a comparison of men in occupations ranging from the ministry, medicine and college professors to actors, football players and firemen, Dr. Dabbs found that testosterone levels correlated with certain vocations. Ministers were low in the hormone, while actors and football players had the highest levels. That study will be published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
''I was surprised that actors had such high levels,'' Dr. Dabbs said. ''But I found that among the Vietnam veterans, those who described themselves as entertainers also had high testosterone. There is a certain renegade quality to acting as a career.''
Dr. Dabbs is now studying lawyers to see if those specializing in litigation have higher testosterone levels than lawyers who do not fight it out in court.
In a series of other recent findings, fluctuations in testosterone levels in the 20 to 30 percent range have been found to reflect competitive triumphs and defeats. While most studies have focused on testosterone's influence in causing traits, these studies suggest that the hormone may be sensitive to the ups and downs of competition.
For instance, in one study the testosterone levels of the six members of the University of Nebraska varsity tennis team were monitored before and after six meets.
Players with the highest testosterone levels before each match were the most ''psyched,'' feeling optimistic about the match. Afterward, testosterone levels rose in those who won. How well the players felt they performed was also strongly related to the hormone levels: the better the player evaluated his own performance, the higher the level.
''There is a link between triumph and testosterone levels, which possibly could account for the momentum of a losing or winning streak,'' said Alan Mazur, a sociologist at Syracuse University who was an author of the study. The results were published in Hormone and Behavior in 1989.
 
Triumph and Humiliation
In the same vein, an earlier study by Dr. Mazur showed rises in the testosterone levels of men in the hours after being awarded their M.D. degrees. And, conversely, research by Dr. Rose found that testosterone levels fell in men going through harassment during the first few weeks of officers' candidate school.
Dr. Mazur sees testosterone at play in the small contests that establish pecking orders among men in social life. ''The sporting contest is an analog for any social competition,'' he said. ''It needn't be physical. We've found the same hormone changes in chess matches.''
''Finding your place in the hierarchy is a basic part of primate life, and testosterone is tightly linked to the outcome of battles for dominance in other species,'' he added. ''In humans, of course, face-to-face dominance is highly symbolic. I'd guess that any meaningful elevation of status would raise testosterone levels, and a blow to your status would lower them, though it hasn't been measured yet.''

HEADLINE: Applause, Confusion On RJR Debt

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
Prices of some RJR Nabisco ''junk bonds'' soared - though not to expected levels - in heavy trading yesterday, as a $6.9 billion refinancing plan was generally well received by Wall Street.
Traders in both the equity and debt markets, however, said they were somewhat confused by the refinancing and did not fully understand its effect on RJR. Prices of RJR warrants dropped 37.5 cents, to $7, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts attributed the drop to the announcement that Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which acquired RJR in early 1989, had paid $6.25 a share for new RJR stock, raising questions among traders about the actual value of the equity of the privately held company.
As part of the refinancing plan disclosed late Sunday, Kohlberg, Kravis invested more cash in RJR Nabisco and announced details of bond buyback plan. 
 
'Larger Equity Cushion'
Analysts welcomed the plan, saying it greatly strengthened RJR Nabisco's balance sheet. Investors said that the plan appeared to benefit both bondholders and Kolhberg, Kravis.
''This is a company that now has a larger equity cushion and a less burdensome debt profile,'' said Edward P. Mally, a junk bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
Investors said that the program somewhat enhanced the Wall Street image of Kohlberg, Kravis. To complete the 1989 buyout, the firm used some junk bonds with a ''reset'' feature that required RJR to establish a fixed interest rate intended to make the bonds trade at their full value.
The reset feature has created problems, because declines in the prices of the bonds require that a higher interest rate be established at the time of the resetting to make the prices rise back to 100 cents on the dollar.
Earlier this year, many investors expressed doubts about whether RJR or Kohlberg, Kravis could pay off the debts.
 
'Buys Them Credibility'
The official terms of the refinancing have altered some investors' opinions of the buyout firm's strategy for solving the problems of its highly leveraged companies. ''I don't think there's any question that it buys them credibility,'' said Robert S. Dow, portfolio manager of the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund in New York.
Henry R. Kravis, a founder of the buyout firm, said yesterday that he believed the refinancing would benefit bondholders, stockholders and employees of RJR Nabisco. ''We think it is a very attractive package,'' he said.
Trading in some of the company's junk bonds was huge, traders said. One trader estimated that $500 million of the two most active issues changed hands.
The refinancing included these actions:
* RJR reset the interest rate on two issues of junk bonds, with a market value of more than $7 billion.
* Kohlberg, Kravis transferred $1.7 billion in new equity to RJR.
* RJR notified the banks that packaged its new loans that it would begin drawing the $2.2 billion tomorrow.
While the company sought to settle the problem of the reset feature, traders debated whether a solution had been found. Even though RJR put a fixed interest rate on two junk bond issues that was intended to make them trade at 100 cents on the dollar plus their accrued interest, neither of the bonds traded yesterday at what investors estimate is their full value.
The exchange debentures due in 2007 closed at 91.75, up more than four points, or $40 for every $1,000 face amount. The converting debentures due in 2009 closed at 114 3/8, up more than 8 points.
 
Possible Legal Action
The closing prices were lower than the bonds' full values, analysts estimated. The difference, traders said, reflected the lack of details about the new convertible preferred stock that will be used in an exchange offer for some of the bonds. Traders said bondholders did not appear upset that the bonds did not trade at par yesterday. But they said lawsuits might be filed if the bonds do not trade at their full value in the next week.
The language of the bond agreement does not say that the two junk bond issues must actually trade at par. It says the rate set by the investment bankers must be one that they believe will make the bonds trade at their par value on a ''fully distributed basis.''
The rate on the exchange debentures due in 2007 is 17 percent, and the rate on the converting debentures due in 2009 is 17 3/8 percent. Those rates were higher than many investors had anticipated, traders said.
The interest in RJR's junk bonds helped to lift overall junk bond prices yesterday.
The complicated reset feature had allowed Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire RJR Nabisco in its battle for the company against a group led by F. Ross Johnson, who was then chief executive of the tobacco and food giant, and included Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers. The special committee of RJR board members that decided the buyout issue agreed to accept the Kohlberg, Kravis offer because it included junk bonds with the reset feature, and the bid by their opponents did not, according to a book about the battle, ''Barbarians at the Gate.''
RJR executives have put in new cash and are ridding the company of some of its most expensive debt. This includes junk bonds that were accruing interest as additional bonds instead of cash, $1 billion of increasing-rate notes, a $1.15 billion bank bridge loan and some of a $500 million bridge loan from Kohlberg, Kravis.
RJR would not disclose how the refinancing would affect the company's cash payments of interest and dividends. But Dirk Van Doren, a junk bond analyst at McCarthy Crisanti Maffei in Montpelier, Vt., estimated that the total payments -including interest and dividends on the new preferred stock - were not likely to increase. He estimated that in 1991 the company would have to pay between $500 million and $600 million in cash that under the old plan was accruing in additional bonds. Such a sum is easily covered by the company's cash flow, he said.
 
Gains Equity
In the new structure, RJR has a great deal more equity. While debt is reduced to less than $20 billion, from $23 billion, equity has been increased to $4 billion, from $1 billion. At the same time Kohlberg, Kravis's share of this equity has increased to about 68 percent, from about 58 percent, a spokesman for RJR said. The amount available to bondholders in the new issue of convertible preferred stock remains the same at about 25 percent and the proportionate share of the holders of RJR warrants declines to about 7 percent.
In addition to the change in the interest rate on the junk bonds, RJR plans to use some of the proceeds of the refinancing to buy back some of the bonds in the open market. Some of the cash will also be used in a separate exchange offer for the junk bonds. Initially, the repurchase program will affect only the exchange debentures due in 2007. Open market or private purchases of any of the converting debentures due in 2009 will begin only after an exchange offer for the converting debentures is completed.
RJR will also soon announce details of an exchange offer of $800 million in cash and $1.16 billion of new 11.5 percent convertible preferred stock for up to 85 percent of the converting debentures and some of the exchange debentures. Holders of these debentures will receive $333 in cash and $667 in stated value of the new convertible preferred stock for each $1,000 amount of principal and accrued interest.
The new preferred stock has a stated value of $25 a share and may be converted into common shares of RJR Nabisco Holdings at a conversion price of $9 a share.
 
GAF Agreement
WAYNE, N.J., July 16 (AP) - The GAF Corporation announced today that four banks had agreed to provide the specialty chemicals and building materials company with $800 million in long-term financing, primarily to pay off debt incurred when a management group bought out shareholders in March 1989. Banks involved in the agreement are the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Bank of New York, the Bank of Nova Scotia and Banque Paribas of Paris. The refinancing arrangement is expected to be completed next month, the company said. A management group led by Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief executive, paid $1.46 billion in the buyout.

HEADLINE: Profits Off For Some Big Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Problems with bad real estate loans and sluggish demand for new loans are depressing profits of some large banks around the country, reports yesterday of earnings for the second quarter showed.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the First Chicago Corporation and the Bank of New York Company all reported declines in second-quarter earnings from a year earlier, while J. P. Morgan & Company and the Security Pacific Corporation had small gains. But the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., turned in a 50 percent increase in its profits despite an increase in problem loans.
''This is as bad an environment for banks as I have seen in 20 years,'' said Thomas Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., who tracks 35 large banking companies. He recently forecast declines in second-quarter profits at 21 of those banks, including 9 of the nation's 10 largest banks. 64% Decline for Chase Profits at Chase Manhattan fell 64 percent, to $52 million, or 24 cents a share, from $137 million, or $1.31 a share, in the quarter last year, when it had fewer shares outstanding. Chase said its profits were hurt by a $75 million increase in its reserve for loan losses, most of which was needed to cover possible losses on its commercial real estate lending. 
Chase said it had $1.28 billion in commercial real estate loans that were not paying interest or faced trouble at the end of the period, up from $884 million at the end of March.
The weakness at Chase, the nation's second-largest banking company after Citibank, has led to uncertainty over whether it could maintain its common stock dividend of 62 cents a share. A Chase spokesman said yesterday, however, that executives planned to recommend this week that the board maintain the dividend.
''With each quarter that Chase's earnings do not cover its dividend, the stock market gets more and more concerned and discounts Chase stock to reflect the possibility of a dividend reduction,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase stock closed down 50 cents a share, to $20.75, its lowest level of the year.
Beside its problems with real estate loans, analysts said, Chase's future earnings might be hurt by severance pay and other costs from its plans to cut 3,200 workers. Chase had said it hoped the cut in payroll and reorganization would reduce expenses by $300 million annually.
 
First Chicago
First Chicago also reported that problems with bad business loans had depressed its profits, which fell 34 percent, to $87.4 million, or $1.19 a share, from $134.4 million, or $1.92 a share.
More than three-quarters of First Chicago's profit came from its regional banking business, which includes credit cards, consumer banking in Chicago and the activities of the American National Corporation, a big lender to small- and medium-sized businesses. But while profits at the regional bank rose 39 percent, to $61 million, profits from lending to large corporations through its wholesale banking group fell 74 percent, to $20 million.
Business loans that were not paying interest or faced other trouble rose to $640 million at the end of the quarter, from $582 million at the end of March. Troubled commercial real estate loans declined by $44 milion, to $331 million, but the company's holdings of real estate acquired from bad loans rose $76 million, to $293 million.
 
Bank of New York
The Bank of New York's profit of $70 million, or 90 cents a share, was down 39 percent from $114 million, or $1.55 a share.
Most of the decline resulted from a $94 million increase in its loan-loss reserve, of which $71 million was used to pay for write-offs of domestic loans.
Problem assets, including loans that were not paying interest and real estate acquired because of bad loans, rose to $1.336 billion at the end of the quarter, up $145 million from March 31. About $115 million in loans to heavily indebted corporations were added to the problem list during the quarter, but $65 million worth of such loans improved enough to be removed from the list.
 
J. P. Morgan
At J. P. Morgan, profits of $207 million, or $1.06 a share, were up less than 1 percent from $206 million, or $1.09 a share. Morgan, which has avoided the riskier loans for commercial real estate or leveraged buyouts, added only $10 million to its reserve for loan losses, down from $35 million a year earlier.
The strongest element in Morgan's earnings was its trading activities, which produced profits of $234 million, up from $161 million. Profits were strong from interest-rate swaps and trading loans of less-developed countries.
 
Security Pacific
Security Pacific's profit rose nearly 6 percent, to $195.2 million, or $1.59 a share, from $184.5 million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier.
Robert H. Smith, the president the of Los Angeles-based bank, noted that the strength of the California and Washington economies continued to help the company. Noninterest expenses rose by only 2 percent from a year earlier, a much smaller gain that at most other banking companies of its size.
But problems with bad loans, primarily for Arizona real estate and businesses in Britain and Australia, led Security Pacific to add $160.7 million to its reserve for loan losses, up from $111.6 million a year earlier.
 
NCNB
NCNB, which has become the nation's seventh-largest banking company since its expansion into Texas two years ago, said its earnings surged 50 percent, to $137.4 million, or $1.26 a share, from $91.5 million, or $1 a share.
NCNB added to its consumer deposit base by acquiring failed savings and loans in Texas and gaining new customers. Average deposits during the quarter of $48.1 billion were up 13 percent.
Because of slack loan demand, NCNB has been using its rising deposits to buy low-risk Government securities. When loan demand improves and risks of lending subside, analysts expect NCNB to benefit as it shifts from low-yielding Government securities to higher-yielding loans.
Problem loans, however, rose $96.1 million, to $695.2 million, while the company added $84.1 million to its reserve for loan losses. A year earlier, only $46.3 million was added to the resreve.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Programs to Keep Retirees Healthy

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
AT the Campbell Soup Company's fitness center in Camden, N.J., Bill Brown, a 79-year-old retiree, leads an exercise class called flexibility.
A growing number of employers like Campbell Soup are making special efforts to help retirees stay healthy. They say retirees feel good about the programs. So do active employees, especially those nearing retirement. ''It's great for our employees, who can see that these retirees have such a wonderful attitude about life,'' said John R. Thompson, Campbell's employee health services manager. 
And benefits managers reckon that fewer visits to doctors and hospitals will mean savings for the company health plan.
Studies indicate that wellness programs for older adults can reduce the risk of cancer and improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength and motor capacity, said Robert Levin, director of the Institute on Aging with the Washington Business Group on Health, an employers' association.
''It used to be thought that anything you did in health promotion for seniors would be too little and too late, but two new lines of thinking are changing this,'' said Dr. James F. Fries of the Stanford University School of Medicine. ''First, the likelihood of an illness is many times greater for seniors than for younger people, so you are intervening at the right time. And second, health-care expenses are so much greater for seniors that even a small percentage change will yield relatively large dividends.''
Dr. Fries recently reported on a 12-month study of 6,000 retired employees of the Bank of America. Some of the bank's retiree clubs took part in a wellness program, which included exercising, changing diets and quitting smoking. The club members' medical costs declined 16 percent while the dollar claims by retirees in clubs that did not participate rose 3 percent.
In another study, Dr. Fries and J. Paul Leigh, an economist at San Jose State University, looked at the bank's retirees whose health was thought to be at risk. They were overweight, did not exercise vigorously, consumed at least one pack of cigarettes and two alcoholic drinks each day, and usually did not buckle their auto seat belts.
''The worst-case difference in annual hospital and doctor costs between a person with good habits and one with bad habits was $4,588,'' said Clark E. Kerr, a Bank of America vice president in San Francisco. ''We concluded that health habits can make a big difference on the bottom line of actual claims dollars.''
The bank has expanded the health promotion program, now in its third year. ''The retiree clubs that participated were very happy,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''The control groups all wanted in. This is one of the few things the company can do to save money that also makes the employees happy.''
In a similar approach, Texas Instruments has started retiree clubs at 4 of its 13 fitness centers and is organizing more. Retirees get free lifetime memberships in the centers. ''We ask them to donate 10 to 15 hours of voluntary time a year, to help with mailings and organizing special events,'' said Jenny L. Brock, director of corporate health promotion at Texas Instruments, which has 50,000 active employees and 7,000 retirees. She recently started two-month ''Fit to be 50'' classes, which encourage retirees and older employees to keep active and provide advice on nutrition and dealing with stress.
The Adolph Coors Company in Golden, Colo., regularly invites retirees to take part in free exercise and other health-promotion classes.
Some companies encourage retirees to use community facilities like Y.M.C.A. swimming pools. Others keep in touch through retiree health newsletters. The Reader's Digest, for example, sends them Prime Time, a newsletter published by Kelly Communications in Charlottesville, Va.
''Retirees are a tremendous health-cost liability,'' Mr. Kerr at Bank of America said. The cost of health benefits for retirees under age 65, when Medicare kicks in, rose 14 to 16 percent on average this year at 123 corporations surveyed by the TPF&C unit of Towers Perrin, a consulting firm. The average cost for a retiree with family coverage was $4,764. But even this may be a low estimate, TFP&C said, because many employers do not break out their retiree costs.
''Our analysis for specific clients showed costs for retirees under 65 were 150 to 200 percent of the average cost for the active employees,'' said Richard Ostuw, a TPF&C vice president in Cleveland.
Mr. Kerr listed three choices for reducing such costs: ''cut benefits, shift costs to retirees or help retirees get healthier, which is the one everyone likes.'' He added, ''This is something that more and more companies will be doing.''

HEADLINE: Acquisitions By Japanese Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Japanese purchases of American companies jumped sharply in the first half of this year, while American purchases in Japan remained small.
But while the Japanese buying seems to get most of the attention, Japan was not the leading buyer of United States companies. British and French companies led the list, with purchases totaling $7.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. Japan was No. 3, with $3.8 billion in American acquisitions. 
In addition, there were other large acquisitions made by buyers from Italy, Taiwan and Bahrain, where Investcorp Bank E.C., which bought Saks Fifth Avenue, is based.
 
Deals Almost Double
The number of Japanese deals rose to 64, from 33 in the first half of 1989, and the $3.8 billion value of the acquisitions reported climbed from $2.1 billion, according to an analysis of mergers and acquistions by the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick in New York. Over all in 1989, Japanese purchases in America totaled $10.9 billion, based on the deals in which prices were reported.
At the same time, American companies made only $3.7 million worth of acquisitions in Japan. These were Pepsico's acquisition of Fujiya Frito Lay Ltd. for $1.7 million and the Alliant Computer System Corporation's purchase of Nihon Alliant for $2 million.
Among the big purchases made by Japanese concerns in the United States in the first half of this year were the $880 million acquisition of the Aristech Chemical Corporation by Mitsubishi and Ito/Yokado's purchase of 75 percent of the Southland Corporation for $400 million.
United States purchases worldwide in the first half of the year slowed compared with 1989. But there was a surge of large deals in the second quarter of this year that were valued over all at more than $7 billion. More than half that total came from the $3.8 billion paid by the Phillip Morris Companies to acquire Jacobs Suchard A.G., the Swiss candy maker. Another $1.5 billion is from the Bell Atlantic Corporation's purchase of the Telecom Corporation, the New Zealand telephone company.
Most of the American purchases, by the number of deals, were in Britain, with 37 out of 124 acquisitions. But the total value of those acquisitions, $1.2 billion, is far below that of the purchases the British made in the United States.
 
Drop in Credit Cited
Herbert S. Adler, the internatiional mergers and acquisitions partner for KPMG Peat Marwick, said that a declining availability of credit and the slowing economy in the United States helped curb the number of American purchases worldwide in the first half of the year. Compared with 1989, the value of deals fell to $8.1 billion, from $11.4 billion, and the number of deals fell to 124, from 213. Prices were not reported in all the deals.
With the surge of buying from Japan worldwide, which rose 84 percent to $5.3 billion in the first half of the year, and large purchases by Swedish companies, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions rose 16 percent in the first half of the year. The total value of purchases was $62.2 billion, with almost 45 percent of the deals between countries in the 12-nation European Community.

HEADLINE: G.E. Profits Set a Record For Quarter

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said yesterday that it had achieved record operating profit margins in the second quarter and that its net earnings rose to nearly $1.09 billion, a 12 percent increase from the $972 million of a year earlier.
The company's earnings per share rose slightly more, by nearly 13 percent, to $1.22, from $1.08 in the comparable quarter last year, because the company had repurchased 22.9 million shares since starting a stock buyback program last year. The buybacks have reduced the number of shares outstanding by 1.8 percent from a year earlier.
 
Revenues at $14.4 Billion
G.E.'s revenues for the quarter rose by 6.6 percent, to $14.4 billion from $13.5 billion. 
''It was a clean quarter, in line with Wall Street's strong expectations,'' said Mark Altman, who follows General Electric for Paine Webber Inc.
John F. Welch Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, said G.E. had experienced productivity gains in all of its main lines of business. Some groups like appliances and the industrial group, which makes locomotives, factory equipment and lighting and electrical systems, raised their operating profits even though their revenues were about the same as last year.
Overall operating margins for the company reached 12.9 percent of sales, Mr. Welch said. That topped the previous quarterly record of 12.1 percent, which was achieved in the second quarter of last year.
''The strong upward momentum in incoming order trends continued for longer-cycle businesses,'' Mr. Welch said, citing G.E.'s power-generation, medical systems, locomotive, and aircraft engine businesses. The analysts said that several businesses had been strong for years, notably aircraft engines, but that the growth in power generation was more recent and especially encouraging.
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., has experienced especially strong demand for gas turbines.
 
Medical Orders Rise 15%
Orders for medical systems were up by 15 percent from a year earlier, led by demand for magnetic resonance imaging equipment for disease diagnosis and X-ray equipment orders in Europe. The transportation group received an order from Mexico for 100 trains, the company's largest such export order in several years. And its aircraft engine business had a record $35 billion backlog by the end of June, up by 10 percent from a year earlier, because of a large order from Japan Air Lines.
G.E. said its financial services group was among its top-performing units, with net income up by 16 percent. It reported that its GE Capital Corporation unit accounted for most of the gain, which the analysts said suggested that its reinsurance business and its Kidder, Peabody & Company brokerage subsidiary performed neither unusually well nor badly.
The company's aerospace and broadcasting groups reported unspecified declines in their operating profits. The broadcasting group, built around the NBC television network, reported that its revenues fell with its profits. G.E. attributed the troubles at NBC to ''market softness.''
NBC's problems related in part to measured declines in the audience for network television under the Nielsen rating system. The analysts said the agreement among the networks and advertisers to adopt a new system for measuring television viewership might spur improved performance in the latter part of the year.
Considering the overall trends in revenues and productivity, Mr. Welch said, G.E. anticipated that double-digit earnings gains would continue for the rest of 1990.
''The operating margin improvement continues to be very impressive,'' said Russell Leavitt, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. ''They are making productivity improvements despite a sluggish economy.''
Possibly because the results were in line with Wall Street's predictions, the immediate reaction of investors was lukewarm. General Electric's shares fell in morning trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, before rebounding to finish at $74.75, down 12.5 cents.

HEADLINE: Alcoa's Net Is Down by 43%

 BODY:
The Aluminum Company of America, citing a softening in aluminum prices and lower income from the company's affiliate in Brazil, yesterday reported a 43 percent drop in second-quarter earnings.
The Pittsburgh-based company, the world's largest producer of aluminum, said that its earnings fell to $161.9 million, or $1.86 a share, compared with $285.2 million, or $3.21 a share, in the second quarter of 1989. Revenue fell to $2.73 billion in the second quarter from $2.82 billion in the 1989 period.
Alcoa said that the lower earnings were primarily a result of a 24 percent decline in the price of aluminum ingot on world markets. Also, the company said that earnings at Alcoa Aluminio, the Brazilian affiliate in which Alcoa holds a 59 percent stake, dropped to $6 million in the first half of the year, compared with $61 million in the comparable period last year. The decline was attributed to actions taken by the Brazilian Government to improve that country's economy.
Peter Anker, a metals analyst with the First Boston Corporation, said that the results were generally in line with expectations. ''They did a little better in Brazil than we had expected,'' Mr. Anker said. ''We had been expecting them to break even in the operation in Brazil, but it looks like they made $6 million.''
Other analysts said that the company's results reflected declining prices for fabricated aluminum products, adding that the prices of aluminum sheets for beverage cans had declined.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Alcoa shares rose 50 cents yesterday, closing at $69.25.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading; Gold and Silver Prices Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against most major foreign currencies yesterday although traders continued to worry about the direction of American interest rates.
Gold and silver prices fell in the United States and abroad.
Analysts said the dollar continued to recover from a midday decline on Friday, when the Federal Reserve added funds to the banking system and financial markets interpreted the move as a relaxation of the Fed's credit policy. 
Trading was light. James T. McGroarty, senior vice president with Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Connecticut, said the market was uncertain about what the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, might say tomorrow about the central bank's policy when he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.
The dollar put in a mixed performance against the British pound. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8033 from late Friday's $1.8005, but in earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.8040, from $1.8055 late Friday.
 
Rise in Tokyo
The dollar was unchanged against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 148.15 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.43 yen, from 147.42 yen at Friday's close, and it was quoted in London at 148.05 yen.
Gold prices slipped lower in New York, closing at $363.30 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down $1.10 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank recorded a late bid of $362.50, down $1.50.
Gold traded in London late yesterday at $362.75 a troy ounce, down from $364.55 late Friday. The late price in Zurich was $362.70, down from $364.20. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $363.11 an ounce, down from Saturday's $363.59.
Silver prices also declined. In New York, a troy ounce of silver fell 6.1 cents, to $4.847 a troy ounce. Earlier, in London, silver was bid at a late price of $4.89, down from $4.93.

HEADLINE: New Rules and Incinerator Jitters Mean Hospital Waste Piles Up

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Two summers ago, the New York metropolitan area recoiled in horror as a few syringes and blood vials washed up on local beaches. The authorities pledged to hunt down and punish those responsible and New York, and many other states, made hospital disposal practices subject to sterner regulation and stricter punishment.
 
More Garbage, Fewer Sites
But now, although environmental and government officials are virtually unanimous in their conclusion that the fear inspired by the waste on the beaches was grossly out of proportion to a rather modest threat, the cure has contributed to an emerging medical-waste emergency: New York-area hospitals find themselves confronted by growing piles of garbage requiring special handling and a shrinking list of places to put it.
Environmental authorities and hospital officials generally agree that the new laws, which broaden the classification of regulated medical waste to include many items that did not previously require special handling, are useful and overdue. 
But they also acknowledge that the new rules have doubled the amount of waste that hospitals must consign to special red bags and stricter disposal requirements. At the same time, however, the hospitals' usual methods - on-site incineration or shipment out of state - are becoming more and more limited because of environmental concerns.
The hospitals must shut down or improve their incinerators by 1992 to meet stricter state pollution limits. Such improvements, even at smaller incinerators, could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time when many hospitals are in financial trouble. Even if the incinerators are modified to meet the new standards, hospitals still face powerful neighborhood opposition to continued burning.
More than two-thirds of hospital medical waste is shipped out of state for burning and burial in landfills. But this practice is 10 times as expensive as disposing of regular garbage because of the costs of shipping, packaging and handling, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents 120 nonprofit hospitals.
Meanwhile, the receiving states are becoming increasingly hostile to serving as a dumping ground for New York's medical waste and other garbage. Prices are rising, as are threats to close the borders.
''States will say, 'New York's garbage is no longer welcome here,' and who can blame them?'' said Peter A. Kelly, executive vice president for operations at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. Beth Israel will spend $800,000 this year on disposal, twice as much as a year ago, Mr. Kelly said, despite intensified recycling.
In New York State, regulated medical waste must be packaged in red bags before it leaves the hospital. Such waste, presumed to be infectious although it may not be, includes hypodermic needles, material that has absorbed blood and items that have been touched by patients with highly infectious diseases like AIDS.
In the year since the law on regulated medical waste changed, hospitals have been bagging much more material than they probably need to, to avoid fines and other penalties, said Elizabeth Sommers, vice president of regulatory affairs at the hospital association. Regulated waste now accounts for about a third of the 340 tons of solid waste hospitals generate daily, double the amount of a year ago.
 
Autoclaving in Brooklyn
Last week, Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston, a big waste-disposal company, proposed building a 240-ton-a-day medical-waste processing plant in the former Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Under the plan, made public last Wednesday, medical waste would be trucked from hospitals to the plant to be autoclaved - sterilized using steam and high pressure.
After sterilization, the waste would be shredded and trucked to a landfill, William Bingham, a company official in Boston, said. The landfill locations have not been determined, he said, although they could be those owned or operated by Browning-Ferris.
The board of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, a nonprofit concern that operates the yard, has approved a lease for the Browning-Ferris plant, pending regulatory approvals that could take a year or more.
Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, has scheduled a public hearing on the Browning-Ferris proposal today at 6 P.M. at Borough Hall.
Autoclaving, used in hospitals to sterilize instruments, has come into own for bulk waste only in the last two years, said Allen Hershkowitz, a Natural Resources Defense Council scientist.
But there are tradeoffs. Incineration reduces the volume of waste, but its soot can pollute the sky, and the landfilled ash may contain hazardous substances.Autoclaving is environmentally sound and processes much more waste an hour than incineration does, he said, but it does not reduce volume.
 
Betting on Shutdowns
The 261-acre Navy Yard is also under consideration as the site for a new municipal garbage incinerator. Mayor David N. Dinkins has delayed until 1993 a decision on whether to build the incinerator, which has spurred strong opposition from neighborhood and environmental groups.
Browning-Ferris is betting that most hospitals will shut down their on-site incinerators instead of upgrading them and that paying for out-of-state shipment will become untenable. Instead, the company is hoping the hospitals will turn to its plant, the first of its kind in the region.
But the company may have some competition. Local hospitals are discussing building a regional medical-waste incinerator with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.
Such a plant, intended to make disposal cheaper, could burn both normal and regulated medical waste. There are 57 hospital incinerators in New York City, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
Browning-Ferris, which operates incinerators elsewhere, anticipates less environmental opposition to its proposed sterilization and landfilling approach, Mr. Bingham said.
The hospitals agree. ''In the end, they won't be building something they call an incinerator,'' Ms. Sommers said. Indeed, the hospitals expect a time-consuming fight before their incinerator would be allowed to operate in the city.
As has already happened in Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, hospitals may adopt regional disposal rather than treatment at the hospital, because of economies of scale, Mr. Hershkowitz said.
For a price, hospitals can burn regular garbage at city-owned incinerators. But the Sanitation Department will not accept medical waste because of worker safety concerns.
And New York City law prohibits the disposal even of sterilized medical waste at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island for the same reason, said Daniel Millstone, the Sanitation Department's environmental lawyer. But the city would review the law if the safety of the process could be assured and the waste chopped up and rendered unrecognizable, Mr. Millstone said.
Medical waste constitutes only a small part - about 2 percent - of the nation's solid waste. Few people cared about the disposal of such garbage until the summer of 1988.
The fear of contracting AIDS is responsible for much of the concern, but there have been few, if any documented cases of infectious diseases transmitted that way, said a report by the Medical Waste Policy Committee, a panel of industry, labor, waste disposers and environmental groups.
Still, the horror of beached medical waste spurred legislative action.
Congress passed a law requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a two-year pilot program for tracking medical waste ''from its cradle to its grave.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
2 GERMANYS VOW TO RETAIN BORDER WITH THE POLES

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 17

 BODY:
East and West Germany agreed today to resolve Polish anxieties by promising to guarantee the postwar German-Polish frontier, and in doing so, the Germans all but guaranteed international endorsement of their own reunification by the end of the year.
The German assurances to Poland that the current border will not be changed after German unification were worked out during a one-day meeting of the ''two plus four'' group, which was organized by the foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the four World War II Allies - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - to deal with the international aspects of German unification.
The accord on the German-Polish border was widely anticipated after yesterday's landmark agreement between the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in which Mr. Gorbachev dropped his opposition to the membership of a united Germany in NATO.
 
Polish Peace of Mind
And indeed, the Soviet-German breakthrough seemed to propel all the parties gathered in Paris today into a quickly reached compromise on how to assure the Poles that the present East German-Polish border along the Oder and Neisse rivers will not be altered. 
Before the meeting, at which the Poles accepted the pledges on the border, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany privately assured Poland's Foreign Minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, that a united Germany would sign a new economic treaty guaranteeing fulfillment of all business contracts between Poland and East German companies that might soon be out of business.
Mr. Skubiszewski (whose name is pronounced KSHISH-tof Skoo-beh-SHEF-skee) told reporters that ''there was indeed a problem prior to this meeting'' but ''we have received the reassurance that the border treaty would be concluded as soon as possible after unification.''
''Language has been decided that is entirely satisfactory,'' he added.
 
Next Step in September
The six foreign ministers gathered in Paris said they will now be able to meet in Moscow on Sept. 12 to draft a final settlement that would terminate all the four-power rights and responsibilities over Germany and Berlin that grew out of the Allies' occupation of Germany at the end of World War II.
That proposed settlement will be submitted for endorsement to a summit meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The meeting is scheduled for Paris on Nov. 19, provided a treaty reducing conventional arms in Europe is completed by then. Once the Allied rights and responsibilities have been dissolved, fully sovereign East and West Germanys will go ahead with plans to conduct all-German elections on Dec. 2 and proceed with unification.
Today, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, commented: ''We can trust the German people in both parts of Germany. They have proven their commitment to peace and to create a state that will not threaten others.''
''About six months ago in Ottawa we initiated this two-plus-four process,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said at a news conference at the close of today's meeting.
''Our aim was to facilitate the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany and the reconciliation of Europe. Today, we draw much nearer to that target. The outcome that has so long eluded us is now within our reach. By the anniversary of our Ottawa meeting, I expect the United States and the other four-powers will welcome the advent of a united, democratic and sovereign Germany.''
France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, was more categoric, saying: ''There are no more obstacles preventing a united Germany from being re-established in its sovereignty by the end of the year.''
 
Speed of the Essence
Today's Polish-German accord was worked out after the two Germanys agreed to a set of five principles confirming the border and after they promised to conclude a formal border treaty with Poland ''within the shortest possible time'' after unification.
After Mr. Skubiszewski expressed his satisfaction, a British television reporter asked Mr. Genscher whether West Germany was in effect buying off Polish and Soviet opposition to unification, given that the Kohl-Gorbachev accord also included a provision for large-scale German economic aid to the Soviet Union. The reporter also asked Mr. Genscher, a fluent English speaker, to answer the question in English.
Mr. Genscher, bristling with anger and pointedly replying in German, said that it was ''not appropriate'' to talk ''about a price paid to buy Soviet agreement.''
''One cannot buy agreement,'' he added.
Virtually all the questions were directed at Mr. Genscher and only a smattering at Mr. Shevardnadze or Mr. Baker. None at all were asked of Mr. Dumas or the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd.
 
Set of Principles
American officials said the five principles regarding the Polish border accepted by the East and West German Foreign Ministers were these:
* After a final settlement is signed, a united Germany will remove from its laws any language suggesting that the Polish-German border is provisional.
* The area of a united Germany will consist only of Berlin and what is now the territory of East and West Germany.
* The parliament of a united Germany will confirm the Oder-Neisse line in a treaty with Poland ''in the shortest possible time'' after unification.
* A united Germany will forswear any territorial claims.
* The four Allied powers agree to serve in effect as witnesses that these commitments will be fulfilled.
 
Intricate if Grim History
The question of a German-Polish border treaty has been left in abeyance since the close of World War II. At the start of the war, Nazi Germany occupied western Poland and the Soviet Union occupied the eastern part. In 1945, after the war ended, the Soviet Union, by then ally and mentor of Poland, kept parts of eastern Poland, and in compensation gave Poland part of eastern Germany.
The postwar German-Polish border was drawn along the Oder and Neisse Rivers and became known as the Oder-Neisse line. Poland's annexation of the former German lands east of the Oder-Neisse line led to the forced migration of several million ethnic Germans.
On June 21, the Parliaments of the two Germanys adopted matching resolutions guaranteeing that the Oder-Neisse line would remain the border, and called on the parliament of a united Germany to confirm this in a treaty. This was deemed insufficient by Warsaw.
 
An Evaporated Threat
On Monday, Mr. Baker hinted that the wartime Allies might not dissolve all their rights and responsibilities over Germany if the two German nations did not provide satisfactory assurances to Warsaw. That threat seems to have evaporated in view of today's understandings.
Mr. Baker was repeatedly asked why the Bush Administration was taken by surprise by the deal struck in Moscow Monday between Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev, and whether Washington was becoming concerned about unilateral German actions. To one such question, he responded with a circumlocution that left even diplomats scratching their heads.
Said Mr. Baker of the Kohl-Gorbachev accord: ''This is a delightful surprise to the extent that it is a surprise, and it is only a surprise to the extent that we anticipated.''

HEADLINE: Manila Puts Quake Toll at 309 as Search Continues

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Wednesday, July 18

 BODY:
Rescue workers continued to dig in piles of rubble for the dead and the living today, as Philippine officials said the earthquake on Monday had killed at least 309 people and injured at least 595.
As the Office of Civil Defense released its toll from the quake, officials here said the number of casualties was certain to rise, and President Corazon C. Aquino flew to Cabanatuan, about 60 miles north of Manila, to view the rescue efforts at the Christian College of the Philippines, the school knocked flat by the quake.
At least 30 people were thought to be trapped under the remains of the six-story school, officials said.
Before dawn this morning, two aftershocks, measured by the United States Geological Service at 6.3 and 5.8 on the Richter scale, hit the Philippines. The earthquake Monday was measured at 7.7. There was no immediate indication of whether the aftershocks caused additional casualties or damage. 
Some estimates of the number of people killed are running higher than that the confirmed casualty toll issued by the Civil Defense Office. The death toll was especially subject to increase in and around Baguio, a mountain resort 110 miles north of Manila, where the earthquake is thought to have done the most damage. As many as 1,000 people are thought to be trapped in more than 20 badly damaged buildings, including four hotels.
Rescue workers, including cadets from the nearby Philippine military academy and some American servicemen stationed at Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, struggled to find survivors in the collapsed buildings. But little heavy equipment was immediately available.
 
A Painfully Riveting Image
As the Philippines tried to cope with the death and debris of the earthquake, the strongest in 14 years, people kept returning in conversations today to one of those searing television images that comes to symbolize a disaster: a young boy, crushed under the concrete of his school, his arm stretched out as if to write, a ballpoint pen cradled in his lifeless fingers.
Frequent aftershocks continued, and the area remains without electricity, water or fresh food. Roads to Baguio have been cut by collapsing bridges and landslides.
Officials said that hospitals were full, and that relief teams were struggling without necessary equipment. The cries of people still trapped could be heard, according to reports from the scene, some of the victims pinned under concrete that baked in the hot afternoon sun.
In Baguio, the earthquake collapsed the front of the Hyatt Hotel into the lobby, killing at least 50 people, officials said, and ruptured the Nevada Hotel almost down the middle.
The United States Agency for International Development was holding a seminar at the Nevada Hotel at the time with representatives of volunteer organizations. The agency's acting executive director, William Wallamaker, said one American was still unaccounted for, but would not release his name. Several Filipinos working for the agency were also missing, he said.
 
Help From U.S. and Others
An American recreational facility in Baguio, Camp John Hay, escaped damage, officials said.
The United States made immediate relief contributions of $25,000 and nearly 2,000 pounds of medical equipment and supplies, plus tents and clothing, from stores kept at the big American bases, Clark and Subic Bay.
Teams of civil engineers, Navy Seabees construction teams, search dogs, doctors and two portable hospitals with operating rooms were also flown from the American bases to Cabanatuan and Baguio cities. Some of the wounded were being moved to hospitals at Clark and John Hay. Japan provided an eight-member medical team, Philippine officials said, and offers of help also came from Thailand, Canada, Switzerland and South Korea.
The United States Embassy spokesman, Stanley Schrager, emphasized that American aid had nothing to do with pending negotiations, scheduled for late next month, on the future of the American military installations here.
President Aquino's spokesman, Tomas Gomez, said both Japan and the United States had offered whatever help might be needed.
The epicenter of the quake was about 60 miles north of Manila. Other areas badly hit included Dagupan, 100 miles north of Manila. In the capital, life had returned to normal on Tuesday after the quake caused electricity to fail, buildings to sway and crack, and traffic lights to go out on Monday.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Hijacker Sent Back to Moscow, With a Message

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 17

 BODY:
A Soviet teen-ager who forced a passenger plane to go to Sweden last month because he was fed up with life in the Soviet Union was returned to Moscow today. Soviet officials hailed his extradition as a breakthrough in this country's struggle against a remarkable epidemic of hijackings.
The youth, Dmitri Semyonov, 17 years old, was the first hijacker ever extradited to the Soviet Union from Sweden, which like many countries has tended to assume that those fleeing this country were in some measure political refugees.
Boris Ryzhenkov, a Civil Aviation Ministry official responsible for international agreements, said Sweden's decision to send Mr. Semyonov home even though the countries have no extradition treaty would be an important message to others contemplating his example. 
''In the 1960's, when there was a wave of hijackings of American planes to Cuba, what stopped it was that Cuba and the United States signed an extradition agreement,'' Mr. Ryzhenkov said in an interview. ''Extradition of the criminals is by far the most effective measure.''
 
Wields Fake Grenade
Brandishing a fake grenade, Mr. Semyonov diverted the Aeroflot flight to Stockholm on June 9. There were 121 passengers aboard, bound from Minsk, in Soviet Byelorussia, to Murmansk, in the far north. He told interviewers in Sweden that he hijacked the plane out of frustration after his parents had kicked him out of the house.
It was the beginning of one of the worst rashes of hijacking in the history of aviation. Most of the attempts were by young men seeking to escape the draft or flee economic frustration. Ten more hijackings have been tried since then, six successfully, inspiring much black humor about Aeroflot and an official campaign to beef up airport security.
''This is all connected with the complicated economic and political situation,'' said Valery A. Kondratyev, deputy chief of security for the Aviation Ministry. ''Most of these cases were young men who could not find their place in society and decided that they would be better off settling and organizing new lives abroad.''
The hijacking wave comes when freedom of travel has expanded enormously and a new law pending in the Parliament would remove most legal barriers to emigration.
 
'People Are Impatient'
But enactment of the law has been delayed, and even when it comes into force, departure from the country will be complicated by shortages of foreign currency and long waits for airline seats.
''Young people are impatient,'' Mr. Kondratyev said. ''We cannot have passengers endangered because of the whim of someone who wants to drink beer in Finland. Everyone wants a better life, but you have to come by it legally.''
In no case was the hijacker armed, but Soviet officials said passengers faced a different danger: most Soviet crews flying domestic routes are not trained or equipped to land at foreign airports.
''We've had two cases where the planes landed only due to sheer luck,'' said Mr. Ryzhenkov, noting that Soviet crews generally do not speak English, the language of international air traffic, or have the communications devices necessary for landing at busy Western airports.
 
Beefing Up Security
When a 19-year-old Leningrad draft evader diverted a plane to Stockholm last month, the Swedes had to send two military planes to escort it to the ground.
In the wake of the recent hijackings, Soviet officials have announced moves to shore up the security system by putting conspicuous armed patrols at many airports and plainclothes marshals on selected flights. They have also ordering more intense passenger screening.
In the past, Soviet airline security has consisted mainly of issuing firearms to the commanders of all civilian aircraft and installing outdated X-ray machines monitored by attendants who often seem to be busy dozing or gossiping.
But officials say nothing is as effective in fighting hijacking as the assurance that the offender will be sent home to be tried. Hijacking in the Soviet Union brings imprisonment of up to 10 years.
Soviet officials said Sweden's decision to extradite Mr. Semyonov raised strong hopes that two other recent hijackers still in Swedish custody would be sent home to stand trial. Another two hijackers are in Finland, which has an extradition treaty with the Soviet Union, and one is in Turkey, which has no treaty.
Sweden has preferred in the past to try Soviet hijackers in Sweden and allow them to stay after they have served their sentences.
''We understand that at the time the situation was different, the reaction to our requests was cooler,'' Mr. Ryzhenkov said. ''There was a political aspect that gave rise to hesitation.''
Mr. Semyonov, the hijacker sent home today, was shown on the evening television news disembarking at a Moscow airport and penitently advising others not to follow his example.
''Several rides in a Volvo and tasty lunches are not worth the punishment I will receive under Soviet law,'' the handcuffed youth told reporters before being whisked off for questioning by the K.G.B.

HEADLINE: Young Gains Berth in a Runoff To Run for Governor of Georgia

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 17

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia finished first today in the Democratic primary but was forced into a runoff next month with Andrew Young, the former Mayor of Atlanta who is seeking to become the state's first black governor.
Mr Miller led the five-man race, 41 to 29 percent with about three-fourths of the precincts counted.
In the Republican primary, Johnny Isakson, a Republican State Senator from the suburbs of Atlanta, declared victory and appeared to have won more than enough votes to avoid a runoff. Mr. Isakson, a 45-year-old real estate executive had about 70 percent of the vote. 
 
Tight Race for Second Place
Mr. Miller, 58, had been widely expected to finish first in the Democratic primary. Mr. Young, also 58, was in a tight race for second place with State Senator Roy Barnes, who said he would bring conservative Democrats back into the party's fold. Mr. Barnes had 21 percent of the vote.
Trailing well behind were State Representative Lauren (Bubba) McDonald and Lester Maddox, the former Democratic Governor who was a champion of segregation in the 1970's.
With the first primary all but over, Mr. Miller said voters in the Aug. 7 runoff would now have a choice between him and Mr. Young, both of whom have long records of service in elective office.
''I think our respective records will be an issue,'' he said. ''I know Andy Young is going to look at my record, and I will be looking at his.''
The early returns represented the voting from rural areas, and Mr. Young began building his lead over Mr. Barnes when vote tallies come in from heavily black urban areas.
 
Legal Challenge to Runoff
Today's primary had been under the cloud of a legal challenge of the state election laws. State Representative Tyrone Brooks, with the help of lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, sought an injunction to bar runoff elections, which are held when no candidate receives 51 percent of the vote.
Mr. Brooks had contended that the provision discriminated against black voters and black candidates. He said the system invariably favored white candidates because in a runoff, they are more likely to attract supporters of their former white opponents.
The primary campaign was largely devoid of tough issues, dominant personalities or any other sparks to heighten voter interest.
Mr. Miller, who has outspent all other candidates, called for a lottery to finance educational programs and advocated Marine-style boot camps for first-time drug offenders.
Though he built his national reputation as an advocate of civil rights and human rights, in this campaign Mr. Young has stressed his record on economic development as Mayor of Atlanta. He is also the most outspoken advocate of abortion rights in the race.
But Mr. Young's candidacy has not created the air of expectancy that many believed it would.
''This election just failed to catch fire,'' said Ed Brown, director of the Voter Education Project, a nonprofit group here that analyzes voting patterns among blacks. ''It seems that the candidates did not work hard to distinguish themselves, and so there was no real clear definition of any one candidate. Part of that was wanting to avoid negative campaigning, but it was mainly the tendency of candidates today to try to find the lowest common denominator.''

The President's English

 BODY:
President Bush greeted fellow summiteers at their meeting in Houston last week with a ringing but ungrammatical declaration that ''a new world of freedom lays before us.'' The major wire services and most newspapers - The A.P., U.P.I., Reuters, The Washington Post, Newsday and The New York Times, among others - reported it verbatim. But ''lays'' (incorrect) became ''lies'' (correct) in some other papers, including The Los Angeles Times, The Christian Science Monitor, The Washington Times and even Japan's Kyodo News Service.
It's a common problem for editors, whether to clean up a speaker's mistakes or leave them as spoken. When corrections are made, strict grammarians might hope that the speaker notices and maybe even appreciates the effort.
Not Mr. Bush. One day after he misused ''lays'' he flubbed again, with a vengeance. Presiding at dinner at Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, he greeted his guests anew: ''There is no work here tonight - no communiques, no amendments, no language to be corrected. We want you to have a very good time in this museum that we are very proudful of.'' Proudful. As in, before a fall.

HEADLINE: Head of Javits Center Says Major Expansion Is Needed

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Barely four years after its completion, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center needs to expand by as much as a third - 600,000 square feet - to remain competitive and to attract the nation's largest trade shows, the acting president of the center says.
Sol C. Chaikin, acting president and chairman of the Convention Center Operating Corporation, said in an interview that there were 14 large trade shows that the center could not handle and that centers in Las Vegas, Chicago and Atlanta had expanded or were about to undergo expansions that would make them larger than the Javits Center.
With the trade-show industry having grown at a rate of 7 percent a year in the 80's, 43 cities are building centers or expanding existing ones, said Darlene Gudea, editor and publisher of Tradeshow Week, a publication for the industry. Ms. Gudea said that last year 3.6 million square feet of exhibition space arrived on the market.
That has led at least one analyst to question whether it would be wise for New York or another city to undertake an expansion, particularly amid some uncertainty about whether the industry will continue to grow at a strong pace. 
The first call for expansion in New York was made in 1984 by Thomas F. Galvin, who was president of the Javits Center, even as the huge glass-paneled building was scrambling toward completion after what turned out to be nearly two years of delay and more than $100 million in overruns. Mr. Galvin saw a need for a 750,000-square-foot addition to the center, which with its high ceilings, several levels and 1.8 million square feet has the breadth of an airplane hangar and stretches from 34th to 38th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues. That much space would be the equivalent of five city blocks. The Cuomo administration rejected the request as premature; the center was not open, and it was badgered by controversy and red ink.
''Personally I thought it would be foolhardy after our first or second year to say we need another 300,000 or 400,000 square feet,'' Mr. Chaikin said last week. ''It just wasn't propitious. Now I think we will present a pretty strong argument for expansion.''
The proposal would have to be endorsed by the board of the Operating Corporation, a majority of whose members are appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Mr. Chaikin said he would make a presentation to the board in September or October.
The financing, which could easily surpass $100 million for a relatively modest addition, would presumably have to be in some form from the state, which spearheaded the original construction, or possibly the city, which co-sponsored a study five years ago that anticipated a probable need for expansion at some point.
A spokesman for the Governor, Gary G. Fryer, said the administration viewed the center as a success, but would have no position on an expansion until it had analyzed whatever proposal was submitted.
Mr. Chaikin, as chairman of the Operating Corporation, has been an important figure at the center for seven years. For the last year he has also been acting president. But Mr. Cuomo is expected to recommend shortly that his longtime adviser, Fabian G. Palomino, be named president.
Mr. Chaikin said the city and state should also consider building a parking lot next to the center and perhaps moderate-income housing nearby.
 
Comparisons With Expectations
The architecturally striking center, completed amid great controversy in April 1986, is still among the four largest centers in the country. Long a topic of argument, the center appears by many measures to have surpassed the expectations for it in the Environmental Impact Statement published before the Legislature approved the construction in 1979.
The statement predicted that the center would operate 220 days a year and be host to 69 to 78 trade shows, conventions and public shows. Javits officials said that the center was host to 92 trade shows and conventions in the fiscal year ending in March and that counting the days to set up and take down shows, which the organizers pay for, the center was active roughly 300 days.
The officials said that 2.8 million people visited the center in the 1989 fiscal year, compared with 1.75 million anticipated in the environmental statement and that in figures that are harder to measure the visitors directly or indirectly accounted for $6 billion in spending and $500 million in taxes last year.
After years of sizable operating deficits, the center ran close to break even last year and will not receive a state subsidy this year, although the impact statement had anticipated continuing subsidies, officials said. Mr. Chaikin said he expected that the center would meet its $486.2 million budget.
The center is enmeshed in eight suits involving contractors. It is suing one company for $50 million and is being sued by seven for a total of $60 million, according to a statement for a recent bond offering. The general counsel of the center, Morris Dershowitz, said he expected the suits to be settled eventually for far smaller amounts.
 
Across 34th Street
Mr. Chaikin said an expansion should at a minimum provide 250,000 to 400,000 additional square feet of exhibition space. The ideal place for expansion would be a 150,000-square-foot block across 34th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues that the center owns and is mostly used to park trucks, Mr. Chaikin said. Because there are train tracks on the site, the plan would need special approval, and the addition might have to be built on a platform.
A tunnel or bridge could link the addition to the center.
The size and design of the addition would determine its cost. If the current design was used, a 300,000-square-foot expansion would be likely to cost well in excess of $100 million, and an extension would probably take three years to build after being approved, Mr. Chaikin added.
Chris Yoshii, a senior associate with Economics Research Associatese of San Francisco, a real-estate consulting business specializing in public and recreational projects, cautioned that although the largest trade shows were still growing, the number of trade events and the number of attendees had flattened.
As a result, he said, the economic ripple effect, which was used to help justify building the Javits Center and others, is not as potent as it once was.
''Should New York spend hundreds of millions to expand its center for a fairly marginal increase in economic impact?'' Mr. Yoshii asked. ''You have to look at it much more carefully than you did 10 years ago. You have to ask yourself at what point to cut off the spending.''
Convention officials said that there were many shows that routinely bypassed New York because of the need for large spaces and that there were several others that would likely expand soon beyond the capacity of the Javits Center.
Mr. Chaikin said complaints over costly parking that can be as far as five blocks from the center could be solved by building a publicly controlled garage on the site of an old slaughterhouse owned by the city at 39th Street and 11th Avenue. The planners of the center specifically did not recommend that because they anticipated opposition from neighbors and environmentalists. Subsidized housing, Mr. Chaikin said, could turn the often deolate area around the center into a neighborhood.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Eastern Europeans Lack Money to Study in West

 BODY:
Thousands of Eastern European students, eager to sample the educational offerings of the West, are seeking to matriculate at American universities, according to the United States Information Agency.
In Czechoslovakia alone, 2,500 students called, wrote or lined up at the American Embassy in Prague in December, January and February to get university addresses and materials on admissions procedures, said Adeline O'Connell, a U.S.I.A. education official. Before the fall of Czechoslovakia's Communist Government, only 75 students inquired in an average three-month period about American schools.
But American college officials say they have little financial aid to offer Eastern European applicants, who are largely poor and whose money is worth little outside their countries. 
''We don't anticipate large numbers of them being able to study here until some funding is made available for them,'' said Richard Tudisco, director of the international student office at Columbia University.
 
Travel Was Limited
The Communist governments of Eastern Europe limited their citizens' opportunities to travel and study abroad. In the 1989-90 school year, 2,850 Eastern Europeans attended American universities, said Peggy Blumenthal, a vice president of the Institute of International Education, a private organization that administers exchange programs for foreign students.
Almost all those students -from Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany - were researchers with advanced degrees or were on short-term exchanges.
Now, a growing number of Eastern Europeans want to apply directly to American institutions, said Ms. O'Connell, whose agency disseminates materials on American schools to other nations.
John F. Reichard, executive vice president of the National Association for Foreign Student Affairs, a professional organization of international educators, said the students were eager to taste the freedoms of the West, to hone their skills in their fields, and eventually to use their knowledge to help their countries.
 
In Their Own Words
Zdenek Kratochvil, a student at Technical University of Prague, said he wanted to learn a Western approach to engineering and management at an American university. ''After 40 years of a command system, people know nothing of a market system here,'' said Mr. Kratochvil, who dreams of starting a business in Czechoslovakia with the assistance of a Western company.
Karoly Csete, a concierge at the Hilton Hotel in Budapest, is trying to enroll his two teen-age children in an American high school, hoping they will move on to college. The children, Judit, 16 years old, and Akos, 14, spent a year in school in Morris County, N.J., two years ago, when they stayed with Mr. Csete's sister.
''I would like to help them with their future,'' Mr. Csete said. ''This way, if they decide to leave this country, then they will have already made the first step.''
In response to student demand, the U.S.I.A. is supplementing its small advisory staffs and university-related reference materials in its Eastern European offices. In Hungary, the agency has established new information booths at the Szabo Erwin Public Library in Budapest and on five university campuses, Ms. O'Connell said. At the booths, advisers trained by the agency guide students through microfiche collections of college catalogues and point them toward books that evaluate American universities.
 
Ministries Get Information
The agency also plans to open an educational exchange office in Poland and has given reference books on American colleges to education ministries in Czechoslovakia.
Agency officials stress that American higher education is expensive and that the schools, trying hard to find financial aid for American students, have few resources to offer foreign applicants.
Robin Lewis, associate dean of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia, says American universities have had little time to devise ways to help Eastern European students. ''The events in Eastern Europe happened so fast that nothing is really in place, except Band-Aid measures,'' he said.
Indeed, though Mr. Kratochvil has compiled a list of schools he plans to apply to, he knows that little financial aid is available. ''You can't pay for studies there, and you can't get a scholarship,'' he said.
 
Some Aid From Congress
Last November, Congress approved $10 million in scholarships over three years for Polish and Hungarian students who want to study in the United States, said Jonathan Stein, chief foreign policy adviser to Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who sponsored the bill. But Mr. Stein conceded that it was ''not very much'' - enough to assist only 350 to 450 students on short-term stays. He said Congress was discussing additional legislation to assist other Eastern European students.
One promising opening is Harvard, which does not limit the amount spent on foreign students, said William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. Mr. Fitzsimmons said the university was relying on alumni in Eastern Europe to tell potential students of Harvard's eagerness to admit more Eastern Europeans.
''It's one thing for our students to read about what's going on in East Germany,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said, ''but it's another thing to go to classes with someone who has lived through it.''
Other than Harvard and a few other schools with large endowments, most universities will have difficulty finding additional financial aid for Eastern European students. It is a case, some educators say, of economics taking priority over idealism.
''It sounds like it's enterprise and commerce rather than education,'' said Mr. Reichard, of the National Association for Foreign Student Affairs, ''but in part it's reality.''

HEADLINE: Subsidies for Artists: Is Denying a Grant Really Censorship?

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Visitors to the benefit performance staged the other night for the Franklin Furnace, an avant-garde performance space in the TriBeCa section of Manhattan, heard angry protesters warn against what they perceived as Government censorship of the arts.
''We are in a dead-end totalitarian ecological trap,'' the poet Allen Ginsberg said in a telephone call to the benefit, which was held at the Public Theater. The painter Nancy Spero took the stage and said, ''Little by little our rights are being taken away.'' Earlier in the day, Karen Finley, one of several solo performance artists turned down for grants by the beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts this year, told a press conference, ''A year ago I was in a country of free expression; now I am not.''
That night, performing along with Eric Bogosian, Annie Sprinkle, Reno and others at the Franklin Furnace benefit, Ms. Finley chanted a poem in which she talked about how ''they'' -meaning the enemies of free expression - were ripping off her body parts, tearing out her tongue, cutting off her feet, gouging out her heart. 
Is there truth to the charges being made by Ms. Finley and many others these days that ''censorship'' and ''repression'' are taking place?
The charge comes out of the campaign against the endowment being led by conservative and religious groups and their backers in Congress, notably Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who have complained that the endowment has supported artists whose work they deemed to be harmful or obscene.
 
New Cutbacks Feared
When the endowment chairman, John E. Frohnmayer, apparently bowing to conservative pressures, vetoed grants that would otherwise have been given to several controversial performers, including Ms. Finley, many artists and others saw the move not only as censorship but also as a precursor of further efforts to stamp out other expression that the conservatives find disagreeable.
But while it is easy to understand why individuals like Ms. Finley might be angry and upset, are their claims of censorship accurate? And beyond that, are they correct in assessing a new censorious mood in the air, an atmosphere of repression?
It would seem to be one thing to deny some artists Federal funds on the ground that what they do is offensive to some taxpayers, and another to deprive them of their freedom of expression. Ms. Finley, for example, who often performs nude and symbolically defaces her body as a way of protesting the treatment of women in male-dominated society, is scheduled to present two virtually sold-out shows at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun Festival in a few days, so she has hardly been silenced.
Opponents of the arts endowment have asserted over and over that their sole concern is Government subsidies of art that they find morally offensive; there is nothing stopping people from performing whatever they want to perform, they say, as long as it does not come at taxpayers' expense.
 
'Simply Ridiculous'
''The truth is that artists in this country today enjoy a greater degree of freedom of expression than artists have enjoyed in any known civilization in the past, and to confuse the rejection of a grant application with some kind of categorical threat to freedom of expression is simply ridiculous,'' Hilton Kramer, editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of cultural criticism, said in a telephone interview.
Many clearly feel differently about the matter.
''There's no genuine repression yet, but there are little brush fires that are happening at the same time,'' Joseph Papp, the producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Papp mentioned as important parts of a larger pattern the prosecution in Florida of the rap group the 2 Live Crew on obscenity charges and the indictment of the director of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati for mounting an exhibition of the works of the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, one of the artists whose work has been under attack by conservative groups.
''It's a serious thing when people are arrested and charged,'' Mr. Papp said. ''This is where the weather vane could be pointing.''
In many ways, the debate concerns some basic questions regarding Government support of the arts. What exactly is censorship in a country where freedom is more than theoretical but where the Government over the last quarter of a century has become a supporter of many kinds of artistic activity, including some experimental forms like performance art?
''Once you get Government involved in the arts, then withholding money has a kind of punitive effect,'' the novelist John Updike said in a telephone interview. ''So in this manner I can see a certain number of our artists being shaped to please our Government, to please Jesse Helms. A kind of insidious Government control could be exerted.''
 
The Focus: Motives
Here, to a great extent, the debate centers on motives. Defenders of Mr. Frohnmayer's right to deny grants, even grants recommended by the endowment's peer review panels, see not censorship, but a clash of two sincerely held points of view - the artists on one side and conservative groups on the other.
Jacob Neusner, a professor of Jewish history at Southern Florida University who is a member of the endowment's main advisory committee, the National Council on the Arts, cites the ''profoundly symbolic'' nature of Federal support. ''This is the Government saying, 'We approve or disapprove a certain kind of art,' '' he said in a telephone interview.
''I don't think anybody has told artists what they may or may not do,'' Mr. Neusner added. ''What they've been told is that an advisory council and an endowment chairman do not want to support their art.''
The issue of motives can be seen in the fears of some that the anti-endowment forces have broader goals than they have stated. These supporters of subsidies think that the success of conservatives in changing the way the endowment functions and forcing it in essence to take money away from controversial artists reflects a political power held by these groups that they will continue to use, whether taxpayers' money is involved or not.
Martha Wilson, the director of Franklin Furnace, said that the General Accounting Office, acting on a demand by Senator Helms, had asked to examine her records. The G.A.O. wants to see when and how often four specific artists have performed at Franklin Furnace, she said, citing the move as an illustration of what she sees as a growing atmosphere of repression.
 
The 'Wrong' Stuff
The four artists - Ms. Finley, Serri Gaulke, Frank Moore and Johanna Went - are all described by Ms. Wilson as artists who ''use nudity, religious imagery, bodily fluids and references to sex and violence, all the stuff that's supposed to be wrong.''
''They're trying to starve organizations and artists that have unwanted ideas,'' Ms. Wilson said.
The debate over whether censorship is taking place has intensified as the issue of whether to extend the life of the endowment or eliminate it altogether, along with all Federal aid to the arts, is scheduled to come before Congress in the days ahead. Both the House and the Senate are considering bills that would continue the agency without any of the restrictions on artistic content that have been demanded by conservatives. In recent weeks, however, individual Congressmen have expressed little confidence that the legislation will pass without bans on some of the programs supported by the agency in the past.
Another issue in the debate concerns whether public money should as a matter of right go to artists whose goal is to shock and disturb the public, to attack its conventions and assumptions, to disturb it.
''It's now regarded as an entitlement,'' Mr. Kramer of The New Criterion said of Government support of the arts. ''It's precisely the idea that if you received a grant in the past, you have an entitlement to it in the future.'' Mr. Kramer said that members of the avant-garde were behaving like officially approved academic artists of decades past in Europe in looking to the Government for support. At its origins in Europe, Mr. Kramer said, the avant-garde was a rebellion against the state-supported artistic establishment.
 
The Fringe in Europe
Indeed, it seems undeniable that the fringe movements of the past -the ''Independents'' in France and the ''secessionists'' in Central Europe, both of which were essential to the formation of the concept of artistic experimentation - flourished in part because they rejected the state-supported establishment.
Those who advocate endowment grants to avant-garde artists say that times have changed. Once the Government decides to give money for the arts, they maintain, avant-garde artists are as entitled to it as anybody else, and to deny it to them because they express themselves strongly or unconventionally is a form of censorship.
''These artists are saying, 'We're part of the culture too,' '' Ms. Wilson of Franklin Furnace said.
Moreover, these advocates say, the ability of conservative groups to pressure the endowment into denying grants it would otherwise have approved will have a chilling effect on the willingness of artists to be bold or different. Denying grants to the boldest and most outrageous of artists does not limit their freedom of expression, they argue, but, given the economic precariousness of life on the artistic fringes, it will have the practical effect of censorship.
Wendy W. Luers, a member of the National Council on the Arts, the endowment's governing board, said: ''In and of itself, not granting taxpayers' money cannot broadly be called censorship, but it is only a beginning and a clear beginning. This is because the private sector uses the imprimatur of the N.E.A. to determine how they give. If the N.E.A. decides not to give to a certain kind of art, then the private sector is going to follow suit.''

A Soldier Who Supported New Deal Social Change

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

General of the Army
George C. Marshall, Soldier and Statesman
By Ed Cray
847 pages. Illustrated. W. W. Norton. $35.
In the early 1930's, Lieut. Col. George C. Marshall helped to set up dozens of Civilian Conservation Corps camps for the unemployed, one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's pioneering New Deal programs intended to pull the country out of the Depression. The Labor Department recruited the volunteers, the Agriculture and Interior Departments supervised the actual work and the Army trained them. They planted millions of trees for soil conservation, built fire breaks, cleaned streams and beaches, constructed small reservoirs and dams, refurbished roads, bridges and trails in national parks. 
Marshall threw himself into the work enthusiastically. He publicly praised the C.C.C., saying that it was ''the greatest social experiment outside of Russia.'' He found the experience personally rewarding because he saw malnourished, often sullen young men regain confidence and health, enter remedial educational programs and, at the same time, help to rebuild the country. But always the professional soldier, he also considered the corps ''a splendid experience for the War Department and the Army.''
His C.C.C. background and enthusiasm for a socially oriented New Deal program are among the facts about George C. Marshall's career that come to light in Ed Cray's ''General of the Army,'' a solid and readable biography that goes well beyond Marshall's familiar role as Army chief of staff during World War II and architect of the European Recovery Program, a plan that became known by his name and won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.
Mr. Cray's book is also valuable as a survey of a large chunk of 20th-century history. The future five-star general served with the American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I; he helped direct the buildup of the armed forces under Roosevelt's direction; as Ambassador to China, he negotiated a military truce for President Harry S. Truman between the Communists and the Kuomintang; then, as Secretary of State, he developed the Marshall Plan.
On the eve of World War II, 33 generals outranked Marshall, who was a brigadier general, but Roosevelt jumped over them and selected him to be the Army's chief of staff. Their respect for each other's strengths grew during the war. As chief of staff, Marshall also chose talent over seniority when it came to promotions, most famously in his choice of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to lead the American forces in the invasion of North Africa and then as the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. It was a role Marshall coveted for himself, but running a worldwide war in the European, Pacific and China-Burma-India theaters made him too important in Washington.
On the most controversial decision of World War II, dropping the atomic bomb on Japan, Mr. Cray writes that the chief of staff was ''plainly disturbed.'' On purely military grounds, he favored use of the nuclear weapon to shorten the war, but at the same time recognized what he called ''primordial considerations.'' He told John J. McCloy, Assistant Secretary of War, ''Don't ask me to make that decision.''
Marshall said he thought the A-bomb should first be used against a straight military objective, like a naval installation, and then perhaps against a large manufacturing area from which the people would be forewarned to leave. In the end, he went along with Truman and other military and civilian decisionmakers. But the fact that he hesitated and sought alternatives reveals as much as anything in this biography about Marshall's decency and vision.
Many political incidents are recalled in the book. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, who gave his name to one of the worst American isms of modern times, accused Secretary of State Marshall of harboring Communists and branded him a traitor. The author also writes of the dismissal of Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur for insubordination during the Korean War while Marshall briefly served as Secretary of Defense. Marshall urged caution, believing dismissal would encourage the political right in the country, but then agreed with Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that MacArthur had disobeyed their orders and undermined peace efforts.
In his well-researched book, Mr. Cray notes that Senator Richard M. Nixon of California said, ''The happiest group in the country over General MacArthur's removal will be the Communists and their stooges.'' Afterward, and to this day, Marshall's stature soared while his political adversaries stumbled in public esteem.
What made George Catlett Marshall, a military man all his life, develop into a civilian statesman? Truman said he was the greatest living American. Discussing his role in World War II, Winston S. Churchill called him the greatest Roman of them all.
In ''General of the Army,'' the author sings Marshall's praises, too, but like previous biographers he finds it difficult to explain the why of the personality behind the austere facade. Still, it is hard to disagree with his interpretation of Marshall as an idealist, with a pragmatic recognition of geopolitical realities: ''Two world wars - he had fought in one and led the second -had served to tamp down the idealism, but never quite extinguish it.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Increases Modestly

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit rose modestly in May, to $7.73 billion, fueled by the economy's heavy reliance on oil imports and foreign automobiles, the Commerce Department reported today.
Analysts and economists said, however, that the deficit, up 5.8 percent from a revised April figure of $7.31 billion, also showed a healthy growth in exports, particularly in manufactured goods.
''Export growth is keeping us out of a recession,'' said Stephen Cooney, director of international investment at the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group based in Washington. ''As domestic growth continues, imports will also continue to grow, though slower than exports.'' 
 
Oil Imports Show Jump
Exports rose 2.3 percent from April, to $32.79 billion, their second-best showing since March, when they totaled $33.27 billion. But the gain in May was offset by a 2.9 percent increase in imports, to $40.52 billion. That increase came primarily from a precipitous jump in oil imports.
The figures also reflected a significant decrease in May of imports from Japan and a large increase in imports from Canada.
Bush Administration officials said the latest figures were evidence that the nation's trade performance would continue to improve through the end of the year. ''While month-to-month figures can swing significantly, the deficit for the first five months of 1990 is almost $6 billion less than last year,'' Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said. ''We see strong improvements with all the non-oil-producing market economies.''
The growth in exports reflected greater shipments in a wide array of items, including automotive parts, capital goods and consumer products.
But some analysts continue to voice concern that the nation's growing reliance on foreign oil could cut into any expansion in exports. Oil imports rose 15.2 percent in May, to $4.32 billion. Since the beginning of the year, oil imports have risen 21 percent, at $23.39 billion, over the comparable period in 1989.
The May increase in the consumption of foreign oil was encouraged by a declining price per barrel of $1, to $15.57. The volume of shipments rose to 8.95 million barrels a day, up from 7.55 million barrels in April.
Shipments of imported cars were up 5.2 percent in May, to $3.88 billion, largely from Canada and other countries, while imports from Japan fell by $854 million, to $6.7 billion.
The figures reflected a decline in imports from Japan of cars, telecommunications equipment and consumer items and resulted in the lowest monthly trade deficit with Japan since January, when the United States posted a deficit of $2.85 billion.
More than 40 percent of the total trade deficit in May was with Japan, but the imbalance between the two nations shrank by more than $1 billion, to $2.96 billion, from a revised April figure of $3.95 billion. The declining imbalance with Japan was due to a modest rise in exports and a substantial drop in imports.
Over the first five months of this year, the trade deficit, on a seasonally adjusted basis, dropped to $40.7 billion from the $46.4 billion in the comparable 1989 period and $49.8 billion in 1988, according to Commerce Department calculations. At the current rate, the 1990 deficit would be almost $98 billion, down from the $109.4 billion imbalance last year.
The trade balance with the United States' largest trading partner, Canada, moved from a surplus in April of $42 million to a deficit in May of $564 million. The change was fueled by a $1.15 billion rise in imports from Canada.
The United States continued to record a surplus with the European Community in May, although the surplus shrank in May to $811 million, from $1.43 billion in April, largely because of a decline in exports.
A surplus of $69 million was also posted in May with Mexico, compared with a deficit in April of $143 million. The two nations have agreed to negotiate a free-trade pact.
With China, the deficit widened from $614 million to $777 million.

HEADLINE: Savings Crime Bill Is Proposed

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Democrats in the House of Representatives will propose a savings and loan enforcement package on Wednesday that will include a bipartisan national commission to examine the roots of one the nation's worst financial crisis as well as new legal weapons to fight crime in the savings and loan industry, Congressional aides said today.
Absent from the package, an amalgam of Democratic and Republican recommendations, are some of the far-reaching proposals tossed up in recent days as Democrats and Republicans hammered at each other in a heated debate over the blame for the crisis. The Democrats are apparently trying to incorporate Republican suggestions to achieve some cooperation to increase the chances for passage of the legislation.
 
Serious, Not Partisan
''We are trying to find out in a serious and not partisan way what really happened, and if Government is doing all it can to prevent it from happening again,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of a House Judiciary subcomittee that is preparing the savings and loan legislation. 
Some of the most hotly debated Democratic suggestions, like measures to reorganize the Justice Department to create a financial crimes division and a plan to enlist the Secret Service in the savings and loan investigations, were omitted.
Some proposals, like the commission, were originally suggested in slightly different forms by Republicans. Chalmers P. Wylie, an Ohio Republican who brought the commission idea forward, said, ''I think the political rhetoric can be laid aside, if it's not reported out just as a Democratic proposal.''
 
To Uncover Crimes
Mr. Schumer, who declined to discuss the details of the package, said the bill was intended to ''make sure that those who committed crimes can't conceal them and keep their misgotten gains.''
Several specific provisions are intended to give prosecutors and bank regulators broader enforcement powers in future cases. Among them are measures that make it a crime for the accountants of savings and loan associations to fail to report instances of wrongdoing; that increase criminal penalties against savings and loan officials who provide false information to bank examiners, and that allow bank regulators to nullify ''golden parachute'' payments to departing executives of failing savings units.
The legislation, to be attached to a crime bill under consideration in the House, differs in some important respects from the Senate's savings and loan package, which passed last week in a 99-to-1 vote.
The Senate bill, for example, does not provide for the 12-member financial crimes commission, which would be empowered to request documents from the Administration and question witnesses under oath. Under the proposal, the Administration, the House and the Senate would each appoint four members to the panel.
The Bush Administration has opposed any such commission as an unncessary duplication. ''It would potentially restrict our flexibility and micromanage the Administration's investigative and prosecutive responsibilities,'' an Administration official said today.
 
Like the Warren Commission
As envisioned by members of Congress, the commission would operate like the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But in addition to assessing the savings and loan debacle, the financial crimes commission would monitor current efforts of bank regulators and prosecutors, as well as recommend changes in laws, regulations or procedures.
The House package would also authorize a doubling of the annual spending for additional Federal investigators and prosecutors from $75 million to $150 million, and could go higher than that, aides said. The Senate approved $162.5 million for additional personnel. The Administration has proposed spending $100 million, but Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has said the Justice Department could use additional funds without specifying an exact amount.
The Senate's savings and loan package includes several provisions stiffening prison sentences and closing loopholes against financial fraud. The Senate package would increase the maximum penalty for bank fraud to 30 years and permit life imprisonment for people who are convicted of defrauding savings institutions of large sums of money.
House Democrats are racing against the Congressional calendar to complete the legislation. The Judiciary Committee is expected to complete action on the package by the end of the week, hoping for a vote on the legislation before the adjournment late this month or early next month. Some members have said they hope to present President Bush with a bill by mid-August.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes Import Curbs On Apparel but Veto Looms

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
The Senate, by a vote of 68 to 32, approved legislation today to curb imports of textiles and apparel.
But two similar efforts to legislate quotas in the last five years failed when President Ronald Reagan vetoed them and the vetoes were sustained. The Bush Administration has signaled its own veto intentions, leading many analysts to predict the same fate for the Textile, Apparel and Footwear Trade Act of 1990.
The analysts saw today's action as a way for Senators to show support for the domestic mills and labor unions that have been lobbying hard for the bill without fear of broader consequences, since expectations of enactment are low. 
Also working against the bill's chances is a crack in the once solid coalition that had supported textile quota bills in the past.
An apparel trade association representing two-thirds of domestic production, the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, announced it was not supporting the bill. Nor is it opposing it.
''Our people simply felt that in global trade talks now under way the Administration is moving in a direction that they could accept,'' said Stewart Boswell, the association's president.
He characterized the group as being ''on the sidelines,'' and said it wanted to ''see more clearly what emerged from the Uruguay Round'' of trade liberalization talks being held among 106 nations before taking a position.
Linda J. Wachner, president and chief executive of Warnaco Inc., a big apparel maker, said that ''a lot of people have to import fabrics that are innovative and that are not available in the U.S., such as yarn-died cotton for fine-count cotton and blended shirts.''
She said the bill would ''hurt the availability of innovative consumer products that Warnaco manufactures offshore and onshore.''
But backers of the measure, which would limit the annual import growth of textiles to 1 percent and would freeze imports of nonrubber footwear at 1989 levels, described it as essential for the survival of the industry.
''If at the end of the century we have no textile industry left,'' said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, ''don't blame it on the loss of productivity of our workers. Blame it on the lack of political productivity in this country.'' In Mr. Hollings's state, one out of seven people work in textile-related industries.
Opponents, chiefly from more export-oriented regions like the Northwest, warned that the bill would force consumers to pay billions of dollars more in clothing costs and would violate international trade obligations.
 
'It's a Turkey'
''This bill is worse than bad, it's a turkey,'' said Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, which exports electronics, machinery and other products that could be affected by foreign retaliation against American protectionism.
In a study for the Institute of International Economics, William R. Cline, an economist, placed the consumer costs of the legislation at $4.96 billion by 1992, rising to $48.48 billion annually by the year 2000.
Amendments from two Republican Senators, Phil Gramm of Texas, and Pete Wilson of California, would have jettisoned the restrictionist provisions if consumer costs rose above certain limits. They were overwhelmingly rejected during debate on the bill, which began last Thursday.
 
Outlook Clouded in House
Prospects for a similar measure in the House are clouded. The Ways and Means Committee has jurisdiction over trade matters, and neither Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman, or Sam Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the trade subcommittee, have expressed enthusiasm for the legislation. No hearings have yet been scheduled.
Carlos Moore, executive vice president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, which represents three-quarters of the textile industry, acknowledged that the apparel group's position was ''a disappointment.'' But he said it was ''not a major stumbling block because we have the support of other associations.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Does Gorbachev Know Best?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SUPPOSE Mikhail Gorbachev threw a free-market party and nobody wanted to dance?
Soviet leaders make no secret of their worry that people reared in a socialist cocoon would be unable to adjust to the rough and tumble of open competition. Indeed, many apparently fear that the proletariat would take to the barricades before accepting the loss of guaranteed employment and cheap bread, or tolerating the rise of self-made millionaires in their midst.
But pathbreaking survey research by Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale and expert on the psychological underpinnings of economic behavior, suggests that the Kremlin is behind the times: Not only did Mr. Shiller discover that Muscovites were reasonably open to capitalism, but also, the survey shows, in some ways they were more open than their counterparts in New York. 
The research, done with a Soviet economist, Maksim Boiko, and a Soviet sociologist, Vladimir Korobov, and being presented today at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference in Cambridge, Mass., will not be easy to brush aside. Like a few other pioneering analysts, Mr. Shiller has used opinion polling to gauge Soviet resistance to capitalist ideas. But unlike others, he has created a controlled scientific experiment, asking the same questions of Soviet and American citizens, and comparing their responses.
The telephone survey, conducted in May, covered some 360 people in each country with similar age, sex, employment and education profiles. The poll included 36 questions crafted to minimize spurious differences linked to language or culture. A few of the questions explored attitudes toward capitalist institutions head on - i.e., ''What inheritance tax rate for really wealthy people do you think we should have?'' A few asked about current behavior: ''Did you save any money from the income you earned last year?'' But most set up hypothetical situations and asked individuals how they would react, or whether a given result was fair.
One question, for example, asked whether they would accept a 10 percent increase in working hours in return for a 10 percent pay increase. Another asked whether they would charge market-rate interest to a friend who needed a six-month loan to buy a summer house. Yet another asked whether it was fair for a furniture factory to raise the $200 price of kitchen tables by $20 if it could not meet demand at the current price.
In a few cases, responses divided along the anticipated ideological fault lines. Soviet respondents were generally more suspicious of business success: Some 54 percent agreed that ''people who try to make a lot of money will often turn out to be not very honest,'' compared with just 37 percent of the Americans. And Soviet answers showed more reluctance to mix arm's-length business with friendship. Fives times as many Americans (though still a minority) would charge interest on the summer house loan.
In most cases, though, Soviet and American attitudes were quite similar. Roughly the same proportion would be ''tempted to invest a substantial portion of their savings'' in a risky enterprise that might make them rich. Nearly identical percentages thought it fair to buy vegetables from farmers and resell them in the city at a large profit. Most Soviet respondents (64 percent) thought it unfair to raise the price of those scarce kitchen tables - but so, too, did a majority (70 percent) of Americans.
Some answers suggested that Russians are actually more willing capitalist tools than Americans. Just two-thirds as many Soviet people believed that speculation would cause more frequent shortages of bread. More Soviet respondents (49 percent versus 30 percent) would be willing to tolerate the tripling of incomes for a lucky minority to gain a 1 percent increase for everyone else. And a higher percentage in Moscow were ready to tolerate 30 percent inflation as long as their own incomes rose by more.
The survey results may not be entirely representative of attitudes in the two countries. Muscovites with sufficient clout to rate working telephones may be relatively confident they would emerge as winners in the capitalist lottery. New Yorkers, inured to rent control, may be less market-oriented than other Americans.
But such considerations hardly explain away this striking research. At the very least, the results shift the burden of proof to those who view this generation in the Soviet Union as inflexible followers of the socialist god who failed.
An obvious question, then, is why Robert Shiller seems to know better than Mikhail Gorbachev -why the Kremlin is so reluctant to ask people to take a chance on another economic revolution. The good Marxist answer is that the primary beneficiaries of the old system can hardly be expected to remain in the vanguard of change for very long.

HEADLINE: World Bank Considers Loan Charge Reduction

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
World Bank officials announced yesterday that the the bank's net income topped $1 billion in 1990, for the sixth year in a row, and that the institution would now consider reducing its borrowers' costs.
Officials said discussions were likely to begin by the end of the summer on reducing the bank's loan charges. The bank now charges countries 50 basis points over its cost of borrowing. If approved by the board of the bank, the largest provider of aid to third-world countries, it would be the first cut in the bank's 50-basis-point charge on loans. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
No formal proposal has been made. But at a news conference in New York, officials said that with a continuing net income of $1 billion, about $300 million was left over after the bank set aside money to keep its ratio of reserves for bad loans to about 11 percent. A reduction of 10 basis points would cost the bank about $90 million in net income each year, officials said.
Officials said that an opportunity to reduce costs to borrowers was at hand because the bank had reached its goal of raising reserves to 11 percent of its outstanding loans, which total about $89 billion. The level of reserves rose in the fiscal year 1990, which ended June 30, to 10.8 percent from 10.2 percent.
''We are not a profit-maximizing institution,'' said Ernest Stern, senior vice president for finance, in explaining the proposal.
''Our costs impact very directly on our own members,'' he said, and ''our objective is to keep those as low as possible, consistent with income necessary to build and maintain adequate reserves and a strong financial position.''
Mr. Stern would not predict whether the board would approve a reduction in the spread, or how soon it might do so. He said some bank members were likely to propose using the extra income for other purposes, like contributions to its global environmental fund.
But he said he expected that over the next five years, if the bank's income consistently remains above $1 bllion, there wll be some reduction in the 50-basis-point spread. Though he would not guess at the size of the reduction, he did say that a reduction of 20 basis points, which would reduce income by about $180 million, is a ''little optimistic right now.''
In the fiscal year 1990, the bank board approved a reduction in the commitment fee for loans approved but not yet disbursed. The fee was reduced to 25 basis points from 75. The commitment fee reduction has been continued into 1991.
Income for fiscal year 1990, which ended June 30, was $1.046 billion, down slightly from the $1.094 billion of 1989. Income was reduced by several charges, including $150 million for the reduction in the commitment fee.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Rises 0.4% On Auto and Utility Strength

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
A spurt in automobile production and a heat wave that increased utility output pushed industrial production up four-tenths of a percent in June, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Last month's gain, which followed a rise of six-tenths of a percent in May, surprised analysts who had expected a more modest increase.
The June increase helped push industrial production for the second quarter up by an annual rate of 3.5 percent, a significant gain over the six-tenths of a percent annual rate of increase in the first quarter. 
 
Temporary Factors
Private analysts cautioned that the upturn was likely related to temporary factors rather than any long-term comeback in the nation's manufacturing sector, which has been in a slump for months.
The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities, which usually move in tandem with industrial production, rose two-tenths of a percentage point, to 83.5 percent of capacity, in June. The June operating rate was the highest since December's 83.7 percent, but it was still well below the level a year ago when the industrial sector was operating at 84.6 percent of capacity.
The operating rate measures output and changes in productivity levels.
Analysts attributed much of the recent strength in auto production to the likelihood that some auto makers have been building up inventories in preparation for a possible walkout in September by the United Automobile Workers union.
''Manufacturing is not booming; it's struggling,'' said Cynthia Latta of DRI/McGraw Hill, a financial data service in Englewood, Colo. ''But since output does seem to be expanding slightly, it has to be viewed as a relatively good report.''
The Fed said that the increases in automobile production and utility output accounted for three-fourths of the total June increase.
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose five-tenths of a percent in June, after increasing eigth-tenths of a percent in May.
Output of durable goods - items expected to last at least three years - also increased five-tenths of a percent after a jump of 1.3 percent a month earlier. Manufacturing of nondurable goods - items like food and clothing - was up four-tenths of a percent, after a one-tenth of a percent increase in May.
The Fed said its industrial production index in June stood at 109.8 percent of its 1987 base, up from 109.3 in May.

HEADLINE: Computer Screen Dumping Charged

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Frustrated by what they say are the unfair pricing practices of eight major Japanese electronics companies, a small group of American makers of flat screens used in advanced portable computers filed an anti-dumping petition yesterday, calling for an investigation by the United States Government.
The screens, known as flat panel displays, have increased in sales dramatically in recent years as portable computers have gained in popularity - 750,000 laptop computers were sold in the United States last year. The flat panels, made with a lithographic process similar to that used to manufacture semiconductor chips, are lightweight and consume far less power than bulkier monitors using cathode-ray tubes. 
The petition, which was filed with the Commerce Department and United States Trade Commission, charges Japanese makers with selling products at as much as 71 percent less than manufacturing cost. If a Government investigation makes a final determination that dumping has taken place and that it is injuring American industry, significant duties could be placed on the Japanese producers. Dumping is the sale of imports at less than the cost to produce them.
The use of the advanced flat panel displays is making rapid progress. Portions of computers are expected to be integrated directly into the circuitry of the flat panel displays, and advanced television sets may also use the panels.
 
Unable to Meet Competition
But the United States manufacturers producing such displays are small high-technology concerns that account for little more than $50 million in sales, and they said yesterday that they were increasingly unable to meet aggressive Japanese competition.
Last year, the executive vice president of Toshiba, Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, was quoted in the Japan Economic Journal as having said, ''We are prepared to accept red ink for the first five to six years.''
And that prospect is what is upsetting the American companies, said Curtis M. Stevens, vice president for finance at Planar Systems Inc., a maker of flat panel displays in Beaverton, Ore.
Mr. Stevens said the most blatant example of Japanese dumping practices was the flat panel display used in a new portable from Apple Computer Inc. The Apple flat panel, manufactured by the Hosiden Electronics Company, is based on a technology known as thin-film transistor active matrix, which employs a transistor to control each separate picture element in the display. In the complaint filed yesterday, Hosiden is charged with selling a product in the United States at about a third of its manufacturing cost, but the Apple product is not mentioned by name.
The anti-dumping complaint was filed by eight United States manufacturers - the Cherry Display Products Corporation, the Coloray Corporation, Electro Plasma, the Magnascreen Corporation, Ovonics Imaging Systems Inc., Photonics Technology Inc., Planar Systems and Plasmaco Inc. The companies have banded together in a trade association called the Advanced Display Manufacturers of America.
The Japanese display manufacturers are Sharp, Hitachi, Toshiba, NEC, Mitsubishi, Hosiden, Matsushita and Sanyo. I.B.M.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Campaigns For Children Criticized

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
IN a wide-ranging attack on how some of the best-known American corporations market to young children, Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, released a study yesterday detailing what it denounced as increasingly pervasive and hidden advertising to ''America's most vulnerable consumers.''
Charlotte Baecher, the director of education services for Consumers Union, said young children, especially pre-teen-agers, were especially susceptible to sophisticated marketing techniques because they were not yet able to critically assess advertising claims.
The marketing was so pervasive and frequent, she said, that it was, in effect, ''brainwashing and not advertising.''
In response, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which represents agencies that produce and run 80 percent of the nation's television and print advertising, said the industry was sensitive to children as ''a special audience.'' The group's children's advertsing review unit, established in 1974, had persuaded companies to modify or discontinue 270 commercials that had the potential for misleading or confusing children. 
Harold A. Shoup, executive vice president of the group known as the Four A's, said, however, that ''in terms of children's vulnerabilty, children are a lot more discerning than people give them credit for.'' He said the controversy was not new. ''I remember pestering my mother for a Red Ryder BB gun,'' he said, referring to a widely advertised cowboy hero of the 1940's.
At stake in the pre-teen-age market is what Consumers Union estimates is $8 billion a year in sales, the amount spent by children and their parents on snack foods, candy, toys, games, clothes, movies, game arcades and other products and services.
In yesterday's study, Consumers Union was particularly critical of so-called educational materials provided to schools and ''advertorials,'' or advertisements made to resemble editorial matter, contained in children's or teen-agers' magazines.
It also attacked ''kids' clubs,'' or advertiser-sponsored clubs that provide discount product coupons; celebrity endorsements; paid placement of brand-name products, including cigarettes and alcoholic beverages, in movies and the proliferating licensing of toys, lunchboxes and other products.
Consumers Union, a group that attempts to assess advertiser and product claims in its magazine Consumer Reports, called for school districts to declare schools ''ad-free zones'' and to teach children about the biases in advertising. It also urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate new curbs on ''kids' clubs'' and Congress to pass legislation banning tobacco and liquor companies from paying to display their products in movies.
Consumers Union sharply attacked instructional materials or other incentives from corporations given to often financially pressed school districts or directly to teachers interested in widening sparsely financed curriculums.
The Nutrasweet Company, for example, has since 1986 provided a ''Total Health'' nutrition publication for use in home economics classes in high schools. The corporate objective, said Rich Nelson, a spokesman, is to bring ''better food choices to consumers.''
But the materials only mention Nutrasweet as an alternative sweetener to sugar, not its competitor saccharin. The materials also do not mention the health warning to phenylketonurics, who have a rare and serious enzymatic disorder that would be aggravated by using Nutrasweet. ''By the time they reach high school, phenylketonurics know they have the disorder,'' Mr. Nelson said.
In a 16-year-old program in which thousands of schools participate, the Campbell Soup Company buys gymnasium equipment, computers, and even vans for schools in exchange for labels from Campbell soup cans.
''We do not encourage or discourage students to buy Campbell Soup,'' said Kevin G. Lowery, a spokesman, but he noted that most labels were from products that students' families have already purchased. ''But we're not ashamed of what we're doing. We want people to know who is making this possible.''
Similarly, the Coca-Cola Company and its affiliated bottlers will buy football scoreboards for schools in exchange for providing a soft drink vending machine. ''If parents and teachers didn't want our support,'' said Robert Bertini, a spokesman, ''we wouldn't be there.''
Consumers Union also denounced advertorials, and singled out an advertisement by EPI Products USA Inc., maker of Epilady, a woman's hair removal system. The ad, which was labeled as such, ran in January through April of this year in Seventeen magazine. It is in the format of an editorial advice column called ''Ask Loren,'' with a smaller headline saying ''Your Personal Answers to Questions About Make-up & Fashion.'' Only company products are mentioned in the column.
An EPI Products spokeswoman, Susanna Wilson, said ''Loren,'' the advice columnist, received 400 letters a month and that she had answered each one.
In a statement, Ed Gottlieb, EPI Products' director of advertising and marketing, said, ''It is an advertisement disguised as advice column, but we call it educational advertising.''

HEADLINE: Tartikoff Gets Promotion In a Realignment at NBC

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 17

 BODY:
NBC announced today that Brandon Tartikoff, the longtime president of its entertainment division, had been elevated to the new position of chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group.
Warren Littlefield, executive vice president of prime-time programs for NBC, will become president of entertainment. The realignment was announced at a news conference by Robert C. Wright, NBC's president. The NBC programming department is based in Los Angeles. 
Mr. Tartikoff's main new duties will involve generating more economically sound programming owned by NBC and its ventures. He already leads two divisions devoted to creating programs, NBC Productions and a program development group that is a special committee of the leaders of NBC's stations and its news and sports divisions.
''The idea of dabbling with the news department, or the sports department, or even the owned stations is no longer a dabble,'' Mr. Tartikoff said. ''It's essential that those divisions provide us with programming.''
 
Unusual New Structure
Mr. Littlefield, 38 years old, will continue to report to Mr. Tartikoff, which gives NBC a management structure in its entertainment division unlike any other in television. Neither ABC nor CBS has such a position.
Mr. Tartikoff, 41, has served as the chief programming executive for NBC for more than 10 years, longer than any other television executive.
But he said in an interview that the shift does not signal the end of the Tartikoff era, during which the network surged to leadership in television's prime-time programming. Two programs selected by Mr. Tartikoff, ''Cheers'' and ''The Cosby Show,'' were instrumental in the network's success. ''It's still a little early to be talking about ends of eras,'' he said.
But Mr. Tartikoff said he had not extended his contract with NBC, which has less than two years to run.
He cited two reasons for the moves: the need to create new opportunities for Mr. Littlefield and the program executives under him, and the necessity for NBC to respond to changes that have threatened the survival of network television.
Mr. Littlefield's contract would have expired next month. He said it was unlikely he would have remained at NBC if he had not been promoted.
 
A Feeling of Deja Vu
Mr. Tartikoff denied he was ''burned out'' in his basic programming job but said he felt a sense of deja vu when hearing about progam ideas similar to those he heard eight and ten years ago. ''I'm not saying programming Friday nights won't continue to be a challenge,'' he said. ''But I think there are also some things that are more critical and much more interesting that are going to have to do with the long-term survival of network television.''
Many of those challenges ahead involve program costs and control of profits. Mr. Wright has increasingly moved NBC into other businesses, like cable channels and satellite distribution, and has described NBC more and more often as a ''programming company'' rather than a network.
Mr. Tartikoff said a favorable ruling from the Federal Communications Commission on the dispute between the networks and Hollywood studios over syndication profits could affect future NBC businesses. ''By January, there could be a studio acquisition by NBC,'' he said. ''A small studio would be a nice complement to the network.''
Earlier this year, NBC engaged in a long, sometimes bitter renegotiation with the producers of its highest-rated program, ''The Cosby Show.'' NBC kept the show, but only at a record price of a reported $1 million an episode plus other concessions. Mr. Tartikoff said it had spurred him to shift his priorities.
''You start to see a day coming when a lot of your more successful shows will potentially become loss leaders if you don't readjust your strategy; you may be getting ratings, but you may not be making any profit,'' he said. ''You also see the studios asking for things and demanding time periods. You start to say the studios are now figuring out new strategies to guarantee they remain solvent.''
Mr. Tartikoff said he felt the time had come to ''tackle those big issues.'' Neither Mr. Wright nor Mr. Tartikoff was able to delineate how Mr. Tartikoff and Mr. Littlefield would divide the duties of managing the division. General Electric Companyd(NBC)

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Gloomy Prospects Facing Retailers

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
DESPITE a slight rise in the latest store sales figures, American consumers are likely to remain reluctant shoppers for the rest of this year, according to store executives and industry analysts. And that grim outlook means no end is in sight to the difficulties facing most American retailers and their suppliers.
People do have money for shopping, economists say, citing an increased savings rate, but they note that disposable income has dropped. Consumers are putting money away in anticipation of leaner times, they say, and economic surveys confirm. 
Almost as important, many industry experts say, is an apparent growing malaise among shoppers who see few trend-setting clothing styles or must-have consumer products.
Given these factors, many economists said they were not impressed with the rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in June sales reported by the Government on Friday. That gain ended three months of declines. The overall situation leaves many analysts who follow consumer buying convinced that retail sales will not rebound strongly this year.
The dour prospects weigh especially heavily on national retailers with high debts like Federated Stores Inc. and R. H. Macy & Company. These department store companies must depend on steady or increasing sales for the cash flow to pay off the loans used to buy the stores.
And the pressure on the retailers is making life harder for apparel and textile makers, Deborah Bronston and Toni Perrelle of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. noted last week. ''The apparel and textile stocks in our closely followed universe are down 6.6 percent in the last year, compared with a 12.6 percent increase in the S.&P. 500,'' they said, pointing to a 55 percent decline at the Hartmarx Corporation, an 18 percent drop at the V. F. Corporation, a 48 percent fall at Guilford Mills Inc. and a 46 percent slide at Fieldcrest Cannon Inc.
One indication of the continuing slump was the recent report by Investcorp, the Mideast financing group that bought Saks Fifth Avenue. The group told bankers that Saks's earnings for the first half of 1990 were worse than expected and added that it foresaw flat to slightly negative sales results for Saks's Manhattan flagship store for several years.
The overall decline in sales this year seems to mirror an erosion in consumer confidence. The Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization, said that after sampling 5,000 households nationwide its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 102.5 in June, more than 4 points below the level in May and 8 points below April's level.
Robert F. Buchanan, senior retail analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, a Baltimore brokerage, said: ''What retailers are grappling with is a double whammy - a diminished rate of consumer disposable income and a continuing urge to save money. The result is a definite slowdown in personal consumption.''
National retail chains say the biggest sales declines have been in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where thousands of jobs have been lost through business mergers and layoffs and because of the stock market crash in October 1987. The firmest area of the country is said to be the West Coast, particularly the Pacific Northwest. The Sun Belt states are doing relatively well in sales while business in the Midwest is mixed.
Women's, men's and children's wear are showing little buoyancy, even though sales of women's clothing increased last year after a long decline.
''In the first four months of 1990, total apparel sales were down 1 percent both in units and dollars,'' said John Tugman, vice president of MRCA Information Services, a market research company in Stamford, Conn. Men's clothing fell by 8 percent in unit sales and 10 percent in dollar sales.
Still, some analysts see opportunities for selective buying.
Jonathan H. Ziegler, an analyst with Sutro & Company in San Francisco, said, ''The strong retailers will take market share - the guys who provide values and what the consumers want.''
''Wal-Mart will always do well,'' he added. He has a strong buy recommendation on Gottschalks Inc. in Fresno, Calif., which operates 22 department stores in Central California. ''It's a special situation,'' he said. ''They are in a rapid growth economy, which is operating to its own beat right now, and housing prices there are still going up.''
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said in a report, ''We would continue to focus investments in the premier retail companies, including Limited, Wal-Mart, Dillard, May, Toys ''R'' Us, Tiffany and Duty Free International.''
Neil Thall, retail services director of Kurt Salmon Associates, said: ''Those merchants with a different approach in goods and service are doing much better than the pack. Today's customer wants attractive merchandise, clearly good values, service that is more than just a smiling face and shopping convenience.''

HEADLINE: Panel Warns of Risks in Global Trading

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Warning of potentially serious risks to investors, institutions and the economy from round-the-clock trading in stocks and futures, an independent agency of Congress said today that it might fall to lawmakers to lay out regulatory policy toward the emerging global marketplace because ''it is not clear'' if the regulatory agencies share a ''common view.''
A report by the Office of Technology Assessment said Congressional action on global trading was as important as landmark legislation that created the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934.
The S.E.C., the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department share jurisdiction over stock and futures trading. 
 
Risk of Liquidity Crisis
The technology for 24-hour trading is ''poised for a takeoff,'' the agency said, but risks remain because a clear international regulatory system has not been developed. The main risk would involve a liquidity crisis across borders if one major market participant failed.
The report is part of a continuing study by the Congressional agency of the impact of technology on the stock and futures markets, a draft of which was harshly criticized by the securities and futures industries. The draft questioned some fundamental practices of the two industries, including the specialist system of the New York Stock Exchange and the open outcry system of the futures exchanges. An advisory panel of industry representatives sent the report back in January for revisions.
Congressional aides said that they decided to separate the international section from the domestic section because of the reaction to the draft.
 
Hearings Set for September
The full study is scheduled to be issued at hearings in September. Representative Doug Barnard Jr., Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the House Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs, asked for the report after the market crash of October 1987.
Representatives of the stock and futures exchanges said they had not seen the report and had no comment. But a spokesman for the commodities commission said the report's ''factual development, analysis and conclusions remain seriously flawed.''
The S.E.C. commissioners said they would reserve judgment until they had seen the full report. But Eugene Lopez, a special counsel in the commission's division of market regulation, said the report cited significant progress in the international area. ''I don't see the need for any new legislation,'' he said.
The report concluded that futures markets had made more strides than the stock markets toward a global market place and it said new electronic systems for global trading being developed by private companies were largely unregulated.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trade Report Spurs Decline In Dollar in World Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened on world cur-rency markets yesterday after the United States reported a widening of its trade deficit in May.
Gold prices also declined in the United States and abroad. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $362 an ounce, down $1.30 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $361.40 an ounce, off $1.10. 
Currency dealers said the dollar was under pressure in part because the Commerce Department reported that the May trade deficit jumped to $7.73 billion from a revised figure of $7.31 billion. The increase resulted partly from a big rise in oil and car imports.
Currency dealers keep a close watch on the trade figures, since they often affect the dollar's value. For instance, dealers worry that a rise in imports will put downward pressure on the dollar, to encourage higher export sales.
Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said technical factors also played a role in the dollar's decline. ''It just lost the upside momentum,'' he said.
Mr. Johnson said the traders were awaiting testimony scheduled for today by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before Congress on monetary policies.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 148.20 Japanese yen, down from 148.43 late Monday. It traded at 148.32 yen in London, and at 147.80 yen in New York, down from 148.15 yen.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Each pound cost $1.8115 in London, up from $1.8040, and $1.8165 in New York, up from $1.8033.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Monday, included: 1.6440 West German marks, down from 1.6545; 1.4048 Swiss francs, down from 1.4180; 5.5155 French francs, down from 5.5500; 1,204.25 Italian lire, down from 1,211.00, and 1.15295 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15865.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those on Monday, were: 1.6455 German marks, down from 1.6535; 1.4065 Swiss francs, down from 1.4165; 5.5210 French francs, down from 5.5460; 1.8552 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8640; 1,205.12 Italian lire, down from 1,210.75, and 1.1562 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587.
The late bid price of gold in London was $361.25 an ounce, down from $362.75 Monday. Gold fell to $361.50 an ounce in Zurich from $362.70.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at $361.15 an ounce.
Silver prices also weakened. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.814 an ounce, down from $4.847 on Monday.

HEADLINE: EATING WELL

BYLINE: By Densie Webb; Densie Webb, a freelance writer and editor, is a registered dietitian.

 BODY:
MOST people's diets fall far short of the ideal set by organizations like the National Academy of Sciences, the National Cancer Institute and the American Heart Association: cutting back on fat, eating more fiber, reducing cholesterol, eating more fruits, vegetables and whole-grain foods.
Nutritionists say one reason Americans fail to meet dietary goals is that they cling to traditional diets in which high-fat meat is the focus.
Some advocates of vegetarianism say that the only way to follow modern guidelines for healthful eating is to switch to a vegetarian diet or at least a vegetarian-style diet, in which meat plays the role of a condiment or a side dish rather than a main course. On the other side are those who insist that healthful eating is simply choosing low-fat meats and dairy foods and eating more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
Dr. John McDougall, an internist in Santa Rosa, Calif., his wife and three children have had a strict vegetarian diet for 15 years, and he recommends it for his patients. ''But,'' he said, '' I never use the 'V' word. It scares people away.''
Dr. McDougall also directs a residential health program in Deer Park, Calif., offering only vegetarian cuisine. ''People are supposed to eat a diet centered around starch,'' he said, ''like pastas, potatoes, rice and breads, with the addition of fruits and vegetables. That's what best supports human nutrition.''
He said many who follow such diets experience decreases in blood pressure and cholesterol that would not occur with a diet based on meat.
Suzanne Havala, a registered dietitian who is a consulting nutritionist in Charlotte, N.C., has been a vegetarian for 13 years, but she said it was not necessary to follow a totally vegetarian diet to be healthy. ''But you have to try a lot harder to meet the dietary guidelines if you're eating a typical American diet and not a vegetarian kind of diet.'' Ms. Havala said.
She said she believed that moving toward a more vegetarian diet is a good way of putting dietary recommendations into practice. ''People haven't made the connection that if they are going to be eating a diet that is in keeping with the dietary guidelines, it isn't going to resemble the typical American diet,'' she added.
Switching to a vegetarian diet to meet dietary goals is ''absurd and unnecessary,'' said Dr. Jack M. Iacono, director of the Western Human Nutrition Research Center in San Francisco, who has been studying the effects on health of reducing fat in the typical diets of Americans, Finns and Italians for 17 years.
He said that reducing one's intake of fat to less than 30 percent from 40 percent would be easy if consumers chose leaner grades of meat and low-fat cuts of meat, and if they carefully trim visible fat from meat and use low-fat dairy products. Low-fat cuts of beef include top round, eye of round and chuck roast. The leanest grade of beef is ''select.'' If fruits, vegetables and grains are substituted for the fats that have been removed, Dr. Iacona said, the character of the diet is unchanged but the vitamin and mineral content is dramatically improved.
But choosing the right foods is not always easy without the help of a nutritionist, said Dr. Johanna Dwyer, a professor of medicine at Tufts Medical School and director of the nutrition clinic at the New England Medical Center. ''Many people have taken the tack of simply saying 'eat less animal food,' '' Dr. Dwyer said, ''because they don't know that much about food composition. They assume they've just got to give up red meat.''
A simple approach, said Dr. Paul LaChance, professor of nutrition and food science at Rutgers University, is to adjust the distribution of plant foods vis-a-vis animal foods in the diet. Currently, about 60 percent of the American diet comes from animal food (beef, fish, poultry, pork, milk, cheese, eggs) and 40 percent comes from plant food (fruits, vegetables, cereals and grains), the United States Department of Agriculture says. Dr. LaChance would reverse this so 60 percent of the American diet is from plants and only 40 from animals.
Though nutritionists disagree on whether a vegetarian-style diet is necessary to meet dietary guidelines, few of them argue against the evidence that people who follow vegetarian diets have a lower rate of chronic illness - heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and gall bladder disease.
''The nutritional benefits of vegetarian diets are very well established over time with an enormous body of literature,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, chairman of the department of home economics and nutrition at New York University.
Vegetarian diets are very healthy provided calories are adequate and the diet is varied, said Dr. Nestle, who was the managing editor of the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health for 1988. ''The vegetarian diets that get people into trouble are the ones that are too low in calories and too restricted,'' Dr. Nestle said.
Ms. Havala agrees that even vegetarian diets can be nutritionally unbalanced. Sodas and potato chips are vegetarian foods, she says, but if consumed excessively, they make a vegetarian diet high in fat and low in nutrients, just as a meat-based, junk-food diet is.
She offers several suggestions for those who want a diet that emphasizes plant food over animal food. First, she says, don't expect to make changes overnight: the evolution from one's current eating habits should be gradual. She recommends limiting meat intake to 4 ounces a day, or in practical terms, no more than one meat-based meal. Meat consumption now averages about 6 to 8 ounces a day. To accomplish this, she advises that people consider vegetables, rice and grains as the main course and meat and dairy products as the side dish or condiment.
During the transition to a more vegetarian diet, Ms. Havala suggests experimenting with vegetarian cookbooks. But, she says, be forewarned that some vegetarian recipes call for a lot of cheese, sour cream, oils or vegetable margarines, making the dishes high in fat. Cookbooks or cooking classes for such ethnic cuisines as Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Indian, she says, may also provide meatless options that are good starter dishes for those new to vegetarian-style eating.

HEADLINE: U.S. SHIFTS CAMBODIA POLICY; ENDS RECOGNITION OF REBELS; AGREES TO TALKS WITH HANOI

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 18

 BODY:
In a major policy reversal, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced today that the Bush Administration was withdrawing its diplomatic recognition of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition, which includes the Communist Khmer Rouge, and opening negotiations with Vietnam on settling the Cambodian conflict.
Mr. Baker, speaking to reporters after a two-hour meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said the move was necessary because existing American policy appeared increasingly likely to promote a return to power of the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule in the 1970's more than a million Cambodians were killed or died of starvation.
 
Pressure From Rights Groups
The Administration had been under pressure from Congress and human rights groups to change its Cambodia policy, especially in light of a recent series of major military gains by the Khmer Rouge.
The policy that was abandoned today dates to the Carter Administration, which, seeking to improve relations with China and in deference to Southeast Asian nations wishing to contain Vietnam, stifled some of its human rights concerns and condoned Beijing's support of the Khmer Rouge. The policy continued under the Reagan Administration. 
Mr. Shevardnadze, whose Government supports Vietnam, said after meeting with Mr. Baker that the American and Soviet approaches on Cambodia have ''come much closer.''
 
Seeking to Isolate Hanoi
The Administration also signaled that the talks with Vietnam could eventually lead to normal relations with Hanoi, although Mr. Baker said that such a step was not at hand. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the United States sought to isolate Vietnam diplomatically and economically and did not establish relations.
Since Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge and installed a pro-Vietnamese Government, Washington came to support a three-faction Cambodian coalition trying to topple the Government in Phnom Penh, led by Prime Minister Hun Sen. The United States argued that Mr. Hun Sen was an illegitimate puppet of an ''expansionist'' Soviet-backed Vietnamese Government.
The rebel coalition consists of two non-Communist groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, and a former Cambodian Prime Minister, Son Sann, both of which have received American aid. The most powerful military force in the coalition, however, was the third partner, the Khmer Rouge. Washington, in its eagerness to oust the Vietnamese-installed regime, was seen as indirectly supporting the Khmer Rouge's aim of returning to power.
Explaining the Administration's move today, long advocated by human rights organizations, Mr. Baker said Washington had realized one of its goals on Cambodia last year with a Vietnamese troop withdrawal.
But he added: ''Another policy goal was to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge. We've not been able to achieve that goal and, in fact, it would appear that the risks are greater as we move forward that that might occur. So we want to do everything we can to prevent a return of the Khmer Rouge to power. That has been one of our policy goals all along that we've not been able to achieve.''
 
U.S. to Continue Aid
Mr. Baker said that in keeping with this objective, the United States would now ''open a dialogue with Vietnam about Cambodia.'' He said Washington would also ''be prepared to enhance our humanitarian assistance to Cambodia'' and to withdraw support for the rebel coalition's claim to Cambodia's United Nations seat, which it has long held. Washington is expected to support leaving the seat open pending elections in Cambodia.
The Secretary indicated that Washington would continue to provide aid to the two non-Communist guerrilla factions led by Prince Sihanouk and Mr. Son Sann, to keep them politically alive until internationally supervised elections can be held in Cambodia. Whether such a policy will be sustained by Congress, however, is uncertain.
Mr. Baker said he and Mr. Shevardnadze would have discussions of such regional problems when they meet in Irkutsk, in Siberia, on Aug. 1.
 
U.S. Holds Talks With China
Mr. Baker also said that Washington has held ''consultations'' with China and Southeast Asian nations regarding the policy switch, but he declined to elaborate. Persuading China to withdraw its backing for the Khmer Rouge would be an essential ingredient in defusing the conflict.
The Administration's decision to ''change policy does not constitute a decision to normalize relations with Vietnam,'' Mr. Baker said. ''It is a decision simply to begin a dialogue with Vietnam about Cambodia.''
Mr. Baker said whether the talks would lead to a normalization of relations would depend in large part on Vietnam's responsiveness to American inquiries about prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action.
American officials said the talks with Vietnam would be held in New York, where Vietnam has a United Nations mission; a date was not disclosed. The American delegation will be led by the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, Richard H. Solomon.
Mr. Solomon has been in Paris representing the United States at a meeting with China, France, Britain and the Soviet Union designed to push an Australian plan to put Cambodia under United Nations administration until elections can be organized.
That conference adjourned with diplomats from the five countries citing progress toward agreement among themselves, but voicing frustration with the lack of progress toward agreement among the Cambodian factions.
The American policy reversal today appeared to be a way to put pressure on the Cambodian factions to reach a settlement under the plan being developed by the five nations, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Their next meeting on Cambodia is scheduled for late August in New York.
 
Factors Behind U.S. Switch
The Administration's policy switch appears to have been motivated by two factors: The war on the ground, where the Khmer Rouge appear suddenly to be making major headway, and mounting Congressional opposition.
The Khmer Rouge's senior diplomatic representative in Paris, Khieu Samphan, was quoted by French newspapers as saying that the rebels have recently taken up positions near Phnom Penh.
In Congress, a series of recent votes has made it clear to the Administration that its policy of supporting a coalition that could return the Khmer Rouge to power is rapidly losing support. The end of the cold war has made the Soviet-backed Hun Sen Government less distasteful to Washington, and the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia last year has undercut the impression that Mr. Hun Sen was a puppet of Hanoi.
Mr. Baker acknowledged this change in perception of the Hun Sen Government when he said: ''It certainly was a puppet government while Vietnam troops were in the country supporting it. Those Vietnam troops have now gone and that's one of our policy goals that we've been able to achieve.''
While today's move came about in part from consultations with Congress, it is not the result of any negotiated bipartisan agreement, Mr. Baker said.
 
Fears of a New 'Killing Field'
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) -The Bush Administration's decision to open talks with Vietnam is not enough to prevent the Khmer Rouge from again turning Cambodia into a ''vast killing field,'' Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, said today.
''I welcome Secretary Baker's announcement of changes in American policy toward Cambodia, although I do not believe they go far enough in clearly and effectively preventing future Khmer Rouge domination of Cambodia,'' Senator Mitchell said.
The Maine Democrat called for a comprehensive rethinking of American policy.
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittee, said the policy shift was a recognition of changed circumstances in Southeast Asia.
''I consider it a welcome adjustment in our policy in Cambodia,'' Mr. Solarz told reporters.
 
Non-Communists Oppose Policy
BANGKOK, Thailand, July 18 (AP) - Non-Communist Cambodian guerrilla leaders said today that the American decision would force them closer to China and strengthen the Khmer Rouge.
Vietnam's Ambassador to the United Nations, Trinh Xuan Lang, hailed the decision as a ''positive'' step that could eventually lead to the normalization of relations with the United States.
''In the future, to survive, to go on fighting, we will have to accept more aid from China,'' said Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of Prince Sihanouk. Prince Ranariddh is commander of his father's army.
 
No Reaction Reported in China
BEIJING, Thursday, July 19 (Special to The New York Times) -The Chinese Government appeared to be weighing its response to the Baker announcement on Cambodia today as the Foreign Ministry announced it would hold a press conference later in the day.
China's leading newspapers carried no reaction. But in in comments quoted by the New China News Agency, Xu Dunxin, the Assistant Foreign Minister, expressed satisfaction with the progress being made in the talks in Paris among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. His comments appeared to have been made before the Baker announcement.

HEADLINE: Home Builders See Recession And Blame the Savings Crisis

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
For the first time since the recession of the early 1980's, the rate of new housing construction has dropped for five consecutive months, providing further proof, home builders say, that the economic and regulatory fallout from the savings and loan crisis has pulled one of the country's biggest industries into a recession.
The Commerce Department figures, released yesterday, show that single-family and apartment housing starts fell to an annual rate of 1.18 million in June, a drop of 15.7 percent from the rate of 1.4 million a year ago. The decline was steepest in the Northeast, where housing activity was 32 percent below the 1989 level.
At the same time, sales of new homes have fallen 21 percent since their peak last November, to an annual rate of 546,000 units. The drop is particularly severe in the Northeast. 
Leaders of the country's $200 billion housing industry, which accounts for about 5 percent of the gross national product, say that the slump results in part from a move by Federal bank regulators to discourage banks from real estate lending in an attempt to prevent them from falling victim to the same careless practices that bankrupted so many savings institutions. Unless conditions improve, they say -and other factors, including a smaller number of young home buyers, make any improvement unlikely for the near term - the rest of the economy will also be pulled under.
In fact, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, eased interest rates last week to offset the tightening in commercial loans.
''We're worse off today than we were in the early 80's when we had those incredibly high interest rates,'' said H. Daniel Pincus, a home builder in Brick-town, N.J. ''Then the banks were helping to keep everyone alive, not destroy us.''
The backlash from the savings crisis is only the latest in a series of adverse developments for the housing industry. Economists say the direction of the market has become so uncertain that many buyers and sellers are now staying on the sidelines, waiting to see what happens to prices and mortgage interest rates, which have remained persistently high in relation to the country's sluggish economic performance.
The fact that the market has not responded to stable interest rates and falling prices, for instance, suggests to some that prices are likely to slip further, and inventories to inch up a bit, before the next upswing in the historically cyclical housing industry.
The number of people who own homes is declining for all but those who are middle-aged and older, and demographic trends point to a smaller number of people in the age group in coming years buying homes for the first time.
In addition, the 1986 tax revision law drove tax-shelter investors, a big source of building money, out of the real estate market. And new Federal rules mandating access for handicapped people to apartment houses have scared many multifamily builders away. Apartment construction has dropped by more than half since January, when the rules took effect.
 
Low Rents Seen as a Factor
Forecasters say that part of the slump in the housing market is also a result of the low rents in the overbuilt apartment and town house market, which have encouraged renters to postpone the purchase of their first house.
''We're being hit all at once by high interest rates, low job growth, the credit crunch, the new multifamily handicapped rules, and it's putting us right at the edge of a major recession in the housing industry,'' said Martin Perlman, a Houston developer who is president of the National Association of Home Builders. ''If we topple over, and toppling over means less than one million starts a year, we might very well pull the rest of the economy down with us.''
For its huge economic size, the housing industry is remarkably fragmented, an amalgamation of entrepreneurs, part blue-collar, part banker, who do their own land deals, secure loans, finesse local building rules, bully contractors and cajole buyers in a business where a dollar too much or a day too late can mean the difference between profit and loss.
 
Factors Encouraging Sales
The industry points to economic signs that should result in better starts and sales - a fairly low inventory of unsold homes on the market, plentiful mortgage money in the 10.5 percent range, which is moderate by recent standards, and home prices that have begun to slip a bit in search of buyers.
The inventory of unsold new homes nationally, expressed in months' supply at current sales rates, stands at a 7.5 months' supply, compared with 8 months a year ago and 6.6 months two years ago. For existing homes, the figures are 8.2 months today, versus 8.5 months a year ago and 9.6 months in 1988.
Yet experts outside the industry say the market is just not ready for another building boom.
 
'To Build in This Market Is Crazy'
''The credit crunch, in some areas at least, is absolutely real, and so it should be, because anyone who wants to build in this market is crazy,'' said Carl Case, an economics professor at Wellesley College who specializes in real estate analysis. ''The way the real estate market works is that it must clear itself of any surpluses before it can begin to move again. It's hard for the builders because it's their livelihood, but, boy, I wouldn't make development loans at this point in time.''
In New York, Long Island and northern and central New Jersey, housing starts in the first quarter of this year dropped to half their rate of a year ago for single-family construction. The only exception in the three-state region was the Hartford area, which showed a 5.7 percent gain.
Glenn Crellin, another real estate association economist, said he believes that banks are waiting for the market to start to move before they go back to returning phone calls from credit-seeking developers.
 
Banks Seen as Defensive
''The banks are unwilling to contribute to what they see as an increase in the inventory,'' he said. ''They're trying to protect their own portfolios and the industry as a whole from what might happen in a further weakening of the market.''
William B. Brueggeman, consulting director of real estate research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he believes that one reason the housing market is not responding to stable inventories and soft prices is that the vacancy rate of rentals, which shot up after the boom in apartment building in the mid-1980's, is only now beginning to drop.
''In some markets it is cheaper to rent than to own, and that is only slowly correcting itself,'' he said.
 
Rise in New York Vacancy Rates
Commerce Department figures show that the vacancy rate for rental apartments nationwide declined from 7.7 percent in 1987 to 7.1 percent last year. For Long Island, however, the rate has crept upward, from 6.3 percent to 6.9 percent, as it has in New York, from 2.4 percent to 3.3 percent, which indicates that the situation is worse there.
The vacancy rates for single-family homes are even more troubling for this region. While the national rate has declined from 1.7 percent to 1.4 percent, it has increased for Nassau and Suffolk counties from four-tenths of 1 percent to nine-tenths of 1 percent, and in New York City from 2.2 percent to 3 percent, the third highest of any major city after the depressed oil cities of Dallas, where it is 3.9 percent, and Denver, 3.7 percent.
The rise in single-family vacancies is thought by analysts to be caused by the growing number of families unable to sell their homes at prices they find acceptable that are putting them on the rental market.
 
One Builder's Problems
This distressed housing market has brought down many savings institutions, worsening some developers' difficulties. For instance, when the savings and loan that had been financing Mr. Pincus failed and was taken over by Federal regulators, Mr. Pincus had about 20 of the 36 units planned for his subdivision built and sold, and another six in various stages of completion.
After a delay, the bank agreed to reopen Mr. Pincus's line of credit, but kept changing the rules, he said.
''They said on June 4 they would disburse the money,'' Mr. Pincus said. ''Then came June 4, and they came up with a newfangled problem someone had thought of, and it took until the 25th of June to straighten it out.''
To ride out the wait, Mr. Pincus persuaded contractors to wait until the closing on two more houses for their payment.
''I got lucky, because I got contractors and a couple of buyers who were willing to work with me,'' he continued. ''But you can't work an ongoing job on that basis, and if I can't get the money to stay afloat, what's going to happen?''
 
Support for Banks' Position
Mr. Pincus said he is convinced that his homes, selling for $230,000 to $250,000, are the right product for the times, and that his completion schedule, only 10 percent below the prediction he made to his bank three years ago, shows that they are.
But Professor Case of Wellesley said that every builder believes he has the market figured out, that misplaced builder self-confidence helped get the country into the savings and loan crisis in the first place, and that it is up to the banks to take the large view.
''Each individual builder believes that he can build a good product in a good location and sell it and do fine,'' Mr. Case continued. ''But if I'm a bank, I've got to be able to sort all that out, because not every builder is going to succeed in this market.''
 
Home-Start Report
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - Construction of new homes fell 2.3 percent in June, the Commerce Department said today. The drop, which followed a revised nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in May, came despite lower interest rates that economists had predicted would at least keep starts from continuing to fall.
Tom Holloway, senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that the interest rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage loan came down in June to an average of 10.16 percent, from 10.48 percent in May.
Building of single-family homes fell one-tenth of 1 percent in June, while building of apartments was down 8.7 percent from May levels, as total housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units in June, from a rate of 1.21 million units in May.
That rate was the lowest for new-home building since October 1982, when starts were 1.17 million units. The drop in June starts represented the fifth straight monthly decline, the first time that housing starts fell for five successive months since the recession year 1981, when they dropped from July through November, department officials said.
The department previously reported that May housing starts had fallen by 1.4 percent but revised that to a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
By region, construction starts fell 10.9 percent last month in the Northeast. Starts were down 9.2 percent in the Midwest and 10.1 percent in the West but rose in the South by 8.8 percent.
Building permits, a sign of future plans, rose 3.9 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.11 million, after falling 3.9 percent in May and 10.1 percent in April.
But the rise in permits was entirely for apartment construction, analysts noted, while permits to build new single-family homes declined because of the large number of completed and unsold homes.

HEADLINE: Hopes Dying In the Rubble In Philippines

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CABANATUAN, the Philippines, July 18

 BODY:
A young vendor in the market here has become something of a hero in the wake of the earthquake that devastated parts of the city on Monday.
The vendor, Junjun Merosa, 19 years old, was among the first to arrive after the Christian College of the Philippines collapsed on Monday afternoon in this city north of Manila. Small and lithe, Mr. Merosa personally retrieved 12 living people and 25 bodies, he said, helping the living squeeze from the rubble by dousing them with motor oil and pulling them gently with ropes.
Accounts like Mr. Merosa's have spread through the nation in the aftermath of the earthquake. The official death toll nationwide rose to at least 311, with 682 injured, and the numbers are sure to increase. 
An American rescue worker said the body of an official of the United States Agency for International Development was found in the ruins of the Nevada Hotel in Baguio, but had not yet recovered it, The Associated Press reported. Several members of the agency had been attending a conference at the hotel.
Doctors said that any people trapped alive who could not be reached in the next day would almost surely die from shock, wounds and dehydration. Officials estimated that perhaps 1,000 people were missing, including some 150 workers who were trapped in the rubble of a Baguio chemical factory that then caught on fire.
 
'No Realistic Hope'
At the flattened Christian College of the Philippines in Cabanatuan, Col. Ramon Ong, whose soldiers were searching for survivors side by side with American Marines and Seabees engineers from Subic Bay Naval Station, said, ''Every hour that passes diminishes our hope.''
A Marine lieutenant, Michael Barrett, with a combat engineering group and one of 292 Americans helping in this city, said more bluntly, ''There's no realistic hope now of anyone still alive.''
Filipino officials here and in Baguio, the two towns hardest hit by the earthquake, said their efforts had to begin to turn to the needs of the living. Residents of Baguio are without drinking water, fresh food and electricity, and have been sleeping outside to avoid injury in a series of aftershocks.
 
Roads Still Impassable
Roads to Baguio, a mountain resort 110 miles north of Manila, were still impassable from landslides, making it difficult for equipment and supplies to get to the town. The airport, its runway buckled, is also shut to everything but helicopters.
Hundreds of people remain trapped in the rubble, but without heavy cranes, which cannot be taken in by helicopter, rescue workers can do little except listen for the cries of those still able to cry in the enormous piles of twisted concrete and steel.
At a Baguio hotel, the Hyatt Terraces, much of which collapsed, Clarita Gonzales used a megaphone to call to her daughter, 5 years old. ''Baby, Baby Michelle darling, Mama's here!'' she shouted, over and over.
A hotel spokesman said 80 people were still missing, including 30 guests, 25 employees and perhaps 25 others who had been in the casino.
President Corazon C. Aquino flew to Baguio today and asked students there, who make up at least a quarter of the population of 120,000, to try to return to their homes.
 
U.S. Team Arrives
People were leaving the city on foot while others waited at the airport to try to get rides on relief helicopters.
The American Embassy in Manila said a 14-member military search and rescue team arrived today and would go by helicopter to Baguio.
Rescue workers said one of their biggest difficulties was the lack of sensitive microphones and infrared scanners that can help identify those still alive.
Here in Cabanatuan, the last person rescued was pulled from the wrecked school about 9 P.M. on Tuesday by a Marine. The boy, Florencio Agapito, 14, was taken to a hospital, his legs and pelvis crushed.
The Americans had brought in a tactical field hospital with 54 beds and an operating room and set it up nearby, but no one else was found alive today.
Lieutenant Barrett, 25, said his Marines arrived about the time the boy was saved and worked through the night, but ''all we saw were dead ones.''
From a ladder, five bodies deep in the wreckage were visible but inaccessible. The rescue workers, most of whom wore surgical masks, studiously avoided looking at them as they searched for any sign of the living. Between 30 and 50 people are believed to be still trapped in the building; 62 have been found dead and retrieved, and 134 were injured.

HEADLINE: PREMIER OF CZECHS SEEKS U.S. CAPITAL

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, July 18

 BODY:
The Premier of the Czech region of this country is to arrive in the United States on Friday in search of what he calls pluralism.
The Premier, Petr Pithart, does not mean a multiplicity of political parties, which Czechoslovakia has abundantly achieved since last autumn without foreign help. The Premier will travel coast to coast, possibly even to Alaska, to enlist American support and investment to counterbalance what he called ''terrible pressure'' from potential West German investors.
Mr. Pithart is not only the head of the larger of Czechoslovakia's two constituent republics. The 49-year-old legal scholar and historian is also one of President Vaclav Havel's most trusted political strategists and, through his leadership in the Civic Forum mass movement, a close ally in the preparation and carrying out of the revolution that ended Communist rule. 
Mr. Pithart said he understood the surprising degree of popular pessimism that has followed the peaceful triumph of democracy of last autumn and the landslide election victory that confirmed it last month.
 
'Selling Out the Country'
''The main problem is that the federal Government and economists as a group are not united on a course of action,'' he said in an interview. ''There are no precedents, only the unsuccessful or at best half successful precedents of the old regime.
''The leadership and the people see a need to go as fast as possible. But when we are in a situation to resolve a problem, to choose a way, a lot of hesitation comes to their minds. And the advice from abroad is sometimes contradictory. We have no complete scenario of the logical steps to reform.''
Mr. Pithart, whose father was an Ambassador of the Communist Government, and who was reduced in the 21 years between the revolutions of 1968 and 1989 from an academic post to many menial jobs, outlined in imperfect but carefully chosen English the quandaries that Mr. Havel and his associates must confront in the overriding task of making the stagnant, highly centralized economy advance toward Western levels of productivity.
The problem is not only economic, the Premier said.
''The prevailing mood of Czechoslovakia is an understandable fear of selling out the country,'' Mr. Pithart said. ''It is a curious reaction, arising from our poverty. It is to be understood psychologically, this pride of a people that is poor.
 
Role of Foreign Investors
''We don't want to become the property of any Western country. It's like an architectural ruin. You either sell it to somebody who can restore it or you let it go on to certain destruction. What do you prefer? There is no third way.''
Reluctantly, Mr. Pithart said, he has come to the conclusion that in a country that has no sources of capital for the privatization of the obsolete and sluggish economy, foreign investors must be granted greater concessions than many Czechoslovaks want to offer.
''At the beginning I shared their attitude,'' he said. ''But we have to be more open.'' Does that mean 51 percent foreign holdings in an enterprise? ''Up to 100 percent,'' the Premier replied.
''But the necessary precondition is pluralism of countries,'' he said. ''There is terrible pressure from West Germany. That is why we need America.''
 
'A Bolshevist State Still'
To achieve that aim, Mr. Pithart will try to enlist the support of the American Czechoslovak community, which has been far less organized in political and economic support of their mother country than Polish-Americans or Hungarian-Americans.
''The Czechs who are organized are mostly older people,'' Mr. Pithart said. Those who came to America after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 believe that only the surface has changed, he said, ''and we are a Bolshevist state still.''
Many Czechoslovak economists and officials share concern over the fact that the bulk of the investment offers comes from West Germany. Czechoslovakia is keeping options open. But Mr. Pithart said that by the end of the summer, Volkswagen, for instance, is likely to own a controlling interest in Skoda, the country's largest carmaker.
The Premier said there was also indecision about how to introduce badly needed competition into the economy.
 
Resisting a Purge
''We are doing our best to bring to the country elements of free trade in a system in which the monopolies of the existing enterprises prevail,'' he said. ''How do you create an atmosphere of competition when most of the factories are monopolistic?''
He said one way was to create what he called an ''artificial atmosphere of competition'' by opening the market wide to imports. ''This is a very costly way,'' he said, because to make Czechoslovakia attractive, customs duties have to be pegged very low.
''A further reason for pessimism is that the old structures on the middle and lower levels are still in position,'' Mr. Pithart said. The Government faces a quandary in how to renew the Communist Party-dominated economic and administrative structures without a political purge, which the Havel leadership has forsworn. From the revolution's start, Civic Forum has insisted against much popular opposition that to dismiss masses of people only because of party membership would be unjust.
Czechoslovakia underwent wholesale purges three times in the life of its older citizens - under Germany's virtual annexation in 1939, in the Communist takeover in 1948 and after the 1968 invasion.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
U.S. Gives Soviets Menu Of American Expertise

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 18

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has given Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union a list of economic assistance projects the Bush Administration is prepared to undertake in the Soviet Union, a senior Administration official said today.
The delivery of the list today was the first time since the summit meeting at Malta in December 1989 that the Administration has formally offered a package of technical economic aid programs to Moscow. The offer was made as some American allies, particularly West Germany, are planning to offer Moscow cash grants, bank credits and low-interest loans. The list given to Mr. Shevardnadze today far exceeded that presented at Malta, the official said. 
Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze met for two hours today at the American Ambassador's residence, a day after the talks on German reunification in Paris that produced a resolution of the German-Polish border dispute.
 
Contacts With Opposition
During the talks, Mr. Baker also told Mr. Shevardnadze that Washington planned to begin contacts with the emerging non-Communist opposition in the Soviet Union, including people like Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, and Mayor Gavriil K. Popov of Moscow. The Soviet Foreign Minister registered no objections, said the Administration official, who emphasized that Washington intended to keep these contacts on a low-key, low-level basis, at least for now.
Among the projects on the list were these:
* A proposal for sending American experts who would help advise the Soviets on how to improve their clogged distribution networks, which often get so backed up that goods imported from the West sit for months in railroad cars and ships before they get to consumers.
* A proposal for providing technical advice on how to set up a private banking system. Given the American savings and loan crisis, American officials acknowledged that there was a bit of an incongruity in the notion that the Bush Administration would offer Moscow its expertise in this field.
* A proposal being drawn up by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for advising the Soviet Union on how to develop a private housing industry. When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union flew from Washington to Camp David during the June summit, he spent much of the flight asking his hosts how much the private houses they were flying over cost to build, own and maintain.
* A proposal for developing management training courses.
* A proposal for establishing an effective tax administration. The Soviet tax system is currently a chaotic, often inconsistent, amalgam of legislation. Mr. Baker suggested American help in designing an equitable tax policy, as well as a tax-collection bureaucracy to administer it.
What all the proposals have in common, say American officials, is that they do not involve any cash infusions, but solely technical advice to help the Soviets get the most out of what they have now, and to help them move toward a more market-oriented system.
Mr. Shevardnadze, according to the Administration official, promised to give Mr. Baker a reaction to the list when the two meet again on Aug. 1 in Siberia while Mr. Baker is on an Asian tour. Because of their long discussion today of domestic developments in the Soviet Union, the two ministers agreed to postpone their planned talks about Afghanistan and other regional disputes until they meet in Irkutsk.
Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, is sponsoring an economic aid bill for Eastern Europe for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, that would provide the Administration with the funds for use in delivering technical assistance to either Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.
Most of the programs that began after the Malta talks were low-budget projects involving one-time visits by teams of American experts.
After an initial burst of visits, though, the technical aid seemed to slow down, apparently in part because of a lack of responsiveness from Moscow and in part because of diminishing energy on the American end. Mr. Baker's proposals were clearly prompted by Mr. Gorbachev's direct appeal to the West for help, and the need by Washington to demonstrate more active support at a time when its allies seem to be opening their wallets.

HEADLINE: Behind U.S. Reversal: Gains by the Khmer Rouge

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Defense and intelligence officials say they are increasingly concerned that the Communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas are winning their war to oust the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian Government. The Bush Administration's announcement today that it is withdrawing recognition of the Cambodian rebel coalition and opening talks with Vietnam underlines that concern.
State Department, Defense Department and Congressional analysts said that despite recent Khmer Rouge advances they do not believe the Cambodian Government will fall this year.
They said that two non-Communist guerrilla groups loosely allied with the Khmer Rouge had failed to make similar advances. The two groups receive more than $15 million in yearly overt and covert American assistance. 
''A primary concern of our policy is to keep the Khmer Rouge from taking power,'' said a senior State Department official. ''Khmer Rouge military advances have caused concern.''
 
A Rainy Season Offensive
''We want to do everything we can to prevent a return of the Khmer Rouge to power,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told reporters in Paris.
Human-rights monitors have documented that more than a million Cambodians were killed under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970's during a radical restructuring of society that included the forced mass migration of urban people into the countryside.
Administration officials said that the Khmer Rouge rebels are following rural-based strategy similar to the one used in encircling Phnom Penh in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge came to power.
American officials said that in their current rainy-season offensive, the rebels are taking advantage of the Government's decreased mobility. The rebels are spreading their forces across the countryside - from northwestern Siem Reap province and Bantheay Meanchey province to southern Kampot province - while they cut off major highways and communications lines to choke the cities.
In the face of this offensive on northern, southern and central villages within 40 miles of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, Government forces are retreating and in some cases dropping their weapons, the officials said.
A Defense Department official said the Khmer Rouge strategy was directed at ''undermining the people's confidence in the Government and the Government's confidence in itself.'' The official continued: ''The Government forces are hard pressed and extended in contending with the Khmer Rouge offensive. Morale problems and corruption are clearly evident.''
The Vietnamese-backed Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen is struggling to manage a series of problems. The Government cannot pay all of its civil servants and soldiers, a situation made all the more severe by rising inflation and a decline in Vietnamese and Soviet economic aid.
Regular Vietnamese Army forces, which once numbered up to 200,000, left the country last year. American officials report that a few thousand Vietnamese military advisers have returned to help beat back the offensive.
 
Support for Khmer Rouge
In briefings to other Government officials earlier this week, Central Intelligence Agency analysts estimated that the Khmer Rouge faction consists of 30,000 to 40,000 fighters, slightly larger than the size of the two non-Communist rebel groups combined.
They fight a Government army of from 60,000 to 100,000 men. The C.I.A. estimated that the value of Chinese assistance to the Khmer Rouge approaches $100 million a year, while the non-Communist groups receive much less from several countries, including Singapore, which sends them $10 million a year in military hardware and other supplies.
The C.I.A. estimates that the Khmer Rouge is backed in one form or another by 30 percent of the population, with larger proportions of support in areas they control, where they can exercise intimidation.
C.I.A. analysts also said the non-Communist groups and Khmer Rouge share supply lines, raising questions of how the Bush Administration can continue to supply the non-Communists without inadvertently helping the Khmer Rouge. The deeper the American-supported groups operate inside Cambodia, the more dependent they are on the Khmer Rouge.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Said to Tell China It Will Go Ahead on Loan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 18

 BODY:
A senior Japanese official has told Chinese leaders here that despite the tepid endorsement its diplomatic opening to China received from President Bush in Houston it intends to push ahead, a Japanese official who attended the meetings said.
The reported comments by the senior official, Deputy Foreign Minister Hisashi Owada, who ended an important three-day visit today, are just one step in what appears to be a focused Japanese diplomatic offensive to rebuild relations with China quickly and, implicitly, to encourage China to see Japan as its most reliable ally among the major industrialized nations.
It is also an early demonstration of Japan's stated aim of pursuing a more independent foreign policy that uses the vast financial resources it has amassed over the last decade to strengthen relationships.
''The Chinese understood that what came out of Houston was a compromise,'' said the official, who attended the meetings with Mr. Owada. ''They understood that Japan was not satisfied, because its position was not completely accepted'' on normalizing ties to China. President Bush agreed at the Houston summit not to block Japan's huge loan program to China. 
As the United States and other Western nations continue to curtail diplomatic, cultural and other contacts with China after the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square last year, Japan is sending a wave of senior figures and pushing ahead with the stalled $5.5 billion subsidized-loan program.
Shortly after the summit meeting of the seven leading industrialized nations, Japan began to plan the processing for 17 of the 42 low-cost loans for projects included in the program.
Just before the Houston gathering, in fact, a team of nearly two dozen Japanese experts had already quietly approved the feasibility of the projects, which include construction of railways, port centers, upgraded telephone lines, fertilizer plants and a city water supply system, a Japanese official said. The loans are made at below-market rates of 3 percent.
In keeping with a Japanese strategy, the projects will also make it more attractive for foreign companies to invest in China by improving the industrial infrastructure.
Under pressure from the United States and other leading industrialized nations, the World Bank and other countries have made official loans only for projects that covered basic humanitarian needs, not ones that brought broader commercial and economic benefits, as the 17 Japanese projects will.
Mr. Owada also explained in the briefing for the Chinese, the diplomat who attended the meetings said, that Japan opposed attaching conditions to its economic aid, as the United States increasingly does. China has fought the inclusion of conditions, like making aid dependent on political or economic liberalization, as an intrusion on its internal policies.
 
Hesitant Japanese Banks
Mr. Owada was the most senior Japanese official to visit Beijing since Chinese troops killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators last year.
Later this week, Sakutaro Tanino, head of the Foreign Ministry's Asia department, is scheduled to come and discuss the loan program directly. And a former Foreign Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, paid a visit here this week and was greeted by top Chinese officials.
Another former Foreign Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, and the president of the powerful lower house of Parliament, Yoshio Sakurauchi - both leading figures in Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party - are expected next week.
Because the Chinese economy is ailing and its outlook is muddy, many Japanese businesses, in particular, banks, have not been so quick to rush back in here. But the Japanese Government and the private sector regard China as holding immense strategic importance, and have said they do not want events like the Tiananmen Square crackdown to disturb the long-term relationship, which they see as promising as a major market and low-cost production base.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Our German Future

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Something is wrong with me. I can't rejoice at the great news.
Heaven knows, all kinds of important people are telling us to sing and dance - the President of the United States, columnists and editorial writers, professors, and also Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, head of the House of Hohenzollern.
They are ringing bells and sending congratulations to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail Gorbachev for getting together and working out the big deal. 
Mr. Gorbachev drops his opposition to German membership in NATO, which he could not stop anyway, and gets promises of heavy German money and trade.
Chancellor Kohl rids himself and his country of the short-term annoyance of Soviet kvetching about German membership in NATO. But more important he earns a deserved reputation as the smartest, most successful and most powerful leader in Europe, West or East, and quite probably the world.
The competition is not all that tough, but you have to hand it to Mr. Kohl for beating out the Prime Minister of Japan.
Mr. Gorbachev may have been the man of the 1980's. But the way things look Mr. Kohl will grace the cover of the history of the 1990's.
Now why am I not singing like a lark? After all, I know that German unification, which never thrilled me, is an accomplished fact, and that the best we can do now is pray for the best, with minimum snarling.
Realpolitik, Mr. Gorbachev calls it with a huge smile. A good word for it because it has plain connotations of cynicism and expediency.
For Soviet acquiescence the Germans are willing to pay billions of marks. Mr. Gorbachev needs the money and they can spare it, in wise expectation that it will be seed money for the growth of German economic and political power in the East.
But it is not the details of the German-Soviet deal that are so troublesome. It is the realization that it is the official opening of a new era of world politics - and that we do not know where it will lead us.
Headlines in The Times explain the queasiness. ''Bowing to the Inexorable: Soviets Make the Best of New German Might.''
''Germany Makes the Most of Its Newfound Power.''
And this poignant one: ''Bush Declares He Does Not Feel Left Out by Gorbachev and Kohl.'' (No, of course not. Mr. Kohl just went to see Mr. Gorbachev, worked out an economic, political and military understanding of world importance and filled Mr. Bush in. The next day Mr. Bush sent congratulations. Who said anything about left out?) It's worth facing realities, though we cannot change them. 1. The West was caught dead in the water by the collapse of Communism, never believing those Soviet rebels who kept saying it was inevitable. 2. The death of Communism sent masses of East Germans into West Germany. Instead of saying hold on, as victors in World War II we want a controlling voice in the unification process, the West and the Soviet Union watched slack-mouthed as Mr. Kohl waved at them from his speeding unification steam engine. 3. Unification creates a different German nation, not only stronger economically but moving on its own political track. It is already the first all-Europe power, strong in East and West. Mr. Kohl has worked out Moscow's expenses-paid troop withdrawal. Fine; now get ready for demands that American troops, like Soviet, withdraw from Germany. 4. The West hopes the advantages of belonging to the European economic union will chain Germany down. Maybe, but European union will also make Germany even stronger. The chain will hold fast - as long as Germany wishes. 5. None of the above need be a world disaster - just as long as the current support for democratic ways never fades among Germans, just as long as there will never ever be a German leadership that uses a crisis as the excuse for getting economically or politically nasty with the rest of Europe. 6. If you believe such guarantees exist, ring bells and cry joy. If not, wait awhile.
Wait, but don't go away. I know people who were reluctant to visit Germany or get involved with it because of memories and fears that need no explaining. I was one of them.
Not anymore. The memories will never fade; Germany is so much a part of our past.
Today we cannot do much more than visit, watch and talk with Germans. But we cannot do less, because now Germany is so much a part of our future.

Seeking to Make The Unpopular More Palatable

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In Yonkers yesterday, Mayor Henry Spallone not only accepted a $95,000 payoff from a power broker but also held a news conference to announce it.
Mr. Spallone, on behalf of local civic groups, was among the first recipients of a $1.2 million fund established by the New York State Power Authority to compensate communities along the route of a power line linking Westchester and Nassau Counties.
For every mile the cable traverses within its boundaries, each city, town and village is eligible for $55,000; counties can collect $5,000. Grants cover public benefits ranging from a refrigerator at a soup kitchen in Tuckahoe to stage rigging at Bronxville High School. A similar program, which gives a new dimension to the phrase ''making it under the wire,'' has disbursed $12 million to upstate communities that would derive no direct benefits from the 200-mile Marcy-South power line. 
While the Power Authority chairman, Richard M. Flynn, was presenting the grant in Yonkers, New York City officials were unveiling their own version of government by mitigation. It depends largely on a more open process and on a perception: that fundamental fairness in apportioning unpopular projects will infuse their neighbors with more public spiritedness.
The Dinkins administration rejected a formula, such as one using a grant or a tax abatement, that would place a value on a project's social or environmental undesirability. Instead, Mayor David N. Dinkins's proposal to the City Planning Commission formally expands the criteria routinely considered in finding sites for public projects.
It represents, said Richard L. Schaffer, the commission chairman, ''the first attempt in the nation to combine efficiency and equity in a unified siting process.''
One goal of the guidelines, which are required by the new City Charter, is to disperse unpopular projects that have typically been dumped in poorer neighborhoods. Additional projects deemed among the most unpopular -those involving garbage and sewerage, as well as residential programs for the homeless, drug addicts and jail inmates - could be placed in overburdened neighborhoods only under certain conditions.
The guidelines are consistent with Mr. Dinkins's goals when he was Manhattan Borough President:
He won commitments for more trees and other amenities to compensate for yet another drug treatment center in Harlem, and he endorsed an initiative for the homeless that dispersed shelters to the four other boroughs.
But it's uncertain whether the guidelines, despite their good intentions, will dramatically alter concentrations of public projects and, in some cases, whether they should.
In Manhattan, market forces may confine those projects to places like Harlem and lower Manhattan where land is less expensive. Political pressure will invariably distort the process, too: why else, for example, would the Koch administration have decided to build one huge garbage incinerator in each borough? (One analysis during the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay found a preponderance of popular projects in districts that voted for him). And some neighborhoods have high concentrations of drug treatment programs because many addicts live there.
The guidelines distinguish, though, between ambulatory programs, more likely to benefit people from the neighborhood, and residential programs that, theoretically, could be located anywhere and, arguably, fulfill a regional need. They also consider the impact of Federal, state and private projects.
New York, though, is a city where some people view even a school or a park as unpopular because they might attract undesirables. What the guidelines try to address, Mr. Schaffer said, ''is how does government analyze the cumulative impact of separate intrusions on a community?''
The guidelines may cost the city more in time and money, but Mr. Schaffer reasons that adopting a rational process that is both public and equitable will create more good will than resorting to subterfuges, like closing a fire station after the company has left to answer a false alarm. (Inauspiciously, Ruth W. Messinger, who succeeded Mr. Dinkins as Borough President, complained that her staff had not been adequately consulted on the guidelines, as the charter requires).
In November, the Mayor will, for the first time, present the big picture - an annual forecast of projects that the city hopes to open or close. Yet will that overview persuade New Yorkers to accept blots on their own backyard any less begrudgingly?
Mr. Schaffer hopes so. But he acknowledged, ''How much comfort that will give people, I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Omen for Young: Low Black Turnout

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 18

 BODY:
In his bid to become Georgia's first black governor, Andrew Young may have won a place on the runoff ballot Tuesday in the state's Democratic gubernatorial primary, but many of his campaign aides and other political observers said today that he had failed to generate the enthusiasm among black voters needed to win the nomination.
Mr. Young ran second in the primary, with 28.9 percent of the vote behind Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller's 41.2 percent. The two men had been front-runners in polls well before the voting and had been expected to end up in a runoff. What was not expected, many political experts said, was the low black voter turnout, which turned a narrow lead for Mr. Miller over Mr. Young in earlier opinion polls into a yawning gap in the voting Tuesday. 
''The black voter turnout was nothing to write home about,'' said Charles Schroder, the executive director of the state Democratic Party.
 
Shoring Up Black Support
While it was difficult to come up with hard figures on black voter turnout, Neihl Horton, Mr. Young's campaign spokesman, acknowledged that the campaign had not done as well as expected. He said particular emphasis would be given to shoring up black voter support before the Aug. 7 runoff.
Some Young aides cited the tactical difficulty facing a black candidate in trying to woo white voters while retaining black support. Mr. Young, they noted, has de-emphasized race and the historic nature of his campaign, shed his long opposition to the death penalty and stressed economic development over social programs and social policy. One aide said Mr. Young had to ''lean right and moderate his positions for whites while counting on blacks to see this as a tactic and not a theological conversion.''
''Apparently many considered it a theological conversion,'' said the aide.
Claiborne Darden, a political poll taker based here, agreed, saying, ''Unless Zell Miller makes a mistake, Andy Young is through.''
 
Record Republican Turnout
The voting Tuesday also produced a record turnout in a Republican primary, giving a clear victory to to State Senator Johnny Isakson, who captured 65 percent of the vote in the gubernatorial race. The state Republican chairman, Alec Poitevint, said the party was now in a position to elect its first Republican governor in more than a century.
In the past decade, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama have broken with century-long practices and elected Republican governors. The trend has been late coming to Georgia, Mr. Poitevint suggested, because of the Presidency of Jimmy Carter, who commanded strong loyalty in his home state.
But Mr. Schroder noted that the 111,000 Republican primary votes cast were still about one tenth of the 900,000 Democratic votes cast. He added that Mr. Isakson's stance in favor of abortion rights and his moderate political profile in a state with outspoken Republican conservatives did not make him the dream candidate of his party.
 
Moderate Appeals Fell Short
Mr. Young's apparent failure to draw a large black vote was puzzling. In Fulton County, which contains much of Atlanta, Jesse Jackson got nearly 9.000 more votes in his 1988 Presidential bid in winning the county than Mr. Young got Tuesday. Similar comparisons held for many of the predominantly black counties in rural areas of the state.
''I don't buy the idea that Andy Young didn't walk the tightrope the right way,'' said Mr. Darden, referring to Mr. Young's need to court white voters while holding on to his base of black voters. ''I thought he was even more moderate in his appeals than Doug Wilder was in Virginia, and Wilder held his black base. We know what happened, but I don't think we know why.'' Mr. Wilder, who is black, was elected governor of Virginia last year.
 
'Black Vote Was Just Neglected'
One political advisor to Mr. Young said: ''It's partly Andy's history in that he doesn't talk a lot about what he has done for poor blacks. But this time the black vote was just neglected and they assumed that they would get them. We are going to try to help build an apparatus that will make sure he gets those votes on Aug. 7.''
But Paul Begala, deputy campaign manager for Mr. Miller, said Mr. Young would have a tough time taking the lead. The Lieutenant Governor, a 16-year veteran of state politics, won in 119 of 159 counties and took all of the suburban Atlanta counties with the exception of one, Dekalb. Mr. Begala attributed this to Mr. Miller's emphasis on programs such as a lottery to finance education improvements and boot camps for first offenders, compared to Mr. Young's more general emphasis on bringing in more jobs and greater economic development.
''We had a resounding victory because Zell Miller articulated the agenda for this campaign,'' said Mr. Begala.
 
Coin Flip Picks Victor
CHICAGO, July 18 (Reuters) - A bitterly contested primary election for the Illinois Legislature that became a battleground in the fight over abortion was decided today by the toss of a coin.
Rosemary Mulligan was declared the winner by state election officials over Penny Pullen, an outspoken abortion foe. Both women were seeking the Republican nomination for a state House seat in suburban Chicago that Ms. Pullen had held for 14 years. Ms. Pullen's lawyer said he wouldf appeal to the State Supreme Court the decision declaring the race a tie.

HEADLINE: Decorators Feel the Pinch As Jobs Wane

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
''PEOPLE in this business are used to saying 'everything is fabulous,' '' a New York decorator said recently.
But the word among many professionals in the design industry is that business this year has been far from fabulous, particularly in New York and the Northeast. Although some firms and decorators report that they have never been busier (''The rich always have money,'' said one New York decorator. ''Thank God my clients are substantial.''), many are feeling the effects of the general economic slowdown, sluggish local real-estate markets and leaner times on Wall Street in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash.
Many decorators, those who are not celebrities but whose businesses were thriving a year ago, tell of reduced budgets, lack of phone calls from prospective clients, protracted bidding procedures, phased installations and the evaporation of ''middle-range'' jobs with budgets of $15,000 to $150,000 - the bread and butter of the business. When the phone rings these days, it's often, as one decorator put it, ''contractors looking for work, or vendors trying to sell me something.'' 
In a business that purveys image, it is not uncommon to hear decorators say that their business is fine, but they've heard others have troubles. ''Nobody wants to look like there's a problem,'' said Alan Lindenfeld, a New York designer. ''But there's definitely a problem.''
Financial data on the decorating industry is difficult to obtain, in part because there are no Government indicators for it. The interior design business is largely a closed, secretive world. Most of the major fabric houses are privately held and do not release sales figures. Many residential decorating concerns are companies composed of one to five people.
A recent survey of the country's 200 largest interior design firms by Cahners Economics, a division of Cahners Publishing, which publishes Interior Design and other magazines, asked the firms to compare this year's residential business to last year. Thirteen percent said the business, which makes up varying portions of their total billings, had increased, 30 percent said it had decreased and 57 percent said it was unchanged.
But in two weeks of interviews, many prominent decorators, manufacturers and contractors admitted to feeling a pinch, especially in the New York City area.
''Business is spotty,'' said Mark McIntire, vice president for marketing at the New York Design Center at 200 Lexington Avenue. ''Some are having record months, but generally, right now it's tough.''
The center, which has 71 showrooms, lost four over the last year, Mr. McIntire said. He described several others as shaky. He said that the customer base of the Center has changed noticeably.
''We used to have the 20- to 40-year-old all-cash customer who was making money on Wall Street,'' Mr. McIntyre said. ''They're not in the market right now. Instead, we're seeing 38- to 60-year-olds who are spending investment income. We're not getting the $400,000 paychecks. We'd sure like to have them back.'' To lure new clients, Mr. McIntire, like many others, has had to get aggressive. This October he will invite 2,000 would-be customers into this to-the-trade-only sanctum, where 100 decorators will be strategically stationed with portfolios and business cards. Such tactics have become necessary, he said, adding, ''If you get into the mentality of not spending, one of the first things you can live without is that $7,000 sofa.''
Showroom personnel at the Decoration & Design Building on Third Avenue say, there is a sense of holding back. ''I don't think people have less money, they're just less eager to spend it,'' said John Brewer, president of Fonthill Ltd.. ''I've heard everyone complaining, from designers at large firms to the housewife decorators.'' His business is ''not down,'' he added. ''I consider that up.''
Edwin W. Bitter, chairman of Scalamandre, said his company is ''not doing too badly, but we're not as active as we should be.'' New York has been hit especially hard, he said, though sales are up 7 percent in Dallas and Houston, and California is doing swimmingly.
''The Californians,'' he said, ''are holding up New York, God bless them.''
Raymond Chevallier, a vice president for F. Schumacher & Company, another well-known fabric company, began to sense a softening of the residential market in the fourth quarter last year. ''It has continued, with some ups and downs through the present,'' he said. But the slowdown ''is definitely regional. We've seen a strong pick-up in business in Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado.''
''We're looking at an attitudinal problem,' said Wallace W. Epperson, a senior vice president of Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. and a furniture industry analyst. ''We're seeing consumers increasingly anxious and nervous.'' Perhaps as a result, he said, personal savings have increased, suggesting that when confidence returns, consumers will have greater liquidity than after past economic slowdowns.
Rod G. Kreitzer, president of the Baker Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Mich., in part blamed his own industry for ''lack of innovation. We've lost our sense of daring. There hasn't been much drawing customers to say, 'Wow, let's change the whole house and hock our future to get it.' ''
There will always be decorators who tell of the client who went antiques shopping with his wife and ''after $1 million, put his foot down.'' But even decorators with stellar clients have noticed a subtle change.
Anthony P. Browne, a Washington decorator whose clients include Andrew Lloyd Webber and Oprah Winfrey, observes a marked contrast to the 1980's: ''People have become more concerned about people noticing what they're spending,'' he said.
Penne Poole, another Washington designer, describes the present moment as one of ''cautious opulence.'' Once she had a steady stream of complete residential projects, she said. Now it comes in phases. ''You'll do the foyer or the dining room, but the living room isn't done. You get these pockets in a house. It's a little unsettling.'' Bunny Williams, a Manhattan decorator, said: ''You don't get five calls a week now. In the 80's, it was, 'Oh, let's call a decorator.' ''
Some clients are forgoing details, like tasseled fringes and chandeliers with a pleated shade on each light. ''They're asking the price of things now,'' said the Manhattan decorator Josef Pricci. ''They're doing the staples and filling in as they feel comfortable.'' Competition among those who perform services for the industry - contractors, craftsmen and skilled laborers - has increased, decorators say. The bidding process is taking longer. ''Where four contractors were competing for a job,'' said Diana Polack, marketing director for G. P. Winter Associates, a New York construction firm, ''there are eight now.''
Brian Kehoe, a professional wallpaper hanger in Manhattan whose business centers on new apartments, said: ''It's job to job now. There's no backlog.'' Glen Hodges, a partner in G Square Inc. in Manhattan, which specializes in kitchens, said he always had plenty of work until last year. Between last March and this spring, ''we didn't sign a single contract,'' he said. ''We lived off the ends of projects. We dried up.''
The firm was recently hired for three new jobs, and Mr. Hodges is convinced the worst is over. ''The people who have names may be O.K.,'' he explained, ''but for people like us, it's been hard.''
After a difficult winter, Carl J. Lana, a Manhattan decorator, began selling accessories and doing consulting work, and he even considered abandoning his chosen career. Recently, things have begun to look up. ''This is what I do,'' he said. ''This is what I love to do. So I'm sticking with it.''
According to Rita Sue Siegel, whose Manhattan firm recruits design professionals, there have been ''significant reductions'' in the last year in requests for both architects and interior designers.
Roslyn Dolber, director of career counseling at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said: ''It's a grim picture. We're seeing real caution in hiring, and we're certainly arming our graduates with that information.''
But many express relief that the decorative frenzy of the 1980's is unwinding and welcome the retrenchment. Overembellishment is even becoming outre.
''There was an abandonment in the 1980's that was almost surreal,'' said Timothy MacDonald, a Manhattan designer. ''It feels like we're back to reality again.''
''It almost came to overkill,'' said Murray Douglas, the senior vice president of Brunschwig & Fils, the fabric house. ''You can't go-go forever.'' She reports inklings that excess fringe is being eclipsed by architectural wallpaper borders.
In New York, at least, introspection can occasionally give rise to black humor. ''People have a sense of wanting to establish permanence and security in their home,'' Mr. Chevallier said, ''especially since they realize they can't sell their home anyway.''

Untangling the Strands of the Wedtech Scandal

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Too Good to Be True
The Outlandish Story of Wedtech
By James Traub
Illustrated. 379 pages. Doubleday. $21.95.
One thinks of the Wedtech scandal as a farce of greed and incompetence. But what James Traub reveals in his penetrating report, ''Too Good to Be True: The Outlandish Story of Wedtech,'' is that considerable genius was involved in the story of the little Bronx military contracting company that grew to be the apple of the Reagan Administration's eye. There had to be genius involved for so many millions of dollars to be lost and stolen and for so many powerful people to be corrupted. 
The rise of Wedtech, originally called the Welbilt Electronic Die Corporation, is essentially a simple story. Wedtech began with John Mariotta, a self-taught mechanical engineer from the South Bronx who liked to call himself a New York Rican, or ''an individual that cannot speak English and cannot speak Spanish.'' It was Mr. Mariotta's genius to be able to build things, as well as to perceive in the American system a bias that set him at a disadvantage to his fellows.
Wedtech sprouted with its discovery that the United States Government would pay you to build things for it, and that if you were a minority member you were more likely to qualify for a contract. The trouble was that Wedtech was not minority-owned; Mr. Mariotta had taken on as an equal partner a death-camp survivor from Israel named Fred Neuberger. So the two men pretended that Mr. Mariotta was the controlling partner. By doing so, they revealed another facet of Wedtech's genius, its ability to misrepresent itself.
Wedtech began to blossom after a Congressman named Mario Biaggi dropped by its offices and offered his influence in Washington in exchange for a $20,000-a-year retainer for his law firm. Wedtech thereby discovered its genius for buying politicians. Now all the pieces were in place; it only remained for everything to grow - the company, the contracts, the things to be built, the politicians and the bribes.
And grow they did, until Wedtech became a multi-million-dollar military contractor whose corrupt influence reached all the way into the Reagan White House. All it took was the company's special genius. The only trouble was that it had fashioned itself into a self-destructing machine. The bigger the contracts it finagled, the greater the sums of money it lost, the more it had to bribe and cheat.
Eventually Wedtech was sunk by pontoons, a huge Navy contract to build motorized bridges to shuttle cargo between ship and shore, a contract that Wedtech never even began to fulfill. As the company went down, the law moved in, and the partners ended up in jail, along with a good many of the people they had bribed. As James Traub puts it: The ''minuteness of exposure may make Wedtech unique in the annals of white-collar crime. Moreover, in their testimony the conspirators who cooperated with the Government offered an amazingly intimate and ramified, if not always completely trustworthy, record of their own thoughts and stratagems.''
Mr. Traub has taken this record and done an unusually thorough job of untangling its details. His prose has dramatic verve. Of the moment when Wedtech met E. Robert Wallach, a lawyer from San Francisco who linked the company up with President Reagan's Counselor at the time, Edwin Meese 3d, he writes: ''What followed was a blinding moment of fusion, as fantasy, guile, political reach, and large quantities of money combined to produce an irresistible force.''
His characters pop up off the page. ''In short order Wallach succeeded in weirding out the straight-arrow Ivy Leaguers in the U.S. Government whom he was trying so hard to impress. He wore a yellow rose in his lapel, as always, and carried his leather shoulder bag, and wafted into and out of rooms like a zephyr from California, and spoke from under the vast canopy of his eyebrows in his painfully quiet and solemn tones.''
If ''Too Good to Be True'' has any flaw, it is that its superabundance of detail sometimes confuses the narrative. Or else Mr. Traub simply forgets where he is occasionally. For instance, he introduces two separate characters as Wedtech's ''nemesis,'' the ''Goddess of Retribution . . . whom men invite when they overreach themselves.'' Yet the threats of both these people - one a Navy captain who disapproved of the pontoon deal and the other a businessman who lost out in the rigged contest for the contract - end up being neutralized. And nemesis ultimately turns out to be the various district attorneys' offices that stumbled on different parts of the Wedtech beast.
But if Mr. Traub's narrative is not always in focus, the lessons of his story are. In the forefront he places the bitter economic paradoxes of the era. To President Reagan, John Mariotta was one of the ''heroes for the 80's'' who proved that free enterprise instead of welfare was the solution ''to providing jobs and training for the hard-core unemployed.'' But what also trickled down was some of the less desirable aspects of laissez-faire capitalism.
Yet behind this story there is a more complicated lesson. As Mr. Traub concludes: John Mariotta may have been paranoid in his belief that the game was fixed against him and that only by cheating could he overcome the odds. But even paranoids have enemies: the military procurement process he ran up against was a game in which special influence did count for practically everything. In short, had he not bent the rules, he never would have gotten to play.
In the end, however, his genius betrayed him, for ''the inventor had infused his creation not only with his energy and passion but with his egotism and his blindness.'' As Mr. Traub writes: ''A man-made thing can't be better than the men who make it, and Wedtech reflected all the virtues, and all the follies and the appetites, of the men who fashioned and guided it. It was a strange and wonderful creature, even noble, yet something corrupt destroyed its greatest possibilities.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Not Cutting Rates Soon

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Despite increased pressure from the Bush Administration for a quick reduction in interest rates, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, suggested today that rates would not be lowered soon, except to offset unusually restrictive commercial lending practices.
The main risk to the economy is ''a shade more'' in the direction of recession than it was last winter, Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee. Still, he said, ''stable credit market conditions at this stage would be appropriate for the best performance of the economy.''
Mr. Greenspan is required by law to report to Congress every six months on monetary policy and the economic outlook. His testimony is closely watched in the financial markets for even the slightest clue about which way interest rates might turn. 
 
Now the Markets Worry
Last week, the markets reacted favorably to testimony in which he hinted that interest rates might be pushed down to balance tighter lending practices by banks. Indeed, the Federal Reserve moved to lower a key rate slightly.
Today's testimony, however, had a dampening effect on the markets. Many traders, who had hoped to hear a clear explanation of why the central bank eased monetary policy last week, felt frustrated that the testimony did not disclose specific details on policy direction.
In addition, the Labor Department's report that the Consumer Price Index rose half a percentage point in June contributed to the markets' declines. [Page D5.] The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.07 points to close at 2,981.68. [Page D8.] In the credit markets, Treasury prices sagged, and long-term interest rates rose sharply. By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were offered at a price of 102 1/4, down 26/32, to yield 8.54 percent. [Page D14.] Cryptic Statements Mr. Greenspan tends to speak cryptically at these sessions, retaining his freedom to change course if economic or political forces warrant.
For example, he said today, as he has many times before, that ''a major cut in the budget'' was the most important way to strengthen the economy. And he promised that the Federal Reserve would act decisively to lower interest rates if tax increases and spending cuts seemed likely to tip the country into a recession.
But he repeatedly refused to quantify the steps the Fed might take in the aftermath of a budget deal between President Bush and Congress. ''What adjustment might be necessary and how it might be timed cannot be spelled out before the fact,'' he said. ''The actions required will depend on the constellation of other influences on the economy, the nature and magnitude of the fiscal policy package and the likely timing of its effects.''
 
Other Points From Testimony
Mr. Greenspan made these other points today:
* He asserted that restrictive bank-lending practices around the country did not amount to a ''credit crunch.'' But he said that ''the tightening is beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects,'' and he gave his first full public assessment of what he thought had caused the situation.
* He offered the Federal Reserve's economic forecast for the rest of this year and next year, predicting economic growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent this year and 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent next year. Those estimates are slightly more pessimistic than the Bush Administration's growth forecasts of 2.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year.
* He provided a new range for money-supply growth next year that was slightly below the current range.
* He expressed concern that despite the relatively low unemployment rate, ''many individuals,'' particularly young people, ''now perceive job opportunities as less abundant.''
 
Leaning Toward High Rates
On balance, Mr. Greenspan's remarks seemed to tilt toward maintaining high interest rates to restrain inflation. The Federal Reserve is the only Government agency that can directly control interest rates. It does so mainly by increasing or decreasing the amount of money available for banks to lend.
The chairman insisted that despite the economy's sluggish growth this year, ''things are not doing all that badly.'' And he said, ''The likelihood of a near-term recession seems low.''
He emphasized that the Federal Reserve's decision last week to push down the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point was made solely to offset the unusual tightening of credit by commercial lenders and had nothing to do with the overall state of the economy. (The Federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans.) Mr. Greenspan called the sharp increase in consumer prices in June an aberration and said it would probably turn around in July. Still, the half-a-percentage-point increase shows that inflation remains a problem that the Fed needs to address.
 
Administration's Preference
That is bad news not only for the financial markets but also for the Bush Administration's top economic policy makers, who have been leaning on Mr. Greenspan for several weeks to push down interest rates.
The Administration wants lower rates for two reasons. First, easier credit would stimulate the economy in the short run, which is good for the party in power in an election year. Second, a stronger economy would generate more tax revenue, and lower rates would reduce total interest payments. Higher tax revenue, in turn, would lower the budget deficit.
At a news conference Monday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was asked whether the slight drop in the Federal funds rate last week was adequate. Mr. Brady replied, ''As the minister said, 'All donations gratefully received.' ''
Mr. Greenspan and most of the other policy makers at the Federal Reserve argue, however, that the only way to guarantee long-term economic growth is to keep a tight rein on inflation.
 
'A Semantic Nicety'
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged today that some commercial borrowers were having a difficult time getting loans. But he said, ''I would not call this change technically a credit crunch, as those words connote a contraction of lending on a major scale, with many borrowers effectively shut out of credit markets regardless of qualifications.''
He conceded that such a view might be ''perceived as a semantic nicety by a borrower who today is suddenly unable to get a loan on the terms formerly available,'' but he contended that credit was not abnormally tight.
Rather, lending procedures have returned to normal after ''the excesses of the 1980's,'' he said.
''When you go from excess credit creation to normal, it can feel like a tightening,'' Mr. Greenspan added.
The credit situation would require ''continued scrutiny,'' he said, but he gave no indication that it would lead to a further lowering of rates.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Sour Investment By Pension Funds

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
A $425 MILLION deal that was widely heralded last year as the entry of American pension funds into Europe's real estate markets has been hammered recently by high interest rates in Britain, and the investors that took part in the deal have watched the value of the properties drop sharply in the last few months.
Last July the Chicago-based JMB Realty Corporation made an investment in Randsworth Trust P.L.C., a British real estate concern, in partnership with some of this country's largest pension funds. Since the start of the year, Randsworth has seen its portfolio of high-profile West London office and retail space fall some 6 percent in value.
Late last month, JMB told its institutional partners that the Randsworth partnership was paying out too much on its floating-rate debt and that its plan to sell some of the properties in the first few years of ownership was being stymied by the weak real estate market. 
JMB's problems with Randsworth are a sign that difficult times in the commercial real estate business are affecting even the most sophisticated players, and it also puts the risks of global real estate investing in sharp relief.
JMB Acquisition Partners, the limited partnership that holds about 16 percent of Randsworth, called on the partners to come up with about $34 million that they had earlier agreed to provide, but it also sought an additional $100 million from the partners to help pay down debt and avoid having to sell properties in the weakened London market.
''The sensible thing to do is to put some additional capital in and pay down debt,'' said Neil G. Bluhm, the president of JMB.
Randsworth's cash problems surprised the pension fund partners. The original $425 million buyout, valued at about $800 million when refinanced debt is included, was designed to be highly leveraged to help protect the pension funds against currency swings. But the upward push of British interest rates and the weak London property market left the partnership short of cash to make capital improvements on Randsworth's properties.
The money that Randsworth is seeking from its equity partners will eventually reduce the debt-to-equity ratio in the deal to 50-50 from the original 75-25 level.
Among the investors being asked to ante up more cash are the public employee pension funds for Massachussets, Oregon and Illinois, and the employee pension funds of A.T.&T. and Ameritech, and AMB Pension, a pension fund for public employees in the Netherlands.
JMB paid about $425 million last summer to buy the publicly traded shares of Randsworth. That was 325 pence, about $5.88 at current exchange rates, for each share, or a 2 percent premium over the book value of the shares. The equity in the original deal was about 190 million, or $340 million. Of that sum the pension fund partners contributed about $290 million, JMB contributed 16 percent, or about $50 million. The rest of the price was raised through bonds and British bank loans. Recently the properties in the Randsworth portfolio were reappraised in London and the portfolio's value was downgraded by about 6 percent. The increased borrowing costs from high British interest rates and the lower asset value of the portfolio caused Randsworth to hit its loan limits with the British banks, leaving it with insufficient money for capital improvements or further investments without calling on the pension fund partners.
In an earlier sign of the international worries about real estate, Citicorp had a difficult time trying to syndicate a $425 million loan that was part of the permanent financing for the Randsworth acquisition. The loan was to repay a bridge loan that JMB raised to help finance its bid, retire Randsworth's outstanding debt and provide working capital.
Over the last year, American institutional investors and real estate developers have been scrambling to make investments in European real estate markets because the returns in much of Europe are better than those in the United States, where overbuilding has crippled the market in many regions. The economic integration of the European Community and the political upheaval in Eastern Europe have also led many experts to predict that property values in leading commercial cities like London, Paris and Frankfurt will continue to appreciate sharply during the next decade, with demand outpacing supply.
Randsworth's portfolio of London properties includes about 650,000 square feet of prime London office space.
JMB, one of the largest privately held real estate concerns in the country, has absorbed enormous amounts of real estate and several sizable companies over the last several years. It has more than $22 billion worth of property under its management - part of it for JMB's own account and the rest for its clients.
The company has one of the strongest followings among institutional investors of any privately held concern in the country. This has allowed JMB to raise billions of dollars for acquisitions and investments from the big pension funds.

HEADLINE: Loss Reported At HomeFed

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 18

 BODY:
The HomeFed Corporation, the parent of HomeFed Bank, a San Diego-based savings institution, today reported a second-quarter loss of $108.2 million after setting up a loss provision of $234 million to cover a rise in problem real estate loans.
The loss is in contrast to a profit of $28.1 million, or $1.20 a share, reported in the comparable period a year earlier. 
''We have loaned out of state, and in general the out-of-state lending has been where we have experience problems,'' said William D. Nichol, HomeFed's chief financial officer.
Mr. Nichol said many apartment loans and some commercial loans in Florida and in the Washington, D.C., area soured this year along with a regional economic slowdown.
The shares of HomeFed fell $1.75 each today, to $19, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Price Index Surged 0.5% Last Month

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Surges in the prices of food, housing and gasoline led to a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices in June, the Labor Department said today. The unexpectedly sharp rise followed two months of more modest advances and moved the annual rate of inflation up to 5.9 percent so far this year.
The seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index had increased by two-tenths of 1 percent each in April and May, and the bigger increase last month was a disappointment to economists and Government officials, who had been predicting inflation would decline.
The 5.9 percent annualized inflation rate compared with a price increase of 4.6 percent for all of last year, a 4.4 percent rise in 1988 and a 4.4 percent gain in 1987. 
 
A Blow to the Markets
Given the renewed worries about inflation, combined with the suggestion today by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the Fed would not lower rates soon except to counter a credit contraction, the stock and bond markets retreated.
Consumer prices had increased steeply in January, following a cold spell in December that cut supplies of produce and reduced fuel oil supplies. But until today's report, those increases had been moderating.
There were wide differences of opinion about the signficance of the June change. Some economists suggested it was a monthly blip in a decelerating trend, while others expressed worry about gains in the underlying rate of inflation.
Noting the fall in housing construction for the fifth straight month, some economists also said the risks of recession now appeared greater than the risks of inflation.
 
View of Stability
David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, observed that excluding more volatile food and energy sectors, consumer inflation remained stable.
In his Congressional testimony today, Mr. Greenspan took a similar approach, arguing that while the index was ''higher than one would like to see, it doesn't, in my judgment, fundamentally affect the underlying trends.''
Mr. Wyss suggested that special factors were at work in the volatile sectors. The increase in gasoline prices to consumers, contrasted with declines at the wholesale level, he noted, showed that retailers were ''jacking up'' margins. Higher homeowner costs, he added, reflected rising state and local property taxes.
Michael L. Penzer, senior economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco, and Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, contended that the underlying trend of inflation was declining.
 
An Abating Core Rate
The core rate of the index, which excludes the volatile food and energy areas, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June, or a 5.5 percent annual rate. In the first half of 1990, the core rate rose by a 5.7 percent annual rate. In all of 1989, the increase was 4.4 percent.
But Mr. Roach said he was worried about accelerating labor costs. Unit labor costs, representing compensation increases adjusted for productivity gains, rose 5 percent in 1989 and are likely to rise ''at least as much'' this year, he said.
From 1983 to 1988, unit labor costs, which account for about two-thirds of total production costs, rose an average of 3 percent annually.
Today's index showed that grocery store food prices, which registered declines in each of the preceding two months, increased 1 percent in June, a month in which they normally fall. All of the major food groups, particularly meats, poultry, fish, eggs, fruits and vegetables, were higher in price.
 
Higher Fresh Vegetables
Fresh vegetable prices, which increased 29.2 percent in the first two months of the year and then declined 23.6 percent in the next three months, advanced 1.4 percent in June. Tomato prices rose 16.2 percent.
Gasoline prices, which normally rise with the higher demand created by the summer vacation season, climbed a hefty 2.5 percent in June, after falling 1.6 percent in May.
Energy costs over all were up six-tenths of 1 percent. The price of natural gas shot up 2.7 percent, but fuel oil prices declined by 4.2 percent and electricity was off by 1.6 percent.
Clothing prices declined for the second consecutive month, off one-tenth of 1 percent in June, reflecting larger-than-usual seasonal falls in prices for both men's and girls' apparel.
Housing costs over all rose six-tenths of 1 percent in June, following a two-tenths of 1 percent increase in May. For their shelter, homeowners paid 1.1 percent more and renters paid four-tenths of 1 percent more during June.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Drop

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report continued to decline in the week ended yesterday.
''The decline in yields reflects the Federal Reserve's action last Friday to reduce basic interest rates,'' said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's. ''Where we go from here will depend on the budget talks now under way in Washington. Because the budget talks now dominate interest rates, we can expect yields to fluctuate with the prospects for a meaningful outcome of these negotiations.'' 
As for the tax-exempt sector, Stephen C. Shachat, portfolio manager at the Evergreen Tax-Exempt Money Market Fund, said: ''We expect yields to remain stable until the new supply of debt, including some $5 billion of municipal notes, comes to market in the next few weeks. This should cause rates to move upward.''
As it was, managers of tax-exempt funds increased the average number of days that securities are held in their portfolios to 51 days, from 49 days in last week's report.
The assets were unchanged at $78.9 billion, with the average seven-day compounded yield down 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.23 percent, and the 30-day average yield off 3 basis points, to 5.37 percent.
For investors in the 28 percent bracket, the equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield would be 7.26 percent, while it would be 7.81 percent for those in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million surveyed by IBC/Donogue's, the Strong Municipal Market Fund topped the list with a yield of 6.29 percent. The Strong fund is distributed by Strong/ Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee.
The assets of taxable funds increased by $3.2 billion, to a total of $382.4 billion. Those of institutional funds rose by $2.5 billion, to $82.0 billion. The gains were again attributed to a narrowing of yield spreads between certificates of deposit and money market funds.
The average days to maturity of taxable securities held in managers' portfolios increased to 44 from 43.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund was unchanged at 7.95 percent, while the 30-day average slipped 2 basis points, to 7.95 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Alger Money Market Portfolio, distributed by Fred Alger & Company of Jersey City, showed the best return for the third consecutive week, with a yield of 8.82 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 18.07 in Heavy Program Selling

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Investors turned cautious yesterday amid heavy program selling, depressing stock prices for the first time in more than a week and leaving the Dow 3,000 level as a barrier still to be crossed.
By the end of the day the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 2,981.68, down 18.07 points.
The bellwether Dow average has, in fact, pierced the barrier several times since it first broke through last Friday but it has never been able to hold above that level until the close of a trading day, and, the record does not really count until it does.
Trading volume slumped a bit, to 168.8 million shares, from 176.8 million the day before. Stocks that fell outnumbered those that gained by 1,030 to 483. 60 Stocks at New Lows Sixty stocks set new lows, including Polaroid, the instant-photo camera company. After reporting a 23 percent drop in profits, it slid 3 1/4 to close at 36 in heavy trading; during the day it reached a new low of 35 1/4. 
''Three thousand is giving people pause,'' said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ''It's just a psychological constraint. We're going into territory we've never been before, and that makes people pause and think if stocks are expensive at these levels.''
David B. Bostian, chief economist for Jesup, Josephthal & Company, said, ''You've had three attempts'' to reach 3,000 ''and they failed.''
Referring to statements before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, he added, ''And there was nothing in Greenspan's testimony that the market could read into the lowering of interest rates,'' a move that would send the market up again.
Mr. Bostian said that ''the euphoria'' over the easing of interest rates last Friday ''is now over'' and ''there's no immediate prospect of a further reduction.''
Moreover, he argued, investors might soon begin to focus on the budget talks in Washington, with their ''risk of tax increases'' and the posssibility that if Congress and the Administration are unable to negotiate an agreement, automatic spending cuts would be imposed by law.
 
Transportation Issues Tumble
Along with the decline in the Dow industrials, the Dow transportation stocks tumbled 16.06, to 1,171.53. UAL rose 1/2, to 162 1/2, after its nonunion workers joined in a union effort to buy the air carrier, but AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 2 7/8, to 61 5/8, after reporting lower second-quarter profits. Delta Air Lines fell 2 3/8, to 73, after Paul P. Karos, airline analyst at the First Boston Corporation, cut his earnings estimates for Delta and AMR. Conrail fell 1 3/8, to 49 5/8, after reporting lower profits.
Among the industrials, United Technologies, which fell 1 1/2, to 60 1/2, was the only Dow blue chip to sink as much as a point. A.T.&T. rose 1/8, to 37 1/8; Coca-Cola rose 1/8, to 47 3/8; Philip Morris fell 3/8, to 50 1/8, and I.B.M. fell 7/8, to 119 7/8, all in heavy trading.
United Telecommunications, the phone company, which fell 8 3/4 Tuesday after reporting a 55 percent drop in profits, topped the New York Stock Exchange active list for the second day, falling another 2 1/4, to 27 1/4, with 10.03 million shares changing hands.
MCI, the long-distance company, which fell 1 5/8 Tuesday, fell another 1 7/8, to 36 1/2, on nearly 13 million shares, making it the most heavily traded stock in yesterday's over-the-counter trading.
Century Telephone rose 1 1/4, to 32 1/4, in a weak telephone group. Bell Atlantic fell 1, to 45 3/8; Nynex fell 1 1/8, to 78 1/8, and Rochester Telephone fell 1 3/8, to 32 5/8.
Drug stocks also weakened. Warner Lambert fell 1 7/8, to 67 1/4, and American Home Products fell 2 1/8, to 52 1/4, despite higher profits. Lilly fell 3 7/8, to 85, after a New York woman charged in a suit that its drug Prozac made her try to kill herself. But Pfizer rose 2, to 71 1/4, and Upjohn rose 2 3/8, to 43 7/8, a new high, after favorable earnings reports.
Birinyi Associates said heavy program trading - largely selling -clipped nearly 19 points off the Dow. The S.&P. 500 index fell 3.30, to 364.22; the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.66, to 460.82, and the Amex market-value index fell 2.33, to 362.06.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Higher in U.S.; Gold Prices Are Down a Bit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher in choppy trading yesterday after falling overseas, as Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, failed to erase confusion over American interest rates.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $361.60 an ounce, down 40 cents from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $361.10, off 60 cents. 
In discussing monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said rates would not be lowered soon except to offset unusually restrictive commercial lending practices.
Some currency dealers said they interpreted the remarks to mean that a drop in rates was forthcoming. But others said the remarks confused the markets.
 
'Playing With Words'
''We're not quite sure what Greenspan is up to,'' a London dealer said. ''He appears to be playing with words, which could be dangerous.''
Adding to the confusion was a report from the Labor Department showing that consumer prices had climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in June, more than double the rate of the last two months.
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar fell to 147.25 Japanese yen, from 148.20 yen on Tuesday. It traded at 147.45 yen in London, and at 147.765 yen in New York, down from 147.80 yen.
The dollar was mixed against the pound compared with late Tuesday's figure. Sterling traded at $1.8205 in London, up from $1.8115, and at $1.81525 in New York, down from $1.8165.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, were: 1.6480 German marks, up from 1.6440; 1.41585 Swiss francs, up from 1.4048; 5.5285 French francs, up from 5.5155; 1,207.00 Italian lire, up from 1,204.25, and 1.15425 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15295.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $360.25 an ounce, from $361.25 on Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $359.85 from $361.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell by $1.71, to $360.15.
Silver prices were up.

Times Co. Profit Dropped in the 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported yesterday that income in the second quarter fell to $26.8 million, or 35 cents a share, down 35.1 percent from net income of $41.3 million, or 53 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter of 1989.
Second-quarter profits were down 31.6 percent from income from continuing operations of $39.2 million, or 50 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Times Company revenues rose 1.9 percent in the quarter, to $468.9 million, from $460.3 million in the comparable period last year. 
The company said the main reasons for its lower profits were lower advertising lineage at The New York Times, which reflected continuing weakness in the New York region's economy; a reduction of 7 cents a share as a result of acquiring McCall's magazine in July 1989, a deal structured to maximize cash flow, and a reduction of 8 cents a share because of higher depreciation and interest expense related to construction. The company completed the building for The New York Times's new color production and distribution plant in Edison, N.J., and it built a plant for The Gwinnett Daily News in Georgia, one of its regional newspapers.
Eric Philo, a publishing analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the earnings were a little better than expected in part because of the performance of the regional newspapers. But he said economic weakness was spreading to other parts of the country, and he does not expect the regional papers to show the growth in the second half that they showed in the quarter.
 
Two Special Items
The Times Company said that except for the acquisition of McCall's and the construction expenses, second-quarter earnings would have equaled the results from continuing operations a year earlier.
The company said operating profit in this year's second quarter for the newspaper group declined to $50.1 million from $67 million in the second quarter of 1989. The group consists of The New York Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in The International Herald Tribune.
Advertising volume at The New York Times declined 13.4 percent, to 24.7 million lines, in the second quarter. Average circulation for The Times in the first half reached new highs of 1,133,400 copies on weekdays, up 45,700 copies, and 1,713,200 on Sundays, up 65,100 copies.
Advertising volume for the 35 regional newspapers increased 2.5 percent, to 9.7 million inches, in the second quarter. Circulation also increased at the regional newspapers, to 880,200 copies on Sundays, up 16,900 copies, and to 901,700 copies on weekdays, up 19,700 copies. Circulation was 77,400 for the non-dailies, up 1,000 copies.
Profits from the company's Magazine Group were down because of the acquisition of McCall's, while results from the Broadcasting/Information Service Group held even and earnings in the Forest Products Group declined, reflecting softness in the newsprint market and unfavorable Canadian currency exchange rates.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Kohl Gets German Spotlight But Genscher Had the Vision

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, July 19

 BODY:
The man of the hour of German unity may be Chancellor Helmut Kohl, but the man who first saw it coming is certainly Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
In the mid-1980's when almost everybody else distrusted the gleam of ''new thinking'' in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's eye, Mr. Genscher was urging Mr. Kohl and skeptical Western leaders to take the new leader at his word and seize the opportunity to end the division of Europe and Germany.
When the breakthrough was announced at a spa in the Northern Caucasus on Monday - and the Soviet leader said that he had agreed to a united Germany in the NATO alliance - Mr. Gorbachev paid tribute to the 50 hours of meetings between Mr. Genscher and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union that paved the way.
For the man who has been West German Foreign Minister for 16 years -and a man who had been accused more than once of being willing to sell out a Chancellor, or even the whole Western alliance if it would assure success for his own small Free Democratic Party - it was a moment of quiet satisfaction. 
 
'Both Need Each Other'
''Kohl and Genscher are both too self-important and ambitious not to begrudge each other a success that each feels he earned on his own,'' said one official who knows both of them. ''But both need each other and know it too well to let it show too openly.''
Mr. Genscher never criticizes Mr. Kohl in public, but there is considerable sparring behind the scenes.
When Mr. Kohl named one of his own aides, Horst Teltschik, as his personal representative to Poland last year, Mr. Genscher was furious, his aides say, and he blocked the Chancellor from giving the aide the same assignment to Czechoslovakia.
Mr. Genscher's aides say that he nearly split the coalition Government in early 1989 by repeatedly saying that NATO should not deploy new American short-range nuclear missiles here to replace the old Lance system. Finally, Mr. Kohl went along with Mr. Genscher and President Bush acquiesced.
This spring, while Mr. Kohl was hesitating to rule out a change in the German-Polish border after unification, Mr. Genscher kept saying that anybody who did not rule out a change was damaging the cause of German unity.
Mr. Kohl finally came around on that one, too.
 
Satisfaction of Being Right
''It is not very often given to a politician to turn out to be right,'' Mr. Genscher said a few days ago. ''Even less often it happens while he's still alive, and yet more rarely while he's still in office. I have the advantage of all three together.''
It is not gratitude or personal warmth but political necessity that keeps Mr. Kohl and Mr. Genscher together, their aides say, in a coalition that Mr. Kohl may no longer think he needs if he can win an absolute majority of votes in the all-German elections that are now planned for Dec. 2.
Until he does, he will continue to need the 63-year-old Mr. Genscher, who grew up in Halle and has been dreaming of making Germany whole again ever since it was partitioned by the Allies, leaving Halle in the Soviet Zone, later East Germany.
Taken prisoner by the United States Army the day before the war ended and held briefly, Mr. Genscher, who had been drafted into the Wehrmacht, returned to his mother in Halle and moved to the West in 1952 as a politically active lawyer.
 
Christmas Visits to East
Mr. Genscher began making annual private Christmas visits back to Halle after it became possible in the early 1970's, even after he became Interior Minister in 1969 and Foreign Minister in 1974.
For years he has endured innuendo about the reasons for his ''soft'' approach to the Soviet Union, both inside and outside his country.
During the Reagan Administration, Richard R. Burt, the American Ambassador to Bonn, described the Foreign Minister as ''slippery.'' Mr. Genscher's relationship with Secretary of State George P. Shultz was terrible, diplomats who observed these things say.
With unification fast approaching, Mr. Genscher's trips home have become even more frequent. On Friday, he is going back to Halle for the second time in two weeks, to mingle with crowds that consider him a big hero, bringing local entrepreneurs and West German bankers together to discuss how to rebuild the East German economy and speaking about foreign policy to students of the Martin Luther University summer school.
 
An Active World Traveler
Here in West Germany, Mr. Genscher is far more popular than either his party or his Chancellor, according to all the major public opinion polls. The catalogue of his diplomatic trips around the world now takes up 11 single-spaced, small-print pages in one recent book about him.
Mr. Genscher, now often affectionately described by grateful citizens as ''Genschman,'' has not always been so popular. In September 1982, he withdrew his Free Democrats from a 13-year coalition with the Social Democratic Party, bringing down Helmut Schmidt as Chancellor and incurring his undying contempt.
By switching allegiance to the Christian Democrats, Mr. Genscher brought Mr. Kohl to power. His high-profile foreign policy has helped his party survive, though the pace has taken its toll on him. In frail health ever since a long bout of tuberculosis after the war, he suffered a heart attack last summer that took him out of action for weeks.
Next Monday, before an intense fall schedule, he will attend the opening of the Bayreuth Festival - Wagner's ''Der Fliegende Hollander'' - and retreat later in the week to a vacation home in Berchtesgaden, in the Bavarian Alps, until the middle of August.
 
Clues From Gorbachev in 1986
Mr. Genscher apparently formed his view that Mr. Gorbachev might deliver the key to German unity during his first encounter with the Soviet leader in the summer of 1986.
A few months later, Mr. Kohl sent German-Soviet relations into a deep freeze by comparing, in an interview with a West German magazine, Mr. Gorbachev's public relations skills with those of the Nazi propaganda chief, Joseph Goebbels.
But on Feb. 1 of the following year, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Genscher sounded prophetic: ''If there should be a chance today that, after 40 years of East-West confrontation, there could be a turning point in East-West relations, it would be a mistake of historical dimension for the West to let this chance slip just because it cannot escape from a way of thinking which invariably expects the worst from the Soviet Union.''
''Let us not sit back idly and wait for Mr. Gorbachev to deliver,'' Mr. Genscher said. ''Let us rather try to influence, expedite and shape developments from our end.''
''Our motto can only be, he went on, 'Let us take Mr. Gorbachev seriously. let us take him at his word,' ''
 
Three Years of Achievements
What he proposed instead sounds remarkably similar to what he and Mr. Kohl have largely achieved three years later - a comprehensive package of arms reductions, an all-European security structure building on the mechanisms set up in 1975 by the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, large-scale Western financial help for the Soviet Union to modernize its economy and a gradual end to the divisions of the Continent.
NATO has accepted most of this now, agreeing to study the aid question while letting Germany go ahead and provide what it can already. But only a little more than a year ago, Mr. Genscher was suspected in many NATO capitals of being an apostle of appeasement, for which ''Genscherism'' became the synonym. Now, Mr. Genscher jokes, it's a mass movement.
But in April 1989, Mr. Genscher raised eyebrows in the West German Parliament during a debate on new short-range nuclear missiles.
''We are talking about systems that can reach the territory of Poland and Czechoslovakia,'' he said and added, in reference to East Germany, missiles that could reach ''the other part of our Fatherland.''
This, he stressed, despite the fact that all West German officials had sworn an oath to provide for the well-being of the German people.
''The obligation deriving from that oath does not stop at the border cutting through Germany,'' he said then. ''The responsibility for the nation established by that oath does not exclude my native region, the town where I was born, nor the people in the G.D.R. Indeed, it includes them.''
A turning point, his aides say, was his role in negotiating free passage out of Czechoslovakia and Hungary last fall for thousands of East Germans who had taken refuge in the West German embassies. Aides who accompanied them on trains through East Germany said it was clear from the cheering by East Germans along the rail line that the Iron Curtain was cracking and was bound to break.
Mr. Genscher, in the West German Embassy in Prague, described the moment of freedom as ''the most beautiful moment of my political career.''

HEADLINE: Higher Fares, Less Reward: New York Cabs Hit a Slump

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The taxi industry in New York City has undergone sweeping changes in the last 18 months that have made the business less rewarding for drivers and owners.
Some of the changes result from enforcing regulations aimed at improving service and deterring fare-gouging. Drivers complain that the enforcement campaign has made their jobs more difficult and more expensive.
At the same time, an economic slump in the city has virtually wiped out the benefits for drivers of a Jan. 7 fare increase because there are fewer customers.
 
Leasing Fees Rise
While there are no official statistics on taxi ridership, dozens of drivers interviewed last week said the increase, which averaged 12 percent, did not add to their earnings because medallion owners pocketed much of the increase by raising their leasing fees. 
For owners, the industry's distress is reflected in a highly unusual decline in the value of medallions for at least half of the city's 11,787 taxis.
One new rule from the Taxi and Limousine Commission has had a far-reaching impact - a rule that forces new owners of single-cab medallions to drive their cabs full time. The rule has made the medallions less desirable investments and has reduced their value.
Industry experts say that a single-cab medallion, which sold last year for a record $144,000, has lost 10 percent of its value and is now selling for less than $129,000 - the first time that medallion prices have ever dropped after a fare increase. Taxi commission officials said a broker reported selling a medallion last week for $119,000.
The number of medallions has been frozen since 1937. Half are reserved for fleet operators and half for owners of single cabs. Only medallion cabs may legally cruise for passengers in most of Manhattan.
As part of its enforcement campaign, the commission is issuing summonses for violations of safety rules, dress codes and other regulations that had long been virtually ignored. While the crackdown is aimed at improving service and is not expected to result in any shortages of drivers or cabs, many cabbies contend the changes are so onerous that they will ultimately force some of the best drivers out of business.
 
Aggressive Enforcement
''The Taxi Commission has taken away the incentive for people to buy a medallion as an investment, and it has effectively discouraged drivers who want to buy a medallion and drive it short term,'' said Nat Goldbetter, vice president of Medallion Transfer Inc., a New York taxi brokerage. ''The agency is also bombing guys with summonses and making life extremely difficult and driving guys to go into other occupations.''
Cabdrivers, medallion brokers and some industry officials blame the decline in medallion values and what they say are their financial woes on the aggressive enforcement of regulations initiated by Jack S. Lusk, who became Commissioner in 1988.
After taking over, Mr. Lusk began driving cabs occasionally to try to determine ways to improve service. In doing so, he noticed what he thought were areas that could be improved through stricter enforcement of commission regulations. Mr. Lusk has said that enforcement would improve the appearance and maintenance of cabs and the quality of service.
 
Overcharging Customers
Since then, the number of summonses issued to taxi drivers has increased markedly. In the fiscal year that ended in June 1989, the commission handed out 86,691 summonses, 81 percent more than the 48,000 issued in the fiscal year 1988. For the 1990 fiscal year, ended in June, the commission issued 113,350 summonses.
The most common summonses have been for overcharging customers, an offense that carries a $100 minimum fine; failure to bring a vehicle in for inspection, $100 minimum, and refusing to pick up a customer, $200 minimum.
In the weakening economy, the increase in leasing rates that followed the fare increase delivered another serious blow.
The Taxi Commission estimates that leasing rates for fleet taxis increased by about 9 percent for daytime drivers and by about 6 percent for nighttime drivers. As a result, drivers who work during the day should have kept about 60 percent of the fare increase and drivers who work at night about 75 percent, the commission said.
But taxi-leasing officials and fleet owners said that while leasing rates have risen only marginally compared to the taxi fare increase, their drivers have been hurt by the slow economy and layoffs in the financial services industry.
The recent increase in the motor vehicle tax for medallion cabs to $1,000 a year from $100 on Dec. 1, 1989 - has also cut into profits.
 
Decline in Value
''We are aware that business is off substantially across the board, especially at night so that the drivers are probably not making as much as was anticipated at the time of the fare raise,'' said Betty Lawrence, executive director of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents 18 taxi fleets.
The cabbies say driving a taxicab was more attractive when people knew they could save up enough to buy a medallion, then lease it full time. Often, they said, drivers bought medallions intending to operate cabs for a few years and then lease the medallion to other drivers. The medallion became an extremely lucrative investment, and its price skyrocketed from $60,000 in 1980 to a high of $144,000 in 1989 because of the leasing power.
Under the new rule, owners of individual medallions bought after January must drive the cabs themselves at least 210 nine-hour shifts a year. Leasing is allowed at other times.
''This is not the way it was supposed to be,'' said Eddy Jacques, a 26-year-old cabby from Brooklyn who after only three years is getting out of the taxi business to become a bank teller. ''Owning a medallion just isn't worth it, man. No matter how hard you work you'll always be tied to the driver's seat.''
 
Little Sympathy
Since the new ownership rules went into effect on Jan. 1, business has been off by about 50 percent at Medallion Transfer, the brokerage, which last year sold about 120 medallions but expects to make only 60 transactions this year, Mr. Goldbetter said. ''We get a lot of inquiries but very few buyers, especially when people learn of the new rule,'' he said.
Frands Fequiere, a 35-year-old taxi driver and medallion owner from the Bronx, said he paid $60,000 for his medallion in 1980. He now says that he regrets not selling it last year when the market was at a high and there were plenty of buyers.
''Now, no one wants to buy, and I am starting to lose all the equity that I built up over the last decade,'' Mr. Fequiere said. ''Jack Lusk has dismantled the the business side of the taxi industry.''
Mr. Lusk displays scant sympathy for the complaints of those who possess medallions or hope to own them. ''As a regulator, my job is not to be worried about the price of a medallion,'' he said. ''Our major concern is that passengers get a safe, clean, comfortable ride to their destination.''
Mr. Lusk said consumers - many of whom have grown accustomed to dirty cabs and drivers who speak little English and do not know the city - are seeing an improvement in the quality of service and the condition of cabs.
 
Professor's View
He attributes the change to the commission's new inspection center in Woodside, Queens, where taxis are required to undergo a rigorous battery of tests three times a year to insure among other things that meters are properly calibrated and the vehicle is correctly aligned. He also cites tougher English and geography tests that are given to new drivers.
Prof. Elizabeth Roistacher, an economist at Queens College who studies the taxi industry, said she gives Mr. Lusk high marks for the stringent ownership requirements and increased enforcement.
''Absentee ownership, where a medallion owner doesn't drive the cab, shifts all the responsibility to the driver who has little interest in providing good service,'' Professor Roistacher said. ''But people who operate their own cabs take better care of them and their customers.''
An average cabdriver who leases a medallion can net from $500 to $700 in a five-day week working from 10 to 11 hours a day. Cabbies who own a medallion make a little more, netting about $960 a week for 11 hours' work. But they must subtract payments on the financing of their medallions, which average about $375 a week.
Victor Vega, 48, who has been driving a cab for 14 years, said that in the last month commission inspectors have twice issued him summonses for ''trivial'' violations, including his allowing a passenger to leave his cab at the airport before reaching the curb. Mr. Vega said the passenger had insisted on getting out. ''If you are ugly, you get a ticket in this business,'' Mr. Vega said.
Some drivers say that low pay, long hours and increasing crime are driving them to pursue other jobs and that the commission needs to find ways to make driving a taxi a more desirable career.
''I think in the end the consumer is not getting the better service because they are not getting the best possible drivers,'' Mr. Goldbetter said. ''If life was easier, they would attract better drivers. In London, the cabdriver is treated as a professional, but here they are treated like dirt.''

HEADLINE: China Faults U.S. Shift on Cambodia

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 19

 BODY:
China issued a stern and disappointed response today to the American announcement that Washington was withdrawing support for China's closest ally in Cambodia and beginning direct talks with Vietnam, China's bitterest rival in Asia.
Jin Guihua, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China would stand by its current policy and continue to back its ally, the Communist Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge are one of the three groups in the guerrilla coalition fighting the Cambodian Government of Hun Sen, which is backed by Vietnam.
''So long as Vietnam does not genuinely withdraw all its troops from Cambodia, China will continue to support the Cambodian people in their resistance against the foreign invaders and their just struggle for national independence,'' Mr. Jin said at a briefing today. 
On Wednesday in Paris, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced that the United States was withdrawing its support for the Cambodian guerrilla coalition including the Khmer Rouge, who caused the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during their rule in the 1970's.
 
Ties With Hanoi Possible
Mr. Baker said the change in policy was necessary to prevent the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, and the Administration also signaled that the talks with Vietnam could eventually lead to a restoration of American diplomatic relations with Hanoi.
Today Mr. Jin made it clear that China considered it a grave mistake to favor Vietnam over the guerrilla groups, since Vietnam's invasion and continued presence in Cambodia are, in the Chinese view, the principal cause of the draining conflict in the poverty-stricken country.
China was joined in its implicit criticism of the United States by other Asian officials. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia, the current chairman of the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has been a sponsor of peace talks, said, ''We sincerely doubt whether at this stage of negotiation such a move would help toward reaching a comprehensive solution that is mutually acceptable.'' [The official Vietnam News Agency quoted Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, as approving of the American move, the Associated Press reported. Mr. Thach was quoted as saying Hanoi wanted ''an early, fair and equitable solution'' and ''is ready to negotiate with concerned countries on the Cambodia issue.''] Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of one of the two non-Communist groups in the guerrilla coalition, issued a statement from North Korea, where he lives part of the year. He condemned the American move as a ''very serious injustice'' that would only stiffen the guerrillas' resolve to carry on their military campaign.
 
China's Words Are Measured
While the Chinese response today was stern, it was also measured, and Mr. Jin reiterated positive remarks about progress being made in United Nations-sponsored talks on the Cambodian problem. Noting that ''differences of view still exist,'' Mr. Jin said progress had been made at the most recent session of the talks, held Tuesday in Paris.
This appeared to leave open the possibility that a more elaborate deal might be under negotiation between the United States, China, Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other parties.
There were no direct signs that such a deal might be in the works, but some diplomats expressed surprise that such a harsh American blow to the Chinese position had not brought stronger language or action from Beijing.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman did hint that China may fight the American shift in the United Nations, where the guerrilla coalition holds the seat for Cambodia.
Mr. Jin noted that the guerrilla coalition groups have had the support of more than 100 other nations in their desire to keep the seat from being given to the Hun Sen Government. He added that the seat ''should not be left vacant'' before a political solution to the conflict is reached.
Asked about Mr. Baker's announcement that the United States would start talks with Vietnam over Cambodia, Mr. Jin said, ''This is a matter between the United States and Vietnam.'' $100 Million in Chinese Support American officials estimate that China provides as much as $100 million a year in military and other support to the Khmer Rouge, which has the largest and most powerful force among the guerrillas.
Diplomats here said today that China's resistance to a direct Vietnamese role has been bolstered by the fact that recent Chinese attempts to negotiate with Hanoi had apparently failed to do anything but leave a trail of hurt feelings and hardened positions. After a meeting in Hanoi and another in Beijing this year between the enemies, Chinese officials came out of the meetings saying the Vietnamese were intransigent and rude, the diplomats said.
Mr. Jin said today that the Hun Sen Government and Vietnam had taken a ''rigid pose'' in the talks and had resisted ''reasonable formulas'' for achieving peace.
 
U.S. Official Is Hopeful
WASHINGTON, July 19 - A senior Bush Administration official today expressed hope that the Chinese criticism of United States policy would not influence what he called China's increasingly helpful position in talks seeking free elections in Cambodia.
''I would prefer to look at their actions around the negotiating tables rather than at their public comments,'' he said. ''We have taken every opportunity to tell the Chinese that they have an important role to play in bringing peace to Cambodia. It is very crucial to get the Chinese to back the process since they are only ones who can bring the pressure to bear on the Khmer Rouge.''

HEADLINE: Manila Assesses Damage and High Cost of Quake

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, July 19

 BODY:
As the generally fruitless and frustrating search for survivors of Monday's earthquake continued today, Philippine officials began to assess the physical damage and weigh the costs of reconstruction.
By tonight, the official count was 429 dead and 1,225 injured. And Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said the death toll could rise to 1,000, including scores of people believed to be entombed in landslides along Kennon Road, the highway that leads to Baguio, the resort city 120 miles north of Manila that was hardest hit by the earthquake. [A United States Marine plane helping in rescue operations crashed on Friday near Baguio, The Associated Press reported. One crew member was reportedly killed when the OV-1 observation plane from Subic Bay naval base crashed into the mountains.] Even four days after the earthquake, reports of destruction in isolated areas trickled in. In Nueva Vizcaya Province, 100 miles northeast of Manila, about 30 miles of the Dalton Pass, which cuts through the Sierra Madre range, was reported buried in mud slides. 
Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao said today that Manila would ask the World Bank for loans, and the president of the Asian Development Bank, Kimihasa Taiumiza, said that the bank would rush the release of already approved loans for school buildings, power lines, roads and bridges.
 
Three Hotels Collapse
Private economists said the Government would have to rechannel funds intended for new projects to repair the earthquake damage.
In Baguio 28 buildings collapsed, including three large hotels, several factories and a university building. The power and water supply systems were badly damaged. Officials said it could take as long as 20 years for the city to recover from the devastation.
American, British and Japanese rescue teams used dogs and heat-sensing equipment to search for survivors in Baguio's hotels and factories. But heavy rains and continuing aftershocks hampered the search.
As the day ended, the teams recovered only corpses. The hope of finding survivors among the scores trapped in the wreckage of Baguio was fading fast. But hundreds looking for missing relatives and friends continued to keep vigil, huddling underneath plastic tents in the hard rain.
 
A.I.D. Official's Body Found
Rescuers today found the body of an official with the United States Agency for International Development in the rubble of the Nevada Hotel. An agency official said 27 of 65 participants in an A.I.D.-sponsored conference at the hotel were thought to be dead. Rescue teams left the site today, having given up hope of finding survivors.
While the painstaking rescue efforts continued, thousands of survivors continued to leave Baguio, most of them traveling on foot down a mountain road still partly buried in landslides. Military transport planes evacuated hundreds of Philippine and foreign tourists from the city. Hundreds more crowded the airport, begging to be flown out.

HEADLINE: GOV. DUKAKIS SIGNS INCREASE IN TAXES

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 19

 BODY:
Given a push by an opinion from the state's highest court, a package of tax increases totaling more than $1 billion and intended to solve Massachusetts' fiscal crisis has been signed into law by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
Mr. Dukakis, who campaigned for the Presidency two years ago on the economic performance of the ''Massachusetts miracle,'' signed the bill in private Wednesday, with no fanfare.
''This is not something to celebrate,'' he said later. 
The measure raises state income and gasoline taxes and extends the state's 5 percent sales tax to numerous business services, virtually all of which have been exempted until now. It is expected to generate $1.2 billion in the current fiscal year, which began July 1, and $1.8 billion next year.
State officials said residents would start feeling the effects of the law within 10 days at the gasoline pump, where the tax will rise 10 cents a gallon, and would start seeing larger withholding from their paychecks within three weeks.
 
Court Opinion on Sales Tax
Proponents of the measure had argued that it was needed to help pay off a $1 billion deficit in the state's $12.8 billion budget for the fiscal year that ended June 30 and to help balance a budget for the current year that has not yet been passed by the Legislature but is expected to total $13.6 billion.
But the $500-million-a-year provision that extended the sales tax to services was vigorously opposed by business leaders and professionals, who argued that the State Constitution provided for a tax only on ''commodities'' and therefore implictly exempted services.
As a result, the Governor delayed signing the bill until he could get an advisory opinion from the Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest judicial body. In a 4-to-3 opinion issued Tuesday, the court cleared the way for the law, holding that the word ''commodities'' was not limited ''to tangible personal property.''

HEADLINE: We'll Be Sorry if Japan's Money Stays at Home

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One can only applaud the provisions of the new United States trade agreement with the Japanese (front page, June 29), aimed at giving our goods and services a fair opportunity to compete in their market. I suggest, however, that we will one day regret their agreement, on which we insisted, substantially to increase their domestic investments - in roads, houses and the like - if they live up to that part of the bargain.
Our purpose in persuading them to invest more of their savings and use more of their output at home has, of course, been to cut down their export surplus with us, running around $50 billion a year. 
But, as the Japanese Finance Ministry has been remonstrating (Business Day, June 25), the world's capital shortage is getting worse, if anything, with increased demands for savings, and increased opportunities to invest in Eastern Europe and to buy the state-owned enterprises up for sale all over Latin America.
Increased domestic spending within Japan has produced a mild acceleration of inflation, accompanied by the inevitable rising interest rates. And that has meant rising interest rates everywhere: for example, Japanese investors have apparently sold more United States Government securities this year than they bought. Similarly, West German long-term interest rates have moved above ours despite a lower inflation rate -partly because of the cost of subsidizing the East Germans. No wonder our interest rates remain stubbornly high and the Federal Reserve Board feels unable to pursue a more relaxed monetary policy, though our economy has slowed.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is reported to have said the new demands for capital in Europe ''should not be confused'' with the need for countries like Japan to bring down their trade surpluses, by increasing investments at home.
His position is schizophrenic. The world needs their savings, he recognizes, but we insist they invest more of them at home because we don't want their trade surpluses. That is arithmetically impossible: the way -the only way - in which any country invests or lends abroad is by exporting more goods and services than it imports.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
When Reality Dawns

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
Representative Stephen Solarz of New York has been a principal shaper and supporter of American policy on Cambodia for years. The policy has been to isolate the Hun Sen Government in Phnom Penh as a Vietnamese puppet, aid two small non-Communist guerrilla forces, urge them into coalition with the Khmer Rouge and give the coalition Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.
Because Mr. Solarz is a thoughtful politician, and sensitive on human rights, friends wondered why he backed a policy that in effect seemed to help the murderous Khmer Rouge. His answer was that the only way to contain the Khmer Rouge was through a political settlement. 
Three weeks ago, in a telephone conversation, I asked Mr. Solarz about reports of Khmer Rouge military advances near Phnom Penh. What if the Hun Sen Government falls to the Khmer Rouge? I asked.
''That would be a great tragedy and disaster,'' he replied. ''At that point either Vietnam would have to send its forces back into Cambodia, or there would have to be some kind of international force. I personally would be prepared to support any kind of international police action, but as a practical matter it would be very difficult to put together any kind of consortium of countries.''
What a paradoxical answer, I thought. The United States has been doing all it can to weaken the Hun Sen Government - supporting two of its opponents, imposing economic sanctions, even forbidding humanitarian groups to help the destitute in Phnom Penh. Yet if that Government falls, and the Khmer Rouge inevitably takes over, it would be a ''tragedy'' calling for military intervention.
Mr. Solarz's answer showed, in short, that American policy has been disconnected from its own logical end. No doubt we were sincere in wanting a diplomatic solution; certainly Mr. Solarz was. But the actual effect of the policy on the ground was to improve chances for the return of Pol Pot and the other Khmer Rouge leaders who presided over the death of one million Cambodians.
That reality was recognized by Secretary of State Baker when he announced a change of policy on Cambodia. One sentence of his told the story: ''We want to do everything we can to prevent a return of the Khmer Rouge to power.''
The United States will now seek to oust the coalition dominated by the Khmer Rouge from the U.N. seat. It will apparently encourage humanitarian assistance to Cambodia. An American delegation headed by Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon will ''open a dialogue'' with Vietnam, as Mr. Baker put it, in talks at the United Nations.
Comment on the change of policy attributed it to growing pressures on the Bush Administration. Congress had become restive about Cambodia. Last month the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to cut off covert aid to the non-Communist resistance. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, has been a strong voice for change. The reports of Khmer Rouge military gains were sobering.
But all that amounts to saying that the Bush Administration yielded to reality. And surely that is a credit. Far better to understand the possible consequences of a mistaken policy, and change, than to pursue it mindlessly for fear of seeming to admit a mistake.
The Bush Administration deserves credit for realism in another respect. This shift in policy directly reflects a recognition that the cold war is over.
American policy on Cambodia has been driven to a considerable extent by resentment at the outcome of the Vietnam War. We regarded Phnom Penh as not only a Vietnamese but a Soviet outpost. But this week Secretary Baker had a productive talk about Cambodia with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze.
Exactly what the new American position will mean in practice remains to be seen, and one should maintain a certain skepticism. Still less does it give any assurance of peace to the Cambodians. That still depends on diplomacy.
The current diplomatic proposal is for the United Nations to take charge in Cambodia while an election is organized. Neither Hun Sen nor the Khmer Rouge has so far endorsed the idea. China, the crucial outside force, has said what sounds like yes. Perhaps the Bush Administration will be able to persuade Vietnam on a U.N. role. Perhaps it will put its friendship with China to good use, though Beijing reacted critically to Secretary Baker's announcement.
There are big ifs, and the hour is late. But at least the United States seems to be on the right side now, committed above all to keeping the Khmer Rouge out of power.

HEADLINE: From Rust Belt to Money Belt in Buffalo

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: BUFFALO, July 19

 BODY:
There are not many bright spots in the New York economy these days, and one of the few can be found in the unlikeliest of places: Buffalo.
Often victimized in the past by its Frost Belt geography, Buffalo has become the sudden beneficiary of its location across the Niagara River from Canada. Two streams of financial fortune, one from an overheated economy in nearby Toronto and the other from the 1988 free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada, have insulated western New York from the financial troubles afflicting much of the nation.
While New York and many other states are edging perilously close to recession, Buffalo is brimming with the self-confident boosterism of a boom town.
''For a long time, Buffalonians have had a problem with themselves,'' said Dennis T. Gorski, the Erie County Executive. ''We didn't expand our chests. We were embarrassed by the snow jokes on the Johnny Carson show. That is not the case today. People are genuinely sanguine and proud of the resurgence here.'' 
 
Gateway to American Market
The monthly unemployment rate in the Buffalo area is 4.6 percent. In March it fell below the state average for the first time in 11 years. Job growth in the Buffalo region, which is defined as Erie and Niagara Counties, has outpaced the state average in each of the last four years. At 2.8 percent, it was almost triple the state rate last year.
Economists and business figures disagree about whether the revitalization has been fueled mostly by the trade agreement or by Toronto's economic conditions, but the effect has been the same. Canadian prospectors have looked south and seen western New York as a source of cheap real estate and affordable labor and as a gateway to the huge American market opening to them.
The same phenomenon has been seen in other border towns across the country, like Port Huron, Mich., and Plattsburg, N.Y. But Buffalo has also made itself more resistant to hard times with a significant expansion of its service sector. The economy's diversification, which took place relatively quickly, saved the region from what many feared would be a death blow when the area lost nearly a third of its manufacturing jobs during the last decade.
It would be hard to overstate the sense of despair that enveloped western New York during the late 1970's and early 1980's. Headlines then seemed like dirges. When they finished mourning the blizzard of 1977, which killed stranded drivers in their cars, they began tolling the deaths of steel mills and factories. As a symbol of the Rust Belt, the city's national image and sense of worth suffered.
 
Stadium Unemployment Nights
In 1983, when the unemployment rate was 12 percent, the crumbling baseball stadium sponsored Unemployment Nights, in which discounted tickets were offered to jobless workers coming to see the minor league Bisons. A billboard erected near City Hall asked, ''Will the Last Worker Out of Western New York Please Turn Out the Light?''
''The waterfront was a wasteland,'' said Mayor James D. Griffin, who has run Buffalo for 13 years. ''Downtown looked like Seoul, Korea, back in the war. Nobody had any confidence in the city whatsoever.''
Today, the metaphors for western New York's recovery are just as abundant. Although the esthetic impact on Buffalo's uninspiring skyline has been marginal, banks are building glass and marble towers downtown. Pricey condominiums have been built along the lake front and all have been purchased.
The Bisons now play at Pilot Field, a 21,000-seat ballpark in downtown Buffalo that is three years old and has the timeless grace of Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. The Bisons set a minor league attendance record in 1988 by drawing nearly 1.2 million fans, more than saw the Chicago White Sox, the Seattle Mariners or the Atlanta Braves play that year.
 
Like the Set of 'Batman'
The city is waging a fanatical crusade to win one of two major league expansion teams in 1991, and is willing to double the size of the stadium if it does. Many see the commitment of the Bisons' owner, Robert E. Rich Jr., a frozen-food magnate, to buy a major league franchise at a potential cost of $100 million as the ultimate sign of confidence in the city's future.
From the upper deck of the stadium, one can see the hulking remains of the Bethlehem Steel mill that employed 22,000 workers at its peak before closing in 1983. The 1,400-acre site along Lake Erie looks like a set out of ''Batman,'' full of slag heaps, idle smokestacks and dark, decaying buildings.
But during the last five years, part of the site has been reclaimed. A locally based conglomerate, the Gateway Trade Center, bought 300 acres and established a commercial park, a port and a free-trade zone. Seventeen of the 24 companies operating in the free-trade zone are Canadian.
In suburban Cheektowaga and in Niagara Falls, expansive new malls have been built to capture Canadian shoppers who flock across the border to take advantage of lower prices, lower taxes and the strong Canadian dollar. There are plans to build a 1.5-million-square-foot factory outlet mall, reportedly the world's largest, within 100 yards of the falls next year. Franchised Chicken Wings? Because there are still limits on how much merchandise Canadians can take home without paying Customs duties, the visitors are often spotted stripping out of sweat suits and donning their new finery in mall parking lots to deceive Customs officials. When the free-trade agreement takes full effect in nine years, such machinations will become unnecessary.
The free-trade frenzy has even caught the attention of Dominic Bellissimo, whose mother, Teressa, invented Buffalo's famous chicken wings 26 years ago at the Anchor Bar, which he now owns. Mr. Bellissimo said he has been approached by Canadian businessmen about opening 35 chicken-wing stands in the Toronto area.
''God bless it,'' said Mr. Bellissimo, who currently serves 73,000 pounds of wings a month from the Anchor Bar. ''I wish mother was here to see it.''
The conventional wisdom among most economists and political leaders in the Buffalo area is that the free-trade agreement accelerated a comeback that had already started.
 
It Began in Canada
They say the impetus for investment in Buffalo was inflation, high taxes, and regulatory strictures in Ontario and specifically in Toronto, 100 miles away.
As the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce gleefully points out, salaries, taxes, interest rates and real estate are significantly lower in western New York than in southern Ontario.
Sam Cole, director of the Center for Regional Studies at the State University of New York at Buffalo, asserts that the city is slowly becoming an economic suburb of Toronto. The two economies should become even more integrated as the free-trade agreement gradually eliminates tariffs.
Canada and the United States, which exchanged $167 billion in trade last year, are the world's largest trading partners. About 20 percent of that trade traveled over the four transnational bridges in the Buffalo Customs District, which ranks second only to Detroit in cross-border traffic.
 
Built for 'Comparatively Peanuts'
In the last three years, 90 Canadian companies have relocated or expanded in the Buffalo region, adding to the 375 already there, according to the Chamber of Commerce.
For Canadian businessmen like Edward R. Steger, president of Stetron International Inc., an electronics manufacturer, Buffalo seemed the ideal base for expansion into the American market. It was cheap, it was a two-hour drive from his headquarters in Toronto and the city and state had a record of generosity in offering tax abatements and low-interest loans.
''We built ourselves a beautiful building near downtown Buffalo for comparatively peanuts: $1 million,'' Mr. Steger said. ''In Toronto it might have cost $20 million.''
Mr. Steger, who bought one of the new lake front condominiums, said he will decide next year whether to build a 45,000-foot plant in Buffalo, which would expand his work force here from 12 to 150. An Illusory Recovery? Not everybody is bullish about the area's economic future. Some believe it is illusory because of the emphasis on service sector jobs, which on average pay 18 percent less than manufacturing jobs in New York State.
Because many younger residents left during the bad days, the population is smaller and older. Many black leaders say they believe that minorities have not shared equally in the comeback.
Others worry that the area does not have the roads and bridges to take advantage of the trade agreement. Trucks sometimes have to wait two hours to cross clogged bridges. The state is conducting a $500,000 study to analyze the cost of a new crossing.
But to most who lived through the bad years, the mere symbols of rebirth bring lasting joy. Satisfaction was on the face of 67-year-old Hank J. Kotlarz, who was laid off by his trucking company in 1984, as he watched the Bisons beat the Columbus Clippers at Pilot Field on a flawless Monday night.
''This is the best place in America to watch baseball and even with the inflation, you can afford to go to the games,'' he said. ''You won't catch me moving.''

HEADLINE: A Hudson Retreat Is Split by a Fight Over Development

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDGEWATER, N.J.

 BODY:
Joan Lawlor Reilly remembers taking the 125th Street Ferry across the Hudson River to this sliver of a waterfront town where her parents rented a shack and some sweet shade from a Dutchman named Goethius.
That was more than 50 years ago, and Ms. Lawlor Reilly, now 62, still lives here, although with additions and improvements over the years the shack is now a small house. But the land, incorporated in 1948 as a cooperative known as the Edgewater Colony, has gone through major changes.
There are still no sidewalks, no sewers and hardly any fences. All the land is owned by the 116 shareholders of the colony. But instead of the carefree rustic retreat it once was, the colony is contentious and divided. At the heart of the matter is a question any New York City co-op owner would recognize. Is the colony an investment or a home? 
The conflict started with a rumor that someone wanted to buy the colony.
''That's the whole thing that makes it so crazy,'' said Lucien A. Fontaine, the harness driver and a resident since 1984. ''There's no offer. But perhaps it's for the best, because the community is going to be stronger for it.''
Tucked into a jagged hillside in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge between River Road and the Hudson, the colony is one of the most unusual communities in the state. The entire 26 acres is owned cooperatively, and all but 30 shareholders live here.
Shareholders pay monthly maintenance fees for the land and equal portions of the property tax on the land. They own their houses and pay separately assessed property taxes on them.
The three roads in the community meander under tall densely canopied trees, sometimes turning back on themselves or leaving just barely enough room for an automobile to pass.
The homes make up an eccentric group. The tents that Ms. Lawlor Reilly remembers are gone, replaced by tar-paper shacks, expanded bungalows and California contemporaries costing more than $400,000 perched on rocky ledges with sweeping views of the river and Washington Heights.
In the late 1980's, when development swept much of the Hudson waterfront from the bridge to Jersey City, expensive houses were built in the colony, and many existing houses were modernized and expanded.
Over the last year a rumor, of which there are several versions, about an offer to buy the colony for $30 million or $58 million set residents chattering. There were also controversies brewing over how some people were spending too much or too little on their houses.
Mr. Fontaine and a group of shareholders, many relative newcomers, hired lawyers from big firms and spent more than $150,000 seeking a way to block a sale of the land to a developer.
Another group, which included many old-timers and elderly residents, insisted they had the right to sell, take the proceeds and move.
Older residents tended to favor a sale because they stood for the most part to make out very well. Because of the co-op status, the money would have been divided among the 116 shareholders. Those with big houses on the river would have received less than their houses were worth on the market, and those who owned shacks would have received substantially more.
Mr. Fontaine said he became involved because shareholders who did not live here were being allowed to vote in elections for the co-op board and would presumably be allowed to vote on a sales proposal, which he felt made it more likely that the land would change hands.
In May, Judge Arthur L. Lesemann of Superior Court ruled that nonresident stockholders could not be denied the right to vote. He did say that in the future the board could limit nonresidents' rights to own stock.
 
Split in Elections
Some tensions lingered. After decades of complacency, some residents were reluctant to say hello if they passed one another on the street. Unsigned letters of criticism were dropped in mailboxes.
A month after the ruling, an election was held to fill five of the 10 seats on the board. Both sides put up full slates and campaigned fiercely. Three candidates favoring a sale and two who opposed a sale had the highest vote totals and won. Over all the votes were split almost evenly between the two slates.
Some residents saw that balanced turnout as representative of the community's true feelings about a sale. Under the bylaws, a sale would have to be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders.
''I feel the people have spoken,'' said Jack Ennis, a resident for more than 20 years and one of the 10 who joined Mr. Fontaine. ''They want the colony to stay as a single community.''
 
Letter From Broker
''Now that the litigation is over,'' Ms. Lawlor Reilly said, ''we're hoping sincerely that everybody gets back together so we can be the community we once were.''
But there is evidence that might not be possible. Recently a shareholder who was not involved in the election, Michael J. Ignatieff, wrote an open letter to residents saying he was not for or against a sale, despite rumors that he had once tried to interest developers in the land. He is a real-estate broker.
''What I said was that if an offer should be presented, we should run it past an accountant, and if it holds water then it ought to be put to the shareholders for a vote,'' Mr. Ignatieff said. ''I told them, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.' ''
Nothing that has occurred in the last few months would prevent a sale, but some residents said they believed that with the economy slowing, it was unlikely anyone would make a serious offer.
Mr. Ennis said he did not think that the legal battle proved that the colony's days were numbered or that the co-op form was no longer workable. ''Look, having 116 shareholders is like being in 116 marriages,'' he said. ''You've got to settle things yourself.''

HEADLINE: Law: At The Bar;
Here she comes to Wall Street: Miss America. Maybe.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Victor Hugo once declared: ''Greater than the tread of mighty armies is an idea whose time has come.'' And it may just be that in our litigious age - when, to cite one index, there are 100,000 lawyers in California alone - the time has finally come for Miss America to be a corporate lawyer.
True, a few Miss Americas have eventually gone on to law school and become lawyers. And at least a few others have gone on to retain them. But in the contest's 70-year history no reigning Miss America has actually been a law student, someone who at least metaphorically carried a briefcase along with her crown as she floated down the runway. That brings us to Marjorie Vincent, a second-year student at Duke Law School and a summer law associate at the New York firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon. 
Three weeks ago Miss Vincent was crowned Miss Illinois. That makes her one of at least two soon-to-be lawyers - Dana Renea Brown, Miss Tennessee, has completed her first year at the Memphis State University School of Law - and the only soon-to-be Wall Street lawyer in September's pageant. When Gary Collins soon croons, ''There she is, Miss America; there she is, your ideal,'' he might just be pointing to someone whose goal is not to be some Hollywood starlet but an authority on the Securities Exchange Act of 1933.
Can a would-be lawyer epitomize ''the queen of femininity,'' the ''fairest of the fair?'' There are no lawyers on Miss America's judiciary. But Ms. Vincent is hoping that in an affair forever seeking to shed its Barbie Doll image, her career may stand her in good stead.
The 25-year-old Ms. Vincent, who comes from Oak Park, Ill., is no stranger to pageantry. En route to Atlantic City, she has battled for Miss Chicago (three times), Miss Illinois (twice), Miss Kankakee County and Miss North Carolina (once each). In between, she became an accomplished pianist and graduated from DePaul University.
Given the poor state of the legal economy, there will be many Miss Congenialities this summer at some of Wall Street's more fragile law firms. But Mudge Rose picked a relatively small class, 29, and according to Michael De Angelis, the partner in charge of the summer program, all of them will probably get offers.
Ms. Vincent already has, though should she win the contest she will have to put off practice for a year. But according to Leonard Horn, the Atlantic City lawyer who runs the contest, even competing for Miss America is good legal training.
''A woman who would enter this type of competition obviously has enthusiasm, courage and zeal, and those are excellent qualities for any lawyer,'' he told Brett Campbell in ''Here She Comes, Miss America J.D.,'' an article prepared for Barrister magazine. And it's no mean feat, he added, to speak extemporaneously in front of 60 million people. ''I don't know if I could do that, and I've been practicing trial law since 1961.''
Anyone interviewing Miss Vincent, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, cannot be blamed for occasionally feeling like Bert Parks. He will hear how she loves the law, loves Duke, loves New York, loves Mudge Rose, and loves the work she has been doing there (even though she admits she has yet to handle her first sale-and-leaseback agreement).
But beneath all of the usual sugar coating is an articulate and talented woman. During the program she will perform a Reader's Digest version of Chopin's ''Fantasie Impromptu,'' Op. 66. ''That's the one that sounds like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' '' she explained.
Concerned that donning a swimsuit before the cameras would be frowned upon by feminist types and stuffy lawyers, Miss Vincent did not even mention her various crowns to prospective employers. But at Mudge Rose - a firm anxious, perhaps, to finally shed its image as the place where Richard M. Nixon and John N. Mitchell once worked -everyone is cheering her on.
The firm went so far as to ask its public relations company, Howard J. Rubenstein Associates Inc., to tout its ties to Miss Vincent. (With most of what law firms do either unnewsworthy or, if newsworthy, confidential, this is typical of what their publicists do.) As things turned out, Mudge Rose acted unlawfully - that is, according to the code of the pageant. It seems that contestants are barred from soliciting any national publicity prior to the gala, lest they obtain an unfair competitive advantage. ''Her law firm had no right to contact you,'' a pageant official huffily told a reporter.
Mr. Horn disputed the notion that lawyers might feel queasy about having one of their own as Miss America - that her very conspicuousness might intensify complaints that ours is a hopelessly lawyer-laden society. If anything, he argued, it could only help; most Miss Americas, he seemed to say, have a better reputation than most lawyers.

HEADLINE: Judge Upholds X Rating For Almodovar Film

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A New York State judge upheld the X rating given to the Pedro Almodovar film ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' yesterday and said he inferred that Miramax Films, the distributor, had brought the suit for publicity purposes.
However, in his 13-page decision, Judge Charles E. Ramos of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan had harsh words for the way the Motion Picture Association of America rates movies. ''The manner in which the M.P.A.A. rates all films, not just 'Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,' causes this Court to question the integrity of the present rating system,'' he said.
In the first challenge to the motion-picture association's rating system in 20 years, Miramax and Mr. Almodovar, who directed ''Tie Me Up!,'' filed a civil suit in May seeking to overturn the X rating. An X bars moviegoers younger than 17 from theaters where the film is playing. 
''Tie Me Up!'' is a comedy about a former mental patient who kidnaps a soft-core porn star and tries to woo her after tying her up. The film was released in the United States by Miramax on May 4.
 
'A Rational Basis'
In a highly publicized court session last month, William Kunstler, the lawyer for Miramax, asked Judge Ramos to declare the X rating ''arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious'' under Article 278 of the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules.
These rules allow parties to petition the court for redress from the actions of an administrative body, like the motion-picture association.
In the decision, which was unexpectedly handed down at 4 P.M. yesterday, Judge Ramos said Miramax had ''clearly failed'' to prove its case under the law. ''There has been no showing that the X rating afforded 'Tie Me Up!' was without a rational basis or arbitrary and capricious,'' he wrote.
The Miramax lawsuit has drawn much attention in the media for ''Tie Me Up!'' - a fact that the judge noted. ''There are questions of the good faith of the petitioners in instituting this proceeding,'' the judge wrote. The court record ''leads to the inference that this proceeding may be just publicity'' for the film.
Jack Valenti, president of the motion-picture association, an industry trade group, commented last night: ''We are quite pleased that the case was thrown out. We are grateful that the court recognized the unambiguous supremacy of the First Amendment.''
His mention of the Constitution referred to the motion-picture association's legal defense. In court last month, Floyd Abrams, the lawyer representing the motion-picture association, asked that the Miramax suit be dismissed because it would involve the courts in the ratings process. Mr. Abrams asserted that the First Amendment bars the court ''from forcing my client to issue a rating system that my client does not want to have.''
Judge Ramos, in his opinion, acknowledged that under the First Amendment, the court could not require the motion-picture association to impose a different rating system.
However, in a statement last night, Mr. Kunstler criticized the judge, saying that ''the court's inability to rein in the forces of censorship is an alarming abdication of the judiciary's role as the protector and guarantor of free expression.''
Russell Schwartz, executive vice president of Miramax, said he was ''dismayed'' that the X rating for ''Tie Me Up!'' was upheld. For the last two months he has denied that the suit was brought for publicity purposes. Last night he added: ''Miramax is considering appealing the decision and will continue our work within the industry to encourage the M.P.A.A. to rework its rating system.''
However, Mr. Schwartz said he was ''gratified that Judge Ramos has admonished the M.P.A.A.'s present rating system as one in need of an overhaul.''
 
A Growing Debate
Yesterday's decision was the latest event in a growing debate over the motion-picture ratings system, which was created in 1968. Many film makers and distributors say the system exerts a kind of censorship through its X rating. They are calling for the creation of a new rating that would not have the stigma of the X. The judge noted this debate in his opinion, asserting that ''the rating system censors serious films by the force of economic pressure.''
The judge's opinion noted that the standard of the rating board ''is not scientific'' and criticized the membership of the board, which is composed entirely of parents.
The judge wrote: ''The industry that profits from scenes of mass murder, dismemberment and the portrayal of war as noble and glamorous apparently has no interest in the opinions of professionals, only the opinions of its consumers.''
He added: ''There are no physicians, child psychiatrists or child care professionals on the board.'' The judge asserted that no effort is made to ''professionally advise the board members on the impact of a depiction of violent rape on the one hand and an act of love on the other.''
Judge Ramos continued: ''The effort by the M.P.A.A. to encourage a more lenient policy toward violence is indefensible.''
Mr. Valenti, commenting on Judge Ramos's charges, said, ''I flatly deny that we are more lenient toward violence.''
He added: ''Just about everything the opinion had to say about the rating system is wrong, totally wrong.'' He added that he sees ''no reason to change the rating system.''
As for the judge's assertion that parents need psychological experts to advise them, Mr. Valenti commented: ''The rating system is not and does not pretend to be the National Institutes of Health. Only parents have the authority and the responsibility to set value standards for their children.''

HEADLINE: Argentina Agrees to Sell Majority Share of Its Airline

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 19

 BODY:
Argentina, which agreed last month to sell its national telecommunications company to Spanish and American interests, has now agreed to sell a majority share of the national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, to a consortium led by the Spanish airline Iberia.
The sale of the two state-owned companies will allow Argentina to wipe out more than $7 billion of its $62 billion foreign debt. Both deals entail the conversion of Argentine foreign debt paper.
President Carlos Saul Menem signed the decree Wednesday night awarding Aerolineas to the Iberia group, which was the only bidder two weeks ago when offers were received for the sale of 85 percent of the airline. 
The Iberia group, which also includes the parent company of the Argentine private airline Austral and several Argentine businessmen, offered $260 million in cash and $2.01 billion in debt paper, more than the minimum set by the Government.
With the deeply depressed Argentine debt paper currently trading at 14 to 15 cents on the dollar of face value in the secondary market, the real total cost to the bidders for Latin America's second-largest airline is estimated in the range of $540 million to $560 million. Aerolineas owns 24 Boeing passenger planes, ranging from 707's to 747's, and carried 3.7 million passengers last year to 28 destinations around the world.
In June, two groups led by the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telephone company, were successful bidders for the purchase of majority shares of Entel, the Argentine phone company, which will be reorganized into two private companies.
Telefonica agreed to pay $114 million cash and $2.72 billion in debt paper for 60 percent of what will become Entel South, and Bell Atlantic agreed to pay $100 million cash and $2.308 billion in debt paper for 60 percent of Entel North. The remaining 40 percent of each will be sold to employees, provincial telephone cooperatives and through the stock market.
The transfer of ownership of both Entel and the airline is expected to occur in September.
The year-old Menem Government, abandoning more than 40 years of faith in state domination of the economy by Mr. Menem's Peronist Party, initiated the privatization program as part of a general economic liberalization and reform. His Government inherited fiscal deficits running 10 percent of the gross national product, plus the third-largest foreign debt in Latin America and runaway inflation now considered relatively stabilized at 10 to 12 percent a month.
Although the telephone company, which has been running deficits of $50 million a month, and the slightly profitable airline were viewed as the centerpieces for the privatization effort, Mr. Menem has promised to proceed rapidly with other privatizations as well, including the Buenos Aires electricity company, Segba.
 
Next, Armed Forces Companies
The Government is also preparing to put up for international bidding eight companies or portions of companies now owned by the armed forces. These include an iron and steel works and a shipyard in which private interests already have a majority stake, and several concerns in the petrochemical field. Private companies are expected to bid for full ownership of those put up.
Also, the oil industry is being increasingly opened to private concerns. Last week, the Government received offers from 25 consortiums of foreign and Argentine private companies totaling $260 million to exploit marginal or secondary areas now in the hands of the state oil company.
When those offers are accepted, as is expected soon, oil officials say Argentine crude production will be 37 percent in private hands. Sometime next year, the Government plans to begin offering to private interests some of the main producing areas now held by the state concern, YPF, which has long been criticized for being slow and unproductive.

HEADLINE: Earnings Decline 6% At A.T.&T.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that its earnings had fallen 6 percent in the second quarter. It attributed the drop to lower equipment sales and rentals, higher income taxes and the costs of introducing a combination calling card and credit card.
Four of the seven regional Bell operating companies reported modest earnings yesterday. The four companies, which mostly provide local telephone service, were the BellSouth Corporation, the Nynex Corporation, the Pacific Telesis Group and the Southwestern Bell Corporation. The Baby Bells' results were in line with or slightly higher than what analysts had expected. 
A.T.&T. said its second-quarter profits fell to $657 million, or 60 cents a share, from $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1989. Sales fell 2.5 percent, to $9.03 billion, from $9.26 billion a year ago. The results were similar to or slightly higher than estimates made by Wall Street analysts after A.T.&T. announced on June 27 that its second-quarter earnings would drop instead of increasing as expected.
 
Share Price Up 50/
The share price of A.T.&T., the nation's most widely held company, rose 50 cents yesterday to close at $37.625 in moderately heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was trading at about $41 a share before June 27.
A.T.&T.'s sales and rentals of company switchboards and multiple-line telephones dropped sharply in the quarter, while long-distance telephone service revenues fell 3.9 percent, as lower average prices outweighed a 7 percent increase in volume. The company said the drop reflected, in part, moves by business customers to lower-price services.
''It's like a charge you're taking for having people on the wrong services for a hundred years,'' said Gregory R. Sawers, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York.
 
End of Long-Distance Slide Seen
Morris Tanenbaum, the chief financial officer and a vice chairman of A.T.&T., said in a telephone interview that the company was pleased with the long-distance telephone results. A.T.&T. has stopped losing market share among most types of business customers, he said, and is moving toward ending the erosion of its market share among residential customers.
Jack B. Grubman, a telephone industry analyst at Paine Webber, said, ''The underlying business trends are certainly better than I thought they would be a month ago.''
Mr. Tanenbaum reiterated that it be difficult for A.T.&T. to meet its target of 10 percent to 12 percent growth in earnings this year.
A.T.&T.'s sales of central office equipment for telephone companies grew by 1.8 percent from a year ago, as gains in international and cellular company sales offset decreased equipment sales to the regional Bell operating companies. The company told analysts that central office equipment sales in June ended up being less weak than it had anticipated in making the June 27 earnings prediction.
Mr. Tanenbaum said the modest sales growth was still below the company's targets set earlier this year. ''Our sales levels are somewhat softer than we had hoped,'' he said.
 
BellSouth
The Atlanta-based company, which provides service in nine states, said second-quarter profits rose 6.5 percent, to $445.2 million, or 92 cents a share, from $418.1 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 4.3 percent, to $3.62 billion from $3.47 billion. BellSouth's share price dropped 25 cents to close at $52.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
BellSouth said its earnings were held down by local telephone rate reductions in several Southeastern states, which the company had accepted in exchange for looser regulation of profits in the future.
 
Nynex
The New York-based parent of the New York Telephone Company and the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company reported that its second-quarter profits rose 7.7 percent, to $300.6 million, or $1.52 a share, compared with $279 million, or $1.42 a share, a year ago. Sales rose 4.2 percent, to $3.44 billion from $3.3 billion. Nynex's share price fell 37.5 cents to close at $77.75 in light trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The latest earnings included a $39 million pretax charge that was the result of an early-retirement program for managers, which ended May 31.
 
Pacific Telesis
The San Francisco-based parent of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, which provides service in California and Nevada, reported that second-quarter profits fell 11.7 percent, to $287 million, or 72 cents a share, from $325 million, or 79 cents a share, a year ago. Sales crept up eight-tenths of a percent, to $2.43 billion from $2.41 billion. The share price of Pacific Telesis fell 12.5 cents to close at $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.
California has imposed rate reductions on Pacific Bell in exchange for regulatory changes similar to those enacted in several states served by BellSouth. Modest growth in cellular telephone subscribers at Pactel Cellular reflected the company's decision to restrict its marketing to affluent potential customers who are likely to use the service heavily, said Kenneth N. Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company.
 
Southwestern Bell
The St. Louis-based company reported an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in second-quarter earnings, to $262.5 million, or 87 cents a share, from $261.5 million, or 87 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 1.4 percent, to $2.17 billion, on sales of $2.14 billion. The company's share price was unchanged, at $53.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Southwestern Bell said it had added 71,000 new cellular telephone subscribers, more than twice as many as it had added in the quarter last year. The company has benefited from a modest recovery of the Texas economy, Mr. Leon said.

HEADLINE: American Express Net Rises 1.2%

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The American Express Company reported yesterday that second-quarter earnings edged up 1.2 percent from the quarter a year earlier and that revenues fell slightly.
The financial services company said it earned $320 million in the quarter, compared with $316 million in the 1989 period. Earnings per share for both periods were 73 cents. Revenues were $6.1 billion, down slightly from $6.4 billion last year. 
Earnings at the Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage subsidiary rebounded from the huge loss posted in the year's first quarter, when Shearson took a $630 million write-off for a reorganization. Second-quarter earnings at the unit were $51 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $55 million, or 54 cents a share, in the 1989 second quarter. Revenues were $2.6 billion, compared with $3.3 billion for the 1989 period. 2 One-Time Transactions Samuel G. Liss, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, attributed Shearson's performance to improved trading results and to two one-time transactions: the sales of the Lehman asset managment operations and of Shearson's stake in a joint venture with the Nippon Life Insurance Company.
''It's too early to say much about the Shearson restructuring,'' Mr. Liss said. ''Clearly, they took significant action in the first quarter, and their expense growth seems to be contained.''
Shearson has suffered recently from the collapse of the ''junk bond'' market and problems related to its 1988 acquistion of E. F. Hutton & Company. But after trying to sell its 60 percent stake in Shearson, American Express decided to buy full ownership and renewed its commitment to reviving the company.
 
Higher Interest Expense
That decision affected the earnings of American Express as well. The company said that its earnings were hurt by higher interest expenses to cover the costs of buying $750 million of convertible preferred stock from Shearson at the end of the first quarter.
But record earnings were reported by the Travel-Related Services division, up 16 percent, to $249 million; at IDS Financial Services, up 21 percent, to $52 million, and at the Information Services Corporation, up 25 percent, to $22 million.
''Demand for American Express products and services remained generally strong in the face of softness in certain segments of the economy,'' said James D. Robinson 3d, chief executive. He termed Shearson's second-quarter performance ''encouraging'' and said that a highlight was the ''enthusiastic response'' to the company's 20 million share equity offering during the quarter.
The company will issue 25.4 million additional common shares next month, in part, because of the Shearson takeover.
Micheal L. Goldstin, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the American Express earnings were in line with expectations. He said that Shearson had cut expenses by $250 million to $270 million. ''They are doing what they said they would,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Evidence Backs Greenspan

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN his testimony this week on the midyear state of the economy, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, seemed to be tiptoeing through a mine field, spread with the dangers of recession, inflation, a worsening budget deficit and a weakened financial structure in the private sector.
The biggest danger is that if a recession once got under way it would cause the failures of a host of debt-ridden corporations and financial institutions. The savings and loan disaster happened while the economy was growing steadily; a recession would harm many other sectors. With the nation's precarious debt structure, a recession now could cumulate into the worst of the postwar period. 
Mr. Greenspan responded to such anxieties by saying that the Fed was prepared to ease credit if it was necessary to prevent a recession. It would ease, he implied, if policy makers put together a budget deficit-cutting package. But he does not believe further easing is ncessary right now, insisting that he sees no signs of a recession yet.
At the same time, inflationary worries persist. Indeed, just before Mr. Greenspan testified, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in June, more than twice the rate of the preceding two months. The Fed view is that too stimulative a monetary policy would worsen inflationary anxieties and send interest rates spiraling upward, jeopardizing the expansion itself.
The cardinal issue facing the Fed is how serious is the threat of recession and whether it would cause a serious crack in the nation's financial structure.
James J. O'Leary, economic consultant of the United States Trust Company of New York, argues that the threat of recession is real and the danger to the financial structure grave. He contends that the Fed has overstayed its policy of heading off rising inflation by trying to encourage sustained low economic growth without precitating a recession. ''This strategy, laudable as it has been, now seems in danger of tipping the economy into a recession, given the pervasive and very serious problems in our financial system,'' Mr. O'Leary said.
The economy, he warned, is ''very highly leveraged,'' with total outstanding debt having soared to $12.1 trillion from $4.2 trillion a decade ago. The substitution of debt for equity has led to a sharp increase in fixed interest payments as a share of corporate earnings: In the 1950's and 1960's it took 17 cents of every $1 of pre-interest earnings to service debt. In the 1970's the figure rose to 35 cents, and has now reached 61 cents.
With this year's decline in cash flow and profits, many companies are finding it hard to meet their fixed charges. Lenders, including both banks and life insurance companies, are experiencing high delinquencies and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and home mortgage loans. Delinquencies have also been rising on consumer loans.
There are signs, Mr. O'Leary says, that ''the constant din of troublesome developments in the financial system'' is starting to have a negative effect on consumer confidence. The American Express Bank Review supports that position, declaring that three factors are adding to the risks of recession: growing corporate debt, the savings and loan crisis and the need to cut the budget deficit.
Nevertheless, Mr. Greenspan is holding to a no-recession, moderate-growth forecast for the rest of 1990 and through 1991. He forecast economic growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent for 1990 and 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent next year.
Is he whistling in the dark? The weight of the evidence is on his side. The structure of interest rates indicates that there is no credit squeeze, and none is likely. A forecasting model developed by Prof. Campbell R. Harvey of Duke University, based on the spread between short- and long-term interest rates, generates forecasts very close to those reported by Mr. Greenspan.
Last June the Harvey model predicted real economic growth of 1.7 percent through the next four quarters; that prediction looks right on target for the rest of this year.
And the model, based on the difference between the five-year bond yield and the three-month Treasury bill, now predicts real growth of 2.4 percent during the next four quarters; the economy is likely to be sluggish until mid-1991 and then turn gradually upward. Applied retroactively to the business cycle over the last 25 years, the Harvey model has called every recession correctly, and it foresees no downturn in the coming year.
Policy blunders could blow this outlook. The best way to assure stable growth in the year ahead would be a Fed policy of easing short-term rates down gradually as the Administration and Congress move to narrow the budget deficit. And that is the best prescription for avoiding a devastating shock to the nation's financial structure.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Integrated's Battle Over Partnerships

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN the world of investing, there are few better positions than that of general partner in a widely distributed partnership. The fees roll in, generally regardless of how well the partnership is doing, and it is difficult to lose the job.
Those advantages, however, are not absolute, and a decision that a Federal bankruptcy judge in New York is facing may reinforce the rights of limited partners to throw out the management and redirect the lucrative fee income. Or it could serve to entrench the management. 
Judge Howard C. Buschman 3d heard arguments yesterday in the bankruptcy case of Integrated Resources Inc., the collapsed financial-services company. Much of Integrated's remaining assets consist of its general-partner interests in more than 600 partnerships that it sold to investors.
At stake is Integrated's plan to sell its stake in four of those partnerships, for at least $38.6 million and perhaps an additional $6.5 million, to another company, Krupp Inc. But Krupp will buy only if it can be assured that the fees will keep flowing, and there is a threat to that from an attempt by CRI Inc. to make a tender offer for the limited partnership units. So Integrated is seeking an injunction to bar CRI, a money-management company, from making the offer.
A ruling against Integrated would threaten to reduce severely the value of Integrated's remaining assets and to damage Integrated's bondholders even more. But a ruling for Integrated would, in effect, deny holders of partnership units their rights to sell their units to whomever they wish. Judge Buschman did not indicate when he would rule on that issue, although he did delay until Aug. 1 any proceedings in two related suits, filed in Delaware and California state courts, in which CRI is seeking to reverse some partnership rules it claims were hurriedly and illegally adopted this year to entrench management.
In a partnership, the general partner is usually the company that organized the partnership and picked up a variety of fees for doing so. The general partner owns a small part of the partnership, usually 1 percent or less, and there is no question that it has a right to sell that stake.
Its more important right as general partner is to choose the managers who run the partnership and collect fees that can be sizable. Generally, it chooses itself or affiliated companies.
But in most partnerships, the limited partners have a right, any time they choose, to change general partners. And the new general partner can hire different managers.
One glaring example of the value of being the general partner can be seen in a pending attempt by the Hallwood Group Inc. to take control of 11 real estate partnerships that were organized and managed by Equitec Inc., which is now in serious financial straits, although it has not filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws.
Hallwood, in a proposal that partners of the 11 funds will vote on next month, wants to combine the partnerships into a new, publicly traded partnership. In the process, it will pay Equitec more than $5 million for its stake, in effect valuing it substantially higher than the stakes of the other partners. In addition, the partnerships will pay Equitec an additional $9 million for little more than going away. Finally, Equitec will be allowed to share in the management fees for at least two more years.
Anthony J. Gumbiner, the chairman of Hallwood, said yesterday that he was not happy about the payments to Equitec, which he said had chosen properties poorly and had made some questionable decisions in running them. But he added that ''for the common good of the investors, it is far better to overpay Equitec to go away'' than to have it stay on. And he added that the management fees would be cut back, in effect paying back the partnerships for the $9 million within two years.
The other alternative, he said, would have been an expensive proxy fight, which would not have interested Hallwood. To make sure that Hallwood cannot be easily thrown out later, one provision of its offer provides that a two-thirds vote of the partners would be needed to dismiss it.
In the Integrated case, the partnerships at issue bought insured mortgages and have not performed as badly as the real estate partnerships in the Equitec case. CRI negotiated with Integrated to buy its stake, but was willing to do so only if it could get assurances that it would not be ousted, something that would need the approval of the limited partners. Instead, Integrated chose to proceed with a different sale and to seek the court order.
The judge's ruling, when it comes, may set a precedent for whether partnership investors who have suffered in bad deals will lose their rights when the sponsor gets into financial problem. In effect, the judge will be choosing between the bondholders who lent money to Integrated and the partnership investors who put up the money for the assets in the partnership.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Small Traders Take Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday in lackluster trading, with little news to affect the market.
Gold prices softened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, off 20 cents from late Wednesday. 
Traders described the market as listless, with primary dealers sidelined because of a lack of news.
''There's no real reason to buy or sell dollars,'' said Gabriele Schmitt, a vice president in the foreign exchange department of the Bank of New York.
The only activity came from small traders taking profits, she said. ''It was one of those choppy days that didn't have much reason behind it,'' Ms. Schmitt said. The traders said the market was seeking clearer signs on the direction of interest rates and inflation. Congressional testimony on Wednesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, failed to ease confusion about where American interest rates were headed, they said.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed would lower rates to prevent a recession, but only after lawmakers agreed on a deficit-reduction plan.
The market was further confused about inflation by a report from the Labor Department on Wednesday that consumer prices rose five-tenths of a percent in June, more than double the rate of the last two months.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 147.60 Japanese yen, from 147.25 yen late Wednesday. Later, in London, it rose to 148.00 yen. In New York, a dollar bought 148.09 yen, up from 147.77 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8155, from $1.8205 late Wednesday. In New York, a pound cost $1.8165, more expensive than $1.81525 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Wednesday, included: 1.6408 German marks, down from 1.6480; 1.4060 Swiss francs, down from 1.41585; 5.5045 French francs, down from 5.5285; 1,201.75 Italian lire, down from 1,207.00, and 1.1524 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15425.
The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $360.40, down 70 cents an ounce. The precious metal rose in London to a late bid of $362.75 an ounce, from a $360.25 bid late Wednesday.
Silver prices fell domestically after rising overseas. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $4.851 an ounce, down from $4.884 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Heroin Is Making Comeback In Lethal Tandem With Crack

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Stepping behind a rusty railroad car on the Brooklyn waterfront the other day, Brenda Gonzales stoked her crack pipe and inhaled deeply. Moments later she scooped grains of heroin into her nostrils.
''The crack gets me hyper,'' Ms. Gonzales said. ''I start sweating and I want more crack. So I take the heroin and get calm. It relaxes me.''
At 23 years old, Ms. Gonzales is part of a new and perhaps unwary generation of heroin users, discovering a drug that in the 1960's and 70's was synonymous with addiction and death. Now, amid the cocaine epidemic, heroin is making a comeback, creating dual addictions and increasing the potential for spreading the deadly AIDS virus through the use of hypodermic needles. 
 
New York a Heroin Hub
Although there has been no recent census to measure the increase in heroin use, interviews with researchers, clinicians and law enforcement officials suggest that the upsurge is most pronounced in New York, which has long been the national center for heroin distribution and where 200,000 of the country's estimated 500,000 heroin addicts live.
But the drug is also finding new followers in Washington, Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Seattle, as well as in Newark and Jersey City, the experts say.
''Two generations of young people were scared off heroin,'' said Philippe Bourgois, an anthropologist from San Francisco State University who has been doing field work in East Harlem for five years. ''Now cocaine and crack have turned out to be so extraordinarily destructive that people, ironically, end up back with heroin.''
Production of opium, the raw material for heroin, is booming in Asia and Latin America and seizures of the drug in the United States have been rising.
The growth in heroin use comes as evidence is accumulating that the consumption of crack and powdered cocaine has peaked and may be declining. And it seems to fit with a theory of many experts that drug use runs in cycles, with stimulants like cocaine alternating with depressants like heroin.
''I think heroin is going to be the drug of the 90's,'' said Felix Jimenez, the chief of the heroin division of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington.
David F. Musto, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine who is perhaps the country's leading historian on drug abuse, says he doubts heroin will come close to matching cocaine as the favorite drug of millions of Americans, largely because the growing anti-drug atmosphere in the country will serve as a brake on any new epidemic.
 
Soothing, Pure and Deceptive
Nevertheless, the revival of heroin compounds the country's struggle with drugs and raises new dangers for those who fall under its spell.
''The potential is pretty great for heroin becoming a major problem,'' said Dr. Richard E. Lopez, the acting director of the substance abuse program at District of Columbia General Hospital.
Heroin's allure, in this era of nerve-jangling crack, is its soothing quality, leading many to rely on it as a kind of self-medication. It is being sold at such high levels of purity that users no longer need confront the hypodermic needle, but can snort or smoke the drug. This, however, has given rise to the myth that if heroin is not injected, it is not addictive.
Most often, drug users take heroin to soften and prolong the effects of crack. But after a crack binge of three or four days, known as ''a mission,'' some take heroin as a sleeping pill. Still others take a $10 bag of heroin, the standard measure sold on the streets of New York, to stabilize a crack high in order to keep an appointment, for instance, or hide their addiction at work.
By following a hit of crack with a snort of heroin, ''You feel normal,'' said Mildred Mercado, a 25-year-old Brooklyn woman. ''You aren't really normal,'' she said, ''but it brings your heartbeat back to normal.''
 
Double Addictions Increasing
Enjoying a false sense of well-being, crack addicts using heroin often fail to recognize the extent of their deterioration. Increasingly, people are becoming addicted to both drugs, making recovery longer and more difficult.
Moreover, heroin addicts inevitably build up a tolerance for the drug and many eventually turn to the more efficient but extremely risky practice of injecting, which has become the leading way of transmitting the deadly AIDS virus in the metropolitan area.
Often the shift to shooting, as the addicts say, is explained as common-sense economics. ''Why should I buy three bags to snort when I can go shoot one bag and feel the same?'' said Michael Bethea, a former addict who works for the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment, a private group that counsels drug addicts in East Harlem and Brooklyn.
Ms. Mercado changed from snorting to shooting heroin about a month ago. ''It hits you quicker,'' she said, shortly after taking an injection the other day. ''Boom. I love it.'' Moving Directly to Heroin Officals at several drug-treatment programs in the city as well as sociologists working in the drug culture say they are routinely seeing cocaine and crack users shifting to heroin. Some young people, they say, are bypassing crack and moving directly into experimentation with heroin.
The New York State Division of Substance Abuse reports that 31 percent of the heroin users in drug-treatment programs last year said they snorted the drug compared with 15 percent three years earlier, adding that many of the users last year appeared to be newcomers to heroin.
Deaths from heroin overdoses, usually taken as an indicator of the drug's popularity, declined 22 percent in New York last year. But state drug officials say that figure is deceptive. An overdose death is less likely ''if you're snorting, as opposed to shooting heroin in the veins, because of the speed and the amount that gets in,'' said Dr. Stanley Yancovitz, the chief of medical dependency at the Beth Israel Medical Center, which operates the largest drug-treatment program in New York.
 
From Luxury to Obsession
In the early stages, drug users may treat heroin as a luxury, using it sparingly while spending most of their money on vials of crack for $2.50, $3 or $5, each vial containing three or four pinhead-sized pebbles of dehydrated cocaine. Eventually, however, the desire for heroin begins to feel like a necessity, said Ms. Gonzales and others.
She tried heroin as a teen-ager. Then in her 20's she shifted to crack and her heroin consumption more than quadrupled. She was dismissed from her job at a bakery and has been working as a prostitute. Now, she said, she doesn't start smoking crack unless she has a bag of heroin with her. ''If I don't have that bag of heroin,'' she said, ''I just keep smoking and searching for more money to get more crack.''
Jean Williams, a 34-year-old Brooklyn woman, used to snort heroin to mask her crack addiction when she worked as a clerk in a Manhattan law firm. ''You don't want to go to work feeling all jittery,'' she said, ''and I couldn't appear to be high. So I'd take a bag of dope.''
 
Crack Epidemic Fading
Many young people, according to researchers in New York and other cities, are beginning to shy away from crack after seeing how quickly people become addicted and burned out by the drug, how craving for it comes to dominate their lives. In contrast, they see heroin, which produces a rather peaceful high, as a benign drug. The newcomers seem to know nothing of the great heroin plague that laid waste to New York and many other cities in the late 60's and 70's. The number of addicts soared tenfold then, from about 50,000, and scores died from overdoses.
Terry Williams, a sociologist who has been studying the drug culture in New York for nearly 20 years, said that while crack use remains high, the epidemic appears to be burning itself out.
''You've reached a period where people have gone through the freneticness of crack; they've had friends and family members who've been involved in a negative way,'' he said.
Mr. Williams, the author of a book on young drug dealers called ''The Cocaine Kids,'' said he began to notice ''a really serious increase'' in heroin use last fall and discovered that many cocaine and crack dealers had added heroin to their line of products.
 
Typical Bag's Purity Rising
Heroin, like the cocaine products, is most widely available in the poorer sections of New York and other cities. Federal officials say that Chinese racketeers dominate the heroin trade in New York and mainly import a type known as China White, which is made from opium grown in the Golden Triangle, at the juncture of the borders of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar, formerly Burma. Dominicans, Jamaicans and American blacks serve as middlemen in New York's heroin business, the authorities say, with neighborhood youths handling street sales. While wholesale prices have declined, the price on the street has remained $10 a bag. But a typical bag now contains 20 percent pure heroin, up from less than 10 percent in the past. Often, the mix consists of 40 percent or more heroin.
''Heroin is starting to play a very strong role here,'' said Mr. Williams. ''I haven't seen so much of it since the early 70's.''

HEADLINE: VACANCY ON THE COURT;
BRENNAN, KEY LIBERAL, QUITS SUPREME COURT; BATTLE FOR SEAT LIKELY

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the Supreme Court's senior member, resigned from the Court tonight, effective immediately.
The sudden resignation of the 84-year-old Justice, the Court's leading liberal, raised the prospect of a major political battle over the future direction of the Court between the White House and the Democratic-controlled Senate, which would confirm or reject President Bush's nominee. .
President Bush said tonight that he planned to turn immediately to the task of choosing Justice Brennan's successor. He said he would convene a meeting at the White House Saturday morning to discuss possible nominees.
 
Bush Says He's 'Not Afraid'
He said he wanted the best-qualified person and was ''not afraid of starting a nomination fight.''
In the term that ended last month, Justice Brennan's vote made the difference in a series of 5-to-4 liberal victories on subjects including affirmative action and political patronage. 
Without his vote, the Court's razor-thin margin in favor of continued recognition of a constitutional right to abortion could well disappear.
The resignation came as a shock to the Court, the Congress and the White House, which apparently got the news in a letter Justice Brennan addressed to President Bush.
 
'Strenuous Demands' Cited
''The strenuous demands of Court work and its related duties required or expected of a Justice appear at this time to be incompatible with my advancing age and medical condition,'' Justice Brennan said in the letter. ''I therefore retire effective immediately as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,''
He did not elaborate on his health problems. But a family friend said tonight that Justice Brennan had suffered what turned out to be a mild stroke just before taking a two-week Scandinavian cruise with his wife, Mary. The couple completed the cruise and returned home on Tuesday. Justice Brennan's doctor diagnosed the stroke later in the week and advised the Justice that he needed to rest.
Justice Brennan had suffered a mild stroke in 1979 and had been hospitalized briefly for several relatively minor illnesses in the last few years.
The family friend said Justice Brennan was at home, was comfortable and was suffering no obvious impairment.
The Court released a statement from Justice Brennan tonight, saying ''This was a very difficult decision after almost 34 years of service on the Court.'' [Text, page 7A.] The choice of a successor presents President Bush with an important political challenge on the eve of the Congressional elections. The nomination could well become a battleground over abortion rights and similar issues, as the contentious battle over President Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork demonstrated three years ago. Judge Bork was defeated for the vacancy that was eventually filled by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
In several dozen appointments he has made to the Federal bench so far, Mr. Bush has generally followed President Reagan's approach in seeking judges who interpret laws narrowly, favor the prosecution in criminal matters and defer to Congress and state legislatures. He has been generally praised by conservatives for his judicial nominations.
Aboard Air Force One, which was taking the President to Washington from Cheyenne, Wyo., the President told reporters tonight: ''I've always said I want somebody who will be on there not to legislate from the bench but to faithfully interpret the Constitution. So that gives me wide latitude.''
Mr. Bush said he hoped he would select a nominee ''very very soon.'' He said he would meet Saturday with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh; John H. Sununu, his chief of staff, and C. Boyden Gray, his legal counsel.
''I want to move swiftly,'' the President said, ''but I want to move so that my nominee will be widely approved and quickly confirmed for this important post.''
 
A File of Potential Candidates
A senior Bush Administration official said tonight that Administration officials had discussed filling a Supreme Court vacancy in the abstract, without knowledge of when a vacancy might occur. He said that a file of potential candidates existed but that there was no ''short list'' of possible choices or even a firm idea of the process that the President would employ to select his first Supreme Court nominee.
Among those who have been mentioned as possible nominees are Kenneth W. Starr, the Solicitor General; Ralph K. Winter of New Haven, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Abraham D. Sofaer, a former Federal judge now in private law practice, who until recently served as the State Department's top lawyer.
Several other sitting Federal appellate judges have been mentioned, including Patrick E. Higginbotham of Dallas, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit; Roger Miner of Albany, who is on the Second Circuit; William W. Wilkins Jr. of Greenville, S.C., of the Fourth Circuit, and J. Clifford Wallace of San Diego and Cynthia H. Hall of Pasadena, Calif., both of the Ninth Circuit.
Some Congressional Democrats speculated that the President might choose a Senator in an effort to assure a speedy confirmation. Several prominent Republican incumbents are lawyers with an interest in the judiciary, including Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, a former state attorney general.
The Court, now in recess, returns for its 1990-91 term on Oct. 1, just over two months from now. With Congress due to leave early next month for a month-long recess, there is a prospect that only eight Justices will be sitting when the Court goes back into session. However, the Court does not begin handing down decisions until close to Thanksgiving. Arguments in cases on which there is a 4-to-4 deadlock can be reheard later in the term after the vacancy is filled. Several cases were argued again after Justice Kennedy's confirmation, in February 1988, filled a vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. the previous June.
 
Senator Gives Democrats' Reply
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, served notice tonight that a political fight was possible. Senator Kennedy, a leader in the battle that denied confirmation to Judge Bork, said: ''Justice Brennan's America is the kinder, gentler nation of which President Bush has eloquently spoken. I urge the President to nominate a successor worthy of that vision.''
Senator Kennedy hailed Justice Brennan, saying he had ''earned an extraordinary place in American history and American constitutional law'' and ranks ''with Marshall, Holmes and Brandeis as the greatest Justices the country has ever had.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Justice Brennan was a ''great figure in American law, and his wisdom on the court will be missed.''
 
'Voice of Caution'
Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Brennan's closest ally on the Court and at age 82 two years his junior, said tonight that Justice Brennan had been a ''voice of caution and compassion in urging that this Court not retreat from its constitutional mission to protect individuals' rights of freedom of expression, guarantee that minorities be free from discrimination and to assure the rights of those accused of crimes.''
In an interview tonight on the ABC News program ''Night Line,'' former Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. said he ''was very surprised'' by Justice Brennan's resignation.
''He has had health problems, but I did not realize that they had reached the point at which he would resign,'' Mr. Powell said.
The former Justice also said, ''A change of one Justice often affects various areas of constitutional law.'' Asked to name some areas that he thought would be affected by Justice Brennan's resignation, he mentioned affirmative action, abortion, criminal law and the interpretation of Federal habeas corpus law, which has often been used by inmates facing execution to challenge their sentences before the Supreme Court.
 
'One Person, One Vote'
After a judicial career with few parallels for length and dimension, Justice Brennan's influence extends to virtually every corner of modern constitutional law and to much of daily life.
As a relatively young Justice in 1962, he wrote the opinion in Baker v. Carr that led to the ''one person, one vote'' reapportionment cases. In his last week of active duty on the Court, last month, he wrote the opinion affirming the constitutional power of Congress to enact affirmative action programs.
In the decades in between, he played an instrumental role in a series of cases that opened the doors of Federal courts to people with complaints against government officials and that established the Federal courts as the guarantors of the quality of justice dispensed by state judicial systems.
His vote in school-prayer and other religion cases maintained strict separation of church and state. He wrote the 1964 landmark libel decision, New York Times v. Sullivan, finding that the First Amendment shields the press from liability for statements about public officials that cannot be shown to be deliberately false or published with reckless disregard for the truth.
Over the past decade, support eroded on the increasingly conservative Court for some of Justice Brennan's most cherished legal doctrines, particularly those involving the role of the Federal courts. And he was not able to win a majority for his view, shared with Justice Marshall, that the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances.
 
A Harvard Law Scholarship
William Brennan was born in 1906 in Newark. He attended the Newark public schools and graduated with a bachelor's degree, cum laude, in economics from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania in 1928. Shortly before his graduation, he married Marjorie Leonard of Belfast, N.Y.
Mr. Brennan then won a scholarship to Harvard Law School, where one of his professors was Felix Frankfurter, later a colleague on the Court. He graduated in 1931 among the top 10 students in the class.
Mr. Brennan became a trial lawyer specializing in labor cases. After World War II service in the Army, he worked in private practice for four more years.
In 1949 Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, offered him a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court, he gratefully accepted.
Two years later, he was elevated to the Appellate Division of that court, and in 1952 Governor Driscoll named him as an Associate Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Judge Brennan's elevation to the Supreme Court in 1956 came as a nearly complete surprise to the bench, to the bar and to Mr. Brennan. President Eisenhower named him to succeed Associate Justice Sherman Minton, who was about to retire because of poor health.
Eisenhower wrote later in his memoirs that he had been heavily influenced by praise of the appointee by Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Now a New Europe

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Now comes the long, intricate process of reorganizing Europe. The last couple of weeks - the NATO summit meeting, the Kohl-Gorbachev accord, the Paris talks on Germany - have removed all important barriers that kept Germany and the Continent divided since World War II.
It will take a few more years for the Soviet troops to go home, for getting rid of extravagant arsenals, for the two parts of Germany to meld effectively, for the Eastern Europeans to climb up into the modern economic and political world, for the Soviets to work out what kind of country, or countries, they intend to be.
But the new era starts now. The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945. 
Certainly the unease is there. And it is natural that fears focus on Germans, not only because of the past but also because of their capacity to exploit technology for economic power and because of their mass. They will outweigh each of their partners. It will be up to their partners, including the U.S., to show the energy and dedication to keep up with them in the East.
The Germans feel the discomfort too, in the midst of their euphoria at regaining full sovereignty and a single state. Their leaders are convinced that Mikhail Gorbachev wants American troops to remain ''to control the Germans,'' and so do they, officials say in private.
Still, it is oddly self-lacerating to complain at the skill and the snappy, crisis-free tempo with which the postwar European order is being demolished. Apparently President Bush and Chancellor Kohl have done such a good job of chocolate-coating the collapse of empire for the Russians that some critics think they've given away the goodies.
There have been some compromises that could cause trouble one day if the policy fails. One strange anomaly is that NATO's protective guarantees will extend to the Oder-Neisse border with Poland as soon as East Germany is absorbed, even though there will still be Soviet forces in the area for three or four years. The diplomats couldn't find a way around it, so they agreed to cross their fingers and live with it for the time being.
Another possible problem down the road is the ban on nuclear weapons and stationing - presumably also training and exercising - non-German NATO troops on former East German territory even after the Soviets leave. It's essentially a matter of principle, since nobody intended to send American soldiers or nuclear weapons there anyway. But it will leave an artificial, internationally endorsed military line down the middle of Germany when all the other remnants of partition are swept away.
These are the sorts of things that could bring friction if the overall policy fails, and the climate goes bad again. But if it fails, they would be minor sources of irritation compared with the big dangers. The chance of success for the new Europe requires sensible planning on how it can work. Anticipating only the worst possible cases would block that hope.
The limelight of attention switches compulsively from one personality to another. It's the Russian, the German, the American who is running away with the show, deviously leaving the others behind. That is largely optical illusion. In fact, there has been an unusually effective triple play among the three, each one passing the ball at a critical moment and advancing to the solution now achieved.
If the French and the British had little impact, it's mainly because they chose to dither, imagining they could delay events rather than joining the action. The Poles, who had a perfectly clear sense of what they needed all along - watertight renunciation of any German territorial claims - supported a united Germany in NATO from the start. They wound up proclaiming the result ''completely satisfactory,'' in the words of their Foreign Minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski. They will also get a general treaty of friendship and trade with Germany that they hope will be modeled on the French-German treaty, with similar profound effect.
Once again Mikhail Gorbachev has shown his capacity to do a flip-flop, moving with events when he is convinced he cannot forestall them. The interaction among him, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Bush has been a good sign, each showing an ability to take the others' needs into account. It enabled NATO's two-fisted Secretary General, Manfred Worner, to go to Moscow and declare, soothingly, ''We intend to steer change in Europe so that there are no losers, only winners.''
This is only the start. But the direction is right.

HEADLINE: Helms Aide Stirs Furor With Racial Accusation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The head of the N.A.A.C.P. and a black civil rights pioneer employed by Senator Jesse Helms have clashed over assertions by the Helms aide that some American black leaders are controlled by 15 powerful white men and are engaged in criminal and immoral activities.
The Helms staff member is James H. Meredith, whose enrollment at the University of Mississippi in 1962 touched off riots that left two dead and hundreds injured. On Monday, in a news release on Mr. Helms's Senate stationery, he said many leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and some black Democratic leaders were puppets of a small group of ''liberal elite'' whites.
He said he knew the names of the whites but he refused to divulge them or the names of any of the blacks he said were being controlled. He also charged that many of the 3,000 delegates at an N.A.A.C.P. convention in Los Angeles last weekend were involved in drug use, crime and immoral activities. He offered no evidence for any of his assertions. 
 
Compelled to Respond
Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., declined to respond at first, saying he would not ''dignify the stupidity of his allegations.'' But on Wednesday, he said the wide publicity given the Meredith assertions and the fact that they appeared on Mr. Helms's stationery compelled him to respond.
Describing the assertions as ''sheer nonsense'' and ''ludicrous,'' Mr. Hooks suggested that they were part of a ''sinister, devious and unholy plot'' to aid Mr. Helms's political career, and he called on the North Carolina Republican, a staunch opponent of civil rights legislation, to disavow and censure Mr. Meredith.
''I pose the question whether this entire episode is influenced by the fact that Senator Helms's opponent in the general election is Harvey Gantt, the Democratic candidate, who happens to be black,'' Mr. Hooks said at a news conference in New York. Mr. Gantt is a former Mayor of Charlotte.
Mr. Helms, in a statement Wednesday, said he had not authorized Mr. Meredith's news release and faulted him for using his Senate stationery and his free mailing privileges. But he added: ''It is his right to express his opinion, and I would think the press would respect that - even if he does not espouse the liberal ideas the press supports.''
Questions yesterday about the affair were referred by members of the Senator's staff in Washington to a spokesman, Eric Lundgren, who did not return two phone calls to a reporter seeking comment. The office said Mr. Meredith was unavailable.
 
A Harsh Critic
Mr. Meredith, after desegregating the University of Mississippi, was wounded in a civil rights march in Mississippi in 1966. But in later years, he became a harsh critic of the civil rights establishment and he has denounced integration and argued that a white liberal elite wants to keep blacks down under the pretext of helping them.
The 58-year-old Mr. Meredith has held many jobs, including financial planner and tree farmer, in various parts of the country and has made a number of trips to Africa to promote black economic development. Last September, he joined Mr. Helms's Washington staff as a domestic policy adviser.
Many blacks expressed surprise at his appointment, noting that Mr. Helms, since his election to the Senate in 1972, had been a scathing critic of domestic programs favored by many blacks, a defender of South Africa's white minority government and an opponent of efforts to make the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday.
But Mr. Meredith, at the time of his appointment, said he did not believe Senator Helms was hostile to blacks. ''I have never seen anyone sustain that charge or give one iota of evidence,'' he said.
Mr. Meredith, in his assertions on the Helms stationery this week, accused American black leaders, especially in the N.A.A.C.P. and the Democratic Party, of selling out to a cadre of white conspirators.
''The truth of the matter is that the liberal elite - with knowledge and full thought on the part of the black elite -have deliberately set up a phenomenon as part of their political power control, of taking a handful of selected blacks, giving them high rewards and using them to control the black population,'' Mr. Meredith said. Mr. Hooks, in his news conference, said ''the charges were so outlandish that no sane person could give them any degree of credibility.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Says China Backs Halt In Weapons to Khmer Rouge

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
A senior State Department official told Congress today that China had agreed to stop arms shipments to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas and to support a disarming of all military forces in Cambodia as part of an arrangement leading to elections there.
Richard H. Solomon, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told a committee of Congress that China's pledge, made at a meeting sponsored by the United Nations in Paris last Tuesday, was an advance in international negotiations to settle the Cambodian civil war.
The commitment he attributed to the Chinese came a day before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced in Paris that the United States was withdrawing its support from the Chinese-backed Cambodian coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge. That decision was in turn attacked in Beijing on Thursday. 
 
Tough Questioning
Mr. Solomon conceded, ''I wouldn't say time is on the side of a political solution.''
Mr. Solomon faced heavy criticism and tough questioning before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two days after the Administration announced a revision of its Cambodia policy by dropping diplomatic recognition for the Cambodia guerrilla coalition and opening talks with Vietnam.
Several senators asserted that despite the change, the continuation of United States aid to two non-Communist groups fighting to overthrow the Government still threatened to help the Khmer Rouge retake power.
The 11-year war pits the Vietnamese-backed Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen against a loose guerrilla alliance including the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist rebel groups. The United States gives more than $15 million in covert and overt aid each year to the non-Communist guerrillas.
The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1978, when more than a million people were systematically killed or starved. A Vietnamese invasion force overran the Khmer Rouge in 1979.
 
'Very Positive Development'
Mr. Solomon said the Administration's policy change accompanied previously unreported progress in the latest round of talks on Cambodia between the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
''One of the very positive developments'' that came out of the Paris session, Mr. Solomon said, was the agreement to ''a framework that would involve cantonment of the various forces after a cease-fire and a phased process by which the armed units would stack arms, and arms would come under United Nations control and supervision.''
He added: ''You've got to have the Chinese on board committed to cutting off arms and encouraging their friends to join in the political process. And they have told us they will do so. They have been constructive.''
The United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China have held five meetings on Cambodia since January. The talks, which will continue in New York on Aug. 27 and 28, have agreed that the United Nations should provide peacekeeping forces and foster an administration structure including all the known warring factions.
 
'The Time Is Past Due'
Mr. Solomon's description of the diplomatic advance went beyond the short communique released by the five countries on Tuesday that said ''the time is past due for the Cambodian parties to turn from the battlefield to the negotiating table.''
But neither the communique nor Mr. Solomon have indicated that the warring Government and guerrilla factions have come any closer to a settlement of their differences. The Khmer Rouge has insisted that guerrilla representatives outnumber Government representatives in the pre-election Supreme National Council, a proposal Mr. Hun Sen has dismissed as out of hand.
Critics, including several senators and witnesses who spoke today at the hearing, assert that China and the Khmer Rouge are interested in the negotiations merely to stall for time. The Communist guerrillas' real strategy, they say, is to amass their guerrilla forces and political cadres for a final offensive in the next year or two.
In testimony, former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie said, ''If Cambodia should again fall to the Khmer Rouge, the United States Government will have the blood of the Cambodian people on its hands.'' He recommended cutting off aid to the Cambodian guerrillas, opening talks with the Hun Sen Government, terminating the economic embargo on Cambodia, and pressing the Chinese to cut aid to the Khmer Rouge.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Shopping for CD Rates by Telephone

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Dialing for dollars has moved from the fantasy of television game shows to the reality of the trillion-dollar market for certificates of deposit.
A new telephone service started earlier this month by CD Rateline, a company in Armonk, N.Y., allows consumers to compare certificates of deposit and money-market accounts, either to obtain the highest interest rate or to make sure that their bank is offering a rate close to the competition.
When customers call 900-BANK-CDS, a recording tells them to select the information they want by pressing buttons on the telephone. One option provides a list of the five institutions offering the highest yields for CD's of the maturity selected by the caller. Another option provides CD yields of a particular institution. 
 
Sorting Things Out
 ''People are getting more comfortable doing their banking over the phone,'' said Les Dinkin, head of a management consulting company in Westport, Conn., that specializes in financial services. ''A rate-shopping service like this can help consumers sort out what is going on.''
Organizers of the new business started with information for more than 100 institutions in New York City, and plan to include northern New Jersey banks by next week and other major markets around the nation within a few months.
Because interest rates offered on certificates of deposit vary widely from bank to bank, shopping for a higher interest rate is easily worth the price of a phone call to the new service. Calls to CD Rateline are $1.95 for the first minute and 95 cents for each additional minute.
Before investors jump at the chance to earn a higher interest rate, they should consider the time and effort required to visit the new bank and complete forms. And investing by mail can mean lost checks.
But there are times when the attraction of a higher rate might be compelling, despite the inconvenience of changing accounts. This week, for example, the highest rate available in New York for a six-month certificate was 8.21 percent, yielding 8.50 percent after compounding, at the Eastchester Savings Bank. The lowest was a 6.85 percent rate, yielding 6.97 percent, at the Israel Discount Bank. The average for more than 100 banks was a yield of 8.20 percent.
The difference in interest earned on $10,000 over six months with the highest-rate CD compared with the lowest-rate one is $68. The difference between the highest and lowest rates varies depending on the maturity of the deposit, but often exceeds three percentage points, according to CD Rateline data.
''The inherent conflict between banks, who want to pay the lowest possible rate, and consumers, who want the highest rate, is the basic idea behind our business,'' said Keith Trauner, president of CD Rateline. ''We see this as a way we can make some money by providing money-making information for the average consumer.''
Since the early 1980's, when Federal ceilings on interest rates paid by banks and savings institutions began to be lifted, consumers have been confronted with a bewildering array of CD's, each with a different rate. Finding the best rate is often a hit-or-miss affair.
''Most people do not have time to do any serious survey of what is available,'' Mr. Trauner said. The lack of information, plus the time and effort needed by consumers to open a new account, gives bankers more leeway to keep rates as low as possible.
CD Rateline contacts each bank on Tuesday to collect the latest rate information. By Wednesday the information is on the telephone recording.
Interest rates quoted in the phone service are for $10,000 certificates. The service does not cover the higher interest rates available for larger deposits, and it lists only CD's with maturities of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months.
While CD Rateline says it is the first to offer bank-deposit information over a 900 phone number, there are several other companies that provide similar information in newsletters. Bank Advertising News of North Palm Beach, Fla., publishes ''100 Highest Yields,'' which tracks rates for small-sized certificates of deposit, as well as the ''Jumbo Flash Report,'' which tracks rates for $100,000 deposits. Many newspapers also publish lists of the highest rates for large- and small-sized CD's from banks and savings institutions nationwide.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD: Coping;
With Buying Luggage

BYLINE: By DEBORAH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Luggage is coming out of the closet as people prepare to pack for August vacations. And while most will carry bags they have toted on previous trips, others will head for department stores, luggage shops, chain stores and discount stores.
But unlike the impulse to shop for a new summer outfit, the motivation to buy new luggage is largely need rather than whim, according to a recent study by the Gallup Organization. Most people, the researchers reported, buy new pieces only if theirs are stolen, lost or falling apart. 
Last year Americans spent $2.6 billion on luggage, the Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America, an industry group, estimated. The purchases were based more on practical needs like durability and ease of handling rather than style. With that in mind, manufacturers have developed new lines of luggage designed to ease the burden of packing and toting vacation or business essentials.
''The public is saying, 'I don't want a bag that weighs 30 pounds before I even put anything in it,' '' said Michele M. Marini, editor in chief of Showcase Magazine, a trade publication. ''And as a result manufacturers have been introducing some new lines to meet those criteria.''
Samsonite recently introduced the Ultralite bag, which it says is 30 percent lighter than other structured soft-side bags. The 26-inch suitcase, the most popular size, weighs about five pounds and is on wheels. It costs $115.
Another Samsonite bag has a built-in luggage cart and comes in a carry-on size for overhead storing on a plane. The Piggyback Carry-On is a hard-side molded bag that can be pulled down an airplane's aisle. It is also made with a retractable strap so that up to two other bags can be pulled along with it. It measures 14 1/4 by 21 3/4 by 8 inches. It will be on the market next month at $179.99. While the airlines differ in their allowances for size, weight and number of pieces that can be carried aboard, the Air Transport Association offers these guidelines:
* Underseat bags, 9 by 14 by 22 inches with total dimensions of 45 inches.
* Garment bags, 4 inches by 23 inches by 45 inches with a total of 72 inches.
* Overhead bags, 10 inches by 14 inches by 36 inches with a total of 60 inches.
A need for portability and easy storage led to the Hartmann Luggage Company's new Trifold Hangbag. Extended, the garment bag measures 48 inches and can carry two suits. Folded, it reduces to 12 to 14 inches and will fit under a seat. It ranges in price from $305 to $680, depending on the material.
The new Hartmann Extended Hanger is 10 inches longer than the standard 44-inch bag, for the dresses of taller women, or an evening dress. The extra 10-inch flap folds up and the bag folds in half to measure 44 inches. It's $380 to $960.
Then there are the large-capacity bags and bags within bags, for items acquired on vacation. The bags are so big they are on wheels. One is made by Baltimore Luggage of especially sturdy nylon. It measures 32 by 15 by 15 inches and costs $125.
Samsonite's new Oyster Sport Edition is a hard-side case with a removable sport tote inside that can be carried separately. It comes in 24-inch, 26-inch and 29-inch sizes and sells for $90, $120 and $140.
After function, size, style and price, the buyer is left with a final consideration: color. Navy, tan, maroon, gray, rose and red are common choices. But Bob D'Addario, the buyer for the 30 Innovation Luggage stores in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, says the undisputed favorite is black.
''Black, black, black and lots more black,'' he said. ''You can open a luggage store with nothing but black luggage in it and be successful.''
 
BAGGAGE CHECK
The Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of America offer these tips:
COVERING: The material should be tightly woven and smooth to avoid snags. Look for bags treated to be stain- and water repellant.
CONSTRUCTION: Cases with reinforced narrow sides and corners wear best. Hard-sided cases should close tightly, with no gaps. Lids should stay open for easy packing and unpacking. Look for even stitches, with double-stitching at stress points.
HARDWARE: Solid brass and die-cast metal hardware are stronger than plastic or stamped metal. Look for secure shoulder-strap attachments and detachable straps that resist when you pull on them.
WHEELS: Wheels should be solidly affixed and the wheel system should handle turns easily.
GARMENT BAGS: Does the top of the bag have a bar support? A center bar in the middle of the case will anchor the handle and keep the case from sagging. A double track that allows hangers to be staggered maximizes space. A pocket or snap should secure the hanging hook when it is not in use.
HANDLES and STRAPS: Double screws or rivets are more secure than prongs. Look for adjustable shoulder straps and pull-straps that are long enough so you can pull the bag comfortably while standing upright.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Are Mixed; Trading Is Light and Choppy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday, ending slightly lower in domestic trading against every major currency but the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
Gold prices were mixed in New York after falling overseas.
Karen Gibbs, senior financial futures analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said currency trading was light and choppy largely because of uncertainty about the direction of the American economy. 
The dollar turned in its strongest performance against the yen.
Dealers said traders sold the yen for dollars and West German marks after Japanese money supply figures dashed hopes among some traders that Japanese authorities would move soon to lower interest rates.
Masayuki Takaura, senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in London, said the yen was due for a modest correction after recent gains. But he said the dollar's move through 148.50 yen in early European dealings helped produce a flurry of stop-loss dollar buying.
Ms. Gibbs said she felt that ''the path of least resistance is still down for the dollar.''
She said that the Federal Reserve's relaxation of credit conditions a week ago made American interest rates ''unattractive globally.'' She also said there was downward pressure on the dollar because Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had expressed willingness to lower rates further if a budget compromise was reached and the economy remained weak.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks, she said, showed ''they are not going to tighten, and that would be the only thing making the dollar more attractive.''
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.35 yen, from 147.60 Thursday. The dollar was quoted later in London at 148.90 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 148.65 yen, from 148.09 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8140, from $1.8155 late Thursday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8185 from $1.8165.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.6385 West German marks, down from 1.6408; 1.4043 Swiss francs, down from 1.4060; 5.4965 French francs, down from 5.5045; 1,200.00 Italian lire, down from 1,201.75, and 1.15495 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15235.
The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $360.75 a troy ounce, up 35 cents from Thursday's after-hours bid.

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Issues Post Small Rise

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities posted small increases yesterday in a muted reaction to further indications that the Federal Reserve was lowering key interest rates.
Dealers said the market would have been more positive to the Fed's latest move except for the fact that a record $135 billion of Treasury borrowings have been listed for auction during the next four weeks.
As has been the case recently, much of the money raised by the Treasury borrowings will be used to cover the mounting losses of the savings and loan industry. $2.5 Billion Injection ''The market has yet to fully absorb the significance of the flood of Treasury paper, including the quarterly refunding, that has been placed on the auction calendar,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The market's reaction thus far has been to keep prices of the longer maturities from rising.'' 
The Fed's latest move on interest rates was to inject $2.5 billion of temporary reserves into the banking system by effecting repurchase agreements on behalf of foreign central banks and other customers.
As usual, the immediate impact of this move was to reduce the key Federal funds rate to 7 15/16 percent from 8 percent, where it had been trading all week. The rate is what banks charge each other for temporary loans.
A much bolder move by the Fed a week earlier sent the Federal funds rate to 8 percent after hovering around the 8.25 percent level since last December. Normally, Treasury bill rates respond immediately to changes in the funds rate, but they hardly moved yesterday.
In late trading, the discount rate on 90-day bills was off a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, at 7.54 percent; six-month bills rose a basis point, to 7.46 percent, and the one-year bills were unchanged at 7.34 percent.
The Treasury announced that it would auction $10.25 billion of new one-year bills at its monthly auction of this maturity next Thursday.
At the far end of the Treasury market, the benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue that will mature in 2020, were offered late in the session at 102 11/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.53 percent, compared with 8.54 percent the day before and 8.45 percent a week before.
 
Notes of 1992 Rise
In between, the secondary market in Treasury debt found the 8 3/8 percent notes of 1992 up by 1/32, at 100 17/32, for a yield of 8.06 percent.
Next Wednesday, the Treasury plans to auction a record $11.5 billion of new two-year notes, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.05 percent, against 8.11 percent the day before.
The Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of 2000, rose 4/32, to 102 21/32, for a yield of 8.47 percent, up from 8.43 perent a week earlier. The yield on the comparable Japanese maturity climbed to 7.38 percent from 7.21 percent the week before, while that on the West German 10-year bonds dropped to 8.39 percent from 8.54 percent during the week.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Profit Off 67.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., July 20

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that its earnings fell 67.4 percent in the second quarter, confirming its earlier prediction that profits would plunge.
The construction equipment maker said it earned $46 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with $141 million, or $1.39 a share, in the comparable period of 1989. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $2.95 billion, down 3 percent from the period of last year, when Caterpillar reported $3.04 billion in revenue.
The company attributed the decline to an 8 percent drop in sales volume, offset in part by higher prices and a $19 million improvement in revenue from its financial subsidiaries.
In a statement, the company attributed its sagging profits to a lower demand for machines among many industrial nations. On June 25, Caterpillar announced that drastic new economic policies in Brazil were having a disastrous impact on the company's profits.
Sales inside the United States were $1.3 billion for the quarter, a drop of $59 million from last year.
Caterpillar also said that it was the target of a class-action lawsuit filed this week in Peoria, Ill., regarding its financial condition. The company had no further comment on the suit.

HEADLINE: Meetings Are Shifted By Chase

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Hurt by weak earnings, Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's first- and second-largest banking companies, are cutting costs and focusing on the most prestigious part of their businesses: handling large corporate clients.
The more austere approach at Chase was signaled on Thursday, when senior officers were told that the international advisory committee - a group of 19 of the world's most prominent business executives headed by David Rockefeller, chairman of the bank in the 1970's - would hold two meetings later this year at Chase's headquarters in New York rather than in London and Brussels as planned.
And Chase directors, in an apparent effort to set an example for the rest of the bank, agreed to shift a meeting later this year from Williamsburg, Va., also to the more economical setting of Chase's headquarters building near Wall Street.
 
'A Massive Effort'
Chase officials declined to comment publicly on the changes. ''It is true, however,'' said Fraser P. Seitel, a spokesman for Chase, ''that we are engaged in a massive effort at Chase to do two things - boost revenues and reduce operating expenses by $300 million a year.'' 
Bank insiders said the changes were disclosed Thursday morning when Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase's newly named chairman, briefed senior officers about the previous day's board meeting.
At Citicorp, cost-cutting is concentrating on the global finance group, which lends to large corporations in North America, Europe and Japan. The bank said yesterday that it was reorganizing the group's management structure in ways that ''ultimately will result in fewer people and lower costs.'' Job Losses Acknowledged While both Chase and Citicorp are still working on details of how to reorganize their corporate lending businesses, they acknowledge that many jobs will be lost. At Chase, executives estimate that more than 3,000 employees might be cut, out of its work force of 42,000. Citicorp, with 90,000 employees, has not indicated how many jobs might be lost as it reorganizes the 15,000-employee global finance group, but analysts expect that a cut of several thousand is likely.
A large number of the layoffs are expected in New York City, where both banks are based. But both are continuing to expand their consumer banking business, which employs the greatest number of workers.
''We are witnessing truly major efforts to control costs, the like of which American banks have never seen before,'' said Thomas Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers.
While the cost-cutting ''is long overdue,'' Mr. Hanley added, a determined management could cut costs more than might now be expected. At Chase, for example, ''I expect they will ultimately achieve cost savings substantially greater than the $300 million target they have set,'' he said.
Frank DeSantis, an analyst of large New York City banks at Paine Webber Inc., said the actions at Chase were a reminder that ''it is amazing what people can do in a crisis.'' Spending on meals and lodging for directors and the advisory committee is not the major problem at Chase, but ''the changes are symbolic and show a willingness of management to cut expenses starting at the top and going down,'' he added.
The shifts of meetings were suggested by Mr. Labrecque, whose announcement was loudly applauded at the normally uneventful monthly meeting of the senior officers, bankers at the meeting said. The 51-year-old Mr. Labrecque, an executive with 26 years of experience at Chase, was named in June to succeed Willard C. Butcher as chairman at the end of October. Mr. Butcher, who is retiring, was selected by Mr. Rockefeller to run the bank during the 1980's.
 
Profits Rather Than Prestige
Because Chase has been well known in banking circles for lavish spending on entertainment of clients and senior employees, analysts saw the willingness to cut spending on meetings of the advisory committee and the directors as a sign that under Mr. Labrecque the bank will become more concerned with profits than prestige.
The international advisory committee was created by Mr. Rockefeller as a way for Chase to benefit from the economic and political insights of key business leaders. Henry A. Kissinger is a member of the committee, along with Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat S.p.A., and Lord Carrington, chairman of the Christies International auction house and a former British Foreign Secretary.
Under Mr. Rockefeller, and to a lesser extent Mr. Butcher, the chairman of Chase has tended to be more involved with activities like the international advisory committee, leaving to subordinates the nitty-gritty work of controlling costs and avoiding bad loans.
Mr. Labrecque has already indicated he will be more active than his predecessors in the daily management of the bank.
 
Employee-Protection Plan
Other action taken by Chase's board on Wednesday included approval of a plan to protect all employee severance pay agreements and retirement funds if control of the company changed. The so-called ''tin parachutes'' would not necessarily prevent an unwanted acquisition or merger, but they have been adopted by other banking companies because they make employees more confident about their future.
The need for cost-cutting is especially evident at banks like Chase and Citicorp, which have been hurt by a decline in wholesale lending and other financing for large corporations. While the banks still maintain expensive networks of foreign offices, corporate treasurers have learned how to borrow more cheaply in the securities markets or from foreign banks. During 1989, the decline in the wholesale banking business with large corporations accelerated, as the number and size of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts dropped.
Citicorp executives say they do not have a target for how many jobs will be cut in the next few years. But analysts said they expected Citicorp would cut costs in its global finance group by at least 10 percent, with the loss of several thousand jobs. Profits in the global finance group, headed since January by Michael A. Callen, fell 69 percent in the second quarter, to $42 million, as operating expenses rose along with the costs of bad loans.
 
Change in Measurements
To improve the performance of the global finance group, Mr. Callen said that the practice of measuring bankers' performances by earnings of each profit center would be de-emphasized and replaced by measures of market share, rankings compared with other banks and the total amount of revenues from a corporate client.
Mr. Callen said he was beginning to review staffing in each of 50 different activities of the global finance group with a goal of cutting back the layers of management.
Citicorp and Chase are not the only money-center banks acting to reduce costs. Earlier this week, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, the eighth-largest banking company, said it was planning to cut 1,400 jobs and reduce costs by $125 million annually. Most of the cuts are also expected in the corporate finance area.

HEADLINE: An Evolving Cityscape Mixes New Shapes With Old

 BODY:
Urban renewal is a natural, continuing process in New York. New construction supplements old, creating a subtle but vital sense of evolution in the city.

HEADLINE: Tax Protest Shows Splits In New Jersey

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLMDEL, N.J., July 19

 BODY:
A gathering of mayors from across New Jersey tonight was advertised by its host, Mayor Peggy Lasky of Holmdel, as a search for ''constructive reform'' of the $2.8 billion in higher income taxes and sales taxes that Gov. Jim Florio pushed through the Legislature.
But over three and a half hours, the meeting of 110 mayors and municipal officials evolved into partisan fighting between Republicans and Democrats, and an illustration of the wide gulf separating New Jersey's poor cities and prosperous suburbs.
The Governor, in arguing that New Jersey cannot afford to remain separated into rich and poor, fashioned his tax and school-financing package so that the state's wealthiest residents and communities would bear much of the tax burden for increasing school aid and providing property-tax relief in cities and poor rural areas.
 
Urban Democrats
John F. Zisa, a Republican who is Mayor of Hackensack, which is to lose millions of dollars in school aid under Mr. Florio's plan, called the session ''New Jersey's first 'Tea Party.' '' And for Republicans the meeting was a pep rally, with Republican mayors serving up anti-tax rhetoric to a crowd of about 350 people in the audience at Holmdel High School already brimming with hostility to Mr. Florio. 
Two pro-Florio, big-city Democrats, Sharpe James of Newark and William Pascrell of Paterson, appealed for unity and drew hoots in response.
''Instead of pointing fingers at one another, we should work together to get an equitable solution,'' Mr. Pascrell said. ''We need to lower our voices if we're going to have one New Jersey. Each of our pains should be all of our pains.''
That drew a deep round of boos from the audience. Mr. James called the Governor courageous for cutting the state budget by $2 billion and said ''we should march together.'' More boos erupted. ''Come up with alternatives and I'll listen,'' he said. More boos arose. When Ms. Lasky summoned the mayors in a July 4 letter, she wrote that she was ''fighting mad'' about the Florio tax package and told her colleagues that they should ''do something that will be heard all the way to Trenton.'' An agenda accompanying the letter suggested withholding tax payments to the state and organizing a major march on Trenton.
No such plans emerged tonight. A 16-member committee was created, but with a murky agenda and its schedule for future meetings vague.
At the meeting's end, Mr. Lasky said that she would summon the committee in mid-August, after her vacation, and that they would consider a list of issues to present to the Governor, including repealing the tax package and dropping the state's mandate that school districts, rather than the state, pay their teachers' pensions costs.
Despite Mr. Zisa's talk about a tea party, nobody suggested withholding tax payments.
At one point, Democratic mayors sought to undercut the entire proceeding. They pressed for a vote that would have allowed the state's League of Municipalities and its Conference of Mayors to act as the official mechanism for any mayors' complaints about the higher taxes.
 
'Like a Republican Conspiracy'
Ms. Lasky refused to allow the vote, and many Democrats left.
After they did, Florio aides who said they had come as observers spent several minutes ushering Democrats to reporters.
''It's like a Republican conspiracy,'' grumbled Michael Voll, Mayor of Middle Township.
''I'm not sure what this ad hoc group wants to accomplish,'' complained Donald Rainear, Mayor of Bridgeton. ''It appears to be a lot of Florio-bashing.''
Holmdel and other towns in Monmouth County and neighboring Ocean County are a center of anti-Florio, anti-tax sentiment now. A grass-roots tax-revolt movement, Hands Across New Jersey, is centered in the two counties. Its founder, John Budzash, a 39-year-old mailman, said 350,000 people have signed petitions calling for repeal of the Florio tax package, legislation allowing voters to recall a governor and members of the Legislature, and binding referendums on the November ballot.
 
A Committee Is Proposed
Those petitions have recently started appearing in the affluent suburbs of Bergen, Essex, and Morris Counties. Those areas face the stiffest increases in income taxes and deepest cuts in state school aid under the Florio package. Resentment runs deep in those counties, but there has been no coordinated protest there.
On a night thick with political verbiage, one novel reformist idea was offered. Timothy McDonough, a political independent and Mayor of Hope Township, a community of about 1,700 in rural Warren County on the Delaware River, proposed creation of a committee of business executives, citizens and state officials to monitor the state's revenues each month.
''The minute they drop below projections, we cut state spending on the spot,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''It's a simple law of economics. You've got to have money to spend it. What's the alternative? Raising taxes, which is why we are here tonight.''
Democratic mayors said a multimillion-dollar deficit left behind by Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, forced Mr. Florio's sweeping tax increases, the largest in state history. Republicans and their sympathizers in the audience wanted none of that.
 
'Something Called Recall'
The Mayor of Parsippany-Troy Hills, Frank Priore, a Republican, accused the Governor of over-taxing residents. He said $700 million could have closed the budget gap and another $500 million could have satisfied the recent State Supreme Court mandate for additional financing for the state's poorest 28 urban school systems.
''Why take $2.8 billion from the taxpayers?'' Mr. Priore shouted to the audience, drawing a roar of approval. ''In my town they have something called recall. It makes you receptive and responsible to the people.''
Another Republican Mayor, Bob McKenna, of Wall Township, devoted his time to a second theme of the anti-tax movement - legislation to establish initiative and referendum processes to give voters the authority to write law without going through the Legislature.
''People have to feel they have some degree of control,'' Mr. McKenna said. ''The greatest shame of this entire situation is the cynicism the average person in the state has developed. People have lost faith.''

HEADLINE: Sandinistas' U.S. Friends: Case of Dashed Ideals

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Americans who spent much of the last 10 years working in the United States and Nicaragua on behalf of the Sandinista Government now find themselves back in their cramped and dreary offices in New York, stunned by defeat, deserted by their constituency and searching for a new outlet for their dreams.
After the Sandinista Party lost the national election in February, donations to the American groups plummeted, projects in Nicaragua were suspended, volunteers returned to the United States, and trips to Nicaragua were cut back or canceled.
The morale of those men and women has suffered what many say is an irreversible blow. They went to Nicaragua to help the Sandinistas build what they called a new society. Although the Americans could continue their humanitarian programs there, the Sandinistas' loss of power has removed much of the utopian appeal of the work. ''The only thing I can compare it to is the day Kennedy was shot,'' Lynda Sharp said of the election. She belongs to the Nicaragua Solidarity Network of Greater New York. 
The election brought Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her United States-backed coalition, the National Opposition Union, to power. The vote shattered the faith that many volunteers had in the Sandinistas, who survived nearly 10 years of war with the American-backed contra rebels. Scores of volunteers are searching for new political movements to support.
''Folks are finding themselves moving to other countries where there is a lot of conflict, like the Middle East and South Africa,'' said Lucy F. Harris, coordinator of the Witness for Peace delegations in Nicaragua. ''Since the elections our numbers have fallen off by about 50 percent.''
At the cluttered office of the solidarity network on the top floor of a three-story brick building at Bleecker and Lafayette Streets in Greenwich Village, the walls document the cause. There are posters in English and Spanish denouncing United States intervention in Nicaragua, pictures of Augusto Cesar Sandino, the Nicaraguan revolutionary hero, and multicolored banners tightly furled around wood poles that denounce American policy and call on people to defend the Sandinista revolution.
The 30 volunteers involved with the solidarity network, which has a yearly budget of $20,000, said they remained committed to the Sandinistas. But even they recognize that times are difficult. The Sandinistas, who were armed by Cuba and the Soviet bloc but were also supported by many democratic governments in Latin America and Europe, describe themselves as democratic socialists trying to provide a better life for workers and peasants. They sought to abolish privilege and economic inequities, including the unequal distribution of land and basic resources.
The American workers, many of them alienated by the culture and political life in the United States, saw in the Sandinista Government the embodiment of a simpler and more egalitarian society that they thought the United States should emulate.
''They gave a new definition to democracy,'' William Wilhelm, 29, a leader in the solidarity network, said. ''They built a democracy that was striving to be economic and political, that pervaded all levels in society.''
Solidarity groups had an important role in the often angry debate about United States policy toward Nicaragua. They publicized what they saw as atrocities by the contra army, which was backed by the United States, and developed a wide grass-roots network, especially in churches and universities.
The groups organized two- or three-week tours in which an estimated 250,000 Americans paid their way to Nicaragua. The Americans were often taken to pro-Sandinista organizaions in air-conditioned buses and returned to meet local groups to extol the virtues of Sandinismo and expose what they saw as the terrorism of the contras.
 
Historical Precedents
Hundreds visited for longer periods to work for pittances for the Sandinistas or Sandinista-backed organizations. The visitors worked on activities like water purification and erecting community buildings.
''The extraordinary thing about the Nicaraguan political tours and the attraction exerted by the Nicaraguan political system is that there were many historical precedents of the same phenomena,'' said Dr. Paul Hollander, a professor of sociology at the University of Massaschusetts at Amherst. Dr. Hollander wrote ''Political Pilgrims,'' an examination of socialist systems and their attractions to Western intellectuals.
''High hopes were dashed when earlier generations learned about the realities of the Soviet, Chinese, Cuban, Vietnamese and other political systems,'' Dr. Hollander said. ''A lot of well-educated people learned nothing from this, because they had an urgent need to find a countermodel to the inequality and meaninglessness that they felt prevailed in their own society.''
The loss of the election on Feb. 25 tarnished the messianic quality of the effort in Nicaragua.
''If they remained involved in projects in Nicaragua, their humanitarian activities would have had a more mundane or prosaic aspect to them,'' Dr. Hollander said. ''It would have been no diffferent from building clinics or rural schools in, say, Mexico, where the poor would equally have benefited from such activities, but without the mystique of building a fundamentally different society. Nor would they have been in a position to make a statement against U.S. foreign policy through such activities.''
Witness for Peace, which has taken more than 3,400 people to Nicaragua since 1984, canceled 6 of its 28 delegations this year and combined 2 others.
Two weeks ago the New York Nicaragua Construction Brigade, which had sent 10 groups, closed because money and interest were lacking. Other groups like the Nica School in Nicaragua, which gave classes in Spanish and lectured on the achievements of the revolution, have also closed.
''The members were involved in other things, and there was no new life in the organization,'' said Regina M. Shields, 24, who had worked for the construction brigade. ''The concept of a construction brigade lost its flair.''
 
Decline in Number of Travelers
Contributions have also fallen off sharply. ''The financial effect has been grave,'' said Vivian Stromberg, executive director of Madre, a group that says it has sent more than $1 million in medical supplies to Nicaragua since 1984 and has cut its full-time staff, to 5 from 10.
Marazul Tours, which specializes in trips to Cuba and Nicaragua for political groups, advertised a travel package to Nicaragua for the 11th anniversary of the revolution, which was celebrated on Thursday. The agency, which has arranged trips to Nicaragua for 25,000 people in the last 10 years, helped 250 people attend the anniversary last year. This year no one signed up for the group tour, although the agency arranged for 12 individuals to go to the fete.
Many workers who had lived in Nicaragua have returned to the United States. ''Our ability to continue doing what we were doing there has been reduced following the election,'' said Dee C. Knight, 43, who worked for more than two years with the newspaper of the Sandinista Party and returned recently to New York.
Projects in Nicaragua have wound down in the wake of the elections. A group in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, a ''sister city'' group, has suspended the aid it was sending to build a well in the town of El Jicaral.
''After the elections, suddenly there was a division in our group,'' said Guadalupe Landaverde, 45, a high school teacher and a leader of the Chelsea group. ''We are trying to make a decision. Should we continue to work on the well or work with organizations here that deal with drug abuse, the dropout rate in the schools, housing and health care?''
Ms. Landaverde said she knew of other groups that had more difficulties. ''You should see the groups that are in solidarity with the people of Eastern Europe,'' she said. ''I hear they are in real trouble.''

HEADLINE: Japanese in the New York Region Begin to Feel the Sting of Prejudice

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Japanese who have settled in the New York suburbs, whether for a temporary business assignment or for good, are starting to feel a backlash from their growing presence and the rising economic tensions between Japan and the United States.
In Rye, N.Y., a handful of American parents, unhappy that Japanese enrollment in public schools has swelled so that in one elementary school a fourth of the pupils are Japanese, have quietly pulled their children out of the prestigious system, school officials say.
''You will find people who are totally offended by their being here, which, to me, is a very basic form of bigotry,'' said Lynn Ferrari, a spokeswoman for the district.
 
Japanese-Americans Affected
In Knollwood, N.J., Tak Furumoto, a 45-year-old real-estate broker born in the United States, was dining in a restaurant not long after Mitsubishi bought a majority stake in Rockefeller Center when, he said, ''A couple came up to us and said, 'Why are you guys buying up America?' I told them, 'Hey, we're Japanese-Americans, and I fought in Vietnam.' ''
''But that didn't help,'' he continued. ''Japanese-Americans are affected as well. People don't make the distinction.'' 
Several factors have contributed to what some Japanese and experts in relations between the two countries see as a backlash of feelings.
A rapid movement of Japanese during the 1980's - into many of the New York metropolitan region's most affluent suburbs - has transformed neighborhoods and school districts.
Once here, Japanese students tend to spend more time studying and earn better grades than American students, educators say. #60,000 in Region Language and cultural barriers, as well as the fact that most Japanese families are on temporary assignment, have led to social isolation. And as the Japanese presence has increased, there has been a growing resentment among many Americans who believe the Japanese have usurped the United States' position in the world economy.
Safety and good school districts have attracted many of the Japanese to suburbs like Fort Lee, N.J., and Scarsdale, Hartsdale and Rye, all in Westchester County, N.Y.
There are an estimated 60,000 Japanese men, women and children living in the New York region, according to the Japanese Consulate. For the most part, they are here for a few years with Japanese corporations, but there are also long-term residents who never obtained United States citizenship and spouses of American citizens.
''It's a new phenomenon that people have yet to absorb,'' said Daniel Bob, the assistant director of studies and policy programs at the Japan Society, a private organization committed to bettering understanding between the United States and Japan.
 
Tensions Are Often Muted
''It's similar to the American invasion of Europe in the 1960's,'' he said. ''Initially, there was a great uproar over American investments and fear of an American takeover. It's a natural reaction to something that happens so quickly.''
Many Japanese say they have yet to encounter strained feelings. Moreover, signs of tension are usually muted in the educated, sophisticated communities with the greatest concentration of Japanese.
''You see Japan blamed and put down on television, in newspapers and in political speeches,'' said Masato Matsuo, 53, a Scarsdale resident and president of Nippon Zeon, a chemical company in White Plains. ''But I don't directly see this in my personal relationships. The intellectuals know exactly what's going on and don't blame me for it.''
In gestures grand and small, the Japanese have also tried to smooth relations. Many drive American cars - a symbolic act bespeaking a respect for American products at a time when Japanese consumer products dominate.
 
Tour for Educators
In Harrison, N.Y., another Westchester town, the founders of a new Japanese high school gave the town $500,000 in thanks for its cooperation. In Rye, 48 Japanese families donated 10 fully grown Japanese cherry trees to a school at graduation this year.
And for the second year in a row, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of New York flew a dozen educators from the New York region to Japan for a two-week tour.
''It was fantastic,'' said Dr. Barry Farnham, the Superintendent of the Rye school district, after returning this month. ''I really got to know Japan as a country and the Japanese as a people.''
Yet it is not unusual to overhear people castigating the Japanese in whispered conversations for ''taking over'' their neighborhoods or schools or country clubs. Racist outbursts have grown common, too. Motorists yell ''Japs'' at Japanese golfers as they drive by.
''I've been playing golf for years, and I've never heard this as much as in the last year,'' said Mr. Furumoto, who was born in an internment camp in California during World War II.
 
Cultural Barriers
Recently Hisako Cunningham, a New Yorker for 23 years, approached a woman who had illegally parked in a handicapped-parking space in Elmsford, N.Y. Mrs. Cunningham, who works with handicapped people, said she asked the woman if she had a permit, and was told to ''go back where you came from.''
''That wouldn't have happened 10 years ago,'' said Mrs. Cunningham, who is married to an American citizen.
Mrs. Cunningham is also president of a self-help group in Westchester County that serves some 90 Asian mothers, most of them Japanese.
She says she understands why many Japanese appear to shy from social connections - they don't seek ''social expansion'' even in Japan, she said, and are hindered by the language barrier. But the isolation worries her.
 
Confrontations at School
''Their attitude is 'As long as we don't become a social burden, as long as we are law-abiding residents, then we're O.K.,' '' she said. ''They're not aware of the impact their clinging tendency has on American society.''
This spring her group, Services to Parents of Exceptional Asian Children, surveyed 147 Japanese households to see how parents felt about their children's education and assimilation. An intitial look at the responses, she said, found that parents were concerned about bullying and the mysterious disappearance of their children's belongings, especially high-tech gadgets, in school.
Indeed, school seems to be the place where conflicts, real or perceived, are played out most. Some American parents object that a teacher's attention is diverted at the elementary level by children speaking Japanese. In high school, some argue, the academic success of Japanese students who then return to Japan for college is unfairly skewing the class rank of American students.
''By the time kids around here reach high school, they expect Japanese students to win most of the high-achievement awards,'' said a mother in Rye. ''That can be defeating.'' 'Extremely Distracting'
The mother, who has lived in Rye for 16 years and has three children, took her son out of the public elementary school a few years ago in part because of what she called the ''imbalance'' of Japanese students. She agreed to discuss her reasons on condition that she not be named.
''There were 20 students in his class and six were Japanese,'' she said. ''It was extremely distracting for my son to hear students speaking Japanese while the teacher spoke English.''
Education and government leaders brush aside those concerns. ''You don't have to give the Japanese students much attention because they pick up the language rapidly,'' said Dr. Charles J. Murphy, the Superintendent of the Eastchester school district, where 15 percent of the enrollment is Japanese, up from 8 percent 10 years ago.
Dr. Farnham of Rye said, ''My feeling is that we are a public school system, and we need to respond to our constituents. If we have large numbers of Hispanic students or Japanese students, we must adapt accordingly.''
 
'A Wonderful Challenge'
The competition from Japanese students at the high school level is healthy, in the view of Charles Balancia, the Town Supervisor of Harrison, where the private Keio High School of New York is to open soon.
''If it takes the Japanese children to show us how to excel, so be it,'' he said. ''We have to become more competitive in the world marketplace. This is a wonderful challenge.''
The relations between students themselves are becoming standoffish. When Maki Morimoto arrived in Rye five years ago, he was one of five Japanese students in the eighth grade, but the population has since grown.
''As the number of Japanese students increases, there's more isolation, both because the Japanese are grouping together and Americans aren't making an effort to know them,'' said Mr. Morimoto, the only one of 10 Japanese graduates from Rye this year staying in the United States for college. He will enter Brown University this fall.
''I think, too,'' he said, ''that the American students are probably jealous of the Japanese math and science whizzes.''
Mr. Morimoto was unusual in high school, able to bridge the gap between the communities. A member of the tennis, cross-country and ski teams, he attended American parties, which few of the Japanese students did. His assimilation was eased by his relatively long stay in the United States and by his father's familiarity with American culture after graduate studies at the University of Wisconson.
''I'm so happy being here,'' Mr. Morimoto said. ''Although there's tension between Americans and Japanese -it's definitely there - I can deal with it.''

HEADLINE: Army Town in Texas Pays the Price of Peace

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT HOOD, Tex., July 20

 BODY:
There were no victory parades here when the cold war ended. Instead, warriors began slipping away, tanks were lined up neatly on parking lots for storage, and the civilians who live around this huge Army base started feeling as though they were the losers.
This summer, responding to what it calls ''recent changes in the international climate,'' the Army has begun to dismantle the Second Armored Division, which has 12,000 soldiers based here. The division, known as ''Hell on Wheels,'' was created by Gen. George S. Patton Jr. and fought Nazi panzer divisions in France, Belgium and Germany as part of his Third Army in World War II. Since 1951 it has been poised to fight World War III by rushing troops to protect West Germany from Communist invaders.
''We're all for peace,'' said Mayor Major Blair of Killeen, a central Texas city situated just beyond the gates of the fort. ''But there is something totally wrong about how this is happening. We've always backed the military 100 percent all the way, but now that everything is supposed to be just fine over there, we're going to be living in welfare conditions over here.'' 
 
A Devastating Local Effect
Even though the base is not closing and thousands of troops will remain, the dismantling of the division is expected to have as severe an effect on the local economy as any of the military cutbacks announced so far. The fort is virtually the only source of economic activity for the surrounding area.
Property values in Killeen and neighboring towns have dropped 20 percent since January, when the move was announced, and economists have said unemployment could approach 25 percent after the Second Armored is completely gone by September 1991.
Already some guidons, the banners that the division carried to victory in places like St. Lo and the Battle of the Bulge, are being furled. By the end of the summer about 3,500 soldiers from the Second Armored will be reassigned to other units, and their tanks and other vehicles will be stored in motor pools stretching two and a half miles into the rolling hills.
 
Some Misgivings at Home
In Washington, politicians and analysts are debating whether the United States has been left behind in a world changing so quickly that West Germany decides to offer economic aid to the Soviet Union.
But in Killeen, people like Mayor Blair find it bitterly ironic that their city has fallen victim to the cold war it helped to win. And they express misgivings that go beyond their own hardships.
''This is an awfully fine unit to be throwing away,'' the Mayor said. ''I wish we'd wait until the Russians got rid of theirs before we did it.''
Attracted by the mix of woodlands and rolling savanna, the Army started buying land around Killeen in 1942. There were fewer than 2,000 people in the area then, and there was a lot of empty space.
 
Heavy Military Presence
The base now covers 217,237 acres, and 68,000 people are living in Killeen. The Army fills the vast emptiness. Roughly 100 miles from both Austin and Dallas, Killeen is close enough to be outclassed economically by the two cities but too far away to benefit from their growth. Nearly two-thirds of the families in Killeen, including a growing number of retired military personnel, draw their income directly from the Army.
The military presence gives Killeen a gaudy look not found in the average central Texas town. Cars with out-of-state license plates driven by young men with close-cropped hair fill streets, like Rancier Avenue, that are lined with fast food restaurants, motorcycle and used car dealers, cheap motels and pawn shops.
''My grandparents farmed land that had been in the family for generations until the Army came along and bought them out,'' said Bruce Whitis. ''Without land they had to come to town and learn how to make a living off the military people who moved onto the land.''
Mr. Whitis, aware of the money management problems seemingly endemic to young soldiers, manages five pawn shops strategically situated near the fort's gates.
 
'Prepare for the Worst'
''We've become totally dependent on the military,'' he said. ''Now we aren't going to have either the land or the people, so all I can do is prepare for the worst.''
The Pentagon is also preparing for the worst. Adapting to a reduced Soviet threat abroad and increasing budget deficits at home, the Bush Administration decided to dismantle the Second Armored as part of a series of spending cuts that could eventually reduce forces at 20 bases and close 35 other installations. Those proposals are now in various stages of study and action.
In any case, Fort Hood is not about to disappear.
The Pentagon has said the Second Armored is the only division that can be dismantled without closing an entire base. Fort Hood is the only Army base in the United States that is the home of two divisions - the First Cavalry Division is the other. That division and other assorted units will remain, leaving about 26,000 troops at Fort Hood.
But there is a widespread feeling in Killeen that the military has somehow betrayed an essential bargain.
 
'Brick and Mortar Activity'
In the last decade the Army spent $350 million on three headquarters buildings, motor pools, barracks and other complexes.
''I and lots of other officers encouraged the local people to keep pace with all the brick and mortar activity we had on the base,'' said Gen. Bob Shoemaker, who held several command posts at Fort Hood in 1970's and returned here after retiring. ''We told them Fort Hood was here to stay, and that with an all-volunteer Army it was especially important that they develop the amenities - the schools, roads and hotels and retail shopping.''
In the last 15 years the population of the Killeen area doubled. In the last few years local government agencies have issued bonds worth nearly $40 million to expand water treatment systems and public schools used extensively by the fort.
On June 8, Bell County, which encompasses the Killeen area, along with an ad hoc citizens' group called Keep Hood Alive and Kicking Inc., or Khaki, filed suit in Federal District Court in Waco seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the dismantling of the Second Armored.
 
Army Motion Rejected
Federal District Judge Walter Smith rejected an Army motion to dismiss the suit. He does not expect to issue a ruling before next month.
The suit contends that the Army should have completed a statement on the effect the action would have on the environment and says that if it had done so it would have uncovered some substantial ill effects.
In two days of testimony earlier this month the plaintiffs presented studies they commissioned. They contended among other things that the drop in use of the water and sewer systems would render them dangerously inefficient. They even argued that Army activity enhanced the growth of shrubs that are home to the black capped vireo, an endangered species, and that the birds could lose habitat if the Army abandoned its training grounds.
A main contention is that the ''human environment'' faces harm. There was testimony that 10,000 houses and apartments would be left empty, creating the potential for decay, vandalism and crime. An economic study was produced that forecast ''severely devastating economic damage'' based on the loss of more than 19,600 jobs.
''We are going to be hit by a double whammy,'' Mayor Blair said. ''Just as our tax base is shriveling, we're going to have to provide additional services to all these people in economic distress.''
The Army readily acknowledges that the dismantling of the Second Armored Division will have a severe economic effect on the area. But it contends that the effects on the physical environment can be mitigated and that legal precedents do not allow socio-economic problems to be considered environmental damage.
''What gets me is that everything is changing so fast,'' said Gaylon Christie, chairman of Khaki. ''We are all pro-military here, and I think we'd all go along with whatever the Army decided, even if it cost us, if we just had the feeling that there was a plan, that someone, somewhere knew where we are heading in this crazy world.''

HEADLINE: Western Europe, Its Births Falling, Wonders Who'll Do All the Work

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 21

 BODY:
French families receive generous welfare and tax incentives to have more children, but to no avail. Mothers in France are no longer averaging the 2.1 children needed to insure a natural replacement of the country's population.
In Italy, families are now smaller on average than they are in any other Western European country. So the Government in Rome is trying to woo back descendants of Italians who emigrated to Latin America.
Throughout Western Europe, the trend is clear. As birth rates tumble and life expectancy grows, populations are aging rapidly. 
 
Opposition to Immigration
The number of entrants to the job market will drop in the 1990's, demographers say, and total populations will begin to fall early in the 21st century.
A product of prosperity, this population revolution is posing a complex new challenge. Throughout Western Europe there is strong opposition to new immigration, yet demographers say that foreign workers will be needed to keep up living standards.
For the moment, with millions of Europeans out of work, a labor shortage is not apparent. In several places, immigration is even blamed for unemployment. But immigrants are needed to do the menial or low-paid jobs that out-of-work locals refuse to do.
''A number of countries may be about to enter a long cycle of dependence on migration even though a large proportion of public opinion and of the political class is violently hostile to the idea,'' said Jean-Claude Chesnais, an expert with the National Institute of Demographic Studies in France.
In the 1960's, immigration began changing Europe's social profile. Today, of the 327 million people in the 12-nation European Community, about 12 million are immigrants or descendants of immigrants, with close to 4.5 million in France, 2.5 million in Britain and 1.8 million in West Germany.
Belgium and the Netherlands have large numbers of immigrants from their former colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean region. Over the last five years, Arabs have begun flocking to Italy and Spain.
Even East Germany contracted laborers from Vietnam and Cuba to work in factories.
 
Few Nations Deal With Issue
Beyond building child-care centers and extending maternity leave to encourage mothers to keep working, experts say few governments have dealt with the link between demographic trends and immigration, preferring instead to respond to public pressure to keep out foreigners.
''People have tended to look at immigration as the problem,'' a British sociologist said. ''But it really is the consequence. Look at the United States and Mexico. As long as there are poverty and people in the third world and jobs and capital in the first world, economic forces will work naturally.''
While these forces are also at work in the United States and Japan, the demographic change is strongest in Western Europe. Of the European Community members, only Ireland has a fertility rate that is keeping up with the natural replacement level of 2.1 children.
In Italy and Spain, traditionally countries of large families, it is down to 1.3. And in the European Community as a whole, where there were 41,000 fewer births in 1989 than in 1988, the average is only 1.58.
Demographers calculate the replacement level at 2.1 rather than 2 to take account of people who die before they reach reproductive age.
 
Ranks of Elderly Growing
As life expectancy has surged, the ''graying of the population'' has accelerated. ''There are already 100 million people in the European Community nations over 50 years of age and their number is growing steadily,'' the European Commission said in a recent report. ''By the early years of the next century, Europe will have more older than younger people. The traditional 'age pyramid' will stand on its head.''
One effect will be on social welfare budgets, with governments required to switch the focus of spending from children and education toward senior citizens, pensions and health care.
For example, a recent study in Madrid showed that the city had more people over 65 than under 15.
Still more significant will be the impact on a labor force that is being squeezed by youths who are stretching out their years of education and older workers seeking early retirement.
By the year 2020, according to the European Commission, nonworking dependents will account for two-thirds to three-quarters of the people in the 12 European Community nations.
 
Need for Immigrants Will Grow
For demographers, the statistical message is clear. ''The need for immigrants will grow,'' Mr. Chesnais said. ''You'll have fewer people entering the labor market and more leaving. You'll have an aging labor force that is tired and less efficient but also wants higher salaries. What does a businessman do? He turns to immigrants who earn less and work harder.''
Mass immigration to Western Europe began in the 1960's, with concentrations of Algerians in France, Indians and Pakistanis in Britain and Turks and Yugoslavs in West Germany. By the mid-1970's, political pressure brought restrictions. But the flow continued as relatives joined immigrants and as illegal immigration rose.
Today, with tens of thousands of third-world citizens entering the region each year, either as illegals or as refugees, hostility towards immigrants is growing in several countries, notably France and West Germany.
As it prepares to eliminate its internal borders in 1993, the European Community is also planning a unified policy to keep out new immigrants.
 
Move on to Better Jobs
Foreign workers now pick crops on farms, wash up in restaurants, work on assembly lines, keep city streets clean and run small shops in many countries. Experts say that new immigrants will be needed because once immigrants have settled down they tend to look for better jobs.
From an economic point of view, the need for a constantly replenished work force - a labor reserve, as economists put it - is still greater. And as European populations move deeper into the cycle of aging, stagnating and falling, experts say that the European Community's labor deficit will grow.
During the 1990's, demographers said, some of the gap will be bridged by more women entering the job market and by falling levels of unemployment. But noting that a need for immigration will continue to coexist with unemployment, they said the community would have to look elsewhere for cheap labor.
 
East Germans Take Over Jobs
In the short term, Germany will be an exception. A million East Germans arrived in West Germany in the last year and many more East German are expected to lose their jobs after economic unification.
Some third-world migrants in West Germany, notably Turks, are already being put out of work. Yet a united Germany will still have one of Europe's lowest fertility rates - an average of 1.5 children.
Some countries of Eastern Europe, on the other hand, may become suppliers of labor to the European Community if their economic reforms bring high unemployment. In the past, immigrants from countries like Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia have been more easily assimilated than those from most third-world countries.
North Africa is the region where European political concerns appear likely to clash with economic needs. The birth rate in North Africa is more than three times higher than in the European Community. This population growth and an acute economic crisis are already combining to create enormous pressure on young North Africans to emigrate.
 
More Muslims Are Expected
Calculating the ''pull'' of European labor needs and the ''push'' of third-world poverty, one demographer has estimated that new immigrants and their children could number between 25 million and 65 million by the year 2025, with the great majority of them Muslims from Mediterranean nations.
When many Europeans express fear of immigration, they are usually refering to North Africans. Muslims are perceived as having more difficulty than other foreigners in integrating into Christian societies. For example, France's largest immigrant population is Portuguese, yet Arabs are the main focus of French hostility toward foreign immigrants.
''I don't think Europe is going to be hit by a tidal wave of immigration,'' said a demographer who works for the European Community.
''I think it will be regulated by demand, although demand will grow at the end of the century. But Europe's big challenge is not how to keep out immigrants but how to integrate them.''

HEADLINE: Stories of 2 Ex-Wives Enliven Michigan Race

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 18

 BODY:
Here's the top of the political news from Michigan: Gov. James J. Blanchard, a two-term Democrat, has begun his campaign for re-election, facing a well-financed challenge from State Senator John Engler, a Republican.
But politics aside, the Michigan governor's race is noteworthy for another reason: The former wives of both candidates have written books that document, in part, the breakups of their marriages.
On July 29, excerpts from Paula Blanchard's book, '''Til Politics Do Us Part,'' are scheduled to begin running in The Detroit News after the newspaper paid $20,000 for the publication rights. Ms. Blanchard, who was divorced in 1987, says the book is a description of the highs and lows of her 21-year marriage.
She said she did not believe that anything in the book would be politically damaging to her former husband, adding that she remained proud of him and did not want to hurt him. Even so, she said, the Governor asked her to postpone publication until after the November election but she refused. 
 
Life of a Political Spouse
''It's basically a story about the high price of being a political spouse,'' said Ms. Blanchard, an associate vice president of a Detroit public relations firm.
Mr. Engler's former wife, Colleen, says her manuscript, ''A Matter of Trust,'' will not be submitted to publishers until after the election.
Ms. Engler, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in 1986 who then ran for lieutenant governor the same year, filed for divorce the day after she lost the election.
''My book is a lot different than Paula's,'' said Ms. Engler, who now works for the Commerce Department in Washington. ''Although I discuss somewhat what happened to my marriage to John, it is really incidental to the story of the campaign in 1986 and my life as a woman running for public office.''
Campaign aides for the Governor -and even Republican Party officials -play down the potential political consequences of Ms. Blanchard's book, but they concede that coming in the middle of a political campaign, it has kept the gossip mills churning in an otherwise sleepy summer. 'A Non-Event'? According to the Detroit Free Press, which recently printed a long interview with Ms. Blanchard, the book will address her reaction to rumors that her husband was having an affair with a staff member, Janet Fox, to whom the Governor is now married. In the same interview, Ms. Blanchard said any suspicions that she or others had about her husband's fidelity were not a direct cause of their divorce, and she said she ''chose to believe'' that he had been faithful.
For his part, Governor Blanchard has turned away inquiries about his former wife's book, which is being published by the A & M Publishing Company of suburban Detroit.
Mr. Blanchard's campaign manager, Gary Bachula, said he expected the book ''to be a non-event,'' in terms of its political effect. ''But it will be a major event in Paula's life,'' he said, ''and we wish her well.''
Rusty Hills, a spokesman for the Michigan Republican State Committee, said: ''From what I know, I don't think there is anything in the book that will damage the Governor politically. But coming during the middle of the campaign, I suspect it will sell her some books. I know a lot of Republicans who will probably buy one.''
David W. Rohde, a political science professor at Michigan State University, said he regarded talk of the book as little more than a summer diversion. ''We're a long way from the time when people react negatively to a candidate because of a divorce,'' he said. ''Even to learn later, after the marriage broke up, that one or other of the parties was involved with someone else, I think it's a ho-hum kind of thing.''
 
Contest for Senate Seat
Governor Blanchard, who enters this season's campaign as the front-runner, has no opposition in the statewide primary on Aug. 7. Mr. Engler, who has been the Senate majority leader since 1984, is being challenged on the Republican ballot by John Lauve, a perennial candidate who is expected to win few votes.
In another Michigan race, voters will have to decide between two Republicans competing to challenge Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat who is seeking a third term.
The two are Representative Bill Schuette, who has represented the 10th Congressional District in central Michigan since 1984, and W. Clark Durant 3d, a lawyer who was chairman of the Legal Services Corporation in the Reagan Administration. Mr. Schuette has been endorsed by the state party leadership and is leading in polls.
In the governor's race, Democrats are counting on the staying power that incumbents have traditionally enjoyed in Michigan. Two of Mr. Blanchard's predecessors, William G. Milliken, a Republican, and G. Mennen Williams, the Democrat everyone called Soapy, held the office for 14 years and 12 years, respectively, before deciding not to run again.
 
A Boost From Chrysler Role
Governor Blanchard is a former Congressman from suburban Detroit who acquired a broadened political profile in Michigan as the House floor manager for the legislation under which the financially troubled Chrysler Corporation received Federal loan guarantees of $1.5 billion.
Over his first two terms as Governor, he has received high marks for his efforts to make the state's manufacturing economy more competitive. In his last election, in 1986, he rolled up 68 percent of the vote against his Republican challenger, William Lucas, the former sheriff of Wayne County.
But Mr. Engler, a state lawmaker for 20 years, may be the most formidable opponent yet for Mr. Blanchard. Although Mr. Engler's campaign has sputtered in the early going, he has the solid backing of the state Republican leadership, and his aides say he has raised $3 million, which includes the maximum amount of state matching funds allowed by law.

HEADLINE: Soldier and General Alike To Feel Bite of Budget Ax

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
Driven by sharp budget cuts and a decrease in global tensions, the Pentagon is drastically shrinking its all-volunteer force, and the effort is causing anxiety at all levels of the military.
No one is spared, from admirals and generals to the soldiers and sailors of the future. The military is cutting recruiting quotas, tightening re-enlistment requirements, slashing commissions for new officers and forcing retirement on thousands of senior officers.
Leaders in Congress and the Defense Department say the 2.1 million troops on active duty could be cut by 100,000 a year through 1995, and perhaps through the end of the decade. In the 1991 fiscal year alone, lawmakers have proposed cutting troops by 100,000 or as many as 140,000, nearly four times what Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed. 
''The kind of changes that would be required if I have to do that would include laying a lot of people off,'' Mr. Cheney told a Senate panel last month. ''I am going to have to throw people out on the street. I am going to have to freeze promotions. I am going to end up doing great violence to our most important military asset, our men and women in service.''
 
'Working Backwards'
With a vastly diminished Soviet threat, even the military's most vocal backers concede that troop strength has to drop, particularly in Europe, where the United States has more than 300,000 soldiers.
But Congress and the Pentagon are squaring off over the extent of the cuts, particularly for the next fiscal year, which begins in October. The ballooning Federal deficit has emerged as a powerful force in driving down military spending, currently more than $300 billion a year, half of that for personnel.
Troop levels are likely to be set, at least in the short run, before Defense Department officials decide what size the future military structure should be - the Army divisions, Navy ships, Air Force planes and their home ports or bases that the personnel will support.
''The process seems to be working backwards,'' said Vice Adm. Mike Boorda, the chief of naval personnel.
 
The Cost of Savings
Pentagon planners fear that a Congressional craving for immediate budget reductions may force deep cuts that yield annual savings of $1 billion but hurt future recruiting, badly skew the balance of officers against enlisted personnel and ultimately jeopardize battlefield readiness.
Military experts in Congress, like Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, dispute the military's warnings and insist that their plans offer prudent reductions without painful layoffs. The committee has proposed cutting 100,000 troops next year.
The Senate panel's proposal would require the services, before laying anyone off, to consider cuts in recruitment, reductions in re-enlistments and increases in early releases from service commitments, in that order.
The Defense Department has scaled back sharply in the past; Army troop strength fell by 200,000 to 300,000 soldiers a year shortly after the Vietnam War. But wartime forces were made up largely of draftees eager to leave the service. Since the all-voluntary force was established in 1973, most people have joined with the intent of making the military a career.
 
Effect on the Army
Labor analysts say there is ample room in the national economy to absorb displaced servicemen and servicewomen, many of whom have skills that civilian employers seek. But fewer opportunities to join the services spell trouble for many minority members, economists said. Blacks, in particular, have customarily used the military, and especially the Army, as a ladder of upward mobility.
''The cuts will be a serious problem for black males coming out of high school,'' said Barry M. Blechman, president of Defense Forecasts Inc., a consulting organization in Washington.
The Army, the largest of the services, is bracing for the deepest cuts, largely because one of its major abilities, fighting a conventional war in Europe, has been made all but unnecessary by the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's promise to withdraw its troops there.
Under a House Armed Services subcommittee plan, the Army would shrink by nearly 82,000 troops next year, twice as many as Mr. Nunn's committee proposed. Under the Bush Administration's plan, the Army would drop by 16,669 troops, virtually all through attrition.
''If the cut is beyond 35,000 next year, I will have to decimate the enlisted forces,'' said Brig. Gen. Theodore G. Stroup Jr., the Army's director of military personnel.
 
Cuts in Officers
General Stroup said a reduction of 80,000 would result in enormous layoffs among enlisted personnel, junior officers and retirement-age officers. Federal law protects most mid-career officers from dismissal, a regulation that Mr. Cheney is seeking to relax through new legislation.
This year the Army, using special review panels, forced out 646 lieutenants and 300 colonels eligible for retirement. The Navy and Air Force face less severe cuts that service officials say they can handle through forced retirements and less recruiting. The Pentagon plans to eliminate 78 general and admiral positions within four years, 7 percent of the 1,073 top-ranking officer jobs. The services this year reduced recruiting quotas by 60,000, or 23 percent, and are projecting at least the same proportional reductions for next year. Re-enlistment bonuses have been pared or eliminated.
 
Layoffs or a Top-Heavy Force
As the services study further cuts, personnel bosses face an agonizing choice: sharply reduce recruiting and new officer commissions, creating a top-heavy force, or make across-the-board cuts, including layoffs of mid-career officers and enlisted personnel.
To cushion the blow for casualties of peace, Mr. Cheney and several lawmakers have proposed separation pay for enlisted personnel, improved medical benefits, extended military housing and commissary privileges, and job counseling, among other things.
Despite assurances from nervous Pentagon officials that the Government will not shortchange officers and enlisted personnel who remain in the trimmed-down military, there are troubling signs that some young people aren't listening.
Air Force first-term re-enlistments have dropped to 46 percent from 59 percent a year ago, in part because of an offer this year to allow officers and enlisted personnel to leave before their commitments were up. The Air Force expected 6,000 to apply. Instead 17,000 people volunteered, and embarrassed officials had to turn away 3,000 of them.
 
Disillusionment
Nearly 20 percent of the 1986 graduating class at the United States Military Academy, the elite of the Army's newly commissioned officers, opted to resign this year.
''You're seeing the beginning of a wave of disillusioned, uncertain young people who are not going to find the Army attractive,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert B. Rosenkranz, who is responsible for matching the Army's force needs with the proper personnel levels.
Meanwhile, with no agreement imminent from the White House and Congressional budget negotiators, and final Congressional approval of Pentagon spending in the fiscal year 1991 months away, military planners must begin cutting.
''Give the services a goal, and they can plan how to achieve it,'' concluded a recent Congressional Budget Office report on personnel cuts. ''Leave them with uncertainty, and they must continually either make second-best choices or risk taking irreversible actions that could have severe repercussions in later years.''

HEADLINE: MAGNET TRAINS' USE LIMITED, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
High-speed passenger trains that ride on magnetic cushions are economically feasible in the next 10 or 20 years, but only on a relatively small scale, according to a new report by the Federal Railroad Administration.
The magnetic levitation trains, which would travel about 300 miles an hour while suspended above a guideway by powerful magnetic fields, are under development in several nations and have been proposed as an alternative to air travel between some cities in the United States.
But the railroad agency said in the study that costs might be too high to permit nationwide networks of the train lines. 
The agency's economic analysis found that the train lines could generate enough revenue from fares to cover construction and operating costs on only a relatively few routes, totaling 500 to 2,600 miles. Although the agency conceded that its estimates ''need refinement,'' it said the best estimate of the approximate total of magnetic levitation lines that could be built and operated without public subsidies was about 850 miles.
 
Several Routes Proposed
Several of the train routes have been proposed by state and local governments, including one from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and another to connect Miami, Orlando and Tampa, Fla. The study, which was released on Monday, did not judge the merits of individual proposals, but they were used as the basis for the agency's analysis.
The ''maglev'' technology is expensive and risky, leading many proponents to call for an increased Federal role in development. The study said, ''No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the appropriate U.S. role in future maglev development until further detailed analysis can be conducted.''
The cost of building magnetic levitation routes that totaled 500 to 2,600 miles would be $15.2 billion to $54.7 billion, plus several billion dollars more for the vehicles, the study said.
Although the railroad agency's head, Gilbert Carmichael, has spoken enthusiastically about the prospects for magnetic levitation trains in the United States, he has said private companies should bear the main burden of developing them, with the Government providing some money for research.
His agency's report to Congress casts some doubt on whether these lines would prove profitable enough to attract private investment on a large scale.
 
Role for Trains in Future
The study assumed that tax-free bonds issued by state or local governments could be used to finance construction by private companies that would own and operate the trains; that the cost of rights of way would be minimal; that the demand for transportation would continue to grow, and that the systems could attract more than one-fourth of all travelers.
''These findings suggest that there is a role for maglev in the future U.S. transportation system,'' the study said. ''However, the market for maglev facilities and equipment may not be large enough and certain enough to induce U.S. industry to make a significant commitment of its own resources to a maglev technology development program at this time.''
Robert J. Casey, executive director of the High Speed Rail Association, an industry group, said he viewed the agency's report as ''a fairly conservative estimate'' of the trains' prospects.
''A lot of people are being cautious at this moment in history,'' he said. ''My personal belief is that there will be many thousands of miles of maglev and other high-speed trains in the next 20 years in North America.''

HEADLINE: A.B. Duke to Leave Post as Chancellor Of L.I.U. Campus

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Angier Biddle Duke announced his retirement yesterday as chancellor of Long Island University's Southampton campus, ending a long career in international diplomacy and academia.
Appointed chancellor in 1986, Mr. Duke helped transform the struggling college in a summer resort into a cultural and intellectual center by organizing annual forums that drew notable speakers. But he is best known for his years as Ambassador to El Salvador in the 1950's, followed by ambassadorships to Spain, Denmark and Morocco.
He was also Chief of Protocol under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
Mr. Duke will retire Dec. 31, a month after his 75th birthday. ''I'd much rather leave when the flags are flying than to be pushed,'' he said yesterday.
He will remain a university trustee.
 
Tapped Social Connections
The great-grandson of Washington Duke, the founder of the American Tobacco Company, Mr. Duke, who dropped out of Yale University, unabashedly tapped his social and political connections.
After being named a trustee of the university in 1981, Mr. Duke formed the World Affairs Council, using the Southampton campus as its home base for panels and forums on global issues. Later, as chancellor, he created annual forums on the economy.
Yesterday, Mr. Duke presided over the ''Global Forum on Economic Development and the Environment,'' whose panelists included Dr. Noel Brown, director of the United Nations Environment Program, and United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.
During Mr. Duke's tenure, the campus's enrollment, which had been declining, began to edge upward. From 1981 to 1984, enrollment fell to 1,050 from 1,400. It is now 1,200.
The university has not chosen Mr. Duke's successor.

Summer's Hot Topics: East Bloc and the Earth

 BODY:
Eastern Europe, particularly the Soviet Union, is this year's summer vacation destination of choice for American students, who are flocking to glimpse the rise of democracy or exchange cultural values in what were recently less-friendly lands. For those sticking closer to home, environmental issues are an increasing concern, while political internships in Washington and elsewhere and archeological digs have maintained their traditional prestige.
An informal survey of leading colleges and universities indicates that the pursuit of solid credentials to add to resumes is keener than ever, but that the political and social developments of the last year have added spice to the chase.
In an venture that reflects a number of these currents, an 18-member theater company from the University of Illinois at Chicago will travel to Moscow and Kiev to perform ''The Birds - a Recycled Play,'' an updated version of Aristophanes's play emphasizing the theme of humanity's destruction of the earth's natural resources. The troupe will then take ''The Birds'' on the road to the Save Lake Michigan, Save Lake Baikal Environmental/Ecological and Theater Festival in Ulan-Ude, Siberia. 
Austin Goolsbee, a junior economics major from Yale, went to Poland ''to be part of history in the making.'' He is part of a macroeconomic task force headed by Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor who has been advising the Solidarity Government as it reshapes the Polish economy.
''It's a great opportunity to be here as the country moves toward a free-market economy,'' said Mr. Goolsbee in a telephone interview from Poland.
 
'A Universal Language'
Kenzie Cameron, a junior at Northwestern University, is one of about 60 students from colleges nationwide who are participating in an exchange organized by the American Council of Teachers of Russian, a Washington-based nonprofit organization. Ms. Cameron, who is majoring in Russian and communications studies, is studying Russian at the Institute of Steel Alloys in Moscow and going on field trips, including one to Lithuania earlier this month.
Fifty students from various American colleges are pursuing cultural enrichment against the backdrop of history in the making as members of the American Soviet Youth Orchestra. With 50 counterparts from the Soviet Union, they will appear for two weeks at the Moscow Conservatory and then play in four other European countries, including East Germany. The Youth Orchestra, which is jointly sponsored by the Moscow Conservatory and Oberlin College, will perform in the United States next month.
''I cannot express how excited I am to work with a group of individuals who share a common interest that speaks a universal language,'' said Nathan Pawelek, an English and horn performance major at Oberlin.
Fifteen American students, mostly from Rutgers University and sponsored by Worldworks Foundation in Bridgewater, N.J., have also headed east this summer, to study the problems of hunger. The students will meet with a delegation from Moscow State University and visit Soviet farms, agricultural stations and research centers.
 
'What We Both Can Do About It'
''We need to understand why there is hunger in our country, why there is hunger in their country and what we both can do about it,'' said Krishna Patel, the 1990 class president of Douglass College at Rutgers.
Another Northwestern student, Gregory Schoof, spent his Fourth of July watching political fireworks as he observed Canada's constitutional crisis. As one of 13 Northwestern students studying Canadian politics and French, he was in Ottawa during the tense negotiations that preceded the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord, the compromise meant to accommodate within the constitution Quebec's aspirations for autonomy.
''We taped off the television history as it was happening,'' he said from Laval University in Quebec City.
Nhat-Dien Nguyen, a senior engineering major at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, and Hien Lam, a senior biology major from the University of California at Santa Barbara, are working as volunteers in detention camps for Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong. Both Mr. Nguyen and Ms. Lam fled Vietnam as youths and spent time in detention camps themselves.
''It's not going to be easy,'' Ms. Lam said before leaving. ''But I know in my heart that we can help free the boat people.''
Benjamin Tang, a recent graduate of the University of Texas who is fluent in Chinese and who has lived in Taiwan, traveled to Beijing to observe the aftermath of last summer's student massacre.
''It was remarkably serene,'' he said. ''It seemed like people remembered how bad things were last year, and knew there would be terrible repercussions if it happeneed again.''
 
France and Ibadan
Susan Gray, a senior Russian and history major, journeyed to northern France to study the roles of 13th-century medieval noblewomen. She is hoping to refute what she calls a common misconception that the political and economic power of women declined after the 12th century.
College students traveling overseas are encountering at least one type of cultural shock. Cigarettes, which are becoming increasingly declasse on American college campuses, are coveted in the Soviet Union, for example, and savvy Americans are using them to their advantage. David Schwimmer, a senior English major at Yale, recently accompanied an American business executive to the Soviet Union as a consultant and translator. He knew exactly what to pack. ''Marlboros go a lot farther than rubles,'' said Mr. Schwimmer, who always brings several cartons.
 
Competition in Washington
A considerable number of aspiring politicians remained in the United States this summer, heading for the nation's capital. But they had to overcome tough competition for coveted internships. Only five of the 170 student applicants to the Brookings Institution were selected, a spokeswoman for its Washington office said. Jennifer Nelson, a Carleton College senior, said she submitted her resume more than a year and a half before landing her present job in the office of Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado.
Shepley Orr, a junior psychology major at Vassar College, went to New York to work for the city's Human Rights Commission. He is involved with local communities and public schools as they promote the hiring of more minority teachers.
Working in the Department of Human Services for Davenport, Iowa, gives Katherine Holland, a University of Iowa senior, an opportunity to complete the necessary requirements for her social work degree. Ms. Holland is taking part in a substance-abuse program and helping redesign child-welfare programs.
Sarah Davis, a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is viewing the gritty side of law enforcement this summer. Her job for the County Council in San Mateo Couny, Calif., has taken her to the homes of a prostitute, a petty and a heroin addict and on a helicopter chase of a drug dealer. Her most vivid memory is of an autopsy. ''I was like a mechanic looking into the hood of a car,'' she said.
 
History Begins at Home
Eleven students at the University of Kansas and Kansas State University have discovered that they do not have to move far from their campus to study history. For six hours of college credit, these summer students at the Kansas Archeological Field School are sifting through dirt in Clearview, Kan., to find remnants of lodges built by the Pomonas Indians between 900 and 1400 A.D.
Despite a rotating kitchen duty, a 10 P.M. curfew and the Kansas heat, several of them report that the experience has encouraged them to consider careers in archeology.
Two University of Iowa seniors, Carmen Jans and William Raatz, are also working in the fields. The two geology majors are with the Utah Field Company in Park City, Utah, where they are mapping mountains to uncover their geological structures.
Joyce Whitney, an Ohio State senior, and Ellis Godard, a University of Virginia sophomore, are also engaged in environmental work - rural and urban, respectively. Ms. Whitney, an environmental-education major, is working in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. She flew across the national forest in a helicopter in June, spotting and recording the location of 30 bald eagle nests. The flight was made before egg-hatching time - if the search had been postponed, Ms. Whitney said, ''the young eagles would probably have been frightened and fallen to their deaths.''
 
Recycling and More
Mr. Godard is arranging the locations of recycling bins in the Charlottesville, Va., area, but there is more than recycling on his mind. He has joined the fight to legalize marijuana by writing a book on the subject, which he is seeking to have published, and negotiating with the Charlottesville police department for a 'smoke in' scheduled for October on the university campus.
David Egelman, a sophomore majoring in space physics at Rice University, is not averse to summer high jinks. Mr. Egelman recently gave to his agent an episode to submit to the Fox Network for its show, ''Married With Children.'' The resident of Albuquerque, N.M., has also completed a script for an episode of NBC's ''Cheers.'' Between scripts he is revising a book of humor on the college-admissions process.
Art of a different kind is being pursued by Miranda Junowicz, a Russian major at the University of California at Berkeley, who boasts that this summer she has seen eight Grateful Dead concerts across the nation. The 19-year-old is planning to attend another in Chicago later this month.
 
Dirty Dishes
Not all summer activity was designed to change or discover the world. For many students, the main goal has been income to enable them to return to school in the fall. But every job can have its surprises.
Michael Warren, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University, may have got more than he bargained for when he accepted the job as summer manager for his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. An architecture major from Pittsburgh, Mr. Warren spends his days cleaning up after the nearly 30 occupants of the three-story fraternity house. He has faced stacks of dirty dishes, a broken garbage disposal and frequent visits from the city's health inspector.
Some, like Martin Grunder, a senior at the University of Dayton, are humble about their summer plans.
''I don't really think what I do is a big deal,'' said Mr. Grunder, a management major whose sales from his business enterprises are currently above $700,000. The Bellbrook, Ohio, resident owns a truck wash, a landscaping business and is a partner in a company that provides maintenance to commercial properties.
Mr. Grunder covers all college expenses and says he still has ''plenty of money to have fun with.''

Home Builders' Lament: Fewer New Houses, Fewer New Buyers
 
Everyone's favorite leveraged investment is going sour. Housing starts have fallen five months in a row, the Commerce Department reported last week - down 15.7 percent in a year to an annual rate of 1.18 million in June. Home builders blame their old friends, the savings institutions, who are now unwilling or unable to back them. But they might as well blame population tides, too, because young buyers are scarce. Revisionist statisticians are rewriting the economic history of the 1980's, after suddenly discovering that real, inflation-adjusted housing prices stagnated everywhere but the Northeast and West Coast, where they rose but are now falling. Economists are consoling builders and sellers with the news that they are part of a much broader trend. ''The 1980's was the era of debt and credit-creation,'' said David G. Shulman, director of real estate research at Salomon Brothers. ''In the 1990's, we're unwinding, and housing is the most credit-intensive sector of the economy.'' 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Deciphering Greenspan
 
The credit markets can expect no great help any time soon from Alan Greenspan. The Federal Reserve Board chairman said on Wednesday that economic conditions called for no further lowering of interest rates. The Fed's easing the week before will not be repeated unless needed again to counter the reluctance of banks to make business loans, he said. The bond market, which had jumped the week before, slid after his Wednesday statement. Some listeners thought he was more worried about economic weakness than he let on. His remarks, to the Senate Banking Committee, scarcely touched on inflation, usually a favorite topic. ''Hardly a mention,'' said Kevin Logan, chief economist at Swiss Bank in New York. ''The tone that came out is that the Fed is a little bit closer to easing monetary policy than tightening.''
 
Consumer Prices Rise
 
The same day that Mr. Greenspan testified, consumer prices for June were reported to have risen five-tenths of 1 percent. No cause for panic, but worse than economists had expected. Mr. Greenspan himself called the figure an aberration. Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank, pointed out that inflation reached a 5.9 percent annual rate for the first half of the year - higher than before, he said, but not likely to persist.
 
Thanks, but No Thanks
 
Pity the Pennsylvania executives who welcomed the toughest anti-takeover law in the nation three months ago. Now, big investors, pension funds especially, are threatening to dump their shares unless the companies reject the protection. Westinghouse Electric, H.J. Heinz and the Sun Company have decided that they don't really need all of the law's protections - though Armstrong World, PPG Industries and Alcoa say they will accept the shield. Companies have until Thursday to decide.
 
The Long-Distance Deficit
 
A 10-minute call from the United States to Spain costs $6.20 to $11.75, but in the other direction, $24.67 to $36.29. The Federal Communications Commission wants to force down foreign rates by as much as 50 percent in three years. Foreign telephone monopolies, which use international rates to subsidize domestic service, are certain to object. But the F.C.C. is likely to persist, because the rate structure adds $2.4 billion to the annual United States trade deficit. Foreign Oil Gushes in Exports rose, but imports rose more quickly in May. The trade deficit widened by 5.8 percent from April to $7.73 billion. More auto parts and consumer goods went out, as surging exports helped keep the nation out of a recession. But more cars and oil came in. Because of shrinking domestic production, oil imports rose to a record 49.9 percent of supplies in the first half of the year.
 
In Brief
 
Six Federal judges from around the nation are to gather in an unusual meeting to resolve tens of thousands of asbestos cases jamming their dockets.
 
*
 
Chrysler suggested to the United Automobile Workers on Friday that its financial difficulties argue for a contract more favorable than those to be negotiated with Ford or General Motors. Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, rejected the idea.
 
COMPANIES
 
The Steinbrenner Philosophy
 
Attila the Hun's business insights have appeared in hard-cover. Donald J. Trump's next book will reveal how he has survived, sort of, at the top. So why not repackage the transcripts of a hearing before the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, as ''The Business Secrets of George Steinbrenner''? Among his lessons: First, don't be afraid to fend off hostile overtures with greenmail. ''He scared me,' the Yankees' owner said, to explain why he paid Howard Spira, a gambler, $40,000. ''I felt that if this guy had this money, he would go away.'' Then, when your deals end up in court, blame your lawyers. Regarding his illegal campaign contributions to Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Steinbrenner said, ''My two lawyers, one of whom was later disbarred, told me that it was O.K.'' And what's an executive to say if all his machinations fail? Simple, Mr. Steinbrenner wrote after the hearing: ''I do not believe that it is fair to judge me in hindsight.''
 
No Time to Celebrate at I.B.M.
 
At the International Business Machines Corporation, good news passes in the time it takes a mainframe to do single-digit addition. Second-quarter earnings, announced last week, rose 5.2 percent from a year ago, to $1.41 billion, and I.B.M. stock jumped to a 17-month high. But I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, hastened to diminish investors' expectations, saying, ''Much remains to be done this year.'' And next year, some analysts added. I.B.M.'s hardware sales might suffer well into 1991 as buyers await the introduction of the Summit mainframes. Mainframe shipments were down from the first quarter, reversing the seasonal pattern, said Daniel C. Benton, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. He predicts that I.B.M.'s mainframe revenues will come under pressure from other technologies, like personal computer networks ''at a fraction of the cost.''
 
Citicorp's Weak Spots
 
Having the world's strongest consumer banking business can't always compensate for Citicorp's mistakes. Second-quarter earnings at the nation's largest banking company fell 37 percent from a year ago to $248 million. Loan demand among large corporations weakened, and troubled real estate loans rose. But consumer banking profits increased 28 percent from a year ago to $266 million. Arthur P. Soter, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Citicorp is spreading teller machines, credit cards and branch networks abroad. ''They have the biggest consumer finance franchise in the world,'' he said.

Among other banks, the regionals continued to outperform the money centers. Second-quarter earnings fell 12 percent at Chemical and BankAmerica, 64 percent at Chase Manhattan and 69 percent at Manufacturers Hanover. Chase and Citicorp both announced plans to cut costs. But profits at Security Pacific of Los Angeles rose 6 percent; at NCNB of North Carolina, 50 percent, and at Wells Fargo, in San Francisco, 58 percent.

Where the Money Is
 
As East and West Germany prepare to be joined, the Soviet Union will share in the dowry. Last week, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union announced that he had agreed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany to let a united Germany join NATO. As part of the deal, West Germany will pay billions of marks for the maintenance and relocation of Soviet forces in Germany. It is also providing substantial credits and a commitment to honor East German contracts with the Soviet Union. With the United States promising only technical assistance and Japan still fuming in a territorial dispute, the temptation for the Soviets to embrace Germany is greater. As Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West Relations at the Council on Foreign Relations, put it, ''They went where the money is.''
 
In Brief
 
Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd. will now answer to its creditors, not to Alan Bond. The Australian brewer, media executive and real estate investor agreed to resign as chairman to gain the cooperation of bondholders in arranging refinancing. The G. Heileman Brewing Company in Wisconsin is owned by Bond Holdings.

For Now, the Dollar Holds Its Own

 BODY:
Well, not much happened. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's semi-annual testimony to Congress on monetary policy was a little anticlimactic after he said the previous week that the Fed would lower interest rates to offset a credit squeeze. If anything, he signaled in his testimony that interest rates would not be moving lower again soon. So the dollar held its ground fairly well, even managing to rise against the yen by the end of the week. The higher-than-expected increase in the Consumer Price Index in June also provided support. But the downward pressure is still on the dollar as the economy struggles and the view persists that interest rates are likely to fall, especially if there is an agreement to reduce the Federal deficit.

HEADLINE: Tax Reform Is a Gremlin in the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William B. Michaels, in ''A Different Savings and Loan Villain'' (July 8), was quite accurate with respect to the Tax Reform Act. However, there are several other ramifications of the 1986 law. It seems lawmakers in Washington are so caught up in politicking that they've failed to see certain obvious effects of tax reform.
The first of the disasters was the 1987 stock market crash. I believe the volatility at that time was caused by too much money looking for a place to be put to work. This money came from the nearly $10 billion of private placement, tax-oriented investments that had to be redirected because of tax reform. Much of it went into mutual funds, and even more into the stock market. Money going into private placements is traditionally long-term capital, which is illiquid and under the old tax law was used to promote investments. Given the liquidity in the stock market, investors are now able to trade that equity making the market a lot more volatile. The savings and loan crisis was the second disaster. The third has been happening quietly. Commercial banks are now seeing severe losses not only on real estate, but in all areas of industry where tax benefits heretofore played a role.
It's time that Congress took a good look at itself in the mirror after all the flag waving about what a great new tax law this was to be. It was no simpler; it will certainly be more expensive as a result of the savings and loan criss, and if the commercial banks go next, the price tag will be incalculable.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Japan Isn't Playing by Different Rules

BYLINE: By MICHAEL E. PORTER; Michael E. Porter, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, is author of ''The Competitive Advantage of Nations.''

 BODY:
Slowly and almost imperceptibly, over more than a decade, America has been retreating from one of the most fundamental principles that has distinguished our nation from others: our faith in competition. We have been finding excuses to avoid competition and adopting policies to that effect, often, ironically, in the name of competitiveness. The words of the day are collaboration, relaxing antitrust regulations, managing trade, getting tough on dumping and protecting ''intellectual property.''
It is claimed that the globalization of markets has created a new era in which the old rules of competition must be discarded, and in which domestic rivalry is unimportant. Japan, widely thought to be playing by different rules, is seen as invalidating the principles of free trade. ''Japan Inc.'s'' conquest of world markets is said to show that a new balance between competition and cooperation, and a new role for government, is now needed. Or does it?
This line of thinking is seductive to both companies and policy makers, but it is fundamentally flawed. It rests on an incorrect view of what creates competitive advantage in today's international markets, and on a wholly mistaken view of Japan's success. Retreating from competition will not make American companies competitive, or make America competitive. 
 
The Need for a New Paradigm
Our retreat from competition is based on an erroneous, outdated and static view of international competition in which it is believed that low capital and labor costs, a cheap currency, and economies of scale are the keys to competitive success. Thus mergers, alliances, and collaboration to gain scale and avoid wasteful duplication are thought desirable, and government intervention to foster such behavior and to reduce corporate risk is justified. We think we are doing what our successful competitors have done.
However, my recent study of 10 leading trading nations found that competitive advantage in the knowledge- and skill-intensive industries that form the backbone of advanced economies - those of Japan, Germany and the United States - is the result not of static efficiencies but of rapid improvement, innovation and upgrading. Nations and industries prosper because they can achieve high and rising levels of productivity. This occurs when companies continuously upgrade by improving quality, adding new features, penetrating new and more sophisticated market segments and applying new technology and skills to produce their products more efficiently.
Innovation and upgrading result not from a comfortable home environment in which risks have been minimized, but from pressure and challenge - from demanding home customers, from capable home-based suppliers and most of all from local rivalry. In my research I found that the most internationally competitive industries in every nation were those where there were a number of able local rivals that pressured one another to advance. Examples are American software and consumer packaged goods, German cars and chemicals, Italian fabrics and packaging machinery, and Swedish heavy trucks.
Domestic rivals engage in active feuds. They compete not only for market share but for people, for technical excellence, and perhaps most important for ''bragging rights.'' Progress comes not from unitary or collective approaches but from diverse efforts at innovation by such a group of jealous rivals. Local rivals push each other to compete globally - a better way to gain scale than dominating the home market.
The presence of fierce local rivalry also benefits the entire national industry by stimulating the formation of specialized educational and research institutions to serve the industry. For example, every university in the south of Germany has a department of automotive engineering. This attracts and supports entry into supplier and related industries, and is a magnet for talented individuals and for investments in specialized infrastructure. The national environment becomes a self-reinforcing system that promotes rapid progress.
Globalization does not supersede the role of nations and of domestic competition but arguably makes them even more important. National differences in values, institutions and culture are integral to innovation.
Indeed, competitive advantage is often highly localized in regions or cities, in which entire clusters of rivals, their suppliers, related industries and sophisticated customers in close proximity create a rapid rate of progress. Japan, contrary to popular perception, demonstrates more clearly than any nation the incredible power of competition to foster dynamism.
Many Americans think Japanese companies have succeeded because of cooperation, cartels, and government intervention. Japan does have many cartels - such as in agriculture, chemicals, construction, paper and metals - but these are in sectors where Japan is not competitive.
In the world-class Japanese industries there are numerous Japanese rivals that have diverse strategies. These companies slug it out daily in the home market. Market shares fluctuate rapidly, as new products and production improvements are introduced at a stunning rate.
Japan's 9 automobile companies, 34 semiconductor producers and some 300 robotics competitors show how local rivals, each holding only a modest share of the home market, can prosper through rapid upgrading and global sales. The lesson to be learned from Japan is that competition works, not that we should limit it.
 
Benefits of Duplication
Japanese cooperative research projects, far from eliminating ''wasteful'' duplication, stimulate more of it. Projects sponsored by the Ministry of International Trade and Investment, take place through independent entities to which government and companies contribute personnel and modest amounts of money. However, companies invest much more internally on proprietary research on the same technologies, stimulated by the fact that all their competitors are working on them, too.
Significant joint production ventures involving Japanese rivals, moreover, were not found in any of the internationally competitive industries I studied. In semiconductor memories, where an American joint-production effort called U.S. Memories is widely viewed as necessary, there is not only no Japanese joint production but no fewer than 13 Japanese competitors producing megabyte chips, some with more than one plant. And all the frenetic innovative activity in Japan takes place within a framework of patent and copyright protection that is looser than America's.
The role of government intervention in Japan is also misunderstood. The direct and heavy MITI intervention in specific industries that Americans associate with Japanese success did not take place in many of the competitive Japanese industries like copiers, VCR's, facsimile machines and robots. Much of the direct intervention that did take place occurred in the 1960's, when Japan was a much less advanced nation. But even then, MITI failed repeatedly when it attempted to consolidate industries in areas like steel and automobile production and machine tools.
The notion that Japan is somehow playing by different rules from ours is misguided and nothing more than a smoke screen to justify suspending competition. Import protection, reluctance to buy foreign goods and ''copying'' foreign technology were characteristic of America and also Germany when they were developing. Japan is behaving just as we did.
 
Renewing Competition
What is needed today in American industry is not less competition but more. Instead of relaxing antitrust enforcement, we should be tightening it. Mergers and alliances between leading competitors should be prohibited - they are good neither for companies nor for America. Cooperative research and development involving leaders should be sanctioned only when it is through independent entities involving the majority of industry participants and represents a modest proportion of companies' overall research efforts. The Export Trading Company Act should be sharply curtailed to allow only joint sales promotion abroad and information-gathering activity. The proposal to relax antitrust scrutiny of joint production ventures should be quietly and quickly dropped.
Trade policy should focus on opening up competition rather than using comforting though false arguments to restrict it. The vigorous and increasingly effective efforts of Carla Hills, the United States Trade Representative, to reduce trade barriers in Japan and elsewhere should be the principal focus. Limiting domestic competition in response to trade barriers will only make our problems worse. The ''Voluntary Restraint Agreement'' should be banished from our trade repertoire. Dumping should be claimed only when foreign rivals persist in selling below their cost, not just when American companies are feeling the heat of price competition. Americans should not be influenced or persuaded by Europe's failure to stem the flood of mergers and alliances that threaten to eliminate competition in many European industries. The results of curtailing competition will prove disappointing in Europe as well.
At the root of many of the policy initiatives limiting competition is a loss of self-confidence in American industry, which is reflected in Washington. Instead of looking forward to the next generation of products and processes, too many companies are scrambling to block challenges to their current market positions through mergers, alliances and trips to Washington to secure government help.
A momentum of retreat has been created that is hard to arrest. Once government begins to ''help'' by allowing companies to reduce their risk or avoid the painful steps it takes to become truly competitive, almost irresistible demands are created for more help. This retreat must stop before it becomes a rout. This is the lesson of company history and of national economic history. When a nation becomes preoccupied with complaining about other nations' ''unfair'' practices, its days of economic dynamism are numbered.
What is needed instead is re-commitment to one of America's most unique national values, competition. Ironically, it was America that exported competition to Japan and Germany after World War II. The postwar breakup of their cartels and dominant companies played an immeasurable role in their startling economic success. As uncomfortable as competition always is, it remains the only way that American industry will ever truly prosper.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
France's Buying Binge Takes Its Toll

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
STATE-CONTROLLED French companies are breaking the mold. Rather than tending to their home market, they are aggressively buying abroad, both in Europe and the United States. Some, like Renault, are positioning themselves for the economic union of Europe in 1992; others, like Rhone-Poulenc, are pursuing the grander goal of a top ranking in their industry, worldwide.
But the buying spree is taking its toll. Shares of some of the companies, which are partially publically owned, are lagging far behind what is in any case a mediocre performance by the Paris Bourse. 
Some analysts suggest it is risky for investors to buy the stocks because the state-controlled firms show little concern for their public shareholders. ''A lot of these companies are not being run for the shareholders,'' said one analayst in a French firm, speaking only with assurances of anonymity. ''They are being run to secure a strategic position for France. So it is quite dangerous for shareholders to be in companies like this.''
In addition, the British, who have the most open market in Europe, are getting annoyed as more and more of their companies are picked off by France's state-controlled ones.
And the European Commission, whose competition commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is working on proposals to curb unfair competition by state-controlled companies after 1992, might also take notice - especially of companies dramatically underperforming the market.
More than 80 deals have been completed during the French buying spree in the last year and a half, according to data gathered by Translink's European Deal Review and by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. The total value of the deals, where prices were reported, is around $6 billion.
More important, the French, according to Mark Dixon of Translink, have outgunned state-controlled companies in other countries. Last year, purchases by state-controlled companies equaled 28 percent of total French acquisitions - no other country's state companies reached 5 percent.
Among the deals: Rhone-Poulenc, a chemical and pharmaceutical company, bought the Rorer Group, the American drug company, and RTZ Chemicals, the British speciality chemicals firm. Thomson CSF, the defense contractor, bought Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems in Britain. Renault joined in a cross-ownership deal with Sweden's Volvo. And Pechiney International, which bought American National Can in 1988, purchased Celegraf in Spain, a food packaging company.
In the last 12 months, Rhone-Poulenc has underperformed the French market, as measured by the CAC general index, by 25 percent; Thomson CSF, by 57 percent; and Pechiney International, by 36 percent. (Renault does not have a significant amount of stock trading.) Rhone-Poulenc's performance is most directly attributable to it aggressive acquistions, although it was also hurt by the economic freeze in Brazil and the weak dollar, which reduces foreign earnings. ''It's been overly aggressive acquisitions, purely,'' said Michael Diehl, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. ''It's been a little bit of disregard for the shareholders and the market doesn't appreciate it.''
But while the short-term prospects of Rhone-Poulenc and the others might not be that good, some analysts feel that the buying spree has better positioned them for the long run.
Pascal Viornery, managing director of Bertrand Michel Securities Inc. in New York, argues that Pechiney, for example, has successfully made itself over from an aluminum company to a packaging firm and the market has yet to catch on.
On the issue of unfair competition, some analysts agree that aggressive acquisitions have been made easier by having less concern for the stock price and shareholders. But they also argue that these companies are still hampered in raising money by the limit on public stock ownership, which is 25 percent of capital.
But since the European Commission, at the least, is likely to look at the issue, the French state-controlled companies will have the reason to acquire as fast as possible before some new, and possibly restrictive, guidelines are in place.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Balancing Retirement and Growth

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
LAST month, when he was named emeritus university librarian, Phillip Rosenstein was honored at a champagne bash for 250 people at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. But he still doesn't know what he will do later this month, when he actually leaves the Newark-based library, taking a big chunk of his pension money with him. ''I want the money to be safe, and grow, and be available if I need it,'' he said.
Like Mr. Rosenstein, many retirees have three goals - income, growth and low volatility - that contradict one another. And that's complicated by the fact that most new retirees can expect to live 20 years or more. During that time, they need income to cover expenses and protection from inflation. That protection could come from stock holdings, but stocks are riskier than bonds - and risk is anathema to many retirees. 
''It's an intricate web, so you don't maximize each objective but accept some balance among the three,'' said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, in Chicago.
But many retirees - and people planning retirement - make a common mistake. ''The tendency is to be too conservative,'' said Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor, in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Too often, retirees opt for guaranteed income and forget that, over time, total return is more important. And retirees have special needs that must be considered. Most withdraw money from their portfolios regularly so they need low volatility. After all, they don't want to liquidate when prices are low.
And then there are taxes. To decide whether tax-free or taxable investments make more sense, you must figure ''taxable equivalent yield.'' To do that, divide the tax-free yield by the inverse of your tax rate. For example, if a municipal bond fund yields 6 percent and you are in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent yield is 8.3 percent (6 divided by .72). This means you must earn at least 8.3 percent in a taxable investment to get the same after-tax return.
Retirees who live in high-tax states like New York should think about state taxes, too. They may want to look at single-state municipal bond funds that invest in bonds from the state in which they live. That way, income earned is free of Federal and state tax.
One caveat: Loading up too heavily on tax-free investments can backfire if you collect Social Security. Social Security payments generally become taxable when the sum of your adjusted gross income, one-half of Social Security benefits plus tax-exempt income exceed $32,000 for couples ($25,000 for single taxpayers). But you can never be taxed on more than half of the benefits.
With all this in mind, what kind of retirement portfolios do experts recommend?
Mr. Perritt advises putting 50 percent of the portfolio into bond funds. His favorite: the Benham Treasury Note Fund, which invests in intermediate-term Treasury securities. For protection from inflation, he puts 5 percent in gold, and likes the Lexington Gold Fund.
He also puts 25 percent of the portfolio into stocks and recommends equity-income funds, which invest in high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. He especially likes the T. Rowe Price Equity-Income Fund. The remaining 20 percent of the portfolio is set aside in money-market funds.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's MoneyLetter, in Holliston, Mass., also likes intermediate-term bond funds for one-half of retirees' portfolios. He recommends Dreyfus A Bonds Plus, a high-quality corporate bond fund; T. Rowe Price's New Income Fund, which combines corporate bonds and Treasury securities, and the Rushmore U.S. Government Intermediate Fund, which invests in securities of the Federal Government and some agencies. He also advises keeping 25 percent in stock funds. He likes Fidelity Magellan, Vanguard Windsor II and the Janus Fund, part of the Denver-based Janus Group. The other 25 percent he would set aside in money-market funds.
In his model portfolio, Mr. Jacobs of the No-Load Fund Investor keeps 10 percent in money market funds. For the bond portion (35 percent), he likes Fidelity's Spartan Government Fund and its Intermediate Bond Fund. He divides the portfolio's growth portion between two categories of stock funds. For an aggressive stock play (10 percent), he likes the Janus Venture Fund, which invests mainly in small-company stocks. For the international part (15 percent), he likes the Financial Strategic European Fund, sponsored by Financial Programs of Denver.
The rest of the portfolio is devoted to long-term equities. He likes the Financial Industrial Income Fund, Vanguard's Wellesley Income Fund and the Fidelity Convertible Securities Fund.
Which model portfolio is best for you? That depends on which fit you find most comfortable. Some retirees avoid gold or aggressive stocks; others say the risk is small and worth the potential for gain. In all of these cases, the model portfolio constitutes the total investment, and assumes the funds set aside in money markets can cover emergencies.
 
BACK TO CLOSED-END FUNDS?
AS a group, closed-end stock funds did not fare well in the first half of 1990, rising only 2.4 percent against a 4.63 percent rise in the Dow Jones industrial average. Prices for closed-end funds, which trade on listed exchanges like common stock, are set by supply and demand and fund shares trade at a premium or discount to the value of the stocks in their portfolios.
Share prices lagged the broad stock market because funds began the year with average discounts of about 8 percent and that widened to 10 percent during the first half.
With such big discounts, investors will probably jump back in and, as a result, ''I think more money will be made during the second half of the year than the first,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser who specializes in closed-end funds.

Taxes, S. & L.'s, Anxiety: Recipe For a Political Shakeout?

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER months of quiescence in American politics, the two parties are finally stirring, lurching into the 1990's and the uncharted political terrain beyond Reaganism.
For the first time since the 1988 campaign, Republicans are showing a trace of fear, buffeted by the savings and loan scandal and riven by bitter feuding over President Bush's decision to renege on his ''no new taxes'' pledge. There are cracks in the coalition that ruled the 80's, cracks that could be exacerbated by President Bush's choice of a Supreme Court nominee to replace Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Selection of an appointee to the Court is a contentious process in the calmest of times, and Justice Brennan's replacement will be chosen in a political atmosphere already polarized by the issue of abortion, with both sides seeing the next appointment to the court as critical. 
Many Republicans are trying desperately to hold on to the Reagan magic, uncertain of what will replace it. House Republicans voted last week to defy their President and reassert their opposition to new taxes. Peggy Noonan, La Pasionara of the Reagan Revolution, the White House speechwriter who wrote the last great repudiated soundbite of the 1980's, ''read my lips,'' insisted at a recent meeting of the Republican National Committee that the old magic still had power.
She sketched a vision of President Bush storming away from recalcitrant Democrats at the budget summit meeting and taking his case to the people, a vision grand, defiant, Reaganesque. But her words had the eerie echo of an aging Democrat keening for the glory days of the New Deal. Mr. Bush plods on in the budget talks; the economy, the White House says, demands it.
The times are churning, quickening. Surveys show that the voters are increasingly anxious about the economy, increasingly pessimistic about the country's future, increasingly angry and cynical toward government. ''People are not sitting pretty any more,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker. ''The nervousness that everyone said had been just beneath the surface for years is coming straight to the surface, and it changes the way they think about politics.''
 
The chant of ''We're
Number One!,'' the proud signature of American foreign policy in the 1980's, is ill-suited for a multipolar age, when Helmut Kohl and Mikhail S. Gorbachev - but not President Bush - sit down at a Soviet spa and remake the map of Europe. At home, the prosperity of the Reagan years is now a subject of fierce debate and searching re-examination.
Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, has provoked much furor in political circles with his new book, ''The Politics of Rich and Poor,'' in which he asserts that the 1980's produced an extraordinary concentration of wealth at the top of American society. In the book, which was excerpted recently in The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Phillips foresees a reformist backlash, such as the ones that followed the 1920's and the Gilded Age in the late 19th century.
Two issues have intersected to feed the debate: the drive for new taxes and the mounting bill for the savings and loan bailout, which helped propel the President into budget talks with Congressional Democrats. Day after day, the images of high-flying savings and loan operators, with their condominiums, their yachts and their insider deals, are juxtaposed with grim talk of new taxes and deep spending cuts.
''Taxes and the S. & L.'s are providing handles for this whole question of who profited from the 80's and who got gypped,'' Mr. Phillips said in an interview.
Resentments are simmering. In South Dakota, Democratic Senator Tom Daschle said that people refer to the new farm legislation under debate in Congress as ''the S. & L. farm bill.'' They feel their benefits are being cut because of the cost of the thrift industry bailout, he said.
Representative Lynn Martin, an Illinois Republican, complains of ''an incredible transfer of wealth to Texas.'' Voters who are ''trying to make a mortgage payment'' don't care to hear about savings and loan operators ''with eight houses,'' she said.
Democrats, lately in search of a voice and a message, are trying to capitalize on the growing storm. Party leaders including Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic chairman, accuse the Republicans of wanting to make the middle class pay for the excesses of the wealthy.
''George Bush has finally asked for higher taxes at the same time he's still trying to get a capital gains tax cut for the privileged few,'' said Mr. Brown. ''We know who he wants to pick up the tab for the S. & L. predators' ball.''
The Democrats' efforts to put a Republi-can face on the thrift crisis have been helped by the difficulties of the President's son, Neil Bush, who has been accused of conflicts of interest as a director of a Denver thrift that failed. But the Democrats' hands are by no means clean; four of the ''Keating five,'' the Senators under fire for their relationships with the head of a failed savings and loan institution, are Democrats.
Democrats dream of a populist uprising, but they still have no one to lead it. Their own strategists acknowledge that only a charismatic Presidential nominee can redefine the party.
There has been a flurry of Presidential speculation in recent weeks, particularly around Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, but it is still only speculation. After 10 years out of power, the Presidential wing of the party seems atrophied.
Still, for the first time in a long time, the Republican Party is having its own problems. Many Republican strategists say that the party must change for an era when Communism is collapsing, when voters are increasingly concerned about domestic issues like the environment and education, when abortion is exposing the fault line between the baby boom voters and the new right.
Roger Stone, a Republican strategist, said, ''Issues that were extremely successful for us in the 80's aren't on the radar screen anymore.'' But Robert Teeter, the Republican polltaker, insists that the frictions and tensions are simply the growing pains of a governing coalition. ''The Democrats lived with it for 50 years, and they still won elections,'' he said.
But the Roosevelt legacy was about activist government and was easily institutionalized; many conservatives worry how to preserve the Reagan legacy when its philosophy, at its roots, was an opposition movement.
Many Republicans are wary of a President who appears to be torn between Connecticut and Texas, between the old establishment Republicanism and Reagan-era conservatism. Loosed from the moorings of Ronald Reagan, they look for direction from Mr. Bush and find it varies with the issue and the day - accommodating on taxes, staunch on abortion.
''We all expect him to leave his imprint,'' said Representative Vin Weber, a Minnesota Republican. But he added that the ''loyal troops'' have a right to express what they would like that imprint to be.
White House aides, ever fortified by the President's high approval ratings, say Mr. Bush is providing the leadership the country wants, temperate and committed to making government work. But all around there is a quickening, a shifting. This is a pregnant moment in American politics.

A Windfall Nears In Inheritances From The Richest Generation

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
WITH the wealthiest generation of elderly people in the country's history reaching the end of their lives, economists are trying to predict what will happen to their money.
The assumption is that a wave of inheritances will provide their children, the baby boom generation, with a windfall. But the Federal Government is also expected to keep its eyes on the money, and some economists predict a push for higher inheritance taxes to help solve the budget crisis.
''There has been a great run-up of wealth among the elderly,'' said Robert B. Avery, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University. Much of this accumulation was built between the late 1940's and the late 1960's, when real wages and savings rates were higher and housing costs were lower. For the middle class, the most significant factor may be the escalation of real estate prices over the last 20 years. 
''It's a substantial amount of wealth,'' said Frederick A. Elkind, vice president and director of the TrendSights division of the Ogilvy & Mather advertising agency, which forecasts buying and spending habits. ''And there is a potential for a substantial amount of money and assets to be released or transferred to the baby boomers.''
Not everyone believes there will be an inheritance boom. Cheryl Russell, the editor in chief of American Demographics magazine and the author of ''100 Predictions for the Baby Boom Generation,'' acknowledged the unprecedented wealth of today's older people, but she argued that the size of the baby boom generation has grown faster than the size of the parents' estates. ''Most people will inherit only a middling amount of money,'' she said.
Ms. Russell also maintained that a variety of variables, particularly health care costs, may reduce the size of many estates. ''It's counting chickens before they hatch,'' she said.
But many economists say that even when rising medical costs and other factors are taken into account, inherited wealth is expected to become a significant economic force.
According to Cornell's Department of Economics and Housing, the total worth of estates at death is expected to rise from $924.1 billion between 1987 and 1991 to $2.1 trillion between 2007 and 2011. The estimates are in 1990 dollars.
''Inheritances as a proportion of total wealth have been increasing over the last 20 to 25 years and will certainly continue increasing in the future,'' said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University.
 
'The Rich Beget Rich'
In all, the 64 million baby boomers stand to inherit an estimated $6.8 trillion between 1987 and 2011. Of course not everyone will benefit equally. According to the Cornell study, the richest 1 percent of the population will divide one-third of the worth of the estates, each receiving an average inheritance of $3.6 million; the next richest 9 percent will divide another third for an average inheritance of about $396,000; the remaining 90 percent will share the rest. That means an average inheritance of only about $40,000 for this group. ''The rich beget rich,'' Mr. Avery said. Mr. Elkind predicted that much of the wealth may be passed on as property that, depending on market conditions, may be sold or used as second homes. He said that the prospect of inheritances will help many baby boomers maintain highly leveraged, spendthrift lives. But he also predicted that many inheritances will be used to make gifts to charity or to help meet tuition costs for members of the so-called boomlet generation. ''It wouldn't surprise me if we started seeing more people put their kids in private schools, especially with the baby boomers having fewer kids,'' he said.
Predictions of an inheritance boom may also lead to efforts to raise inheritance taxes, close loopholes or lower the tax exemption levels. The Federal estate tax now ranges from 37 to 55 percent of the value of an estate exceeding $600,000, or, in some cases, $1.2 million if the money is left by a couple.
''The dead don't vote,'' said Thomas J. Drew, an estate lawyer in New York City and Westport, Conn. ''And with legislators groping to reduce the deficit, it's a more politically palatable target than income taxes.''
The argument for increased inheritance taxes has won favor among some people who oppose most taxes. The philosopher Robert Nozick, known for his libertarian views, recommends that the Government lay claim to estates after they pass beyond one generation.
''It sticks out as a special kind of unearned benefit that produces unequal opportunities,'' Mr. Nozick said.
 
'Wooing Retirees'
Some conservatives, however, have argued that inheritance taxes are unfair because they represent double taxation or are ''anti-family.'' And, so far, many state governments seem more interested in reducing their inheritance taxes. In the last two years, for example, Idaho repealed its tax, and Wisconsin is phasing out its tax.
''It brings in a relatively low amount, and it makes states non-competitive for attracting retirees,'' said Corina Eckl, a senior policy analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
Furthermore, many people avoid inheritance taxes by giving away some of their money before they die. Others, worried about paying for long-term health care, give away estates so they can qualify for Medicaid.
Looking further into the future, some economists predict that the wealth of today's elderly may have particularly striking effects not on their children but on their grandchildren.
This may be especially true considering that baby boomers are having smaller families than their parents had and are often supporting themselves with two incomes.
''The potential for boomer wealth, in theory, should be even greater than for their parents, because they have been accumulating their own wealth with their parents' wealth,'' Mr. Elkind said. ''It could reach a critical mass and be a tremendous windfall for their children.''
Then again, he added, baby boomers will likely live longer than their parents did. ''Their kids may have to wait a long time to benefit fully,'' he said.

New Ideas Are Changing Nuclear Debate

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A NEW generation of nuclear power plants - smaller, simpler and probably safer - is taking shape on the drawing boards. But rethinking the nuclear reactor is raising difficult issues for manufacturers and critics alike.
The conundrums involve safety. While the manufacturers can speak of marked improvements, they are reluctant to draw comparisons that would cast doubt on the safety of the 110 existing reactors, which have decades of service remaining. 
The critics say the new designs sometimes trade old problems for new ones. Their latest study, which examines three distinct reactor systems, suggests that these designs are not without risks.
For years, the industry has asserted that its reactors are safe and pose only a minuscule chance of accident. Debates over what could be done to lower the risk further, industry officials say, are really debates over how safe is safe enough.
The issue has lost some of its edge lately, since all the plants ordered after 1974 in this country have been canceled and only a few are still under construction. But major reactor manufacturers sense the prospect of new orders, which would rekindle the debate.
The demand for power today is growing, and the fear of global warming gives nuclear generators an edge over those fired by coal, which releases carbon dioxide, a gas which scientists say tends hold heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Environmentalists have yet to embrace this logic, but it has encouraged the manufacturers, with large Federal subsidies, to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in drawing up new designs.
The new plants, like those already in service, would all split atoms to make heat, which is then used to make electricity, but they differ greatly in their approach. Yet all seek to use basic physical principles to increase safety. Incorporation of such principles, specifically the propensity of water to flow downhill and natural convection to limit overheating of small objects, can make a reactor ''inherently safe,'' according to the new design proponents.
One of the more promising designs is a gas-cooled graphite reactor proffered by General Atomics, a company based in San Diego, Calif., and one the Department of Energy would like to test. Heat-resistant graphite would encapsulate uranium fuel, and helium would conduct the heat needed to make electricity. Current reactors use fuel wrapped in metal, which melts at high temperature, and water, which transfers heat but can boil away in an accident. Helium's safety advantage over water lies in its already being a gas; in an accident water will turn to gas, thus losing much of its ability to carry away heat.
 
Risk Is Always Present
''The temperature characteristics of the fuel, and the inherent character of the helium, factors that are there because they are parts of physics, give you the inherent safety you're looking for,'' said Linden S. Blue, the vice chairman of General Atomics. The uranium cannot get hot enough to break out of its graphite shell, he said.
The General Electric Company is so persuaded of the significance of the new designs, not to mention the public-relations value of the phrase, that it has incorporated the term ''inherently safe'' into the name of one of its designs, the Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module, known as Prism.
But a study of three major reactor designs released last week by the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Mass., which is regarded as the most technically competent of the private nuclear safety groups, said that such claims confuse the issue. According to Gregory C. Minor, a former manager in the advanced control and instrumentation department at General Electric and a consulting engineer who oversaw the study, ''You are dealing with a radioactive reaction, with enormous energy, and enormous potential disruptive action if you don't treat it properly.'' A reactor, he said, can no more be inherently safe than a car can be; improvements can be made, but risk is always present.
A few industry engineers privately concede the point. At the American Nuclear Energy Council, a lobbying group in Washington, James McDonald, a spokesman, said of the idea of inherent safety, ''I don't think that message has credibility.''
Another aspect of the newly proposed designs is their apparent lowering of defenses. Mr. Minor's firm, MHB Technical Associates, of San Jose, Calif., faulted some for lacking two secondary defenses: a containment building, the huge, costly concrete and steel structure devised to retain radiation accidentally released, and off-site emergency plans, which were required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after the accident at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979.
''There's nothing to contain,'' Mr. Blue argued, referring to the desirability of containment structures. ''It's about as useless as wearing a fur coat in the middle of summer.'' At Westinghouse, Richard J. Slember, the vice president and general manager of the Energy Systems Business Unit, said, ''It's a question of the need for an evacuation zone. That doesn't mean you wouldn't put that in. But the plant is so safe it may not require one.'' Before any new reactor could be built, the design would have to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The Union of Concerned Scientists study, which analyzed the designs of General Electric, Westinghouse and General Atomics, welcomed some of the innovations. It applauded taking advantage of natural features in accomplishing vital tasks, including removing heat that continues to be produced after the nuclear reaction has ceased, also known as radioactive decay, which can cause a meltdown.
The study found some countervailing disadvantages. In two designs, ''the passive-decay, heat-removal systems which appear to be so beneficial in terms of accident prevention appear also to present a significant potential sabotage vulnerability,'' the study said, because the heat outlets are above ground. In existing reactors, heat is generally dissipated through cooling towers or into rivers and oceans.
Another design change is to build far smaller reactors, so that the amount of heat that must be removed in an accident is small enough to be removed by natural convection or other simple systems. One design calls for nine clustered reactors, run from a single control room with four operators. Yet mistakes have already occurred with operators at two-reactor control rooms, the study said.
Even as the study was being released, the American Nuclear Energy Council responded that the criticism was premature ''because of the rapidly evolving aspects of these designs.'' The Union of Concerned Scientists, it said, was showing ''its bias against nuclear energy and its long-held goal of phasing out nuclear energy plants.''
Mr. Minor, who oversaw the study for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that even with looming questions about safety, new reactors might be ordered later in this decade. But unless the issues are resolved, he said, the second generation will be few in number and short lived.

H.U.D. Scandal's Lesson: It's a Long Road From Revelation to Resolution

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
IN the fall of 1989, when the scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development were one of the biggest stories in America, David Burns, a senior staff member in the department's New York office, asked his superiors in Washington for permission to talk with the press about past wrongdoing at the agency. He got the go-ahead and the story he told of political pressure put on department bureaucrats in New York during the Reagan years made national headlines.
Mr. Burns's views have to a great extent been vindicated by a recent Federal court ruling and a new shift in housing policy by New York City. The officials brought in to run the agency's New York office by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp in the last year seem to be far less political, Mr. Burns says, and more inclined to make decisions on merit. 
But all that said, Mr. Burns has paid a price for whistleblowing, even in an Administration that seems committed to reform. The week after he went public in October 1989 he was excluded from senior staff meetings he had been routinely attending for a decade and, he says, ''I've never gone to another one since.'' Many of his responsibilites have been taken away, he says. ''I have been isolated at H.U.D.'' Mr. Burns's superiors acknowledge that he is no longer invited to some meetings but they say this has nothing to do with his disclosures.
Today Mr. Burns, a Columbia Law School graduate with 28 years in government, who regularly received good job reviews and bonuses, says, ''For speaking out, I am looked at as an unstable odd-ball by the H.U.D. leadership in New York.''
In many respects Mr. Burns's experience is a study in the difficulty of changing any large bureaucracy and the price that can be paid for trying. The H.U.D. scandals have largely disappeared from daily news, edged aside by the savings and loan story, among other things. But Federal investigators continue to probe and try to build cases. Events set in motion in 1989 could take years to play out. While they do, the targets as well as the whistleblowers live in limbo.
As a regional economist, Mr. Burns had the power to reject a proposed housing project if he felt there was already an ''undue concentration'' of subsidized housing nearby. In 1987 he rejected a site on the Lower East Side of Manhattan where an 80-unit senior citizen project known as Casa Victoria was planned. He calculated that nearly two-thirds of the housing in this high-crime area was subsidized. Mr. Burns says he was then pressured by the department's regional administrator, Joseph Monticciolo, until he changed his decision.
Mr. Burns says he was never sure why he had been pressured, but a sequence of events appeared to point to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican. Mr. Monticciolo and the Senator were close allies. Senator D'Amato wrote a letter to Mr. Monticciolo in support of the project. Shortly after the project was approved in 1987 a construction company that was a major contributor to the Senator, and employs the Senator's brother as an attorney, was picked on a no-bid basis. Senator D'Amato and Mr. Monticciolo have repeatedly said they supported the project on its merits alone. The F.B.I. is investigating.
After Mr. Burns went public, a group of neighborhood people who favored using the site for a park sued in Federal court to block construction. In February, in response to the suit, the housing agency reviewed its 1987 decision and over Mr. Burns's protests, approved the site again. Mr. Burns was then put in the spot of testifying against his employer in court.
 
Earlier this month Federal
District Judge William C. Conner issued an injunction blocking the project, relying heavily on Mr. Burns's testimony.
Judge Conner found that to justify the project the housing department had used inaccurate data and then interpreted its own regulations so loosely that those rules were made meaningless. The key issue, Judge Conner wrote, was whether there was already an ''undue concentration'' of subsidized housing and whether the area suffered from related pressures like crime. The problem, he said, is that in the 16 years the regulation has existed, the housing agency has never defined the term ''undue concentration.'' Housing department officials maintained that housing in the Lower East Side neighborhood was 50 percent subsidized. Judge Conner found several omissions in the estimate and wrote that the area was closer to Mr. Burns's estimate of two-thirds.
The housing agency acknowledged that it was a high-crime area, but contended that it was improving. Judge Conner noted that felonies were on the increase in the nearby housing projects and that residents had testified about heavy drug trading. By putting a project for the elderly there, Judge Conner said, the housing agency would be ''providng additional highly vulnerable crime victims.''
A housing department official, David Shenk, maintained that because the regulation is so vague it would not preclude building in an area that already had even 90 percent low-income housing. But Judge Conner wrote, ''This court cannot sanction such a broad exercise of discretion as to eviscerate the very meaning of the term 'undue concentration.' The effect of deferring to H.U.D. in this case would be to give H.U.D. an effectively unlimited license to build assisted housing regardless of the concentration of such housing in the area.''
 
'No Rational Connection'
Judge Conner said he found ''no rational connecton between the facts found and the choice made'' by the agency. Housing department officials say they have not decided whether to appeal the ruling.
Joseph Lynch, who was the acting regional administrator in the fall of 1989, says he was not punishing Mr. Burns for going to the press. He said he was reorganizing the office in the midst of the scandals and excluded several people, not just Mr. Burns, from senior staff meetings at the time. ''We had so many investigations going on I didn't know who was involved and how deep and who I could trust,'' Mr. Lynch said. He said the fact that he took action right after Mr. Burns went public was ''coincidence.''
For Mr. Burns, who still remains a regional economist, Judge Conner's decision brought mixed feelings. ''I'm very happy that my credibility is vindicated,'' he said. ''However, the feeling still persists in the New York office that I was wrong. I am unable to conclude that my speaking out has contributed to improving the department. It has created discomfort, resentment, and a very defensive reaction.'' He said he felt further vindication last week, when, in an unrelated matter, New York City took its own steps to stop overloading poor neighborhoods with social service projects. ''One of the satisfactions I've gotten from speaking out,'' Mr. Burns said, ''is I have the admiration of the staff, other than the very top. People say, 'keep it up, we appreciate what you did.' You see it in their eyes when you pass in the corridors.''

HEADLINE: If We Don't Give Gorbachev Help, Europe Will

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Should the West Bail Out Gorbachev?'' (Op-Ed, July 5), Graham Allison and Judy Shelton present diverging views in the dialogue on helping perestroika. Mr. Allison proposes targeted technical assistance. Ms. Shelton asserts financial assistance will promote diversion of Soviet resources to defense.
While her misgivings are justified in view of the high level of Soviet defense spending, her analysis smacks of the days of the cold war. Under perestroika, the Soviet leadership's priorities have shifted decisively in favor of assigning a larger slice of the national pie to consumption, followed by investment and, finally, defense. According to Central Intelligence Agency estimates, Soviet consumption in 1989 grew by almost 4 percent in real terms, while investment allocation grew by a minuscule .6 percent, and defense outlays declined by 4 percent to 5 percent. Soviet living standards are so low and public pressure to raise supplies of consumer goods is so overwhelming that the Soviet Government has to adopt sustained cuts in defense. 
Even if defense outlays were reduced drastically in a single stroke, supplies of consumer items and machines to produce them in abundant variety and quality are unlikely to materialize quickly in an efficient market environment. As Ms. Shelton points out, the Ryzhkov plan of May, announcing specific price rises, is hardly the way to introduce markets. But the radical reformers are no better. Boris Yeltsin, in a display of dangerous populist rhetoric, promised ''painless'' price reform on election as president of the Russian Republic. The Moscow City Council, inspired by Mayor Gavril Popov, decided to hand over all apartments to current residents. Given the chance, would the reformers carry populist zeal to the limit and hand factories to the workers and farms to the peasants as cost-free doles?
With the inability of Soviet planners and reformers to implement viable market reforms, what should our response be? At the Houston summit, the Group of Seven decided to set up a joint task force to study aid to the Soviet Union. In the Soviet predicament, that resembles the offer of swimming lessons to a drowning man.
In the meantime, the European countries were left free to extend credits to the Soviet Union, whereas the United States offered technical help without cash. President Bush argued that the Soviet Union must first undertake decisive market reforms. This two-track approach, with the European leadership offering a carrot and the United States President wielding a stick, will push perestroika further on the market route. From our perspective, however, it has two shortcomings:
(1) It would give European business a competitive edge over ours. Most Soviet infrastructure retooling will require not only technical help, but also cash and hardware. A French group of manufacturers and consultants ready to renovate the Soviet rail network would be paid for equipment and services to the Soviet agency out of credits guaranteed by the French Government. The European practice in such ventures is largely for government, industry and banks to work in tandem.
By contrast, legislative limitations on official Export-Import Bank supplier credits for financing United States exports to the Soviet Union, and the prohibition of guarantees by the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation on private United States lending, deprive American business of similar financing. President Bush's denial of concessionary credits to aid perestroika endorses continued restrictions. Congress should consider amending the legislation and ratifying the Bush-Gorbachev Trade Treaty signed at the Washington summit. (This step toward full-fledged commercial and trading relations with Moscow would be timely also because Mikhail S. Gorbachev has lifted sanctions against Lithuania.)
(2) There is an equally compelling, though less tactical, consideration. President Gorbachev's steps of reforming the Soviet economy have undoubtedly been measured. On this side of the street also, it has taken us five years to move from initial doubts about his survival as Soviet leader and the subsequent jitters about the irreversibility of his reforms to finally discussing concrete ways of assisting perestroika. With each hurdle crossed by him, our policy makers have raised the stakes. Such a calculated approach may have spurred him to make the correct moves, but it is likely to reduce our role to that of mere bystanders at a unique moment of history.

HEADLINE: If We Don't Give Gorbachev Help, Europe Will;

To the Editor:
President Bush's shift on taxes may be belated, but it is also timely. Now nothing less is needed than reversing the flow of savings into the United States and creating an outflow of capital, especially to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We created such a flow with the Marshall Plan, with great effect. The infusion of desperately needed capital into Western Europe at the price of abolishing inward-looking cartels and abandoning narrow policies in favor of integrated economies and broad market efficiencies transformed Western Europe. The result was unprecedented prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. 
We can cast that net wider. Orderly transformation of Eastern Europe requires outside resources to cushion the pain, which otherwise will be too excruciating. Again, the aid can be conditional on market-oriented reform. The cost will be substantial, but the benefits will be even greater. This time Western Europe can help, but we must play our part. This implies a massive increase in taxes to raise our share of the capital and have the chips to play in the game.
We found the resources with the Marshall Plan and similar economic and military aid around the world when we were much poorer. They are mobilized through taxes. Our fiscal burden is much lower than every other Western developed country. We need to catch up. It will be a tremendous shock to our economic system, just as financing World War II was a tremendous shock, but worth it. Careful management is required - the sort Americans are capable of when they see the need and the opportunity. If we respond properly and in time, all of us around the world will reap the dividend. If we don't, we will all be poorer.

HEADLINE: Let the Elderly Choose to Work or Not

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Older Americans are an increasingly large group. They are healthier than ever before. A 65-year-old can look forward to 10 or even 15 more working years, if he or she wants to work and is allowed to do so. 
As a matter of national policy, what do we want them to do - work or loaf? It has never been up to them.
For years, employers followed an inappropriate policy of mandatory retirement at 65. Congress countered by making age discrimination unlawful. In 1983, Congress nullified its antidiscrimination stance by imposing a tax on the benefits of Social Security recipients older than 65, putting them into a marginal tax bracket that in some cases approached 100 percent. Those between 65 and 70 became the highest taxed group in the country. This tax is to be reduced modestly this year, but remains a powerful incentive not to work. This year, two competing bills are being considered. One would further raise the effective tax level on the elderly, while the second, from Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, would remove the tax on Social Security benefits altogether. According to The Wall Street Journal, the House Ways and Means Committee (under Dan Rostenkowski) refuses even to let the Hastert bill come to the House floor for discussion, despite support of a majority of the House.
Many of the elderly prefer to work and contribute their skills and wisdom to our economy. All should, at the least, have the choice of working or not working.
Representative Hastert's bill to repeal the earnings limit makes sense. It would likely pass the House if only the Ways and Means chairman would release it.

HEADLINE: Behind the Facades, Surprises in Budapest

BYLINE: By Alexandra Shelley; Alexandra Shelley is a journalist who writes frequently about Hungary. She has lived in Budapest while researching a novel based on her grandmother's life.

 BODY:
Behind the iron gates of Budapest, in courtyards buried within unassuming apartment buildings, offices and universities, a traveler can find forgotten treasures of art and architecture, and footprints of the wars and revolutions that have marched across Hungary for the last millennium.
Unlike the ornate facades of the Hungarian capital's late-19th-century buildings, recently renovated and decked out in gaudy yellows and oranges, powder blues and pinks, the interior yards often remain untouched, their bullet-pocked walls a pentimento of epochs.
Here one can find sculptures ranging from neo-classical Greek gods to a socialist-realist bear on a scooter; an old dungeon; silversmiths' workshops and stables; lush gardens, and the basic component of Hungarian urban landscape architecture: car tires planted with flowers.
The sense of discovery in coming across these is keener for their being completely neglected in the midst of everyday life. And searching for them is a good excuse to stray slightly from the beaten tourist path. 
Courtyards tell the story of the evolution of urban Hungary. From the 19th century through World War II, maids and housewives congregated here to use the rug beaters (wooden contraptions that can still be seen) and pass the scuttlebutt.
An interior yard allowed the coexistence within one building of both lower and upper classes - ''Park Avenue and the South Bronx in the same building,'' as one Hungarian professor of urban anthropology, Istvan Teplan, put it. Facing the street were exclusive apartments. But fronting on the interior were small flats whose residents shared one bathroom in the corridor and drew their water from the courtyard well.
In the country's stormy history courtyards have also served as centers of rebellion. After the invention of the vacuum cleaner and the Communist system, grievances (if not rugs) continued to be aired. In fact, Professor Teplan speculates that this architectural device was abandoned during the Communist era precisely to discourage the subversive commerce of ideas.
''The courtyard was an arena of social conflicts,'' he told me. ''The old houses look inside. The new blocks, the housing developments on the outskirts of Budapest, don't look inside - to avoid space where people can gather.''
Yet in the old workers' districts of Budapest the interior yards remain an agora. Here children improvise games with scraps of wood and Ping-Pong balls, and old people lean their elbows on the windows sills and call across to each other. IN one such neighborhood, the industrial district of Jozsefvaros, I pushed open the doorway of what seemed yet another soot-covered building - at 22 Dioszegi Samuel street - to find an oasis of pink flowering hydrangea, roses, tomato plants, acacia trees. A woman asked me what I was looking for. I told her I had heard that the garden here was beautiful. ''Well, yes,'' she said, ''nothing else is'' - and that was the crux of it: the carefully tended garden was a defense against the squalor outside. (Although some of these courtyards are attached to public buildings, others are private and permission to visit them should technically be asked.) It is not surprising in a country that since the Mongol attack in 1241 has almost continuously been assaulted by invading hordes, that such fragile beauty is secreted away in the protected interior of the buildings.
One does not have to venture as far as Jozsefvaros to find it. In neighborhoods within walking distance of the downtown hotels, from the old Jewish ghetto to the elegant Castle district, the courtyards provide a glimpse of daily life both past and present.
I began my round of courtyards on the Pest side of the Danube just in back of the Intercontinental Hotel, armed with three tools: a good map of the city (available in most bookstores); a copy of ''Budapest: A Critical Guide'' (Park/Officina Nova, 1989), a humorous and intimate book by Andras Torok, and enough curiosity to follow the ghostly path of horse-drawn carriages through the carved wooden doors or ornate iron gates.
Reigning over the faded pink alcove and a bank of mail boxes off the courtyard at 3 Apaczai Csere Janos Street is the queen of the ancient underworld, Persephone. An Italian sculptor, Benno Elkan Roma, has depicted her in a dreamy moment - her eyes closed, her head canted, her pink marble lips a lovely contrast to the sleek white of her face and torso. She half-heartedly covers her nakedness with a bouquet of pink, purple and russet roses of quartz and marble. In the courtyard proper, the wooden stable doors and the water trough form a down-to-earth contrast to the neoclassical pretensions of this early-19th-century building.
Walking the few blocks to Kigyo street and 5 Felszabadulas Square, I stopped at the Parizai arcade. The building, built in 1911 by a bank, gives the impression of a Venetian palace. It is characteristic of the turn-of-the-century eclecticism that resulted from the search for a uniquely Hungarian style of architecture, its eastern motifs derived from a theory that the Hungarian people were of oriental origin.
The architect, Henrik Schmahl, took pains to distinguish the internal arcade from the mundane shoemaker's bazaar it supplanted. It is difficult to find a right angle in this passageway, with its fanciful carved wooden window frames, balustrades and even telephone booths.
The shops in the arcade are marked with mid-1980's neon signs: pocketbook for a luggage store; book for a bookstore, and harem girl, of course, for the carpet store.
I then made my way down Belgrad street, along the Danube, to Dimitrov Square and what was, last year when I studied there, the Karl Marx Economics University - in the new post-communist world the Budapest University of Economic Sciences. The university occupies a 120-year-old former customs house, designed in a neo-Renaissance style by Miklos Ybl, the Budapest Opera architect.
Although this year the school was shorn of his name and the Marxist curriculum, Karl Marx remains in the glass-covered courtyard. His somewhat tortured contemplative look seems to have deepened as the rapid democratization of Hungary took place before his unblinking bronze eyes.
In this hall in the past two years he has seen a succession of speakers indicating the waning of his power, from President Bush to the Dalai Lama to Prince Charles, to, in the spring of 1989, the leaders of the relatively obscure opposition group, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (hashing out a platform and thanking supporters). Not two years later the Democratic Forum is the leading power in the freely elected Hungarian Government.
Walking to Calvin Square and then along Muzeum Avenue, I came to the narrow streets of what was once a working class Jewish neighborhood, behind the Dohany Street Synagogue.
At 18 Dob Street is the Gozsdu building. Seven linked courtyards form the spine of this former dormitory complex built in the late 1800's by a childless Romanian judge, Elek Gozsdu, to house visiting Romanian students.
Some of the small jewelers workshops that lined the courtyards before World War II have been supplanted by what at first appear to be similar businesses - carpenter, hairdresser, dressmaker - but on inspection turn out to be affiliated with the Nepszinhaz, the People's Theater, making costumes, sets and props.
Major acts of Hungarian history have played in the Gozsdu courtyard. One of its groaning wrought-iron gates was the border of the Jewish ghetto during World War II.
During the 1958 revolution it was a headquarters for Hungarian insurgents. Russian tanks leveled the building next door and the struggle is spelled out in the bullet holes in the walls.
In a courtyard at 29-31 Kazinczy Street, behind a cavernous Orthodox synagogue with a crenelated roof, is the Hanna kosher restaurant. The smells of kosher cooking, the clank of pots on stove burners and the shouts of children in recess from Talmud-Torah class recall a time before the Holocaust when more than a thousand worshipers came to the synagogue each week.
One of the older men dining at the Hanna restaurant told me his was the first wedding held under the courtyard's wrought-iron canopy, or huppah, after the war. In Hebrew letters on the huppah's frieze is one of the blessings of the ceremony: ''The voice of joy, the voice of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride.''
Tucked under the courtyard's entranceway is the Sasz Chevra temple. At dusk each day, the murmuring of prayers come from its open door, through which can be seen the clocks that mark the different times of sunset - the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath - in major Hungarian towns.
From here I took a taxi toward Margit Bridge and the Buda side of the Danube, asking the driver to wait for a minute while I stopped in at 13-19 Palffy Gyorgy Street, a huge block of apartments built in the 1950's for military personnel. From the courtyard one feels the full monolithic weight of what Budapesters call the Stalinist Baroque style. On one courtyard wall are two bas-reliefs in bombastic, socialist-realist style: a soldier leaves for war, bidding goodbye to his wife and his flag-waving baby, and a worker in overalls reads to a child dressed in the uniform of the Communist youth group. But what about the bear on the scooter? In the center of the courtyard, this sculpture, although in the same realistic style, is an inexplicably whimsical deviation.
Crossing the Margit bridge I got out of the taxi at the Lukacs Spa, 25-29 Frankel Leo Street. Its swimming pools and medicinal hot baths scented with camomile are a traditional meeting place of journalists and politicans - in these waters much of the country's policy has been brewed over the past century.
On one of the courtyard walls, just below the statue of St. Luke, are plaques donated by thankful spa-goers from faraway lands. They describe in lurid detail the illnesses supposedly cured by the Lukacs. ''An enormous cramp was in my back for months. And this bath relieved it,'' wrote one Hungarian visitor in 1898. ''God's blessing on this miraculous place!''
These waters are said to have been sought out as early as the first century by the Roman legions. The present neoclassical complex was built during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in the mid-19th century. It is ironic that after the Hungarians paid dearly to free themselves from the domination of Vienna, the state spa authority recently sold half of the Lukacs to an Austrian concern. Habitues speak nervously of price increases.
But, for the moment, a weary tourist may still buy a ticket to the two swimming pools for around $1.25. The sulfurous spring water is also sold in the glass-walled drink hall near the courtyard entrance. A giant mug said to cure arthritis can be had for 1 forint (about 2 cents) - although its faint rotten-egg smell may intimidate some visitors. I had no choice but to finish mine as the woman who draws the water explained proudly that families from the countryside take home liters of the stuff.
From here I took the tram at the foot of Margit bridge some five minutes to the last stop, Moscow Square, and caught the Castle Hill jitney to Szentharomsag Square.
Anyone who has gotten this far deserves to duck into the cozy Biedermeier interior of the 180-year-old Ruszwurm pastry shop, 7 Szentharomsag Street. From here it is a short walk on Uri Street to No. 19 (although almost all of the Castle district's restored Gothic and Baroque houses are worth exploring). Inside this house, built on the medieval ruins of an Italian warlord's mansion, is a courtyard whose white-washed walls, balconies and low archways evoke a Mediterranean serenity.
In the courtyard's rock garden, underneath a sundial painted on the wall, is the tombstone of Izabella Lenkey, daughter of the then-owner. The girl died at age 22 in 1850. Her fiance, forced to flee to America after participating in the failed Hungarian revolt against Austrian rule, wrote the poem on her gravestone. ''Two things were aflame in your youthful heart. Your fatherland and its son, your betrothed'' it begins, ascribing her death to the defeat of both of these.
When I inquired about the poem, a gracious elderly lady cooking lunch at an open window welcomed me into her apartment. Mrs. Bela Borsos sat down with me at the dining room table and, in a profound silence broken only the ticking of a deep-lunged clock, she wrote the verses.
How did she know this by heart? Time has blurred beyond recognition the words carved on the tombstone. Her great-grandmother was Izabella Lenkey's sister, said Mrs. Borsos.
As I stood once again in the sun-filled courtyard after an afternoon touring these sanctuaries of the past, it struck me more strongly than ever that history does not end with the final chapter in the textbook.

Air Fares Cut In California Price War
A price war has broken out in the air corridor between Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and passengers willing to plan three weeks ahead can fly for as little as $58 round trip. The most expensive full fare is $186 each way.
United, USAir, Delta, American and Alaska Airlines, all of which operate frequent flights between Northern and Southern California, have been offering the $58 fare since the beginning of July. To get it, customers must buy tickets 21 days in advance, travel any day but Friday and Sunday and stay over one Friday night. The number of $58 seats on any flight is limited, and the cost of the tickets generally cannot be refunded. 
Southwest Airlines sparked the $58 fare battle when it introduced flights between Oakland and Burbank or Ontario in Southern California.
USAir followed suit with hourly flights between San Francisco and Burbank, then added hourly service between San Francisco and Los Angeles International Airport. United, which has the most flights between Los Angeles and San Francisco, proceeded to match USAir's $58 price.
The three-week advance-purchase weekend fare, for travel on Friday or Sunday, is now only $68 round trip. Most airlines also offer a $98 round trip with one-day advance purchase, and a $142 round trip with no advance purchase required.
Airline officials will not say how long the reduced fares will be in effect.
 
Delay Seen on Boat Casinos CHICAGO
Wagerers looking forward to the start of riverboat gambling Jan. 1 in Illinois and April 1 in Iowa could be disappointed. Although plans are proceeding to introduce the floating casinos on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers as well as on some of Illinois's inland waterways, it seems unlikely that betting will start on schedule.
The problem is that only recently did the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission grant its first five licenses to prospective operators of riverboats. In a number of cases, the boats must be built from scratch, and gambling equipment, such as roulette wheels, slot machines and craps tables, brought in from outside vendors.
Things are proceeding even more slowly in Illinois. On July 1 the Illinois Gaming Board accepted its first 10 applications from prospective riverboat operators. The agency must now conduct background checks on the applicants and set the rules for gambling. For example, it has already ruled that no gambling will take place while the boats are docked.
Because the two states passed their gambling laws to promote tourism, it seems likely that the Iowa commission and the Illinois board will require the applicants to base their boats in economically depressed cities such as Rock Island and Moline on the Mississippi River and Sioux City on the Missouri River. The boats will venture on short excursions - say, four hours or less - during which those on board will be free to try their luck at everything from one-armed bandits to baccarat. Illinois and Iowa both have provisions in their laws requiring the boat operators to include entertainment for minors.
The arrival of the boats, which will likely be designed to be reminiscent of 19th-century paddleboats or casino cruise ships, should also spur development. A number of the prospective boat operators in Illinois, for instance, have said they would build hotels and restaurants in the state if their licenses were granted. And in Iowa, one of the licensees, John Connelly, an entrepreneur who operates riverboats in Pittsburgh and St. Louis, has committed to spending $90 million to renovate an existing hotel in Davenport and to build a new hotel and promenade nearby.

German Booklet For Visiting Jews
For the first time, the German National Tourist Office has produced a brochure aimed specifically at Jewish travelers. The 40-page ''Germany for the Jewish Traveler'' includes a history of Jewish communities in several West German cities, advice on contacting the local rabbi and information on obtaining kosher food. Synagogues and Jewish cemeteries are also listed. The brochure begins with a four-page summary of the history of the Jews in Germany, with emphasis on the Holocaust.
In addition to Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and major cities, some lesser-known communities with sites of interest to Jewish visitors are described, including Augsburg, Furth and Bamberg. There are also sections on the Bergen-Belsen and Dachau death camps.
Copies of ''Germany for the Jewish Traveler'' are available free from the German National Tourist Office, 747 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017.
 
Grounded Ship Set to Return 1
The cruise ship Bermuda Star, grounded since striking a reef near the Cape Cod Canal June 10, is scheduled to take to the seas again July 28. The Bermuda Star Line ship has been in Brooklyn undergoing repairs to its hull, which received a gash 115 feet long by 2 feet wide.
Effjohn International Cruise Holdings, which owns the Bermuda Star, has canceled six scheduled cruises, in addition to the one in which the accident occurred off Woods Hole, Mass. The Bermuda Star sails on 7- or 10-day cruises from New York to Canada and Bermuda in summer and fall and from San Diego to Mexico in winter and spring.
The 680 passengers who were on a cruise to Montreal when the ship ran aground and those scheduled on canceled cruises have been given the choice of a refund - plus a $250 credit toward a future cruise - or a 7- or 10-day cruise on any of the Effjohn ships, which include the Queen of Bermuda and the Caribe. Also, each passenger will receive a $100 bar-bill credit.
 
French Trains Curb Smoking
Smoking will be banned on French commuter trains from Jan 1, 1991. Smoking will also be banned in the corridors of nonsmoking cars on long-distance lines and on platforms reserved for nonsmokers. The railroads announced that by January 1993 at least 70 percent of the cars on long-distance routes will be nonsmoking.
 
Hotel Programs for Children
Hotels, resorts and travel agencies are taking steps to appeal to parents through their children.
THE HYATT HOTEL chain, for instance, has introduced Camp Hyatt at many of its hotels and resorts. The camp, for youngsters under age 15, usually runs from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., and includes such activities as kite flying, sand-castle building, and arts and crafts. Children stay free in their parents' rooms at the Hyatt hotels; a separate adjoining room is 50 percent off.
THE CASA DE CAMPO RESORT in La Romana, Dominican Republic, offers children a summer camp that includes lessons in a variety of sports - wind surfing, horseback riding, golf and tennis, among them. The cost is $20 a day, and includes lunch. Camp continues through Sept. 30.
THE HILTON HAWAIIAN VILLAGE in Waikiki features a new children's program with a cruise on Hilton's own Rainbow I catamaran, a tropical bird show, a treasure hunt and a trip to the Dole Pineapple Cannery. All the activities are free for those aged 3 to 12; if there is space, parents are allowed on the excursions.
THE HOMESTEAD, the Allegheny Mountains resort in Hot Springs, Va., offers tennis, fishing and other sports instruction for children aged 7 to 12 in a program called Tower Troop. The program costs $15 a child a day.
THE ROSENBLUTH TRAVEL AGENCY in King of Prussia, Pa., near Philadelphia, has opened the Family Vacation Station. It has opened a ''Kid's Test Flight Room,'' which prepares a child for the experience of air travel. The room has regulation-size airline seats, and there is a musical video that follows a family through an airport and onto a flight.

HEADLINE: Culture Shock as East Greets West

BYLINE: By Stephen Engelberg; Stephen Engelberg is head of the Warsaw bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
West is meeting East this summer in Europe's newly democratic countries, and the clash of cultures has bewildered, frustrated and exhilarated both the visitors and the hosts.
The summer of 1990 has seen record or near-record numbers of Western tourists in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, with the most significant surge of visitors going to Prague and Budapest, according to tourism officials. Romania, with its continuing unrest, and Bulgaria remain less popular destinations.
The tourists came for a glimpse of the places where Central Europeans made history last fall, but when they returned to their hotel rooms, dined in restaurants and tried to make phone calls, they got a first-hand understanding of the legacy of Communism.
While some found the standards of service disappointingly low and road and rail travel within Eastern Europe often erratic, others said the thrill of seeing the places that have dominated the news in the past year made it all worthwhile. 
''This is not a place where things are easy,'' said David Resnicow of Manhattan, as he reflected on a $350-a-night hotel in Prague that disdained answering telephone calls to its main switchboard.
''You wouldn't call coming here a sensual experience,'' he said during a visit with his wife to Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary. ''It's more a socioeconomic and political experience. You can feel an exuberance in the streets, a festiveness, a sense of rediscovery. It's almost like the 1960's in the way set patterns are changing.''
But many of the state-run enterprises in Eastern Europe still retain an ethos - briefly summarized as ''the customer is always wrong'' - that Americans found unnerving. Bill Stamp, a pastor from Birmingham, Ala., who has been driving to some of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania's more obscure cities in the course of delivering Bibles, said he was troubled by the ''Communist mentality'' he encountered. ''The people aren't too willing to help you,'' he said. ''When it's time to close shop, they close shop. And you'd better not be in a hurry when you eat in a restaurant.''
The food of Eastern Europe, most of which stems from a meeting of the Communist shortage economy and traditional heavy Slavic recipes, is getting mixed reviews from Americans. Frances Carlson, of Lexington, Mass., was visiting Poland, the country of her parents' birth, for the first time. '' The food is just too greasy,'' she said. ''The Poles don't seem to have found healthy food yet.'' But Buford Alexander, an American living in Amsterdam, said he was impressed. ''I was prepared for a lot worse from what I read in the papers,'' he said. ''I find the food to be very good.''
Mr. Alexander was one of many tourists who expressed particular affection for Prague. ''It's incredibly well-preserved,'' he said.
Some Western visitors came prepared for the somewhat rustic conditions - and were pleasantly surprised by what they found.
Jim Goldgeier, a Sovietologist at Stanford University, and his fiancee, Kathy Bodovitz, a newspaper reporter from San Francisco, said they decided to venture East early this year braced to do without the pampering many Westerners expect on vacations.
''I expected Poland to be the Soviet Union, but I'm shocked,'' said Mr. Goldgeir. ''There are bananas, kiwis and raspberries everywhere. You would never see this in Moscow or Leningrad.''
Americans are still finding bargains in Eastern Europe - an ice cream cone for the equivalent of 4 cents in Czechoslovakia, for instance - but the economic reform programs in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have driven prices much closer to Western levels.
Eva Kucsas, owner of a souvenir shop in Budapest, said the free-spending tourists who used to come to the city on luxury tours had been replaced by a more tight-fisted crowd. ''My experience is that more of the poor tourists have been coming in the past 10 years. They even fret over 100 forints'' - about $1.50.
Beth Kirchhoff, a classical pianist from Seattle, said she was forced to go 20 minutes outside of Prague before she could find a room within her budget, a student dormitory that would rent a room for $25 a night.
Sue Volz from Florida, a dancer in the European road company of ''A Chorus Line,'' said she was dismayed to discover that only two possiblities for rooms were available when she arrived in Berlin: a cheap pension and a hotel at $470 a night. Ms. Volz said she chose the pension before moving on to better accommodations the next day.
For the East Europeans, the demands and habits of traveling Westerners have proved a bit of a shock in countries where until recently the tourist trade came mainly from neighboring Eastern-bloc countries.
Witold Lawnicki, manager of a state-run store in downtown Warsaw that sells Polish handcrafts, complained about the visitors' aversion to carrying cash, Polish or American. ''We like foreigners to buy our things,'' Mr. Lawnicki said, ''but they are always using these cards of plastic.''
Laszlo Lantos, a Budapest boutique owner, echoed Mr. Lawnicki's concerns. ''The Americans always want to make a bargain by wanting to buy three T-shirts, thinking it will cost less. They simply do not understand we have fixed prices.''
In West Berlin, the tendency of American tourists to look and run has irritated some hoteliers. ''Most Americans come in on the night train, take a walk through the wall and leave early the next morning,'' said an owner of a pension who declined to be named. He said he no longer provided rooms for one-night visitors, adding, ''Many of my colleagues are doing the same.''
Government officials throughout Eastern Europe predict that the number of Americans will rise higher in the late summer and fall as a result of recent changes in a visa process that tried the patience of even experienced travelers. East Germany and Czechoslovakia dropped visa requirements for American tourists earlier this year. Czechoslovakia has dropped all visa requirements for visitors staying a month or less. Hungary still requires Americans to obtain a visa; the charge in the United States is $15.
Figures for the numbers of tourists visiting the region so far this summer are not yet available, but even statistics from the winter months show large increases in the number of visitors to several of the countries.
More than 10 million tourists - about a third of them from Western countries - visited Hungary in the first five months of this year, an 83 percent increase over the same period last year, the Government tourist agency said.
In Poland, Robert Kepinski, General Director of the Department of Tourism, predicted that Western tourism to his country would rise 20 percent this year above the 1989 total of 1.8 million, with the number of Americans perhaps increasing even more sharply.
A spokesman for the West Berlin Tourist Board said 8,000 Americans visited the city in March, nearly twice as many as in March 1989.
In Czechoslovakia, Government officials said 1.2 million Western tourists, mostly Austrians, visited their country from January to March, a 159 percent increase over the same months in 1989. American visitors to the country in the first quarter of the year rose from 6,283 to 15,941, continuing a trend established last fall.
''There has been no tourist season this year,'' said Zdenek Pokorny, receptionist at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square, Prague. ''Prague has been full since the revolution days in November.''
In June, crowds in Wenceslas Square were so large that visitors hoping to browse in Bohemian crystal shops or sip espresso in outdoor cafes found themselves part of a social phenemenon all too familiar to Czechs and Slovaks: a line. But like natives, visitors often found that queuing was for naught. A few overwhelmed cafes ran out of coffee, and the shelves of crystal shops in even the country's most remote cities had nothing but salt and pepper shakers.
Bohuslav Pinkas of the state-run travel agency in Czechoslovakia said: ''South Bohemia is overcrowded. It is impossible to find a place to drink a beer within 100 kilometers of the frontier.''
''You need connections to buy crystal now,'' said Suzanne Stefan, who lives in the small town of Kralovsky Chlmec, near the Czechoslovak-Soviet Union border. ''I can barely get it any more, and I know where to find it.''
It is not yet clear whether this summer will see a net gain in tourism for the countries of Central Europe, because the easing of travel restrictions means that Eastern Europeans are going to Western Europe and elsewhere in record numbers.
According to Krzysztof Gerula, vice president of the state-run Orbis tourist company in Poland, bookings from tourists in the formerly Communist countries have collapsed.
In addition, Poland eliminated its longtime policy of heavily discounting the price of hotel rooms for Polish citizens, a step that may also cause revenues to drop this year. In 1989, the last year for which statistics are available, more than 6 million of the 8.2 million people who came to Poland on visitors' visas were from Eastern-bloc countries.
One business in East Europe's cities that seems to be making a seamless transition to capitalism is the taxi industry, but the attempts to overcharge tourists are still more good-natured than surly. In Budapest, managers at the Hilton Hotel have begun monitoring the fares of drivers carrying hotel guests. In Prague, some taxi drivers become irate if the passenger insists that the meter be turned on, while in Bratislava drivers routinely refuse short-hop fares.
In Czechoslovakia, at least, Americans can feel confident that such treatment is not based on nationality: Everyone who looks like he isn't a native is usually addressed first in German.
One remnant of the Communist system persists in all of the region's countries but Poland: black market currency dealings. The Polish zloty is easily exchanged for dollars at a rate that has held steady throughout this year. In other countries, the main squares and hotels in the major cities are filled with young men who whisper ''Money? Money?'' and offer about a 20 percent premium above the Government-set rate.
Although authorities seem to turn a blind eye, the deals are illegal and sometimes tricky. One visitor to Prague from Houston, for example, complained that she had exchanged dollars for Czechoslovak currency that is no longer in use.
Tourists are finding less of Western Europe's ease when they travel in the region, whether by car or train. Cars are available for rent in all major cities, but road quality varies greatly between countries and urban and rural areas. Car rental rates in Hungary are from $24 to $84 a day plus 24 cents a kilometer, with a weekend rate of $150 plus milage. In addition there is a 25 percent tax on the total. Rates in Poland are from $22 to $60 a day plus mileage of from 10 cents a kilometer to about 64 cents a kilometer.
In Poland, newly paved roads link many of the country's big cities, but a lack of street lights makes night travel difficult, and the number of drunken drivers in rural areas is a major concern.
Czechoslovakia has long stretches of remarkably straight two-lane highways, making car travel in the country a reasonable possibility for tourists who want to travel between the major cities.
Trains in Central Europe are inexpensive - a first-class ticket for the four-hour trip in Poland between Gdansk and Warsaw costs about $5 -but often without the promptness, dining cars and smoking sections found in Western Europe.
In addition, some stretches of track are rundown, forcing the trains to move at a comparatively slow speed for hours at a time. The 40-mile trip from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, to Vienna, for example, takes two hours by train and an hour by car.
Furthermore, train stations such as Warsaw Central tend to attract slick groups of pickpockets, who often choose travelers speaking foreign languages as their targets.
The American Embassy in Warsaw routinely warns Americans about the problem, but an official there said the business in replacement passports had been brisk.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Berlin

BYLINE: By Thomas Seibert; Thomas Seibert contributes to The Times from Bonn.

 BODY:
Less than six months ago, preparing for a night out at one of East Berlin's theaters was a nerve-racking experience for the Western visitor: tickets had to be reserved well in advance through an East German Government agency and crossing from West Berlin involved standing in long lines at one of the two border crossings open to foreigners, Friedrichstrasse and Checkpoint Charlie. A mandatory exchange at the border of West German for East German marks was an additional inconvenience.
Today all border checkpoints have been eliminated, the West German mark has also become the currency of East Germany and theater tickets can be obtained at box offices in both parts of the city.
As the two Berlins come together, the lifting of travel restrictions has not only made it easier for the visitor to cross over to the East, but has also generated the kind of bicultural life that the city has not seen since the Berlin wall went up in 1961.
After World War II each part of the city emerged as a cultural center in its own right. West Berlin, by far the Federal Republic's biggest city with 1.96 million inhabitants, became a center for West German art, while East Berlin, the privileged capital of East Germany, had most of the famous museums of the prewar city center. With the wall gone, East and West Berlin can merge their attractions. 
A fully reunited Berlin will have around 30 major art museums, from the Pergamon in the East, with the 2,000-year-old Pergamon Altar, built for Zeus between 180 and 160 B.C. in Pergamon, Asia Minor, to the National Gallery with works by Max Ernst and Francis Bacon in the West.
Scattered across its 341 square miles, Berlin boasts a cultural landscape that ranges from the Berlin Philharmonic in the West and the Berliner Ensemble in the East, a theater group founded by Bertolt Brecht, to political cabarets like East Berlin's Distel (thistle) on the Friedrichstrasse (telephone 200-4704) and West Berlin's Stachelschweine (porcupines) in the Europa Center on Tauentzinstrasse
 
Logistics
Getting around the two parts of Berlin is no longer a problem that requires careful planning. On July 1, when East and West Germany merged their currencies, economies and social systems, East Germany dropped visa requirements for most Western countries, including the United States. There are around 120 road links, cross-border subway and bus lines and former official border crossings between West Berlin on one side and East Berlin and East Germany on the other side. In addition, hundreds of unofficial breaches have been opened in recent weeks.
 
Museums
The Eastern part of town, the center of prewar Berlin, has the famous Museumsinsel (museum island) on the River Spree, a cluster of museums including the Pergamon (open daily from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.), the Bode Museum (open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.), the National Gallery (Wednesday to Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.) and the Old Museum (Wednesday to Sunday 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.) Admission is 65 cents at each museum, calculated at 1.68 marks to the dollar.
Among the more important in West Berlin are the National Gallery (50 Potsdamerstrasse, open daily except Monday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; admission free), the Gemaldegalerie (painting gallery) in the Museum Dahlem (23-27 Arnimallee, open daily except Monday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; admission free) and the Egyptian Museum in the Charlottenburg Palace (Luisenplatz, open daily except Friday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.; admission free).
Berlin's museums reflect the changes that have swept through the two Germanys and the city. The East Berlin National Gallery, which in the past specialized in displaying the art of 40 years of Communist East Germany, now houses an exhibition by the Austrian Alfred Hrdlicka.
Scheduled to run until Aug. 8, it is titled ''Der Anschluss'' (the annexation), a bitterly negative comment on the moves toward German unity.
 
Performing Arts
Cabarets and theaters in East Berlin, free of the totalitarian regime that regulated their repertory, have plunged into staging politically controversial programs.
The Maxim Gorki Theater in Kastanienwaldchen will interrupt its summer break on Aug. 17, 18 and 19 for three performances of ''Mein Kampf'' by George Tabori, a satirical play about the forming of the mind of the young Hitler (ticket information 208-2748). Tickets are from $2 to $20.
Cabarets like the Distel and the Berliner Kabarett Sundikat (18 Jan Petersen Strasse; 542-9100) deal with the mood and the attitudes of Germans as they prepare for unification. Ticket prices for East Berlin cabarets are around $15.
Tickets for East Berlin concerts, operas and cabarets can be obtained at such West Berlin ticket services as Box Office at Nollendorff Platz (215-1954) and Kurt Schumacher Platz (496-2223), and Theaterkasse Zehlendorf at 22 Teltower Damm (801-3056). In the East they can be obtained at the box office in the Palast Hotel at Spandauer Strasse (212-5258).
Several festivals, such as the Berliner Festwochen, a mainly musical gathering, will highlight the growing links between the two parts of the city. The Festwochen, strictly a West Berlin event in recent years, will be staged on both sides of the wall for the first time. The festival's first concert will feature the Gustav Mahler Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado in the West Berlin Philharmonic Hall on Aug. 7. The concert will be repeated the next day in the ruins of the Chorin monastery outside East Berlin.
On Sept. 1 Leonard Bernstein and the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra will appear on the Waldbuhne, a West Berlin open-air stage. Tickets are available at 882-7011.
 
Art Exhibits
Starting Aug. 28 the Martin Gropius Bau gallery near the wall on the western side will house an exhibition by the German Historic Museum, titled ''Bismarck and Prussia, Germany and Europe.'' (Open 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday; admission $5. Information 329-010.) In East Berlin, the Otto Nagel Haus on Museum Island features Russian and Soviet art from 1910 to 1930 in an exhibition that will run to July 31 (279-1402). It is open Sunday to Thursday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.
Paintings by the East German artist Bernhard Heisig can be seen at the New Gallery of the Old Museum on Museum Island until Aug. 26 (open Wednesday to Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; admission 65 cents. Information 212-7231). ''Out of Rank'' is the title of an exhibition of works of a new generation of East German artists in the Studio Galerie at 3 Strausberger Platz in East Berlin (open Monday to Friday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; 436-3370 for information).
 
Where to Stay
Unfortunately, the united Berlin's new and old attractions can be soured for the tourist by a chronic shortage of hotel rooms. Early booking is essential, at least a month before arriving. The West Berlin Tourist Board can provide visitors with day-to-day vacancies. The board, in the Europa Center on Budapester Strasse near the Kurfurstendamm, is open daily from 7:30 A.M. to 10:30 P.M.; 262-6031.
A new way to look for a hotel in Berlin is provided by Zimmer Frei? (vacancies?), a telephone information service that puts together a list of rooms in different price categories every day (19-414; recorded announcements in German only).
In West Berlin the Hotel Kempinski at 27 Kurfurstendamm (884-340), the city's busiest shopping street, offers luxury accommodation. The lobby has the atmosphere of a 19th-century grand hotel. Double rooms cost around $225 a night; $15 for a buffet breakfast.
The Grand Hotel Esplanade on the Landwehrkanal at 15 Lutzowufer (261-011) is a high-standard hotel with light airy rooms. The modern architecture of the Esplanade, the huge lobby and the hotel's own exhibition of modern art create an atmosphere of cool elegance, quite different from the cosiness of the Kempinski. Double rooms from $196; $12 for breakfast.
A less expensive but comfortable place is the Hotel Kronprinz at 1 Kronprinzendamm (896-030). Built in 1890, it captures some of the traditional, prewar Berlin atmosphere with its high, airy rooms and big windows. Double rooms are $113 with breakfast. In the same category is Hotel Agon at 4 Xantener Strasse (882-851). Doubles are $102 with breakfast. Situated in a modern building in a quiet residential area off Kurfurstendamm, the Agon, with its light, modern rooms, is ideally situated to serve as a base for walks through the city or trips to Berlin's hinterland.
Hotel Econtel International, around the corner from the Charlottenburg Palace at 24 Soemmeringstrasse (346-81147), is medium-priced and convenient to downtown. A double is $86 with breakfast. The Econtel's lobby and rooms stress simple structures and basic functionality.
Budget choice: Large old-Berlin style rooms and a quiet atmosphere can be enjoyed in the Hotel-Pension Pariser Eck (19 Pariser Strasse; 881-2145). Doubles are $57 with breakfast.
In East Berlin a dozen high-price hotels are officially still the only accommodations available. The Victorian-style Grand Hotel at 158 Friedrichstrasse (20-920), built by the former Communist Government to bring in hard currency, offers a grandiose lobby that is a favorite place for afternoon tea. The rooms, which offer every luxury, are $210 with breakfast.
The Palast Hotel (Karl Liebknecht Strasse; 212-5750), next to the Berlin cathederal and the East German Parliament building, the Palace of the Republic, is another luxury place. The hotel's restaurant, the Markisches, (2410), offers a splendid view of the river and the cathedral and has a menu of typical Berlin dishes. Good selection of wines. Dinner around $21 a person. Slightly less expensive than the Grand (a double with breakfast is $160), the Palast is right in the center of East Berlin.
Reservations in East Berlin can be made with the hotels directly or through Zentrale Zimmervermittlung, 5 Alexanderplatz, Postfach 77, 1026 Berlin, East Germany; 215-4402.
 
Where to Eat
The Ermeler Haus at 12 Markisches Ufer (275-5103) has international cuisine for about $20 a person.
For good German food in East Berlin, the Offenbach-Stuben at 8 Stubenkammer Strasse (448-4106) is a good choice. Meals are around $20.
In West Berlin, Fofi's Estiatorio in Fasanenstrasse (881-8785), a meeting place of a colorful in-crowd of artists and actors, offers Greek dishes. A three-course meal with wine is $30 to $40.
Alt Luxemburg, which has become increasingly popular recently, offers haute cuisine in a nostalgic atmosphere on Pestalozzistrasse (323-8730). Dinner with wine is around $71 a person. Reservations necessary.
Florian's, at 52 Grolmannstrasse (313-9184), with dinner at $30, is a good place to have a long chat in a cozy atmosphere. Florian'sspecializes in German food from Franconia.

''Socialism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country,'' Lenin said in 1921 when he introduced his program to bring his nation into the industrial 20th century. Even today the centrality of that tenet to Soviet economic philosophy can hardly be exaggerated. The Soviet Government has taken the production, and consumption, of electric power not just as an index of the nation's economic progress but as a metaphor for the health of its entire system. 
As Lenin initiated the country's electrification by developing its coal and oil resources, and Stalin and Khrushchev promoted heroic hydropower projects, so Mikhail S. Gorbachev made it his mission to accelerate the conversion of the Soviet Union to nuclear power. By 1986 the Soviet Union had the world's third largest nuclear program, after the United States and France. And Mr. Gorbachev's first five-year plan, adopted in February of that year, called for doubling the nation's nuclear capacity, from 11 percent of its electricity to 22 percent. But just two months later, on April 26, 1986, the accident at the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, the largest plant in the Soviet Union, undermined Mr. Gorbachev's plan - and along with it many of the assumptions on which the nation was built.
In ''The Legacy of Chernobyl,'' Zhores A. Medvedev, a biochemist who was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1973 and is now a research scientist for the National Institute for Medical Research in London, combines an exhaustive accounting of technical data with an insider's knowledge of the Soviet bureaucracy to synthesize a damning history of the Chernobyl affair, from its origins in the plant's primitive design and careless management to the economic and political crisis the accident precipitated. Using the same painstaking analysis that distinguished ''Nuclear Disaster in the Urals,'' Mr. Medvedev's now largely vindicated investigation of a devastating nuclear accident in the 1950's, he makes the Chernobyl disaster seem almost inevitable.
The accident itself, Mr. Medvedev asserts, occurred not during the testing of a safety system, as official accounts have suggested, but during a belated attempt to install such a system, more than two years after the plant went on line. Disaster, he believes, was the inevitable result of the sequence of simple operator errors that, as fate had it, occurred in the wee hours of April 26.
Mr. Medvedev also makes it clear that the haphazard, and often bungled, attempts to handle the Chernobyl disaster resulted not just from technical inadequacy but from a bureaucratic cover-up - of the accident itself and of its potential medical effects - that reached as high as the central ministerial level. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people were exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity because they were not evacuated, and even today many remain exposed as they eat food from and live in irradiated areas, mainly Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Many of these accusations, which were first made in the Soviet press last fall, point in the direction of Yuri A. Izrael, chairman of the State Committee on Hydrometeorology, which kept radiological data hidden from the public, and Yevgeny I. Chazov, the Minister of Health, who played down the biological impact of radiation.
The long-term effects of Chernobyl have yet to play themselves out. Ultimately, Mr. Medvedev suggests, cleanup costs could exceed the Soviet Union's entire investment to date in its nuclear capacity. And, he believes, Chernobyl was the catalyst for some of the momentous political and economic changes now taking place. By exposing institutional weaknesses within the Soviet bureaucracy, he writes, the affair forced the examination of the system's ills that became perestroika; and by trespassing international boundaries, the tragedy forced the public admissions from high-ranking Government officials that became the first glimmerings of glasnost. Moreover, the accident triggered an interest in conserving energy. An antinuclear - and, in turn, broadly environmental - movement has gathered across the Soviet Union, and that movement is now the foundation for the ''people's fronts,'' the vanguard of democratic and secessionist sentiments.
If Mr. Medvedev faults the Soviet bureaucracy mainly for its reflexive silence on Chernobyl, Jay M. Gould and Benjamin A. Goldman, the authors of ''Deadly Deceit,'' take pains to demonstrate a history of active deception in American bureaucracies. They contend that the United States Energy and Defense Departments, and even certain state health offices, have falsified data in order to hide the health effects on Americans of both the distant Chernobyl accident and the radiation that has been released by bomb tests, weapons facilities and power plants here.
Mr. Gould, the author of ''The Technical Elite,'' and Mr. Goldman, the author of ''Hazardous Waste Management,'' take as the starting point of their investigation the month following the Chernobyl accident. In that period, they contend, there were sharp increases in the United States figures both for mortality and for the levels of radioactive iodine in milk. What is the connection? They hypothesize that low-level radiation not only triggers long-term chromosomal damage (and thus, frequently, cancer), but can also, when ingested, break up oxygen in the body into highly reactive atoms that can wreak all sorts of additional havoc - from damaging cells in the immune system to encouraging the deposit of cholesterol in arteries. These phenomena, they believe, could cause an immediate rise in mortality, especially among infants and the elderly. Thus, they say, the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at the Energy Department's Savannah River facility in South Carolina in 1970 could explain as many as 100,000 statistically ''excess'' deaths.
There have been decades of Federal, if not state, cover-up of nuclear mismanagement. That much has become all too clear in the course of recent Congressional testimony. But the authors, in the manner of their mentor Ernest J. Sternglass, professor emeritus of radiology at the University of Pittsburgh, seem to get so caught up in raising what may be valid issues that they fail to worry about whether they have manipulated data to make their points. For instance, it is interesting if it is true, as the authors claim, that infant mortality between 1968 and 1983 rose faster in South Carolina than the national average; but it is not clear why they have selected precisely those years, nor whether the causes of death in South Carolina are indeed those (opportunistic pneumonias, for example) that might support their theory. They simply relax their hypothesis.
The authors also allow themselves audacious lapses of logic. For example, they say that the Soviet Union stopped publishing infant mortality data in the early 1970's, just about the time some of its nuclear plants came on line. That's provocative. But to suggest causality, as they do, is to go much too far. Indeed, no modern scourge escapes their speculation. AIDS, they believe, may be the result of above-ground nuclear testing; tick-borne Lyme disease, they suggest, may be the result of a 1975 accident at Connecticut's Millstone reactor.
Late in the book, the authors warn that ''the search for statistical correlation is not meant to replace causality studies, but rather to provide clues where to look.'' To do even that, though, the search for correlation must be beyond reproach.
 
PARANOID DELUSIONS OF REFORMING SOCIETY
 When the British Broadcasting Corporation called Zhores Medvedev to inform him of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, his reaction, he said, was ''complete disbelief.''
''I was puzzled,'' the exiled Soviet scientist said in a telephone interview from his home in London. ''I didn't believe reactors could explode.''
As the author who revealed a previous nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union that had been covered up for more than 20 years, Mr. Medvedev was naturally drawn to the Chernobyl story.
''As soon as the accident at Chernobyl happened I became suspicious,'' he said. He found reams of reports that either played down, exaggerated or falsified facts. ''In the end, I was surprised at how poorly designed the reactor actually was.''
In the Soviet Union, Mr. Medvedev was a victim of official attempts to stifle opposition. Diagnosed in 1970 as having ''paranoid delusions of reforming society,'' he was committed to a mental institution before being exiled in 1973.
The 64-year-old biologist is now a senior research scientist for the National Institute for Medical Research in London. While he describes himself as a researcher and not a reformer, he is nonetheless quite bold when rooting out truth.
''I wanted to write this book not only to show the real scale of this particular catastrophe, but also to demolish a few more secrets and deliberate misconceptions,'' he said.
In recent years, the Soviet Union has warmed toward Mr. Medvedev and his twin brother, Roy, a prominent dissident historian who is now a member of the Soviet Parliament. Mr. Medvedev has returned twice to the Soviet Union to attend scientific seminars. Recently, the Soviet Academy of Scientists invited him to a conference on biological fallout from Chernobyl that will be held near the site of the reactor in September.
''I accepted immediately,'' he said. ''I'll be taking as many copies of my book as I can.''

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:

WASTED, by Linda Wolfe. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) The author of ''The Professor and the Prostitute'' tells the story of the jaded Upper East Side subculture of sex and drugs that gave rise to Jennifer Levin and Robert E. Chambers Jr., the friend who killed her late one night in Central Park. ''In the end, what makes this an excellent, valuable book is that it raises larger questions no less deserving of our attention and consideration,'' Michael M. Thomas said here last year. ''Drugs are an antidote to neglect, and neglect, this story tells us, is not something that begins north of 96th Street.''
 
THE MAMBO KINGS PLAY SONGS OF LOVE, by Oscar Hijuelos. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $9.95.) For the Castillo brothers, who emigrated from Havana in the late 1940's to become New York City mambo stars, the high point of their lives comes when they are discovered in a nightclub by Desi Arnaz, who invites them to make a brief appearance on the ''I Love Lucy'' show. When this novel was published last year, our reviewer, Margo Jefferson, said, ''Mr. Hijuelos is writing music of the heart, not the heart of flesh and blood that stops beating, 'but this other heart filled with light and music . . . a world of pure affection, before torment, before loss, before awareness.' '' 
 
MEMORIES AND HALLUCINATIONS: A Memoir, by D. M. Thomas. (Penguin, $8.95.) This autobiographical book by the British novelist ''lacks energy,'' our reviewer, Helen Dudar, said in 1988. But D. M. Thomas ''is terrific at remembering creative connections. In about two and a half pages, he tells us how 'The White Hotel' was born, and the account is fascinating.''
 
THE MARK TWAIN MURDERS, by Edith Skom. (Dell, $3.50.) A professor of English believes there is a connection between a plagiarism scandal and the murder of a student in the Midwestern University library. ''Literary allusions are dropped into the puzzle plot with easy familiarity by the well-read author, who sharpens her quill for some amusingly barbed character studies of the idiosyncratic faculty in the English department,'' Marilyn Stasio said here last year.
 
BALANCING ACTS: Technology, Finance and the American Future, by James K. Galbraith. (Basic Books, $9.95.) Inflation is not such a bad thing, the author argues, if the alternative is the high interest rates that keep the United States from doing what it does best: manufacturing high-tech goods. ''In a period of so much economic malaise, contrarian ideas can be very helpful in sorting out solutions - particularly when the ideas are as insightful as Mr. Galbraith's,'' Louis Uchitelle said here last year. Basic Books has also republished MEMOIRS OF AN UNREGULATED ECONOMIST ($9.95), in which George J. Stigler, a Nobel Prize winner, tells why the dismal science is not really so heartless after all. ''To win us over, he presents a loving and fierce defense of economics,'' Robert Krulwich said here in 1988.
 
LEAVES OF FORTUNE, by Linda Barlow. (Dell, $4.95.) When this three-century saga of a Boston tea dynasty was published in 1988, our reviewer, Carrie Carmichael, said it should be subtitled ''Something for Everyone.'' The novel has ''channeling and crystals for the New Age crowd. And for mainstream readers, there is money, lots of it, as well as power plays, revenge, death and even eating disorders.''
 
CALDECOTT & CO.: Notes on Books & Pictures, by Maurice Sendak. (Noonday/Michael di Capua/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) The author and illustrator gives his thoughts on Mother Goose, Beatrix Potter, Walt Disney and other inspirations. Last year our reviewer, Michael Cart, said, ''To many readers, the chief value of this important collection will be the opportunity to infer from Mr. Sendak's criticism the creative origins and workings of his own timeless art and to understand, moreover, the consistent importance to the picture book form of rhythm, music . . . and 'the satisfying balance of language and illustration.' ''
 
SECOND FIDDLE, by Mary Wesley. (Penguin, $7.95.) Laura Thornby, a middle-aged woman whose specialty is restoring broken statues, takes an aspiring young writer under her wing, resolving to remold him in her own image. The question, though, is who is remolding whom. ''There are special treats here for writers and those who love and inspire and put up with them,'' Eric Kraft said here last year, ''for this is a novel with much to say about the giddy elation and awful terror that attend creation.''
 
ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE: A Life, by William H. McNeill. (Oxford University, $10.95.) Renowned for his theories of the cyclical nature of history, Arnold J. Toynbee became so well known that his picture appeared on the cover of Time. Last year our reviewer, Mary Lefkowitz, called this book a ''carefully documented and eminently readable account'' of the historian's life.
 
INDECENT DREAMS, by Arnost Lustig. (Northwestern University, $9.95.) Set in Prague during the Nazi occupation, a trio of novellas tells the story of three women forced into reluctant acts of heroism. ''Mr. Lustig's prose is smart, spare, tough-minded and then, abruptly, piercingly lyrical in its evocation of the natural world,'' Johanna Kaplan said here in 1988.
 
THE TALE OF GENJI, by Murasaki Shikibu. Translated and abridged by Edward G. Seidensticker. (Vintage, $9.95.) Three centuries before Chaucer, this story of life in imperial Kyoto became what is now believed to be the oldest existing novel. Its author has been called the Marcel Proust or Jane Austen of Japan. It is ''a long, leisurely but deep examination of love, jealousy, joy, sorrow and intrigue that to this day influences Japanese ideas of manhood and femininity,'' Fumiko Mori Halloran said here in 1986.

HEADLINE: VIEWS OF SPORT;
Time for Colleges to Take Back the Field

BYLINE: By JOHN UNDERWOOD; John Underwood is finishing his eighth book, a personal odyssey through the religious chaos in America, entitled ''Loathe Thy Neighbor.''

 BODY:
THE word is out: big-time college sport, which had been moving rather impressively toward a new rectitude under the whip of a born-again leadership (mostly college presidents fed up with being truant officers), is about to go off the wagon again. Thanks once more to the willingness of television to sponsor debauchery, and the eagerness of college athletic departments to sucker in, half - or so it seems - of the major college programs in the country are said to be preparing to throw caution - and tradition, and common sense - to the winds in a wholesale realignment of who-plays-whom.
According to wild rumor and runaway speculation, a reshuffling of mind-bending proportions is imminent. If transacted to the extreme, it would affect such a face lift on leagues and conferences that the geography of major college sport would take on the aspects of a cartoon rendering . . . of a map the cartoonist only saw once . . . in an opium dream. 
Three (or more) schools from the Southwest Conference would relocate into the Southeastern Conference, including those good ol' Deep South sidekicks, Arkansas and Texas A&M. The Pacific-10 would become the Pacific-16 and include Arizona and Utah-by-the-sea. The Big Ten would become the Big Eleven - at least. Miami and Florida State, the glamour boys of the independents, would wind up in any of two or three old leagues, or one new one, including a football-only ''Metro'' conference that would have Miami - Miami of Florida - in its ''northern'' division. Notre Dame, the Independent, would be left to serve as the only celibate, because, as always, Notre Dame goes its own secure, self-indulgent way.
This fast reshuffle is being roundly advertised as a Good Thing, and an Inevitable Thing, and, most important, a Profitable Thing. It is, of course, a Bad Thing that, once and for all, would stamp big college football and big college basketball as the professional leagues their critics say they really are. And this is a Very Bad Thing indeed, especially now when college leadership is at last exercising its prerogatives and making genuine headway toward straightening out the mess that years of intemperance and malfeasance have created.
As for it being an Inevitable Thing, I'm not so sure. I like to think there are surer hands on the tiller than we are being led to believe.
There is no doubt, however, from which alien planet the stimulus for this madness comes. Television, the great financier of sport, has been getting college athletic departments lucred up for years in order to get them to do what it wants. To get them to play whenever and wherever, and by almost any format, up to and including the distortion of the games themselves (for the glory and accommodation of ''commercial messages,'' the only thing in televised sport that is inevitable).
Television money, as any accounting major knows, is the wonder drug of spectator sports. It is the great elixir that closes the wounds and hides the scars and makes everybody fiscally whole. You can't really blame professional leagues or professional events for throwing in, for becoming ''products of television.'' They are as tied to it as a man's leg is to his hip. But college sport should not be, and deserves better - I think because it happens to be better. Traditionally, at least, the colleges are where sport made its best impression on the American ethos.
Some years ago, however, the administrators of college sport made a fateful decision. They allowed television - or, rather, television's money - to become their best friend. Sometimes your best friend can be your worst enemy. The administrators of college sport gradually came to believe that it was all right to be manipulated by television, as long as the pot was right.
And, lo, the tradeoff turned out to be habit-forming, so much a part of budgetary considerations that what was once thought of as kind of a happy fiscal fluke is now a way of life. The appetite for television money grew ever larger and became insatiable, even to the point of blinding college sport's best examples, Notre Dame now included, into acting as if they were islands unto themselves. As if nobody else mattered. What has made it worse, and so counterproductive, is that the unholy alliance disturbed even further the already shaky academic-athletic balance (the necessary illusion that the athlete is a ''student first''), not only in fact but in the critical eyes of the public - and, most important, in the minds of coaches and players. Don't think for a minute that when coaches are saddled with the added pressure to succeed, to win enough in order to be attractive enough to be on television, so that there'll be more television money, so that the athletic department can live forever in the happy black, that they don't realize how cynical the process has become.
Don't think for a minute that the players don't see it, and don't know that greed is at the beating heart of it.
The pressure to win at any cost costs a lot. From such pressure comes the breakdowns in integrity, the rule-bending, the outright cheating that despoils all of sport. I know one basketball coach on the West Coast who was told flat out by his superior a couple of years ago: ''You need to get us on television to pay our bills, Coach X. Either win the conference championship this year or you're fired.'' He didn't, and he was. You can hardly preach ''the values'' of college athletics to such people, nor the importance of keeping them in line with - and subordinate to - the academic mission. You can't preach to anybody about values when your own eyes are so easily lit by the color of money.
Make no mistake about it. The explosion in the map factory now being talked about for college sport, the massive realignment that would make a shambles of the tradition and order of games, is founded on the hope of cashing in on still one more financial bonanza spawned by television's high finance.
But let the buyer beware. Granting the benefits and the pleasure television brings to sport (and they are many), one should not misidentify the beast. Television is not in the business of standing up for tradition, or fretting over integrity, or helping colleges practice what they preach. It is simply In Business. It does what it has to do, sells what it can sell. When we no longer buy Armstrong Circle Theater, television gives us Who's The Boss.
When the colleges started taking the money, like everyone else they allowed television to transform their games to fit the medium. The best example of the noxious fallout is what television does to the ebb and flow of actual play. Impetus, as any weekend tennis player knows, is a big factor in athletic competition. But television ruins impetus. You see it all the time: big game, fraught with implications . . . a sudden twist of fortune, the ball changing hands . . . players rushing onto the field . . . fans going crazy. And then everybody stands around for two minutes while the folks at home are sold a piece of the rock or a better way to control their bladders.
And while the fans at home are getting those messages, the fans at the stadium, and the players and the coaches, too, are getting this one: we'll do anything, allow anything, forfeit anything for money. Draw up the contract and show us where to sign. The biggest college football game of the year last season was Miami vs. Notre Dame. The two teams ran 126 plays. CBS ran 73 commercials.
But that's just the more obvious manifestation of the problem. The real crux of the television misadventure is the colleges' own mistake in allowing the money madness to spread, and, ipso facto, to confuse what is good for college sport with what is perceived to be good for the individual schools who play it: i.e., the more I squeeze out of the system the better off I'll be. It has caused an ever-widening gulf between the Haves and the Have-Nots, and all but deadened the moral obligation to one another - and to the spirit of competition - that must prevail to justify having intercollegiate sport in the first place.
Well, it just so happens that the time is ripe for the colleges to change all that. At the vortex of chaos, a light has been growing. Primarily it shines from an unprecedented effort on the part of presidents and chancellors, the leadership of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, big-name executives among concerned alumni groups, et al, to make amends for years of neglect. Creating commissions, even, to lead the attack.
Evidence abounds that the N.C.A.A. has at last begun to solve its academic problems. Being a longtime critic of that effort, I feel reasonably assured in saying that the day has finally come when it is next to impossible for an athlete to qualify for a Big Ten scholarship by passing a high school history exam that requires him to name the 12 months of the year, as one did a few years ago. (He passed by naming 10.) The N.C.A.A.'s Proposition 48, and subsequent sword-rattling talk about even stiffer entrance requirements, sent the appropriate message to those high schools and grade schools that graduate without educating: we won't take your morons any more. And the same administrators who pushed for that reform have been joined by a whole new army of reformers, including many athletic directors and coaches, to push for other needed changes: an end to freshman eligibility, an end to athletic dormitories, greater limitations on practice time and recruiting privileges and reduction of scholarship limits.
But also the time is ripe because the very conditions that have stimulated the new thirst for television money (and the talk of super conferences that will vacuum it up) also, ironically, make it possible for the colleges to wean themselves off the TV bottle. Make it possible to break the dependency without necessarily losing the nourishment, and benefit all of college sport in the process.
With the burgeoning of cable networks, ever heavier into sports coverage, television lusts for college sport. And the one salient fact that has long been overlooked is now ''truer'' than ever: television needs college sport more than sport needs television.
Contrary to what the credits say, television does not produce anything in this realm. It merely buys in.
And when the colleges start demanding, as they should have a long time ago, that television ''take us as we are, on our terms, or leave us alone,'' a strange and wonderful thing will happen.
Television will continue to televise the competitions.
It will continue to pay stupefying sums for the privilege. It will have to. What else can it do, form its own leagues? And if, say, in this accommodation, the colleges find that less money comes from that commercial sponsorship (it won't, but say that it does), so what? Let the colleges take a little less. Learn to live a little cheaper. Take the pressure off coaches and athletes to ''win one for the money.'' Go back, says Dick Schultz, executive director of the N.C.A.A., to ''playing for trophies.'' They'll feel a lot better about themselves. And no matter how it totals out, there'll still be plenty to go around.
Which is exactly what should happen to the money: it should go around. Literally. For big-time college sport to advance safely into the 21st century, all that money, every dime of it, should be shared equally among the brotherhood - divided up among those schools that have committed to the expense of playing college sport at the top level. Maybe giving the Have-Nots reason - for a while longer at least - to think it's worth it to continue on as punching bags for the Haves.
From a capitalistic point of view of course, share the wealth would penalize winners from reaping the rewards of their victories, especially now when budgets are so large and they need the money to make ends meet. Well, no, they don't. They have created monstrous athletic budgets to try to keep up with the Smiths and the Joneses - to match thicknesses of carpet, quadraphonics in the training room, the tonnage of gleaming metal in weight rooms - and the budgets simply don't have to be so monstrous.
Ideally, intercollegiate sport would be played whether it made money or not. By the good it brings the schools that foster it and the athletes that participate, its worth should be measured by ''cost-value'' considerations rather than ''profit-loss.'' There was a time when this was so. A return to safer, smarter economics could, in due course, make it so again, and at the same time, level the playing field a little more for competing teams.
Meanwhile, there are ways to save money and some have been suggested here. One has not, and it doesn't get talked about because it would require college football - the big moneymaker, and the big money spender -to go back to its roots: to what Bear Bryant used to call ''total'' football, where players have to play both offense and defense, just like in every other sport, and all those 285-pounders bulked up with extra weight would wear themselves out running up and down the field. Then, Bryant said, you could win the old-fashioned way: with spirit and zeal and real players.
And look, he said, how it would cut costs: instead of 95 players, you could make do with 50. Instead of 16 coaches, with half a dozen. Would the game suffer aesthetically? Well, maybe, he said, but the average fan would never know the difference, and the true athletes would love it. And isn't that the reason you hold athletic contests in the first place?
But, of course, that's another subject.

 BODY:

The Red House
 
Question: I have always been curious about the building known as Red House on the south side of West 85th Street just off off Riverside Drive. What can you tell me about it? . . . S. L., Manhattan
 
Answer: The six-story, 50-unit apartment building at 350 West 85th Street was completed in 1904. Built as a multifamily dwelling, it was designed by the firm of Harde & Short, also responsible for the Alwyn Court on West 58th Street and Seventh Avenue and the Studio building at 44 West 77th Street. 
French Ressaissance in style, the building was designated a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1982. Among its most interesting features is the salamander and crown motif set in its brickwork. It still functions as a rental apartment house.
 
The Owner of Record.7
 
Question: Where do I go to find the name of the owner or owners of a building on Central Park West in Manhattan? There has to be some place where owners of buildings are registered.. . . M. S.,Falls Church, Va.
 
Answer: The place you want is the Manhattan office of the City Register at 31 Chambers Street. Ownership of a property, the dates when it changed hands and the tax billing address are recorded on a document known as the deed. Microfilmed copies of deeds to all properties in New York City are kept on file in the City Register offices in each borough except Staten Island, where they are kept in the Richmond County Clerk's office.
To find a deed you need the block and lot number of the property, which you can look up in the land and map books in each borough office. Properties for which deeds have been recorded since 1982 are listed in computerized indexes; those recorded before are in manual files. A copy costs 25 cents a page.
While the information on deeds is a matter of public record, it is not available over the telephone or by mail. You must do the research in person or have someone do it for you. The City Register offices are open weekdays from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M.
 
Calculating the M.C.I.
 
Question: How do Major Capital Improvement increases affect the calculation of regular rent increases? . . . A. C., Manhattan
 
Answer: The M.C.I. increase is not a surcharge but rather a permanent addition to the base rent for both rent-stabilized and -controlled tenants.
According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, most leases for rent-stabilized tenants include clauses that permit M.C.I. increases to take effect as soon as they are ordered by the agency. In leases where this clause does not exist, the landlord must wait until the lease is renewed or a new lease is written to make this adjustment. Moreover, landlords of rent-stabilized tenants are allowed to collect M.C.I. increases retroactive to the date their applications for the increases were filed.
For rent-controlled tenants, M.C.I. increases become effective on the first rent payment date after the order is issued. Landlords of this category of tenant are not entitled to retroactive M.C.I. increase payments.
Another provision of the regulations regarding M.C.I. increases says that for rent-stabilized tenants, landlords may not impose an increase of more than 6 percent of the monthly rent in one year. Any allowable increase above the limit would have to be added the following year. Landlords of rent-controlled tenants are limited to annual increases of 15 percent of the monthly rent.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Ladies' Mile;
Some Landmarks Languish as a Precinct Prospers By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
Until recently, it did not seem too farfetched to imagine the Avenue of the Americas reclaiming some of its Gilded Age vibrancy south of 23d Street, where heroically scaled but long neglected department stores line the street.
Several former emporiums on the avenue, which is part of the Ladies' Mile Historic District, were renovated: the B. Altman Store at No. 625, the Hugh O'Neill Store at No. 655 and the Adams Dry Goods Store at No. 675. An ambitious restoration - accompanied by a 29-story tower - was proposed for the gigantic Siegel Cooper Store at No. 620. And it appeared that an enormous vacant lot at 23d Street would be redeveloped.
Today, however, almost all of the cavernous ground floors where New Yorkers shopped for dry goods at the turn of the century are empty and dark. All that is being offered to buyers - judging from the ''For Rent'' signs in the vast, plate-glass windows - are the spaces themselves. 
No ground-floor tenants have been signed yet for the Altman, Adams, or O'Neill buildings. The Siegel Cooper project is on the shelf indefinitely while the developer waits for market conditions to improve. And although the owner of the 23d Street site is still talking redevelopment, he has taken steps to turn the parcel into a parking lot, in an effort to recoup some of his carrying costs.
Not that all is empty, by any means. Office tenants fill the upper stories of several of the old stores. In fact, the Ladies' Mile area has one of the lowest commercial vacancy rates in Manhattan, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company.
The June vacancy rate was 9.4 percent in this district, which runs along the Avenue of the Americas, Fifth Avenue and Broadway, from 14th to 28th Streets. That is in contrast to 13.7 percent in the Park Avenue South-Madison Square area, 13.8 percent in Chelsea, 15.1 percent in mid-Manhattan, 15.6 percent in TriBeCa, 19.4 percent in SoHo-NoHo and 19.6 percent downtown.
And the director of preservation at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Alex Herrera, estimates that about 20 applications come in each month - most of which are to renovate or alter storefronts - from owners and tenants in the Ladies' Mile district, which was designated in May 1989. It runs roughly from 15th to 24th Street, Broadway to the Avenue of the Americas.
''The economic times have been bad,'' said Tracie Rozhon, a spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, ''but that area appears to be - although I hate the word - hot.''
If Ladies' Mile has a cynosure, it would be the Flatiron Building, on the triangular block bounded by Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 22d Street. For decades, there was so little call in the area for ground-floor retail space that this building's ''prow'' was given over to an anonymous-looking importing firm.
That space is now being renovated and is to reopen in October as the retail outlet of a men's clothier, C. P. Company, which is based in Bologna. The store will include the angular one-story structure at the very tip of the building, dubbed the ''cow-catcher.'' The architects are Bentley LaRosa Salasky, Design of Manhattan and Cordero Progetti of Italy.
''We're looking to try to restore the building to as close to its early state as possible,'' said Jules Olsheim, who is one of the owners of the fully leased Flatiron Building, as well as the managing agent on behalf of Helmsley-Spear. ''There are some interesting things soon to be happening such as the restoration and cleaning of the exterior, in conjunction with the landmarks commission.''
''Fifth Avenue has turned into the boutique part of the area, almost all the way up to 23d Street, with Matsuda, Armani, Kenneth Cole,'' said C. Bradley Mendelson of Edward S. Gordon. ''On Seventh Avenue, you've got Barney's and the Gap. On Sixth Avenue, nothing seems to have happened.
''Sixth is stuck right in the middle,'' he said. ''You need a destination tenant. It's not what we'd deem a high-traffic area. Traffic needs to be cultivated. If you had a big user who had a big draw, you'd really make that a good, strong shopping area.'' Mr. Mendelson represents No. 625, between 18th and 19th Streets, and No. 675, between 21st and 22d Streets. Both are owned by Israel Taub and neither has a ground-floor tenant.
''To be quite honest, people are asking too much - $50 to $60 a square foot,'' said Jay Caseley of Newmark & Company Real Estate, the primary leasing agent for the old O'Neill store. ''The market is maybe in the high $30's, averaging into the $40's over a 15-year term.'' Mr. Caseley said that a lease has been ''finalized'' - but not signed - for a restaurant on part of the ground floor at 655 Avenue of the Americas, in the ''high $30's''
The O'Neill store, betweeen 20th and 21st Streets, is now known as the Elsevier Science Publishing Building, after its major tenant. Elsevier, which publishes scientific, technical and medical books and journals, moved its 200 employees downtown from the Grand Central Terminal area in December 1988.
''The feedback we've gotten from our employees has been positive about the neighborhood,'' said an Elsevier executive, who requested anonymity. ''It is less congested than midtown. There are interesting little shops to look at, good restaurants that are more reasonably priced than midtown and good space to work in. I think everybody would like to see tenants in the ground-level spaces but I don't think it really upsets anybody that it isn't here yet.''
As for office tenants, a lease is now being negotiated for the second floor at 675 Avenue of the Americas, Mr. Mendelson said, and the rest of the building is occupied by Mattel Toys and the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. At Mr. Taub's other building, where B. Altman did business in the 1870's and 80's, the J. Crew Group, a direct-mail and retail clothing concern, has offices.
North of B. Altman is the former Simpson, Crawford Store, No. 641. Perhaps its best known tenant is the architectural firm of Hellmuth Obata & Kassabaum, which moved to Ladies' Mile from Rockefeller Center in the mid-80's in search of lower rents and high, open loft floors.
On the east side of the avenue, more ambitious projects were envisioned, but only one - the New York Foundling Hospital, at 17th Street - has been realized.
In the late 80's, Tishman Speyer Properties proposed a 38-story midblock tower at the eastern end of the enormous old Siegel Cooper Store, between 18th and 19th Streets, and to restore the building at the same time. The architects were James Stewart Polshek & Partners of Manhattan.
As the project made its way through the review process at the landmarks commission last year, the tower was reduced to 29 stories, but this did little to appease the critics. ''It was way out of scale,'' said Margaret Moore, a leader in the drive to create the Ladies' Mile Historic District. ''And putting a skyscraper on top of a landmark is one of those things that the commission has never approved and - I hope - never will.''
The tower plan was withdrawn before the commission could vote on it. A scheme that would have added two stories to the Siegel Cooper building was approved ''in principle'' by the landmarks commission, Ms. Rozhon said, but nothing has come of that.
''We have great confidence in the building and in the long-term potential of the area,'' said Geoffrey Wharton, a managing director of Tishman Speyer, ''and when market conditions permit, we will initiate a development program.''
Confidence is also expressed by Fraydun Manocherian, who is the founder of the New York Health and Racquet Club and owner of a 40,000-square-foot lot on the east side of the avenue, between 22d and 23d Streets. But he has paved the parcel so that it can be used as a parking lot until the market improves.
''We've had interest from very major department stores, as well as other commercial users,'' Mr. Manocherian said, including a ''major'' hotel operation. He would not identify any of the interested parties. ''But at this particular time, because of the conditions that exist, without a major tenant, we would not go ahead.''
''I am pretty certain that in the decade we've just entered, Sixth Avenue will be all developed'' between Ladies' Mile and mid-Manhattan, Mr. Manocherian said. ''But when will it start? I really can't tell you.''

HEADLINE: Home Market Opening Doors For First-Time Purchasers

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
After years of sitting on the sidelines because of soaring housing costs and high interest rates, first-time home buyers in the New York region are finally getting a break. The relief, say bankers, brokers and the buyers themselves, is in lower prices, cost-cutting incentives offered by both builders and individual sellers and more flexible loan policies of mortgage lenders and insurers.
The National Association of Realtors reports that the median price of existing single-family homes in the metropolitan region has been declining steadily since it peaked at $183,800 in 1988. By the end of the first quarter of this year, the median price had fallen to $174,700. To afford a home at that price, the association has calculated, a family would need an annual income of $58,722. That is still far above the $30,867 median income of households in the region, but the lower prices have brought more families into the market.
Many builders are offering rent-to-buy programs that enable a family with insufficient savings for a conventional down payment to move into new housing and apply part of the rent to a purchase later. Other sellers are cutting their prices for first-time buyers because they are unencumbered by a house they have to sell and can close quickly on a purchase. 
And while mortgage interest rates, now hovering just above 10 percent, are not the relative bargains they were in late 1987 and early 1988, when average rates dipped to about 9.3 percent, neither are buyers stymied by the much higher rates that plagued the housing market in the early 80's.
''Things are easing up for first-time buyers,'' said Nicholas Rizzetta, senior vice president of the East River Savings Bank, which is based in New Rochelle, N.Y. ''We are seeing it in the number of mortgages we are making for this category of borrowers.''
Among those benefiting from the looser climate are Robert and Robyn Hakim, of Hartsdale, N.Y., who want to buy their first home, a two-bedroom apartment they now rent in a building about to be converted into a cooperative. Like many young people, they found that even with two incomes - Mr. Hakim is an accountant and his wife is an office manager - rent was so high that putting money aside for a down payment was all but impossible.
But the Hakims have been given preliminary approval for a mortgage from the East River Savings Bank that will allow them to buy the co-op apartment with no money down.
Even though most mortgages require a down payment of at least 5 percent of the purchase price, the bank can justify the 100 percent loan to the Hakims. First, as ''insiders'' they will pay $81,000 for an apartment expected to be appraised at about $125,000. Their credit rating is good and their monthly mortgage and maintenance payments will be only $105 more than the $975 a month they now are spending on rent.
''Even before you take into consideration the tax deduction of owning, which will be about $10,000 in our case,'' said Mr. Hakim, ''we are in a good position.''
While no lender claims to be making a record number of loans to first-time buyers, some banks and mortgage companies report that since the first of the year those borrowers have made up a higher percentage of all mortgages written.
At East River Savings, 35 percent of the bank's new mortgage business during the second quarter of this year was with first-time buyers. In the last quarter of 1989, the bank was writing only 15 percent of its new mortgages for first-time buyers.
The Dime Savings Bank of New York has seen a similar increase in business with first-time buyers. A survey the bank made last spring that included its own mortgages as well as a random sampling of mortgages by other lenders showed an increase of 20 percent since January.
A large part of the increase can be attributed to a significant decline in the number of other borrowers, including homeowners who want to trade up but cannot sell at a price they find acceptable. Still, many in the industry say there are more opportunities now for those looking to purchase their first homes than there have been in many years.
The East River Savings Bank, for example, will extend 100 percent financing to qualifying inside buyers in co-ops whose conversion plans pass the bank's requirements, and where residents are getting substantial price breaks. The bank has also recently changed its policy to allow up to 3 percent of a borrower's down payment to come from gifts.
East River is also one of several lenders that offer what amounts to a 93 percent mortgage by allowing borrowers to wrap up to 2 points, as well as the first year's mortgage insurance payment, into the loan amount.
Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, the country's largest private mortgage insurer, has raised its gift-money ceiling to 10 percent of the down payment for qualifying first-time buyers. The gift must come from immediate family members.
James Englehardt, regional director for the Northeast, said this change means that some borrowers would be able to take a 100 percent mortgage. Mortgage Guaranty's gift ceiling previously was 2 percent of the purchase price. Lenders and mortgage insurance companies often limit the amount in a down payment that can come from gifts because they have found that when even a small portion of the equity comes from the borrower's own pocket, default on the loan is less likely.
The underwriting policies of mortgage insurers like Mortgage Guaranty are critical to the cash-poor borrowers, who tend to be those buying homes for the first time. That is because virtually all loans for which the borrower's equity is less than 20 percent of the purchase price must carry public or private mortgage insurance against default. The annual premiums can be as high as 1 percent of the purchase price in the first years.
Dime Savings is developing a mortgage to ease the burden on parents who want to help their children clear the down-payment hurdle. The program, which is still in the planning stage, would allow interest-bearing instruments owned by the parents, like certificates of deposit and savings accounts, to serve as the equity on their children's loans.
Richard D. Parsons, the bank's president, said he hoped that the new program could be crafted in such a way that the parents could make a contribution without ''just turning cash over to the kids.''
Mr. Englehardt of Mortgage Guaranty said his company was also searching for ways to give a boost to the first-time buyer.
''The goal is to get more middle-income people into housing,'' he said, referring to the company's liberalized underwriting policies. ''Of course, we must make sure that the buyer has the resources to keep up once they get their loan. But we are working with lenders, public mortgage agencies and nonprofit housing groups to to make it a little easier for young families to buy homes.''
This flexibility, lenders and mortgage insurers readily acknowledge, is not motivated entirely by altruism. As the number of resales and new construction projects eases off, many lenders see the first-time buyers as a part of the market that can expand the demand for funds for several years to come.
''There is no question that the top end has fallen off,'' said Mr. Parsons, Dime's president, referring to residential loans in the $200,000-to-$400,000 range.
''We are also feeling the impact of the decline in new construction. As far as the future is concerned, I don't see any sign that things will turn around soon. So we have been doing a lot of planning to better serve the first-time buyer.''
This fall, as part of a program intended to draw first-time buyers, Dime will offer a series of free seminars on how to find and pay for a first home.
This increased respect for the money of the first-time buyer is not coming just from the mortgage industry.
''They are seen as valuable customers not only by the banks but by home sellers,'' said Edward Tonero, a broker with the Short Hills, N.J., office of Coldwell Banker, a residential brokerage. ''They aren't burdened with homes they have to sell so they are often in a good bargaining position because if they qualify for a mortgage, they can move fast.''
Robert and Suzanne Young, who recently moved into their new home - a three-bedroom Cape Cod in Madison, N.J. - got a good deal on their house because the relocation company handling the property for the previous owners was eager to make a fast sale.
''The owners paid about $230,000 in 1987,'' said Mr. Young, who works at National Westminister Bank in Manhattan. ''That was the first asking price and it was way out of our range.
''But by the time we saw it the people who lived there had already gone back to England and everybody was in the mood to negotiate. The price came down to $208,000. We could live with that.''
Even though the Hakims of Hartsdale are buying an apartment they already occupy, they are benefiting from Westchester County's softer real estate market. Mr. Hakim believes that the drop in prices there helped his building's tenant negotiators cut the price of shares for inside buyers from $850 to $613. The sponsor of the conversion plan has also agreed to give inside buyers cash payments to cover the cost of renovations.
Some first-time buyers are getting a leg up from Federal and state mortgage programs that were created to serve low- and moderate-income borrowers by providing low interest loans.
In March the State Mortgage Agency of New York, also known as Sonny Mae, made upward adjustments on the income limits and the purchase prices for borrowers in some districts, including the one that covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
In those counties, the income limits on Sonny Mae mortgages were increased to $46,000 for households of one or two people and to $64,000 for households of three or more.
Moreover, the ceiling on the purchase price of a single-family home on Long Island was raised to $152,000, from $128,000, for existing residences and to $182,300, from $152,300, for newly constructed homes.
The state mortgage agency is required by law to raise or lower its income and purchase price limits so that it keeps pace with regional fluctuations in the cost of living.
John N. Spano, the agency's vice president and director of single-family housing, said its monthly loan volume had nearly tripled since January. Mr. Spano said the agency was reserving about $1 million worth of home loans in January, while the amount put in reserve in June was $3.437 million.
''Another factor that has influenced the demand for our mortgages,'' said Mr. Spano, ''is the increase in interest rates. Whenever there is a pronounced spread between open market rates and ours, our volume increases.''
The current interest rate for a Sonny Mae mortgage for a 30-year fixed-rate instrument is 8.3 percent. That is about 2 percentage points below the rates for 30-year loans from private lenders, which currently range from 10.1 to 10.71.
Last March, the Federal National Mortgage Association - known as Fannie Mae -introduced a new type of loan which lenders say has been especially popular with first-time buyers. Dubbed the two-step, it is a 30-year loan for which the interest rate charged in the first seven years is lower than it is for the remaining 23 years.
''The two-step mortgage has helped put some of our customers in their homes,'' said Arthur Ciatta, an assistant vice president of East River Savings. ''Even though the break is less than one half of a percentage point, it can make a difference to the buyer on a budget. It lowers the payments in the first years, which are often the toughest for people starting out.''
Earlier this year, the Federal Housing Administration increased allowable purchase prices for homes it finances by nearly 25 percent, from $101,250 to $124,875. That upward adjustment, lenders said, had a considerable impact on buyers in the New York metropolitan area who for the most part had to skip the F.H.A. when shopping for a loan.
But the news was not all good for buyers contemplating an F.H.A. loan. The Government's mortgage insurance program has lost about $350 million in the last several years and is slipping further into debt. Some officials have predicted that without changes in its policies, the F.H.A. could be insolvent within 10 years.
The Senate recently passed legislation intended to shore up the troubled insurance program. It would raise the mortgage insurance premiums for Federal Housing Administration borrowers. The Senate proposal would require all borrowers to pay an upfront premium of 3.8 percent as well as a 0.5 percent risk-based premium for those making down payments of less than 10 percent. The House of Representatives is also considering legislation.
But Norman Lynn, president of the National Association of Realtors, a major trade group based in Washington that represents the residential brokerage community, said the proposed increase in the mortgage insurance premium would have a chilling effect on low- and middle-income buyers.
''Our major objection is that this proposal attacks the market exactly at the wrong place,'' said Mr. Lynn, who predicted that such a change would eventually have an impact on the resale market as well.
His organization supports proposed legislative changes through which the Housing and Urban Development Department would collect a lower one-time upfront fee of 1.35 percent of the loan from the borrower at closing, as well as an annual renewal fee of 0.5 percent, paid on the principal.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: 42d Street Redevelopment;
Picking Up the Pace of Preparing the Site

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
In the life of a longterm development project there are frustrating periods followed by bursts of progress. A condemnation order from a judge in April set off such a burst in the saga of New York City's effort to redevelop 42d Street from Times Square to Eighth Avenue.
The order gave the public title to eight acres of property with 34 parcels occupied by 250 businesses and a few individuals. Since then, closings or relocations have begun in earnest, although an appeal has been filed by the Durst Organization. The relocations are centered in the Times Square area, where new office construction is scheduled to start early next year.
The sight of it all gives the project a new credibility after seven years of controversy, planning and litigation, but also raises the question of its timing. Will the project's four million square feet of new space in four buildings overwhelm the midtown office market? In 14 newly built West Midtown buildings an estimated 5.5 million square feet of space is still unspoken for, and contraction in major industries that use Manhattan office space has gradually pushed up the vacancy rate. 
The project's supporters respond that the benefits of the project go beyond cyclical conditions in employment. They say the project will reclaim blighted 42d Street west of Times Square as the heart of Manhattan's theater and entertainment district and should thereby affect economic activity positively for decades to come.
Nine theaters are to be rejuvenated, and new entertainment uses may emerge on two vacant sites. An independent 42d Street Entertainment Corporation will be named to oversee the renovation of six of the old theaters and the development of the vacant sites.
The Nederlander Organization already has been awarded two other theaters, the Harris and the New Amsterdam.
Still further ahead lies the development of a trade mart and a hotel on the Eighth Avenue side of the site. In the more immediate future is a planned improvement of the Times Square subway station, for which the developers are paying 75 percent of the $100 million cost. The entire redevelopment site is 13 acres.
But in the real estate world it is the impact of the project on the office market that is the arresting question. The developer, a partnership of Park Tower Realty, of which George Klein is the principal, and the Prudential Insurance Company, has the advantage of a tax abatement that permits lower initial rents than builders on private sites could afford.
''It's insane to build subsidized office space when there is a huge oversupply,'' said Douglas Durst, a partner in the Durst Organization, a midtown developer that has long fought the Times Square project. ''It will be the ruination of midtown just as the Port Authority was the ruination of the downtown market.'' The allusion is to the 10 million square feet of space created by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the World Trade Center in the late 60's. A few major developers opposed the Trade Center at the time as oversized.
But that is probably a minority view, even among developers. The rejuvenation of 42d Street probably will boost the capacity of west midtown generally to draw office tenants, a major planning goal. ''It's not an overwhelming amount of space,'' said Franklin Speyer, a commercial broker with Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. ''And the timing bodes well.'' In the mid-90's, when the new Times Square space is ready for occupancy, few other new buildings will be coming on the market.
The larger question is what will be happening to white-collar employment growth in the 90's. Office leasing has been set back sharply by contraction in financial services and related industries.
Two years ago the real estate research department of Salomon Brothers, the investment firm, published a study forecasting a sluggish demand for office space through 1991. David Shulman, who did the study, said he ''doesn't see a lot of demand'' in the next two or three years. He considers Atlanta a significant competitor with New York for one sector where growth may occur, European-related trade and legal-services firms.
At Landauer Associates, the real estate consulting firm, there is greater cheer in the mid-90's forecast. Mr. Landauer notes that financial-services, insurance-related and real estate-related sectors tend to lose jobs in large numbers and gain them back in large numbers as well.
The current downtrend is a ''correction but not a structural change'' for the economy, Landauer says.
In any event, there are other midtown sites where developers are in a position to produce 13.3 million square feet of new office space, but will probably continue to hold off until demand rebounds.
The midtown market leased out about 18.3 million square feet of top-rated, or Class A, office space in 1989 and is expected to lease out at least that much this year, according to Cushman & Wakefield. By the time the Times Square space is available, nearly all of what is currently available in new buildings should be taken.
The first of the new Times Square buildings should be ready for occupancy in late 1993 or early 1994 and the others will follow rapidly. When two of the four office sites are cleared, the developer is obligated to begin construction within six months. One of the two sites is to be the one called the ''Crossroads'' site between Broadway and Seventh Avenue and 41st and 42d Streets. It is essential for the subway-station improvement, a four-year reconstruction that is due to begin next spring.
In the rebuilt station there will be a new 10,000-square-foot mezzanine level and a large rotunda with an elaborately designed ceiling fixture in a greatly expanded ''free'' zone before the customer pays a fare. It will connect all the office buildings. Instead of the current four tracks for the Grand Central shuttle (only three are used) there will be two, with a large platform between them. The shuttle platform will be extended so that a five-car train can operate. Currently the shuttle is a three-car train. The subway planning has been done as a joint venture of William Nicholas Bodouva & Associates and Vollmer Associates.
Most public attention has focused so far on the proposed design for the new office buildings, by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. Spokesmen for the development partners say that all designs so far have been preliminary. The task is to find a design that is neither stodgy nor glitzy, one that relates to Times Square and its entertainment function and yet appeals to the buildings' corporate users.
But at the Urban Development Corporation, the main immediate concern is relocation.
A large Nathan's restaurant on Broadway at 43d Street has closed. So has the Cineplex Odeon's Warner movie theater on Broadway and 42d Street. First Federal Savings and Loan has given up a retail space in 1457 Broadway, near 41st Street. Kentucky Fried Chicken has shut up shop on 42d Street near Seventh Avenue.
Upstairs the tenants are vacating, too. Thirty occupants have either moved or committed themselves to a move date, said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, the Urban Development Corporation subsidiary that is in charge of site preparation. The agency is also working with 30 more tenants who want to move.
''We have no legal obligation to do more than pay for the fixtures,'' said Rebecca Robertson, the subsidiary's president, ''but we're providing reasonable moving expenses and some relocation assistance.'' The 250 occupants received letters in June saying they would have to be out by Oct. 31.

HEADLINE: Returning Workers Trained for Real Jobs

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
A SIMPLE premise lies behind the Re-entry Program of the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce: people who have been out of the work force a long time need training that prepares them for available jobs. Since its inception in 1986, the program has trained 400 people, placed more than 90 percent of them in jobs and earned the trust of employers in Middletown and neighboring communities in Middlesex County. ''It has worked,'' said the program's director, Edmund J. Gubbins. The program is geared to, but not restricted to, older workers. This fall, it will be extended to 25 people - most of them on welfare - who live in subsidized housing in Middletown.
Dr. Gubbins, superintendent of schools in East Haddam during the 1970's and later an East Haddam selectman, also developed education programs for Connecticut prisons. He said he got the idea for the re-entry program after an East Haddam widow described to him her need to go back to work. Her skills were out of date, she said, she could not afford training on her own, and she did not qualify for government-paid instruction. 
 
Confidence and Skills
Dr. Gubbins said he figured that others faced similar problems, and he realized that little was available to aid them. He noticed especially that women who had long tended homes and families were often short of confidence as well as skills when they needed to find a job following a divorce or the death of a spouse, he said.
Dr. Gubbins approached the State Labor Department, citing the lack of state programs to help mature people re-enter the work force. He came away with a challenge: if he could develop a program, the state would provide the money for a pilot project.
In cooperation with the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Gubbins set out to arrange ''a marriage of the needs of business with the needs of people coming in,'' he said. He added that he was determined to provide ''training for jobs, not training for the sake of training.''
A study by the Department of Labor showed that Middlesex County's growing businesses needed people with clerical skills. Through Middlesex Community College, Dr. Gubbins set up a program offering courses like word processing, data processing, programming, general office procedures and one to alleviate math anxiety.
The pilot proved successful, and the program - promoted through brochures, the local media and word of mouth - has continued.Participants, who pay nothing for their training, are selected after testing and counseling by Dr. Gubbins and his staff. They take courses at the college or at the chamber office in Middletown, choosing only the courses they need and going at their own pace.
 
Some Young Participants
Most participants are 55 or older, but some younger people - including low-income single parents - have also taken part. The chamber provides space and pays staff salaries, the State Labor Department pays for the training, and Aetna Life and Casualty and Southern New England Telephone have provided grants for equipment and staff support. Dr. Gubbins said that the cost, about $1,200 for each participant, is considerably lower than the cost of programs at private business schools.
The participants receive informal counseling as they progress through the course work. One of the coordinators of the program, Elsie Snell, of Moodus, is also a graduate.
''I'm a model,'' said Mrs. Snell, who is in her 50's. She said that she knows how students feel when they face instructions like, ''Boot up the machine.'' She said: ''I tell them, 'It will come. Take it step by step.' '' Jobs await those who complete their training, because from the beginning many of the Middlesex chamber's approximately 1,400 members have committed themselves to hiring people from the program.
''In the beginning, the employers took a risk,'' said Larry McHugh, president of the chamber. ''But now, they're waiting in line for people.''
 
Loyal and Dependable
The employers agree with Dr. Gubbins that the program has worked. ''It's tremendous,'' said Joan Lee, senior vice president for human resources at the Farmers and Mechanics Bank in Middletown, where several graduates of the program now work. Mrs. Lee called them loyal and dependable.
''They have a good work ethic, and they've adapted very easily,'' she said. ''The re-entry program prepared them.''
Adele Riley, a recruiter for the Employee Benefits Division of Aetna in Middletown, said: ''The program gives people basic skills, and we can expand on that. It saves a corporation like us from training from ground zero. And the chamber is receptive to our needs.''
Graduates also vouch for the program. William Halligan, of Cromwell, 64 years old, said he had been job hunting for months when he learned of the re-entry training.
''I operated a business that fell on hard times,'' said Mr. Halligan, who is a violinist but said he needs more income than he earns from teaching and performing. He studied computers in the re-entry program. ''It's an excellent program,'' he said, noting that it led him to his job in the loan department of Farmers and Mechanics Bank.
Eleanor Waylock was a nurse for decades; now she is widowed and in her 70's. She came to the re-entry program because she sought part-time work that would be less strenuous than nursing and would augment her pension. In addition to the training, she said, she was helped by the support and friendship of teachers and fellow students.
''You need somebody to build up your morale, to say 'You can do it,' '' Mrs. Waylock said. Today she works part time at the office of Rayco Metals in Middletown.
 
'Takes a Lot of Work'
When other chambers express interest in the program, Dr. Gubbins and Mr. McHugh point out that its success is dependent on having employers committed to offering jobs.
''It takes a lot of work,'' Dr. Gubbins said. ''The sweater won't stay together unless you knit it.''
This fall, the re-entry program will offer a similarly designed program of courses - followed by jobs - geared to the needs of 25 people being recruited through tenant organizations in subsidized housing in Middletown. Dr. Gubbins and Mr. McHugh are working with employers and with government agencies to coordinate the project, which they called a way to get people off welfare rolls and into productive, satisfying work.
''It's going to take time,'' said Mr. McHugh. ''But we're going to go in there and attempt it.''

HEADLINE: Tax Increase: Challenges Amid the Furor

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
THE mounting grass-roots opposition to Gov. Jim Florio's tax package and school aid plan is posing difficult challenges for all sides involved in the intensifying debate.
For Mr. Florio, the growing protest threatens to raise the stakes of his bold gamble to be one of the nation's first governors to repudiate the Reagan economic policies and increase taxes - a risk made painfully clear by a recent poll showing a 19 percent decline in voter approval.
For the state's Democratic legislators, the opposition to the tax plan forces them deep into the cities and towns of their districts to sell the program to angry voters or risk losing the slender majority they now hold in the Legislature.
 
Debate Draws National Scrutiny
And for the organizers of the protest, the hundreds of thousands of signatures and the substantial support they have gathered may have given them a persuasive popular mandate that has no legal force.
Republicans, on the other hand, may be the only beneficiaries of the current uproar, needing only to ride the crest of taxpayer resentment and hope that its momentum can carry them through the 1991 legislative elections. That advantage could evaporate if the Governor's program proves successful. 
The debate is taking place under the scrutiny of Democratic and Republican leaders across the country, as state and Federal officials grapple with the increasing deficits that pose major economic challenges.
Mr. Florio's tax package includes an increase in the income tax rate for the state's wealthiest taxpayers, to 7 percent from 3.5 percent; an increase in the state sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent and inclusion of previously excluded items like toilet paper in the taxable category, and a school aid program that will gradually shift state funds from the more affluent school districts to the poorest ones.
In addition, administration officials have said that property tax rebates that will be paid to 1.3 million homeowners and 812,000 tenants will make up for income tax increases in all but about 20 percent of the cases.
''We want some say in our government, and we want it now,'' said John L. Budzash, the 36-year-old mail carrier who founded Hands Across New Jersey, the organization behind the tax protest. ''It seems that we've been lost in the shuffle of the politicians in this state.''
The group, organized by Mr. Budzash and six acquaintances only one month ago, has already collected more than 350,000 signatures protesting the tax increase and asking for the right to recall Mr. Florio from office. Mr. Budzash hopes to have one million signatures by the end of the summer.
In addition, the group's efforts are being indirectly enhanced by grumbling from other statewide organizations unhappy with the Governor's tax package.
The New Jersey state legislative committee of the American Association of Retired Persons, for example, which represents a majority of the state's 1.1 million elderly people, has said that thousands of retired low- and moderate-income homeowners living on fixed incomes might have to sell their homes because of increased property taxes resulting from the Governor's school aid formula.
 
Opposition on Teachers' Pension Shift
The New Jersey Education Association, the state's 134,000-member school employee union, vehemently opposed Mr. Florio's shifting of teachers' pension benefits from the state to local school districts, saying that local property taxes will ultimately have to be raised to cover the increasing cost of those benefits.
And the United Taxpayers of New Jersey, a coalition of more than 200 taxpayer groups across the state, now plans to step up its 15-year-old campaign to amend the State Constitution to allow referendum and recall, which is the right to remove an elected official from office by a public vote. That demand is also contained in the Hands Across New Jersey petition.
But most importantly, political scientists say, is the endorsement of the Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen, its 624,000 members still smarting from Mr. Florio's recent ban on assault rifles. The coalition has pledged its support and lobbying experience to Hands Across New Jersey.
''It's a distinct possibility,'' said George Sternlieb, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University and founder of its Center for Urban Policy Research, that the antitax forces now at work could maintain their momentum long enough to ''dynamite every Democrat in the legislative elections next year.''
In November 1991, every state legislator must stand for re-election. The Republicans, who are now in the minority, need only take three seats in the Senate and four in the Assembly to gain parity with the Democrats.
 
A Sense of Betrayal
Ordinarily, Mr. Sternlieb said, a tax increase so early in a legislative term might be forgotten by election time. But the depth of the current antitax sentiment, he said, combined with residents' sense of betrayal, could serve to maintain voter animosity through the 1991 elections.
And voters' memories are certain to be enhanced, he said, by the involvement of the Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen.
''Those guys know how to do business,'' Mr. Sternlieb said. ''They know how to reach people; they know how to do direct mail.''
That, combined with the thousands of names and addresses that Hands Across New Jersey is daily pumping into its computers, he said, assures the alliance a prominent voice in the 1991 elections.
Mr. Florio, Mr. Sternlieb said, has a problem, but that is less a problem of substance than one of perception. The Governor's program, he said, is basically sound, but the payoff lies 5 to 10 years in the future.
 
'Promising Future Wonders'
''The Governor's problem is that he's promising future wonders at the cost of present pain,'' Mr. Sternlieb said. ''The electorate isn't used to that.''
State Senator Gabriel M. Ambrosio, Democrat of Lyndhurst, said the most difficult aspect of explaining the tax package to residents was not the complexity of the plan itself, but cutting through the amount of attention from news organizations that the protest group has aroused.
''The press is only telling half the story,'' he said. ''It's only telling the bad news half. But the good news half is that over 80 percent of the people in this state are not going to pay more taxes.'' Any income tax increase paid, he said, will ultimately be returned as property tax relief.
But if that is the message Mr. Florio has to get across to voters, it seems that he is going to have to work a little harder.
 
Poll Finds Dissatisfaction
A recent poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, commissioned by The Star-Ledger of Newark, found that 80 percent of the New Jersey residents surveyed were dissatisfied with Mr. Florio's tax program. And only 23 percent believed that he was doing a ''good'' or ''excellent'' job as Governor - 19 percent fewer than in a similar poll taken in March. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
But Mr. Florio has said he plans to wage a campaign of his own to bring his case to public. ''They say there's a tax revolt in New Jersey,'' he said recently. ''Well, there is - and I'm leading it.''
If Mr. Florio's tax plan works, Mr. Sternlieb said, ''he's going to look like a million bucks going into the 1991 elections.''
Mr. Sternlieb added that since Mr. Florio ''has basically exaggerated the size of the deficit,'' he would probably be able to cut taxes in 1992.
 
Immediate Repeal Sought
But organizers of Hands Across New Jersey would rather not wait until 1992 to find out. Their petition includes demands for the immediate repeal of the tax increase, an independent audit of the state's current financial condition, a rollback of ''unreasonable'' salary increases and the right to recall Mr. Florio.
But despite the vast number of supporters the group has attracted, and notwithstanding the other statewide organizations that are protesting the tax package, residents will most likely have to wait to vent their frustration in the voting booth. Even if Hands Across New Jersey meets its goal of one million signatures, political experts say, the petition has no binding effect.
''It doesn't mean a thing,'' Mr. Sternlieb said. ''It has no legal standing.''
The reason, he said, is that the State Constitution does not provide for initiative and referendum, the process whereby voters can place specific questions or issues on the ballot by petition.
Approximately half the states have such a provision in their state statutes or constitutions. The most commonly cited example of initiative and referendum is California's Proposition 13, in which a successful 1978 voter initiative limited increases in property taxes.
 
Bill Died in State Senate
Last year, the New Jersey Assembly passed an initiative and referendum bill that would have required an amendment to the Constitution, but that bill later died in the State Senate.
And though some Republican lawmakers have resurrected the possibility of initiative and referendum in light of the Hands Across New Jersey drive, most political experts believe that such a measure could be passed only by the majority party. And the majority party, they say, typically has the most to lose by allowing initiative and referendum.
''You can ask a politician to do anything but commit political suicide,'' Mr. Sternlieb said.
Gerald M. Pomper, professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute, said initiative and referendum might not be as beneficial as imagined.
''We have a representative form of government with a process that allows for negotiation,'' he said. ''Initiative and referendum may be good in some cases, but the trouble is that they're just yes or no propositions.'' As a result, he said, questions placed on the ballot by public acclamation might result in simplistic solutions to difficult problems.
But residents, he said, can and do influence their elected officials even without resorting to the ballot box. In 1935, for example, a sales tax that had been adopted by the Legislature was repealed four months later as the result of protests by taxpayers.
 
Freeholders Acting
Indeed, officials in several New Jersey counties with Republican majorities on their Freeholder boards are giving their electorate the opportunity to send a message to legislators a year before the 1991 elections.
In Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Sussex Counties, and perhaps others, voters will be allowed in this November's election to vote on a nonbinding referendum ''decrying the disastrous effects of Governor Florio's tax package,'' in the words of the referendum measure.
Although the vote, like the petition, has no legal consequence, it is intended to ''send a message loud and clear'' to the Governor, said Charles J. O'Dowd, chairman of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders.
''Some people feel that it's an act of futility,'' he said. ''But if there is one thing that even a governor understands, it's votes. And that's the exact purpose of it - to send a message in votes.''
Susan Vetere, a Clark Township resident who recently signed the Hands Across New Jersey petition, is also hopeful of getting her message across to Trenton.
''It's sort of like bailing out the seashore,'' she said. ''But I just feel in my heart of hearts that they have to hear us; somebody down there has to hear us and they have to do something.''

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
''Herein lies the tragedy of all the age: not that men are poor - all men know something of poverty; not that men are wicked - who is good? Not that men are ignorant - what is truth? Nay, but that men know so little of men.'' - W. E. B. DuBois.
IT is just after 7 on a muggy summer's night. Instead of playing ball, watching television or hanging around careless about time, nine young men and women from hard cities around New Jersey are inside a suburban dorm room discussing how men can know more than just a little of men. 
They are told by their teacher that in order to have a relationship of value, you must first know yourself.
''You cannot hide from yourself,'' she tells them. ''You have to be open.''
The nine students in the room are members of minorities who have been selected for an unusual project called the W. E. B. DuBois Scholars Program at William Paterson College. In the three years since it began, the program has garnered high praise for its unusual approach and farsighted commitment.
''Given the national need for a mosaic of thinkers, scientists and artists, they are attempting to not waste any human resources,'' said Dr. William M. Phillips Jr., a professor emeritus of sociology at Rutgers University, who has watched the DuBois program since its inception.
This year, 47 African-American and Hispanic-American high school students with good grad a and bright futures from public and private schools around the state are spending five weeks at the college furthering their academic skills and learning how to be leaders.
The purpose of the program is simple, though in some ways it flies in the face of common wisdom. For what the DuBois program aims to do is solve some of society's intractable problems of poverty, urban decay and disintegrating families, not by attacking the problem but by strengthening the solution.
What this means, for instance, is that instead of working to get another drug-treatment program established in Jersey City, the program takes a high-achieving student like 16-year-old Derrick James and helps him find the encouragement, self-awareness and confidence to become a leader of his community, raising up an example others can follow.
''At this age I can be very influential in solving the problems in Jersey City,'' said Mr. James, his level, serious tone belying his age. ''Being knowledgeable helps you to talk to other people.'' Mr. James is completing his second summer as a DuBois scholar. In order to have been invited back, he had to improve his grades (now mostly A's and a few B's) and get involved in a community project at home.
To meet that requirement, Mr. James revived a peer leadership group at his school, Synder High, one of the toughest of Jersey City's tough schools. In the group, he helped relay to others what he had learned about himself and about being black. The effort culminated in a Pride Day at the school, with an address by the Mayor of Jersey City and a parade.
Such activities carry special weight on the hopeless streets of Jersey City's Greenville section, where Mr. James lives with his mother, a single parent. There, he said, pride is hard to find.
Mr. James's experience underscores the most important parts of the DuBois program: self-esteem, leadership and a sense of duty.
''Even if I did someday move out of Jersey City, I wouldn't completely forget about it,'' said Mr. James, who plans to own his own business, preferably in the field of communications. ''One of my goals in life is to make something of myself and then give back something to my community.''
The lesson here is one that has been applied, successfully, to urban problems of a different sort. When developers move into a shattered city, they generally start not by rebuilding an old tenement in the worst, most devastated slum, only to watch it become engulfed once more by the tide of decay. Rather, they seek out the strongest part of the weakened community, the area that with help can be made whole enough to stabilize and, in time, spread its healing into the rest of the community.
This, explained Dr. Sherle L. Boone, director and founder of the DuBois Scholars program, is essentially the philosophy of W. E. B. DuBois, the noted black historian, scholar and author. Dr. Boone, a professor of psychology at William Paterson, said he started the program because he felt that society had forgotten how to heal itself.
''We have tended to look at addressing problems by going to those who are victims,'' he said. ''Doing that, we've largely ignored those who ought to be the solvers of the problems.''
During the five weeks of the institute, the DuBois students live on the Paterson campus in Wayne and go through a rigorous schedule of advanced courses in psychology, calculus, economics and African history. They read DuBois. They write a thesis. After dinner each night they attend self-esteem workshops intended to help them discover who they are at the time in their lives when the answer might seem most confused.
Since the program is only three years old, and the first participants are just entering colleges like Cornell, Georgetown and Purdue, it is too early to measure how effectively the DuBois scholars have been instilled with the spirit of leadership.
But the blooming of the students' self-esteem is evident. ''In a way I just feel really good about myself,'' said Maribel Bueno, a 16-year-old junior from Paterson. ''I do.''
In their own classrooms, students like Miss Bueno are often the only serious students, and sometimes they feel like aberrations. But in the summer they get to meet dozens of hard-working minority youths. Seeing that, they realize they are not alone.
Miss Bueno and Mr. James are good students, at the top of their classes. Even without the DuBois program they would be doing well. They have the support of encouraging parents, and they have tasted the first bubbles of success.
Mr. Boone said he knew when he started the program that some people would criticize it, calling it elitist because it skips over the disadvantaged in favor of those who already have considerable talent. He sees it differently. ''Our concern here is a very selfish one for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans,'' he said. ''We want the very best minds. That's the bottom line. It has nothing to do with wealth or privilege.''
One of the DuBois faculty, Douglas Evans, a professor of communications, put it in a different perspective. ''There are Grotons, Deerfield Academies, Exeters,'' he said. ''We, as the black community, have limited access to them. But we do have W. E. B. DuBois.''

HEADLINE: Getting Close to Nature in Montana More Women Gaining Entry To Boardroom

BYLINE:  By ANDREW H. MALCOLM; ANDREW H. MALCOLM is national affairs correspondent of The New York Times. By JOAN M. LANG

 BODY:
ACCORDING to a treasured adage in the American West, Montana is what America was. And nowhere does that natural beauty and spirit better exist than in Glacier National Park, a one-million-acre pocket of purity tucked into the northwest corner hard by Canada. Glacier's awe-inspiring alpine vistas are easy to get to but hard to forget. The severity of its mountain geography and its location, slightly off the usual over-traveled Western park trek, have in a wonderfully quiet way helped preserve Glacier from the hordes of Winnebagos, trailers and over-burdened station wagons that clog the roadways at places like Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons. Because of weather conditions, the upper reaches of the park usually do not open until June and the lower portions in April, but now is the time to plan a visit, since accommodations are limited and reservations often necessary. 
Although Glacier is the 10th most visited of the 50 national parks, few of its 1.8 million visitors would ever know it. Most confine themselves to the park's lone paved highway, the marvelously named Going to the Sun Road, which clings precariously to the high-altitude rockfaces. While Glacier and its surrounding area have a vast array of attractions, both natural and manmade, to satisfy the most varied tastes of any family (even one containing teen-agers), this is not a park for city dwellers who need their nature safely canned and neatly labeled along obvious paths packed sidewalk-hard by the soles of thousands of designer hiking shoes.
Because Glacier is adjacent to Canada's Waterton Lakes National Park, another 203 square miles of pristine landscape, it also has the distinction of being the world's first international peace park. Everything from hiking trails to nature studies are coordinated between the two countries.
The mountains on both sides of the Montana-Alberta border were formed by seabeds being thrust up about 100 million years ago. The park came somewhat later, being formed by Congress just 80 years ago. But nature is obviously still in charge. Glacier is one of the few places where wolves and grizzly bears roam freely. Remote forest fires can burn for weeks, untouched by man, as the woods methodically cleanse themselves of decades of accumulated brush and simultaneously stimulate new life. More than four dozen groaning glaciers live at the higher altitudes, packing this year's snows on top of those from 10,000 years ago and moving their icy masses another inch or two down a mountainside.
Even where man intrudes with a road, nature controls the traffic. The 50-mile-long Going to the Sun Road, which took 12 years of hand picking and blasting to build in the 1920's and 30's, must close each mid-October. In April crews begin the two-month process of removing the 60-foot-deep snowdrifts so that family cars can struggle through by late June, their carburetors coughing and their Instamatics clicking.
If a day is all the traveler can spare, the highway alone is worth a detour for its mountain vistas, its wildlife and its wildflowers, which make up for the short summer by their explosion of vivid colors. The road's grade and the park's vehicular length restrictions (30 feet maximum) largely confine the traffic to vehicles that can handle the arduous climb. For those who don't drive, there are bus excursions in both directions over the highway.
Horseback riding is available, though guides are required. There is fishing everywhere, and private boats are permitted on most park waters. Additionally, there are regular boat excursions on the lakes; especially popular is the $5 hourlong evening cruise from the Lake McDonald Lodge to watch the spectacular mountain sunsets of pink and yellow and deep blue, which this far north and west come well after 10 o'clock on midsummer nights.
But Glacier is a park that invites exploration on foot. There are more than 750 miles of subtly marked trails for short strolls or more demanding two-week sojourns into solitude. In keeping with the spirit of freedom in Montana, which did not have a state speed limit until the mid-1970's, back-country rules are blessedly few and common sensical. No pets. No guns. No vehicles. Register your itinerary with the ranger (for your own safety, not his curiosity). If camping, get the required overnight permit. And watch out for bears. ''Remember,'' one park brochure advises humans, ''you are the visitor.''
WILDLIFE encounters are, in fact, one of Glacier's major attractions - and dangers. Deer, moose, elk, mountain goats, eagles and, rarely, gray wolves can be seen, or heard. So, too, can bears, which can be exciting and sometimes fatal. A photographer was killed in Glacier three years ago when a mother bear decided he was too close to her cubs.
Like muggings in urban parks, such events feed fear and inspire caution (make lots of noise when hiking, never store food in a tent, avoid dead animals and don't wear fragrant cosmetics in the woods). If you do encounter a bear, advises one helpful pamphlet, keep calm, look for a tree, watch for aggressive behavior (woofing or chomping of jaws, for instance, is reason for concern) and back away slowly. ''When you are out of sight,'' suggests the booklet, ''retreat more rapidly. At this point, seriously consider abandoning your trip.''
More common than encounters with bears are meetings with marmots, memorable little furry folk who resemble chubby gophers. Few of these brassy creatures know enough to fear humans. So they emerge at any time close by to sit up and utter their distinctive loud whistle, as if hailing a taxi when, in fact, they are requesting a piece of your lunch. Humans are forbidden to feed park wildlife although few marmots are prosecuted for theft of unattended sandwiches.
Adults may be more impressed by rounding a trail corner to come upon a view of a breathtaking drop of several thousand feet and rugged, two-mile-high mountains stretching to the horizon. But simple wildlife encounters seem to be the stuff of significant memories for many youngsters. The pilfering marmot. The curious fawn. The migrating Monarch butterfly that tags along with some hikers for an hour or more. Or the hummingbird that falls in love with a little girl's red shirt, so much so that he hovers by her shoulder while the two worlds peer at each other for a full minute.
Glacier is also home to Granite Park and Sperry Chalets, two hostelries built far from any road. Supplies ride in for six or seven miles on mules or horses; humans hike. Rooms, which are available from July 1 to Labor Day for about $50 a night, are simple, comfortable and private with candles provided for light. All meals are also provided, including sack lunches for individual hikes when hikers are sometimes shadowed by curious, bearded white mountain goats. Reservations within the park are a must months in advance.
For those requiring less austere accommodations, park concessionaires offer more than 700 rooms at several lodges from about June 1 through the first week of September. Prices range from about $20 for two in a one-bedroom cabin without bath at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn to $116 for a two-room suite at the Many Glacier Motel. Rates for the 81 rooms at the grand old gabled Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Park, Alberta, range from $70 for one to $128 for a suite for two. High tea is served every afternoon, British style, overlooking the mountains surrounding Waterton Lake.
Additionally, there are numerous motels of varying size and quality in communities just outside the park like West Glacier, Columbia Falls, Whitefish and Kalispell. With the area's growing popularity, reservations are fast becoming advisable outside the park as well in the summer.
Local highways, namely U.S. 2, provide the usual array of commercial attractions from chain food stops to go-kart tracks, waterslides and whitewater float trips. Secluded dude ranches are also available nearby. But Whitefish is fast developing a reputation for its clothing and gift shops. They are busiest during the Thanksgiving-to-April ski season at the adjacent mammoth Big Mountain Resort, with 45 runs the largest of Montana's rapidly growing ski spots. The chairlift is also open in the summer for rides to the Summit Restaurant, which offers spectacular views. Summer lift tickets are $7, $5 for children.
Although Glacier Park's main through highway is closed by mid-October, the road remains open at lower levels for needle noters, the Rocky Mountain equivalent of New England's leaf peepers - people who wander the roads every autumn admiring the foliage.
Typically, evergreens are just that, because they shed only a fraction of their needles every year. But the mountain larch is a different sort. It sheds all its needles every fall, which helps make a lot of soil for future generations of trees. But before falling, each of the billions of needles turn a variety of brightly colored yellow and red and gold, dotting the vast mountainsides with a last splash of brilliant color before the long white winter.
By late fall the kokanee salmon are spawning in Glacier's rivers and streams. As if by appointment, eagles appear, according to the park's natural rhythm of life and death, closely followed by a few wily tourists with telephoto lenses on their cameras. The tourists sit in their warm cars with the windows open. The majestic birds sit high up in the bare trees, their bright white heads turning sharply, watching for that telltale flash of white that signals that another salmon has spawned and expired and floated to the surface, belly up, to become part of the food cycle.
In April, about the time the crews start trying to clear the park's mountainous highway, the baby salmon emerge from the gravel. Not long afterward they are swiftly swimming downstream beneath the highway bridges, which by then are carrying migrating hordes of tourists back into Glacier National Park.
 
ROAD CONDITIONS, LODGINGS AND SUMMER COURSES ON WOLVES AND BEARS
 
When to Go
The Going to the Sun Road is usually not passable at higher elevations until mid or late June, but lower regions of Glacier National Park are open year round, especially at West Glacier, where 12 miles of the road (to the head of Lake McDonald) are kept plowed to provide access for cross-country skiers. Other roads are allowed to ''snow themselves in,'' said a park ranger, and become usuable as the snow melts. Call park headquarters (406-888-5441) for details on road conditions and other information.
 
Getting There
The park can be reached by flying into Glacier International Airport in Kalispell, Mont., which is served by affiliates of Northwest, Delta, United and Alaska airlines. Amtrak's Empire Builder, which runs between Chicago and Seattle and Portland, Ore., serves the park on a daily schedule.
 
Where to Stay
Accommodations in Glacier Park's Many Glacier Hotel, the Lake McDonald Lodge and the three inns - the Village Inn, the Rising Sun Motor Inn and the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn - are booked well in advance. From October to mid-May, get in touch with Glacier Pak Inc., Greyhound Tower, Station 1210, Phoenix, Ariz. 85077; 602-248-6000; from mid-May to late September, the address is East Glacier Park, Mont. 59434, and the phone number is 406-226-5551. Reservations require one night's deposit in advance.
Reservations for the Sperry and Granite Park Chalets can be made year round through Belton Chalets, Box 188, West Glacier, Mont. 59936. The phone, 406-888-5511, is operational from April to October. Rates for 1989 were $50 a person a night including three meals, $44 for children under 12.
During the summer the phone number for the Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, is 403-859-2231. After mid-September reservations are handled through the same numbers as the American park's hotels.

A SEAT on a board of directors has always been one of the ultimate signs of achievement. Increasingly, the doors to the boardrooms of major corporations and foundations have been swinging open to admit women.
Moreover, the role of women on boards has been changing. In the 1970's, the small number of women who were invited to sit on a board were often asked to do so for the sake of appearance. Well-known and highly visible, these women were active in nonprofit organizations or in government, or they were major shareholders. But over the last decade, as women have entered the corporate world in larger numbers, they have had the opportunity to wield influence on the boards of major corporations.
''It's really the logical progression as a woman moves into top management,'' said Beth Bronner, a senior vice president and general manager of the shop division of the Haagen-Dazs Company in Teaneck and the highest-ranking woman at the ice cream manufacturer and retailer. In addition, for the last two years she has served on the board of MasterMedia Limited, a New York-based publishing company. ''As we progress as individuals,'' she said, ''we need to find new ways of affecting policy, and being on the board is an excellent way to do that.''
Today, women are being selected to fill board seats in much the same way as men: on the basis of expertise. As more organizations begin to expand the strategic role of their boards, more women are being sought for their specific skills and contributions. Yet because women as a whole have not achieved equal representation among the ranks of executives, female board members tend to be younger and at earlier stages in their careers than their male counterparts.
And while an increasing number of companies and foundations are actively seeking women to fill board positions, many people involved in women's issues believe that it will be years before women are fully represented on boards.
''Women have made tremendous professional strides, but it's going to take another 10 to 20 years before they truly attain equality in the workplace,'' said Patricia Harrison, president of the National Women's Economic Alliance, a nonprofit organization formed in 1983 to help women develop more career and economic opportunities.
Women will constitute about two-thirds of new entrants to the work force from 1985 to the year 2000, according to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Currently they account for about half of the work force, or about 57 million, and as the workplace becomes more integrated, it is expected that the proportion of women in management will begin to increase at a faster rate.
In 1989, 59 percent of Fortune 1,000 companies had women on their boards, compared with 36 percent in 1979 and just 11 percent in 1973, according to the 1990 Board of Directors study, which is conducted annually by Korn/Ferry International, a New York City-based executive recruitment concern.
According to Directorship, a consulting organization based in Westport, Conn., there are 30 Fortune 1,000 companies with headquarters in New Jersey, and 28 women holding seats on their boards. Several companies, including Merck & Company, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and C.P.C. International, have more than one female director.
Nationwide, Directorship says, women hold 693 board positions, or nearly 7 percent of the 10,199 seats on the 818 public companies on the Fortune 1,000 list.
''There is no doubt that gaining a position on the board is a more efficient route to establishing a power base,'' said Arlene Johnson, the director of work force programs for the Conference Board, a New York City-based global resource organization for corporations. ''It's easier for a company to bring a woman onto its board than it is to integrate its senior management staff. Advancing through the ranks takes a long time, and the cooperation and commitment of all the people involved are essential.''
 
Actively Seeking Women
Today, many companies are actively seeking female board members. Dr. Carolyne K. Davis serves on the boards of four companies, including the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Merck, and says she believes that in every instance their chief executives were making deliberate attempts to bring a woman onto the board.
''They had made up their minds to have a woman director and were vigorously seeking women candidates,'' Dr. Davis said. ''That gave me an added advantage.''
Which is not to say that sex was the only criterion. As head of the Health Care Financing Administration until 1985, Dr. Davis ran the nation's Medicare and Medicaid programs, and today she is national and international health care adviser to Ernst & Young, a Washington-based accounting company with more than 700 clients in the health care field.
Expertise in a field has become a primary means for an invitation onto a board. Zoe Coulson, the first female corporate vice president in the area of consumer marketing at the Campbell Soup Company, was asked to join the board of Rubbermaid Inc. eight years ago on the strength of that experience.
''At the time, Rubbermaid was beginning to see the potential in the marketplace for all kinds of new consumer products, and I was invited to join because of my background in that area,'' she said. ''I've been in marketing since before they even called it marketing.''
Ms. Coulson's position as vice president for consumer issues at Campbell was eliminated this spring during reorganizing.
 
Variations in Experience
Some people involved in women's issues, however, say companies are willing to relax their standards somewhat in order to have a woman as director.
''Companies are looking for directors who have specific functional experience, people who have demonstrated their effectiveness in running a company or large division, but they are also looking for women,'' said Gardner Heidrick, chairman of Heidrick Partners, a Chicago-based national executive search company. ''And not that many women have achieved the status of C.E.O. Most women are still in staff positions, and many companies are willing to accept a lower level of functional responsibility in order to bring a woman onto the board.''
For this reason, Mr. Heidrick said, the typical female board member tends to be both younger and lower on the corporate ladder than her male counterpart.
''It's true: there aren't that many high-level women out there,'' said Marianne Alfano, president of Executive Women of New Jersey, a professional organization that sponsors a biennial Salute to the Policy Makers program to honor women who sit on the boards of corporations and foundations with offices in New Jersey. Proceeds from the awards dinner benefit a scholarship fund that supports women who are pursuing graduate degrees while working full time, or who are returning to school after spending time in the workplace.
 
Serving With Nonprofit Groups
It is considered easier for women - or men, for that matter - to get on the board of a nonprofit organization, and many women are advised to begin their entry into the boardroom by first serving on a nonprofit board.
''The nonprofits are excellent training grounds, and they afford tremendous visibility,'' said Dr. Marilyn Machlowitz, executive director of the Corporate Board Resource of Catalyst, a New York City-based research and advisory organization geared to women in the business world. The mission of the 13-year-old organization is to work with chief executive officers to help place qualified women on boards.
Barbara Roberts, the chairwoman of the directors' resource committee of the Financial Women's Association of New York, an organization dedicated to the professional development of women, said there was a natural progression at work regarding board membership.
''Younger women, women in their 20's and early 30's, can learn how boards function and establish valuable contacts on nonprofit boards,'' she said. ''Later, they can move on to local government boards and then into the boardrooms of public companies.''
Like other groups, the directors' resource committee maintains data banks of qualified female board candidates and makes the information available to chief executive officers.
 
Corporate Transition Eyed
Dr. Brenda Davis is trying to make just such a transition into the corporate boardroom. She currently serves on the board of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, a statewide philanthropic fund, as well as on the board of the State Urban Development Corporation. Now a visiting fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and Internal Affairs at Princeton University, Dr. Davis was for four years Gov. Thomas H. Kean's chief of policy and planning, and her knowledge of state issues covers the areas of health, human services and the environment.
Yet despite these qualifications, she said she felt that her lack of experience in the private sector had so far blocked her in her attempts to gain a seat on a corporate board.
''Perhaps I'm restricted because many companies in the state already have their requisite women on the board, and they want additional women members to be from the ranks of business, not academia or government,'' she said. ''Or perhaps I'm still too young,'' said Dr. Davis, who is 41.
Yvonne Shepard, division manager for new business development in consumer communications services at A.T. & T., was recently named to the board of the $30 million A.T. & T. Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the communications company. She said she was appointed to the board because she is both Puerto Rican and a woman - which makes her a ''two-fer,'' in executive search parlance.
''The company had made a conscious effort to add representation of both Hispanics and women, and I am the only Hispanic woman on the foundation's board,'' Ms. Shepard said. ''I have taken it upon myself to help effect change for minorities and women through the activities of the foundation, and I suspect that that is one of the reasons the foundation asked me to sit on its board. And it is a wonderful place to influence policy - even though it's not the board of A.T. & T. itself.''
 
Special Role as Mentors
Many women who are board directors do indeed see a special role for themselves as mentors and advocates for younger women within the organization and the community at large. Irene Kramer, a practitioner of naturopathic medicine, has served on the board of the First National Bank of Toms River since 1976 - one of the first women in New Jersey to sit on the board of a for-profit organization. During that time, she has worked with a number of women within the bank to help them advance.
''I see that as a very important role for women like me,'' she said. ''Several of my male colleagues have commented to me that they expected it to be strange to sit across the board table from a woman, and then found that not to be the case at all. And I'm delighted by that.''
In addition to providing their management and functional expertise, many women say they feel that they add something ''different'' to the mix simply because they are women.
''C.E.O.'s and board chairmen are realizing that women offer a tremendous pool of untapped talent, one that can make different but highly valuable contributions to an organization,'' Ms. Harrison said. ''Women can bring as much to the board as men can from the point of view of the experience, along with their own unique perspective.
''The real issue over the next decade is going to be how rapidly and how successfully women can move into the ranks of top management. Until that happens, organizations will continue to have to make a conscious attempt to place women on their boards, rather than simply finding the best candidate for the position, male or female.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 12, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 22 about an increase in the number of women on corporate boards misstated the age of Catalyst, a research and advisory organization for women in the business world. Catalyst is 28 years old; its Corporate Board Resource service, which helps place women on boards, is 13 years old. LEAD: ACCORDING to a treasured adage in the American West, Montana is what America was. And nowhere does that natural beauty and spirit better exist than in Glacier National Park, a one-million-acre pocket of purity tucked into the northwest corner hard by Canada. Glacier's awe-inspiring alpine vistas are easy to get to but hard to forget.

HEADLINE: Some Points On Affordable Housing

 BODY:
The article ''Effort on Affordable Housing Is Falling Short of Goal'' (May 27) provided an excellent update on the status of affordable housing in New Jersey. With due respect to the tireless efforts of many builders, nonprofit organizations, the Council on Affordable Housing and the State Division of Housing Development, I would like to point out the following.
* If the central concern is to increase the supply of affordable housing, attention needs to be focused away from new construction and toward rehabilitation of existing structures. In New Jersey, where many of the older towns and cities have abandoned buildings and neighborhoods, much can be done to turn them into lively places for people. Economic incentives for rehabilitation, technical assistance, streamlining of zoning and building regulations and other actions may accelerate the supply of affordable housing much more rapidly than new construction. 
* For the first-time home buyers, two big obstacles are the ability to qualify for a mortgage and the down payment. Employer assistance as well as innovative financing techniques can certainly help in removing these obstacles.
* While many builders are looking for innovative and efficient methods of building construction, very little has changed in the way the buildings are built today. With the exception of modular building systems used by some of the builders, the building methods remain conventional and costly. Investment in research and experimentation are critical in the building industry.
* Participation of homeowners in some aspects of home design and construction is necessary for developing appropriate forms of housing units as well as for giving the homeowners an opportunity to personalize their homes. The sweat equity in the construction process would reduce costs and improve livability.
* While family living is a key reason for owning a home, the demographic trends suggest newer forms of households or families, like single parents, married couples without children, unmarried couples living together, elderly couples, the single elderly, the disabled and so on. The demographic trends also suggest a change in life style from being home-centered to work-centered. Designs of homes and neighborhoods as well as financing techniques need to respond to these changing trends.

HEADLINE: David's Island Impasse Linked to Public Access

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
THE failure of the developers of David's Island in New Rochelle to grant meaningful public access to the exclusive residential community they planned was a major factor in the decision by state officials last week to reject the project.
That impression was underlined by Gail S. Shaffer, New York's Secretary of State, both in an interview and in a 17-page letter she sent to Gordon Marshall, a partner of Xanadu Properties Associates, the developers. The letter was sent after Mr. Marshall sought to nullify her planned rejection by withdrawing Xanadu's pending application a day before the state planned to announce its decision.
 
Plan Is to Be 'Revised and Resubmitted'
Mr. Marshall, in a brief notice released on Monday, said the application would be ''revised and resubmitted as soon as possible'' with ''additional information.'' He provided no details, but an examination of the objections raised by the state indicated that it would be no small matter to provide the changes necessary for certification. 
The proposal includes 1,750 condominiums in four 31-story apartment towers, an 800-slip marina for island residents and a 29,300-square-foot helicopter pad extending into Long Island Sound. In addition there would be a 3,465-foot-long private bridge - 10 feet longer than the Brooklyn Bridge - that would span New Rochelle Harbor, part of Glen Island and two navigational channels.
This was a revision of Xanadu's original offering, which included one 50-story and two 35-story residential towers. The first version also included a crescent-shaped beach on the island's eastern shore for island residents but no beach access for nonresidents. Since then, as the official state report puts it, ''The applicant has offered a tiny public esplanade adjacent to parking garages and the island's sewage-treatment plant.''
 
A Search for Meaningful Concessions
The withdrawal of the application, just before it was to have been turned down, was the second such action by Mr. Marshall in three years. In August 1987, also facing rejection by Albany, he pulled back the original plan to make changes. But these changes were called ''minimal'' by Ms. Shaffer.
The project, which was approved by New Rochelle in April and by the city's Office of Development in June, would provide an estimated $28 million in property taxes each year, half to the school district and the other half divided almost evenly between the city and the county, according to the plan's sponsors.
This has encouraged the support of city officials and many residents, who have seen virtually no increase in the assessed value of property in New Rochelle over the last decade. During that period, the school budget doubled and the city budget rose by nearly 40 percent.
The developers have said the island's projected 3,700 residents would pay 30 percent of the city's tax bill. In addition, the sale of condominiums would generate $100 million in state sales taxes.
That first withdrawal of the project's application was followed by meetings between the developer and Ms. Shaffer's office ''but throughout the process there has been no willingness on the developer's part to make any meaningful concessions to public access and to other concerns we have raised,'' Ms. Shaffer said.
''In withdrawing it this time, he said our reasons for rejecting the application were 'vague,' '' Ms. Shaffer said. ''Since that's how he felt, I thought it was incumbent upon us to clarify to him what was wrong.'' The 17-page letter, she said, ''is what I would have signed if the process had gone forward.''
 
Protecting a 'Finite Resource'
It found many aspects of the plan inconsistent with the State Coastal Management Program, an eight-year-old effort initiated by the United States Congress to regulate use of the nation's coasts. The state's shoreline was described by Ms. Shaffer as a ''finite resource'' that her office was obliged to protect ''by balancing environmental preservation with economic development.''
Her department's ''principal concern,'' she wrote to Mr. Marshall, ''is that the excessive scale, intensity of development and height of the bridge and buildings proposed for David's Island completely precludes the beneficial use of coastal resources'' while diminishing open spaces, impairing scenic beauty and changing ecological systems.
''Cramming four 31-story towers and other multi-story buildings containing 1,750 residential units and an 800-slip marina with its attendant one-third-mile-long breakwater on a small publicly owned island in the already stressed Long Island Sound does not achieve these objectives,'' she said, referring to the need to maintain coastal resources. ''It makes no sense,'' she said.. The coastal waters and underwater lands surrounding the former offshore Army base on David's Island are publicly owned and are now accessible to the general public for recreational boating, fishing and other water-related activities. The Xanadu plan would remove them from public ownership, and a proposed breakwater would prevent further public access. Similarly, the 3,200-foot-long marina covering 40 acres of surface waters also would be reserved for the private use of the future residents.
 
'Public Must Have Access'
Ms. Shaffer's recommendation was simply that ''the general public must have access to all the waters, lands and facilities which the marina and breakwater would occupy.''
The proposed bridge, supported by 14 concrete piers, crosses two navigational channels. At the smaller one, closer to shore, ships would have a clearance of 14 feet vertically and 160 feet between the piers; at the wider channel, those figures would become 65 feet and 250 feet.
The bridge would introduce ''a large visual element,'' the letter to Mr. Marshall stated. Both the bridge and the high-rise apartment towers ''would not be compatible with the scale of existing development in New Rochelle Harbor,'' while traffic generated by the development would similarly ''adversely affect'' the character of the harbor, it said.
Ms. Shaffer was asked if guarding coastal resources meant rejection of all development likely to represent major change. She said it meant establishing a ''framework'' for proposed development and a balanced approach to preservation and development. ''We're not saying no development,'' she said. ''We're saying appropriate development.''
Mr. Marshall declined to comment and city officials were unwilling to speak for publication until they could meet with Ms. Shaffer. But one official said: ''We never heard her object to the bridge before. The height of the buildings, public access, yes. But the bridge, no. We'll have to talk to her about it.''
 
Ferry Service Suggested
Her letter to Mr. Marshall suggested that ''a ferry service should provide access to David's Island.'' But the developers have said that effective use of the island, in terms of the Xanadu plan, could not be achieved through use of a ferry.
This prompted Ms. Shaffer to comment on the exclusivity sought by the developer as a major selling point.
Throughout most of the review of this project, she wrote, ''the applicant has maintained that public access to the island would not be provided because the provision of such access would eliminate the exclusivity of the residential development, and thereby reduce its marketability.''
In the interview she said she had an obligation to ''uphold the public trust.''
''This is a resource for all,'' she said, ''not just for the privileged few, particularly if it is land already in the public domain.'' She drew attention to the changes in access to a public beach on the island.
 
78 Acres From Public Domain
''He proposes taking 78 acres of land out of the public domain and using three-tenths of an acre for a public beach, near the sewage-treatment plant, while restricting its use from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., and running them over on privately operated jitneys.''
''That's not meaningful access,'' she said. ''Certainly on this issue we are miles apart on our concept of public access.''
Other objections listed by Ms. Shaffer included the helicopter pad, which she said should be relocated on the island rather than extending into the water, and the location of one of the apartment towers, which she said was too close to the water and therefore an intrusion.

City to State: Buy It Again

BYLINE: By Lyn Riddle

 BODY:
This city's government wants the state to buy 13.9 acres of oceanfront land with an asking price of $6 million. The catch is that the state recently handed over its title to a developer.
The scenic site, adjacent to a city-owned lighthouse, is the last big tract of mostly undeveloped property along Portland Harbor. The city wants it for a park. But many residents question whether the state should pay such a high price for property it once owned. 
''I'm so mad I could spit,'' wrote Bill Williamson, a columnist for The Portland Press Herald. Mr. Williamson exhorted the state to refuse to pay any more than the developer had invested and accused the state of lacking foresight.
Once the site of a Federal shipbuilding center, the land was given to the state-run Greater Portland Public Development Corporation after World War II. In 1970, the agency, which was charged with stimulating the peacetime economy through development of such parcels, leased the land and a factory on it to General Electric, which wanted to make parts for nuclear power plants there. The company was to pay $3,750 a month for 20 years and at the end of the lease, own the land.
But in 1983, General Electric closed the plant and sold its lease to Al Glickman, a Cape Elizabeth developer, for $2 million. Mr. Glickman gained title in April.
Two years ago, a Boston developer, McCourt Company, built 175 condominiums on adjacent property and took an option on the 13.9 acres. When the Maine real-estate market sputtered last year, the company let its option lapse and Mr. Glickman asked the city if it wanted the land, said City Manager Jerre Bryant.
The city has asked the Land For Maine's Future Board to buy the parcel. The board was established in 1987 to buy land to protect it from development. The board is working on an appraisal of the property and will consider the purchase along with 103 others.
''There is some irony in it but the history of Maine is replete with such transactions,'' said Richard Silkman, the director of the State Planning Office and the chairman of the land board. Jewell Island, for example, 160 acres off the coast of Portland, was sold for $10,240 in the 60's. In 1972, the state bought it for $200,000 and made it a state park.
Because half of Maine is owned by several large paper companies and families that had always allowed public access, many residents believed it unnecessary for the state to own land.
But as development of the land along the coast and surrounding lakes has grown, more residents are encouraging public ownership.

IN NEW ENGLAND, HARDEST RECESSION IN U.S. TAKES HOLD

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass.

 BODY:
After a decade of spectacular growth built on the pillars of high-technology industries, military contractors and financial services, New England has plunged into recession, the worst of any region in the country.
In an economy that has had the highest per capita income and housing prices in the country, unemployment is rising rapidly in all six states in the area, real estate prices are falling and the growth of wages is slowing.
Five states - Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont - suffered job losses in the last year, the only states to do so, said Sara Johnson, a regional specialist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting organization in Lexington, Mass. The other state, Connecticut, had a job growth rate of only 0.1 percent, giving it the seventh-worst record after the other New England states and Michigan.
 
An Important Measure
Job growth is important, Ms. Johnson said, because economists often use that as the best measure of a state's economic performance. It is particularly important because the Federal Government does not calculate output by state, as it does for the nation as a whole with the gross national product. 
''We're suffering a big hangover from the party we threw in the 1980's,'' said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist for the Shawmut National Bank in Boston. ''I call it life in the slow lane.''
Ten years ago, for instance, Pauline Anton eagerly quit her job to take a new position with Wang Laboratories Inc., then emerging in the fast lane as the world's leading maker of word processors and the force behind the revival of Lowell, an old mill town.
''It was a career move, I was looking for security,'' Mrs. Anton said of her decision to leave her job at a smaller electronics company. But facing increased competition and poor business decisions in the last two years, Wang has cut its work force to 21,000 from 31,600, and Mrs. Anton was registering recently to collect unemployment benefits in this city where the first American industrial revolution blossomed in the 19th century.
 
Foreclosures Are Doubling
The situation has become so bad that personal and business bankruptcies in the first six months of this year are about double the level in the first half of 1989 in each New England state, according to the United States Justice Department. Real estate foreclosures in Massachusetts jumped to 3,497 in the first half of this year, against 1,441 in same period in 1989, according to Banker and Tradesman, a weekly trade publication in Boston.
The Land Court in Boston is where many such cases are filed, and The Boston Globe reported its figures as showing 254 residential and commercial foreclosures in 1985 during the boom. The number more than doubled in 1988, to 546, and in 1989 the number more than doubled again, to greater than 1,200.
Throughout New England, states and local communities have begun slashing services as tax revenue has sharply fallen. In Laconia, N.H., for instance, the City Council has eliminated kindergarten, achievement tests and sports and all other extracurricular activities like band and chorus.
 
The Outlook
How Long Will Downturn Last?
The major question is: What kind of a downturn is New England facing? It could be just a normal cyclical correction after one of the greatest periods of regional growth in modern American history.
Or is it a long-term structural contraction, as the industries on which New England's prosperity was built undergo permanent decline? These include high-technology companies like Wang, many of which made the now out-of-fashion minicomputers or word processors; military contractors imperiled by the winding down of the cold war, and financial service companies, which have suffered since the stock market crash of 1987.
Unlike those who expect the problems to last a long time, the optimists say they believe that the worst will happen this year or next year as wages and real estate prices continue to fall, and that then a gradual rebound will occur.
''The down cycle was inevitable after we hit the wall'' with an unemployment rate below 3 percent and wages rising almost 10 percent a year, said Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College. ''We priced ourselves out of the market so businesses just didn't want to invest here. This had nothing to do with high technology or defense.''
At the height of the boom years, in 1987, for example, Boston became the highest-priced housing market in the country. Today, the city has dropped to being the fifth-costliest housing market, with the median price of an existing single-family house at $182,300, according to the National Association of Realtors. But that is still almost double the national median of $95,900.
But other economists see deeper problems. ''This is not just cyclical; it's also structural,'' said Barry Bluestone, a professor of political economy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
In his view, the pillars on which the New England economy has been built, like the high-technology and military businesses, are in trouble and may have to shrink. ''There will be a period of painful readjustment,'' he said.
Diane Swonk, an economist with the First National Bank of Chicago who wrote a recent study called ''Regional Winners and Losers,'' predicts that ''New England will be at the bottom of all the regions for growth in the 1990's.''
 
The Advantages
Competitive Edge Will Not Go Away
Most economists agree, however, that even with much slower growth, New England will remain one of the country's most affluent regions. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis projects that Connecticut, which ranks first among all states in per capita income, with $18,500 a year, will still be No. 1 in the year 2000. Similarly, Massachusetts, which is fourth, is expected to remain in that position, while New Hampshire, which is seventh, is expected to keep that ranking. The worst drop is expected to occur in Maine, falling to 30th from 28th.
One reason for hope that the economy will rebound, experts say, is that New England will retain its main competitive advantage: the large number of universities that produced the founders of companies like Wang and the Digital Equipment Corporation, the biggest employer in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. ''Universities are our natural resource, and we were able to mine them when the information age came in the 80's,'' Mr. Bluestone said.
New England has the highest percentage of employees in professional, technical and managerial jobs of any of the eight regions counted by the Commerce Department, said Andrew M. Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston.
The economists also stress that the growth of the 1980's in New England was extraordinary, transforming an area where the old economy based on textiles, shoes and leather had been in decline since the 1920's. ''There was a miracle,'' Mr. Sum said.
Each New England state is slightly different, but the six have been tied together by history and geography. In the past decade, Massachusetts - and Boston in particular - were the engine for the region's prosperity, with economic growth radiating north into New Hampshire and Maine, and south into Rhode Island and parts of Connecticut. And it was the ''Massachusetts miracle'' that propelled the state's Governor, Michael S. Dukakis, into the limelight and onto the Democratic ticket as the party's 1988 Presidential nominee.
Mr. Sum noted that in Massachusetts unemployment dropped from a high of more than 12 percent in the mid-1970's to 2.7 percent in 1988, and was consistently the lowest in any major industrial states throughout the decade.
Moreover, per capita income in Massachusetts, which was 4 percent above the national average in 1979, rose to 26 percent more than the national average in 1989, Mr. Sum said.
''It's because the miracle was real that the downturn now is so painful,'' he said.
The seriousness of the regional recession is illustrated by the turnaround in the job situation. Unemployment in Massachusetts, after dropping to 2.7 percent in May 1988, has been steadily climbing, reaching 5.8 percent in June, as against the national average of 5.2 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. This marks the first time in more than a decade that Massachusetts had been above the national average.
 
One City
Lowell Is Mirror For Whole Region
The unraveling of the miracle is underscored by the plight of Lowell, a city of 100,000 people 25 miles northwest of Boston. Lowell was named for Francis Cabot Lowell, a Boston merchant who toured British textile mills in the early 19th century and memorized their design for water-powered machinery that was creating the industrial revolution. Lowell died soon after, but in the 1820's a group of friends acquired this site on a falls in the Merrimack River, dug canals to bring water power around their projected city and built new mills, copying Mr. Lowell's purloined plans.
Lowell was an instant success, and by 1840, it was the largest manufacturing center in America. But as electricity replaced water power and the country sprawled west and south, Lowell began a long decline. Only in the late 1970's, through a combination of smart civic leadership, Federal grants and an infusion of high-technology companies, were Lowell and its old red brick mills rejuvenated. For many, Lowell's rebirth came to symbolize the Massachusetts miracle.
But, like most other computer manufacturers in Massachusetts that made mid-sized machines, Wang misjudged the advent of the smaller personal computer and the work station, which undercut the companies' market.
Wang's ills have spread through Lowell like a virus. In one recent week the city's main department store, a branch of Jordan Marsh, was shuttered, and the five-year-old Lowell Hilton, the centerpiece of a renewed downtown, underwent foreclosure. The hotel had been built beside a new training center for Wang employees and had counted on its business, but was suffering from an occupancy rate of 50 percent, said the Hilton's manager, Stephen E. McCarthy.
Wang's problems have also spread to the many small subcontractors that sprang up here, like Omni Industries Inc., which assembled boards for Wang's word processsors. From 156 employees in 1985, Omni has shriveled to only 9 workers today, said William S. Taupier, its founder.
Mr. Taupier, who also owns a real estate agency in Lowell, said housing prices there are down by 25 percent since they peaked in 1986, and have plummeted 12 percent in just the past year.
In New Hampshire, which was the second fastest-growing state in population east of the Mississippi in the 1980's after Florida, the real estate market is so soft that Nece Caratelli, a health food store manager in the upper-middle-class town of Hampton Falls, has not had one person come to look at her house in the two years it has been for sale.
In Vermont, Walter Gray, a 58-year-old inventory manager, was laid off in December by the General Electric Armament Systems plant in Burlington, which makes high-speed machine guns for aircraft, as it has reduced its work force to 1,000 employees from 2,000 last year. Mr. Gray has not found another job, and like many of the factory's former employees is preparing to move from Vermont.
In Connecticut, the vacancy rate for office buildings in the Hartford area has climbed from 13.4 percent in the second quarter of 1988 to 20.6 percent in the same period for 1989 and now to 25 percent this year, according to the real estate company Coldwell Banker. The current national average is 19.7 percent.
Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with the stock brokerage firm of Tucker Anthony Inc. in Portland, Me., points to other indicators of a regional slowdown. The help-wanted index, for instance, a survey of help-wanted advertisements in newspapers in Hartford, Providence and Boston, published by the Conference Board in New York, has fallen from its high reading of 186 in the second quarter of 1987 to 80 in April.
 
The Future
Region Adds Up Pluses and Minuses
There is more bad news to come. Because New England, particularly Massachusetts and Connecticut, benefited disproportionately from the military buildup in the Reagan years, the region will be harder hit than much of the nation as the Pentagon's budget is cut in the next few years, said Yolanda K. Henderson, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston.
In a study published in June by the Federal Reserve, Ms. Henderson estimated that New England could lose $4.1 billion to $9.6 billion in military funds by 1995, roughly double the national average, and from 57,000 to 134,000 jobs.
The recession, which has led to sharp declines in state tax receipts and caused havoc with state budgets, has resulted in tax increases or budget cuts or both in each state. For example, the largest tax increase in the history of Massachusetts was signed into law last week in an effort to raise more than $1 billion to pay for a deficit in the fiscal year that ended on June 30 and to balance the budget for the current year.
The developments have taken a toll on New England's politicians, with the three Democratic Governors - Mr. Dukakis, William A. O'Neill of Connecticut and Madeleine Kunin of Vermont - deciding not to run again. And while the three Republican Governors in the region are running again, two of them, William DiPrete of Rhode Island and John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, appear to be in trouble, and Judd Greg of New Hampshire faces an unexpectedly tough campaign.
But despite this abundance of difficulties, most economists believe that New England is far from being in as bad shape as Texas was in the late 1980's when the price of oil declined. They estimate that after the regional economy works off some of the high costs of labor and housing, it will resume a period of slower growth sometime in the next few years.
''The real question is how long it will take us to work off the excesses of the 80's,'' said Frederick Breimyer, president of the New England Economic Project, a nonprofit organization that does regional economic analyses.
New England still has several potential advantages, Mr. Breimyer and other economists say. For one thing, it has an older and slower-growing population than most other regions and attracted few new residents even in the boom years, a result partly of its high housing costs and of its climate. But this slowly growing population also means that any improvement in the economy will reduce unemployment faster than in regions with greater population growth.
But there remains the critical question of what will happen after New England returns to a normal slower pattern of development in the next few years, as Mr. Perna put it.
Can New England, drawing on its universities and high-technology resources, develop new industries or revitalize its faltering electronics companies so that it can continue having one of the highest rates of productivity growth?
There are some candidates for new industries: computer software and biotechnology are often mentioned. But Mr. Bluestone is dubious. ''They won't be the white knight,'' he said. They employ too few people and there is too much competition from parts of the country that missed out on the computer manufacturing boom in the 1980's.
More important to Mr. Bluestone is how ''the current pillars are restructured,'' meaning how well the big companies like Digital can develop new products to replace its minicomputers or Pratt and Whitney in Hartford can make the transition from manufacturing military jet engines to engines for civilian airliners.
The evidence on this question so far is mixed.
Still, a number of the economists are optimistic. ''My gut feeling is, if the American economy is going to make it, it will be in technology,'' said Professor Case of Wellesley College. ''And technology is what we do best.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Students Chafe as Islam Puts Imprint on Their Futures

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
Along Enghelab Street, the tree-lined boulevard that is the Iranian equivalent of Harvard Square, the students who are the future of this country say they cannot predict where the Islamic revolution in Iran will lead them.
''Yes, the revolution has done some good things, but maybe we will need a second revolution, especially in the way we are educated,'' said Leila, a 21-year-old science student at Teheran University, perhaps the most important and prestigious university in Iran.
As she hurried between classes, her black head scarf fluttering in a steamy breeze, Leila asked an American visitor whether college students in his country were forced to wear special restrictive clothing, or were plagued by a shortage of professors, or were barred from even the most innocuous classroom conversation with a student of the opposite sex. Her questions were clearly rhetorical. 
 
A Call for Freedom
''Universities must have freedom,'' said Leila's friend, who gave her name as Maryam. ''This university and this nation must have more freedom.''
As much as any institution in the country, Iran's universities and colleges have been restructured - revolutionized, the Government prefers to say - in the 11 years since the fall of the Shah and the declaration of Islamic law.
The Western-style teaching methods used during the Shah's reign have been abandoned, replaced by the sort of structured tutorials favored by the Islamic clerics who now have an important say in the educational system. As a rule, students say, they must remain silent in class and cannot challenge the arguments of a professor.
Applicants to Iranian universities are now admitted largely on the basis of their knowledge of Islam, and rigorous courses on the history and teachings of Islam are compulsory for all students.
The changes wrought by the Islamic Revolution have been particularly severe for college women, who must now adhere to a strict Islamic dress code that requires them to cover their hair, arms and feet at all times, and who face expulsion if they are caught fraternizing with men, even outside class.
In encounters along Enghelab Street and at a hamburger restaurant near campus called the Iran Mac - the restaurant incorporates a golden arches logo - few students declined to be interviewed by an American reporter.
Although Teheran University has often been used by the Government as the staging point for major anti-American demonstrations, students insisted that they had never stopped liking Americans and that they were delighted at the rare opportunity to speak to one. ''We love American people, although we do not love the American Government,'' is a common refrain.
Despite their willingness to answer questions, most of the students asked that their full names not be used, to prevent trouble with university administrators who, in one undergraduate's words, ''may feel differently about you than we do.''
 
'Better Form of Education'
Iranian students are clearly torn over the changes in the educational system brought about by the 1979 revolution. A number of students, especially those with a strong religious upbringing, said they appreciated the way Islam now permeates their studies.
''What we have now is a better form of education,'' declared Mohammed, a literature major in his early 20's who said he enjoyed the university's strict religious instruction and the opportunity to study with some of Iran's most distinguished Islamic clerics.
''If there are still many troubles with this system, it is because of the long war with Iraq, which robbed us of many resources,'' he said. ''With time, I think the universities can overcome these problems.''
Unlike many of his friends, Mohammed said he preferred the restrictions placed on the life style of students - the prohibition on social contact between men and women, for instance -saying the rules allowed him to focus on his studies.
 
A Shortage of Teachers
But Mohammed expressed the frustration of so many Iranian college students: that Iran's best academics left during the revolution and did not return and that there are now far too few qualified professors.
A 24-year-old theater student compared the university to a gardener who ''has picked out the best flowers - us, the students - but who will not water them.'' She added, ''There are so few teachers that it seems we must teach ourselves.''
Students complain, too, that the talents of their best teachers are diluted by an admissions policy that allows entrance to many students who are, at best, marginally qualified.
By most standards, the universities in Iran are as selective as any in the world, admitting only a tiny fraction of the applicants, after rigorous examinations.
The system grew more selective after the revolution, when Iranian students suddenly found themselves barred from entrance to many colleges and universities overseas, particularly in the United States. In a number of disciplines, students said, fewer than 1 in 10 applicants were offered admission to Teheran University last year.
But for some who apply, there are special privileges in the admissions process. At Government decree, more than a third of the places in the student body are reserved for handicapped veterans of the Iran-Iraq war, family members of the war dead and others who somehow sacrificed for the Islamic revolution.
Many students say the quota is closer to 40 percent, and they complained that the system of preferences had flooded the schools with students who are not prepared for the rigors of a university.
''The system we have now causes many problems,'' said 22-year-old Reza, who was a soldier in the front lines during the Iran-Iraq war but who said he gained entrance to Teheran University under the regular admissions process. ''The teachers cannot teach properly because they must do so much remedial work. We all went to war with Iraq to defend our country, but it does not make sense now to use this same heroism to harm the educational system.''
 
A Poor Outlook for Jobs
Students say that their worries extend far beyond their studies and that they fear a university degree will not insulate them from new troubles when they try to start a career.
The Iranian economy is in disarray, a result of the eight-year war with Iraq and of the sharp drop in recent years in the price of oil, Iran's main export. With rampant inflation and an unemployment rate of more than 25 percent, the jobs open even to the nation's best-trained university graduates may simply not offer a paycheck large enough to cover basic living costs.
Sara, a 23-year-old history student, quietly sipped a cola at the Iran Mac as she speculated on her future.
''I am not from a rich family, and I think I will have to work two jobs to have enough money to buy food and to pay rent for a very small apartment,'' she said, her friends nodding in agreement at what they say is their common plight.
''I love Iran,'' she said solemnly. ''I agreed with many of the ideals of the revolution. But Iran has so many problems that it is now like a third world country. Many of my friends and I think we will have to leave our country just so we can survive.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
C.I.A. Accused of Overestimating Soviet Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency, which has prided itself on its knowledge of the inner workings of the Soviet Union, has come under criticism from some lawmakers and economists who say it greatly overestimated the strength of the Soviet economy.
At issue is whether the C.I.A. botched its measurements of Soviet economic growth and industrial production, especially over the last decade, and in so doing led American leaders astray in their strategies.
Critics say the United States military build-up, especially during the Reagan Administration, was rationalized in part by C.I.A. estimates that the Soviet economy was far more powerful than it actually was. The social and economic chaos unleashed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's internal reforms, they say, demonstrates that the system was shakier than the intelligence agency said it was.
C.I.A. officials are clearly nettled by the charges of inaccuracy. ''I just think that is flat-out untrue,'' said a senior C.I.A. official when asked about complaints that measures of the Soviet economy are wrong. 
''We have done extraordinarily good work over the whole decade,'' said the official, interviewed in April. ''If there is anyone in town who can beat us on the basic factors affecting Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union, economically, linguistically, culturally, I don't know who they are.''
 
Assessments Were Gloomy
In fact, the agency's public assessments of the Soviet economy since 1980 have been uniformly gloomy, and its forecasts of political and social fallout from those economic problems appear to have been largely on the mark.
Yet outside experts have persisted in the criticism, in part because they believe that the C.I.A.'s underlying estimates of the size of the economy have been far too rosy, even if the agency's forecasts have been correct.
In an April conference sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research center, a Soviet economist who is a member of the Council of People's Deputies, Vladimir Tikhonov, said Soviet living standards were ''significantly worse than it seems to our American colleagues'' at the C.I.A.
For its part, the agency says it is wrong to rely solely on gross national product, which reflects neither the scope nor the subtleties of the Soviet economy. A large G.N.P. is not incompatible with poor living conditions, for example, if most of a country's production goes to the military and heavy industry rather than consumer goods, as is the case in the Soviet Union.
The criticism of the C.I.A has been popular among political conservatives who have maintained that the Soviet military takes up a larger portion of a much smaller economy. But the debate acquired a distinct partisan cast last Monday, when Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the C.I.A. ''may have hugely overestimated the size and the growth of the Soviet economy'' and, as a result, its military threat.
 
'Much Less Impressive Economy'
At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the issue, Mr. Moynihan said ''we are up against what has clearly turned out to be a much less impressive economy,'' calling it ''nothing like what they expected it to be, and perhaps we depicted it as being.''
In an opinion-page article in The Washington Post this month, Senator Moynihan suggested that the ''persistently distorted'' view of the Soviet threat may have led the Reagan Administration to spend the nation's fortune in the 1980's to defend against an overrated adversary.
At Senator Moynihan's hearing, a longtime critic of the C.I.A. who is employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency, William Lee, contended that the agency's economists ''considerably overstate'' the Soviet Union's total economic output and at the same time ''greatly understate'' its military spending.
Even the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael Jay Boskin, a Stanford University economist, told Senator Moynihan that he believed that the Soviet Union's total annual production of goods and services - its gross national product - was roughly a third less than the C.I.A. estimates. #51 Percent or 35 Percent?
The agency estimates that in 1989 Soviet G.N.P. was roughly 51 percent of the United States G.N.P. of $4.2 trillion. Mr. Boskin and many others place the Soviet Union much lower, at about 35 percent, and one prominent Soviet economist at the American Enterprise Institute seminar, Viktor Belkin, claimed it was less than 28 percent.
To support their lower estimate, the critics cite shockingly poor living conditions in the Soviet Union, new figures on waste and spoilage in industry and farming and new proof of deliberately inflated figures from some Soviet industries, like cotton farming.
Some critics question whether the caliber of the C.I.A.'s economists, who work at lower Government salaries, matches the caliber of those in the private sector. Other suggest that the agency is simply being stubborn, refusing to acknowledge error.
Yet all the parties are debating a figure which they agree is impossible to verify. Most Soviet economic data were state secrets until recently, and economists say even data that are public are unreliable.
 
Outside Reviews Conducted
During the Ford and Reagan Administrations, outside reviews of the C.I.A.'s Soviet economic estimates were conducted by teams of experts assembled by the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a monitoring agency of the White House. Both reviews concluded that the agency's methodology was sound and that its conclusions appeared reasonable.
A Bush Administration official who follows the agency's Soviet forecasts conceded that the estimates of Soviet G.N.P. could be off-target, but not by the amounts critics claim. Privately, however, Administration officials argue that the precise G.N.P. figure is unimportant compared with the accuracy of forecasts about the direction and effects of Soviet economic trends.
The C.I.A.'s own public reports to Congress seem to bolster that claim. In 1980, the agency's economists outlined an economy they said was ''losing its momentum while military programs continue to be pursued with vigor and determination.''
The agency added that major changes in Soviet economic priorities were unlikely under Leonid I. Brezhnev, and that it could take ''several years'' after his departure ''before a new leadership has acquired enough power to make hard choices among competing demands.''
 
Assessment in 1982
When Yuri V. Andropov took over in 1982 after Mr. Brezhnev's death, the C.I.A. said Soviet economic performance was ''deteriorating,'' even as its G.N.P. continued to grow. An economic collapse was ''a very remote possibility indeed,'' the agency said then, but Eastern Europe had ''severe economic problems'' of its own.
In a closed hearing in 1984, Robert M. Gates, now the deputy national security adviser to President Bush, said production had picked up slightly under Mr. Andropov's successor, Konstantin U. Chernenko. But he added that the Soviet Union continued to fall further behind the United States in technology and that its economic state in general was worsening.
In 1986, the C.I.A. said that Mr. Chernenko's successor, Mr. Gorbachev, had had a good year, but that he still had ''no viable, integrated plan for modernization'' of the beleaguered economy, and suggested that he ''may decide to put more teeth into his calls for radical reform.'' The agency predicted - incorrectly, it turned out - that the Soviet economy would grow in the next few years by 2 to 3 percent annually, a figure that has proved too optimistic.
But even that pace, the agency said, would not be enough to remedy the Soviet Union's economic woes. Instead, experts wrote, it would lead to ''more severe battles over resource allocation,'' greater reliance on foreign economic ties and a push for further economic reforms.

HEADLINE: Indian Gaming Spreads, Upsetting Some States

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
To the irritation of some state governments, a booming gambling industry operated by Indian tribes is beginning to spread off the reservations.
A growing number of tribes, taking advantage of a law passed more than half a century ago allowing them to acquire land outside their reservations and place it under tribal jurisdiction, are buying or looking for land near urban centers to open casinos and high-stakes bingo parlors.
The Federal Government, which acts as a trustee for the tribes, two years ago granted them the right to operate such gambling operations as a means of raising money for economic development that benefits all members of the tribe. More than 100 legal gaming operations, most on reservations, are already bringing in nearly $500 million a year. 
But a number of governors have expressed concern about the establishment of off-reservation gaming businesses, which are not subject to state law or supervision. The governors say they are worried about their lack of control as well as unfair competition with charitable or state-run gambling activities that are constrained by state or local regulations.
 
Regulations Proposed
Last Wednesday, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. proposed new Federal guidelines governing the acquisition of off-reservation land for gambling operations. They would require the tribes to explore economic alternatives to gambling for use of the land and would also require that a tribe acquire land for gambling only in a state where it has a reservation.
Earlier this year, Mr. Lujan announced the formation of an Indian Gaming Commission to regulate and oversee Indian gambling operations around the country. The creation of the commission reflects ''a very strong concern that we make sure these games do not fall under the influence of an outside criminal element,'' said Stephen A. Gleason, staff assistant to Eddie Brown, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs. A function of the commission will be to oversee an annual audit of all Indian gambling operations.
After Mr. Lujan announced his guidelines, Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota said he was still opposed to off-reservation gaming operations. ''I don't think that we want islands of gambling or anything else outside the reservations,'' he said.
 
Opposition in Iowa
Paula Dierenfeld, administrative counsel to Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, said in a telephone interview that the state is against a plan by the Mesquakie tribe, which has a reservation in Iowa, from setting up a gaming business outside of the reservation.
''His philosophy at this point is that we have enough gambling opportunities in the state,'' Ms. Dierenfeld said.
Not all states are opposed to off-reservation gambling. Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, for instance, has approved a proposal by the Forest County Potawotomi tribe to establish gaming operations just outside Milwaukee, 200 miles from its reservation. But Governor Thompson's legal counsel, Raymond P. Taffora, said by telephone that the Governor ''is continually concerned about the proliferation of gambling and he is on the record as opposing Atlantic City-Las Vegas type of casino gambling.'' $400 Million From Bingo Indian gaming operations are already big business. According to the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, bingo alone is expected to bring the tribes more than $400 million this year.
Of the more than 100 legal operations, only two bingo parlors are operating off reservation. Applications for two casinos have been filed, and Mr. Gleason said the Interior Department expects many more tribes to open off-reservation casinos soon.
The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 gave the tribes the right to acquire land and take it into trust, meaning it would be subject to tribal rather than state or local jurisdiction. The passage of the Indian Game Regulatory Act of 1988 provided an incentive to the tribes to acquire lands near population centers to set up their gaming centers.
Indian leaders say that gambling provides a much needed stimulous to tribal economies that are often badly depressed.
The Sycuan Band of the Mission Indian tribe, for example, is expanding its bingo operation on its reservation east of San Diego. Jim Trant, business manager of the band, said by telephone that proceeds from its gambling operations have been used to build a profit-making health clinic and ambulance service, which serve not only Indians but also members of nearby communities. The gambling profits have also been used to build housing for the band and a church, and to open a 24-hour fire-protection service, he said.

HEADLINE: 30 Million Americans Can't Joke Poverty Away

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 6 front-page report that the Bush Administration has abandoned its intentions to develop new programs to combat poverty is a sobering reminder of our less kind and less gentle national commitment. A White House official you quote summed up interagency task force conclusions with the not-so-funny flippancy: ''Keep playing with the same toys. But let's paint them a little shinier.'' It is enough to make one weep with shame for our country. 
Twenty-seven years ago, the President challenged his economic advisers: ''It's intolerable that in our rich country there should be over 30 million Americans living below a very low poverty line. I want to know who these poor people are, why they are poor, and what we must do to get them out of poverty, not just to relieve their poverty.'' John F. Kennedy's challenge became Lyndon B. Johnson's, and a ''war on poverty'' began. Millions were helped out of poverty, but not enough. The ''war'' failed to keep up with new challenges.
Today, tragically, there are again more than 30 million Americans below the poverty line - with disproportionate numbers of children and minorities among them. It is incumbent upon today's President to ask the questions asked by Kennedy. The answers will be somewhat different, but the questions are the same: Who are the poor? Why are they poor? What can we do to get them out of poverty? As one who tried to answer such questions in the 60's, I know there are no easy or sure answers. But it is intolerable to be told that there are no answers. Whatever happened to the dramatic call for a new war on poverty issued by Jack Kemp when he was sworn in as Housing and Urban Development Secretary?
I urge President Bush to refuse to take ''no'' for an answer. If his aides cannot make intelligent proposals for wiping out illiteracy, bringing better health care to the poor, improving education and training for the underclass and for the whole range of identifiable obstacles to escaping from poverty, let him get more imaginative aides.

The Fun of Being Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Things I find fun to think about:
My kids when they are agreeable; my cats when they are off the dining-room table; the Mets when they are on a streak.
Things I do not find fun to think about:
Women, often with children, coming into my court with no money to pay the rent and facing the loss of their homes; men, women and children begging for money in the subways and showing clear signs of great physical and mental stress; citizens living on the streets, and often falling there and dying, especially when it is cold and wet. 
But your July 6 front-page report on the White House's decision not to expand antipoverty programs quotes an Administration official as saying, ''It was fun to think about these things.'' The reference is to efforts by members of the Domestic Policy Council to come up with plans to combat poverty. The Administration decided the ''cash wasn't there'' and concluded that nothing would be done.
This kind of ''fun'' thinking is, to me, characteristic of the callous and often cruel approach that our Government has taken toward the need of the 32 million or more people who suffer and barely survive in America today.

HEADLINE: Florio Faces Growing Anti-Tax Storm in New Jersey

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 21

 BODY:
Barely six months after taking office, Gov. Jim Florio is confronted with a growing tax revolt that is fast turning into a general wave of discontent threatening his dominance of the machinery of government in New Jersey.
A central source of anger is a feeling that the Governor lied when he told voters in his campaign that no new taxes were likely and then promptly rammed through the biggest increase in the state's history - $2.8 billion. That sum, an economics consulting concern concluded in a study released on Thursday, ''is the largest single tax increase in the history of the finances of the 50 states, and will become a national test case on both political and economic grounds.''
One goal of the developing protest is to wrest control of the legislative process from the Governor and Legislature by establishing a system for recalling officeholders and overturning legislation by referendum.
 
Protest Stuns Some
For a decade, Republicans have urged an initiative like those in 23 other states, including California, where voters recently approved a tax increase. 
No one can say whether that goal will be achieved, but among politicians and academics who follow government, even skeptics admit they are stunned by the scope of the protest and the depth of its anger. Members of the Florio administration concede that those who seem the angriest are the very people the Governor says he is trying to help the most with his ambitious plans to change the way New Jersey taxes residents and spends money: the frustrated, homeowning, tax-battered middle class.
Yet the administration's response so far has been to largely ignore the protest, maintaining that it will peter out as the benefits of Mr. Florio's tax revisions, which now exist only on the charts of his number-crunchers, turn into things like property-tax rebate checks, lower auto insurance rates and a school financing formula that will give more money to 85 percent of the state's schoolchildren and less to only 15 percent in the wealthier districts. But protest leaders say that it is too little too late, that Mr. Florio is not to be trusted, and that no less than fundamental change of the system to give more power to the people will satisfy them.
Few outside the protest agree, but there is concern even among Florio supporters.
''This thing does have enormous momentum,'' said a leading Democratic strategist with ties to the Governor and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''And I think that one of the things that those of us in the party and in his administration must do is think about a game plan - and unfortunately I have to say I'm not sure there is one at this point.''The Governor's popularity has plummeted in polls after a landslide victory in November.
There is anger over taxes, but there is a more amorphous discontent as well: a feeling that the dream is dying in New Jersey and no one is doing anything about it.
''I tell people that my name is Pat and I'm mad as hell and I'm going to do something about it,'' said Pat Ralston, a Belmont grandmother who helped begin the rebellion with a furious phone call to a Trenton radio talk show a month ago.
She quickly linked up with another irate caller, John Budzash, a 39-year-old mail carrier from Howell. They formed a fledgling protest group they called Hands Across New Jersey, held a rally on July 1 in Trenton that drew 6,000 to 8,000 supporters, and began circulating petitions they say drew 350,000 signatures before they stopped counting a week ago to concentrate solely on circulating and collecting new petitions.
 
Democrat Would Allow Recall
With growing support, they say their goal is a million signatures by Aug. 1. Mr. Budzash promises that ''we're going to hand them right to the Governor.''
The petitions have no weight other than popular pressure - the group's goal is to obtain binding referendums and a recall mechanism - but some Democrats admit that they are beginning to worry and that there is some evidence that the Governor's support in the party could wane if pressures increase.
One Democratic legislator, Assemblyman Thomas P. Foy of Burlington County, declared this week that he supported a provision to allow recall of legislators by popular vote.
His declaration came on a New Jersey talk radio station in Trenton that has become the clearinghouse for complaints and information about the protest movement. The Trentonian, a daily Trenton newspaper, has also become something of an ally of the protest, printing telephone numbers of organizers and running banner accounts of such legislative peccadillos as Assembly Speaker Joseph V. Doria Jr.'s ''personal gift'' of gold badges to Assembly members - a $7,250 gift that Mr. Doria billed to the taxpayers, repaying the money with campaign funds five months later only after the purchase was made public.
 
Toilet Paper a Tax Symbol
Although not of great consequence as legislative expenditures go in a state with a $12 billion budget, the matter rankled many - as did relatively minor aspects of the tax increase.
Protesters at the July 1 rally in Trenton, for example, draped the grounds with toilet tissue as a symbol of their anger not only at the increase in the state sales tax to 7 cents from 6 cents, but also at the broadening of the new tax to apply to paper products and detergent.
But the tax increase was by no means irksome only to household shoppers. Polyconomics, Inc., an economics consulting concern in Morristown that advises 120 corporate clients around the world on economic trends, released a study on Thursday maintaining that New Jersey residents, with the increases, ''will now pay the highest combination of state and local taxes in the nation,'' an average of $8.64 out of every $100.
Moreover, the report warned that increases in state and local taxes around the country threatened to tip the national economy into recession.
 
General Feeling of Discontent
David Goldman, the economist who wrote the study, predicted that with no offsetting relief from Washington, the increase would throw the state into ''a severe regional recession with growth 3 percent below what it otherwise would be.'' State tax receipts, because of the downturn, could actually decline by 5 percent to 10 percent, office relocation could stagnate and middle-range property values could decline as a result, he said.
But what is really intensifying the protest is not taxes alone, but a general feeling of discontent and anger.
''There are really so many things that made me mad,'' said Mr. Budzash, the co-founder of the revolt, which in a very real way is not simply a tax protest but a protest against government itself - its perceived excess, unresponsiveness and even arrogance.
''I was really incensed that my mother all of a sudden had to take a $3 salary cut, from $9 to $6, and she's 65 and ready to retire and her retirement benefits are based on her last salary scale,'' said Mr. Budzash, adding that her mother's employer had been in financial difficulty. ''I know other people who have to take salary cuts and with the economy in the state as bad as it is and our so-called deficit and fiscal problems, the Assembly gets a raise.''
 
Florio 'the Lightning Rod'
The raise was actually voted in the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who left a $1 billion to $2 billion deficit.
Supporters of Mr. Florio say the economic downturn started in New Jersey well before he took office, auto insurance rates have been crazy for years, and it was the courts, not Mr. Florio, that ordered the state to put more money in its poorer schools.
But politically, that does not matter. It is Mr. Florio who will take the heat. ''He's becoming the lightning rod for everything,'' said Janice Ballou, director of the New Jersey poll conducted jointly by The Star-Ledger of Newark and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. The poll recently found that only 23 percent of state residents gave the Governor a favorable job rating.
''As soon as you get a negative image, everything is clouded by that perception,'' she said.
 
New Jerseyans Less Happy
Governor Florio exists in a world that in large measure he did not create. And it is an increasingly restive world. People were unhappy before he moved into the Governor's office. The Eagleton Institute found in other surveys that New Jerseyans are - suddenly - not as happy with where they live.
In 1984, 80 percent of residents said New Jersey was a good to excellent place to live; about the same percentage said the same thing as late as 1988. But this month, that figure dropped to 59 percent.
The state is crowded, housing expensive, freeways jammed, taxes soaring and discontent rising, residents told pollers.
 
Property Taxes Outpace Rebate
''My taxes were $2,000 and then they were $2,519 and now they are $4,003,'' said Mr. Budzash, of Howell. ''But I get a $50 veterans discount. Whoopee. I get the $500 property tax rebate, but my taxes are up a thousand. The guy across the street really got it; he went from $3,000 to $6,000.''
Mr. Budzash continued, ''The people Florio claims he's helping, he's hurting what he says is the middle class. I'm on the low end of it, about $30,000.''
But those on the high end also complain that the combined income for a couple might be $70,000, but that means day-care bills of $5,000 to $10,000 a year, two cars, with two car payments and $2,000 in auto insurance, parking and all the rest.

HEADLINE: East German Consultants Forging Links With West

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN

 BODY:
The words management, marketing and consultant were not in the East German dictionary during four decades of Communism. Now, from lexicographic oblivion, Heino Ackert and Michael Jarowinsky have emerged as two of East Germany's first private management and marketing consultants.
Their rise comes as many companies are turning to consultants for help in evaluating the potential of the unified German market and in finding joint-venture partners. And a number of West German and American consulting groups are rushing to build networks of contacts and a base of information on East Germany. 
Price Waterhouse G.m.b.H., for example, is looking for office space in East Berlin and says it is active in East Germany; McKinsey & Company is running its East German operations from its office in West Berlin; Roland Berger, a consulting company that is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank A.G., said it was very active in East Germany, and so is Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Mittelstandsberatung, another Deutsche Bank unit.
 
Formidable Competition
Mr. Jarowinsky, a 36-year-old marketing expert who was born and raised in East Berlin, acknowledged that the competition is formidable. His company, Marketing Services Berlin G.m.b.H., operates in cooperation with Dr. Ackert & Partner Management Consulting G.m.b.H., the first East German company to join the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany.
''Even for the Western consultants, it's tough,'' Mr. Jarowinsky said. ''The market here was far away behind the Iron Curtain. To outsiders, it was a black box.''
Before Communism's demise, both men worked for Iberma Ltd., a management consulting company partly owned by the East German Government, which had occasional need for capitalist techniques even though it banned them from reference books.
''We operated in both systems and have the advantage of detailed knowledge about East German companies and their ties throughout the East bloc,'' said Mr. Jarowinsky. ''We also have the contacts and the language skills needed to operate in Eastern Europe or Western Europe.''
 
American Clients Preferred
Both men said they hoped to work for private clients, preferably highly specialized, medium-sized companies from the United States. A company from Alaska that specializes in environmental decontamination - a service much in demand in highly polluted East Germany - is one of their first American clients. They would not give the company's name.
Working together, the two companies offer a wide range of services, Mr. Jarowinsky said. ''We want to be primarily a specialized marketing service offering advice on marketing strategy, financing, legal advising and contacts to companies and individuals.''
To help bridge the gap between foreign companies, the two consultants are working in cooperation with a number of foreign specialists, including Fulbright & Jaworski, the Washington law firm, and Hudig-Langeveldt G.m.b.H., the largest industrial insurance brokerage group in Europe.
Both men are confident of their abilities, in large part because of the experience they gained working abroad.
''We advised the state-owned companies on foreign trade and acquisitions,'' said the 36-year-old Mr. Ackert, who was licensed as a private lawyer in March, specializing in foreign trade law. ''My last deal before I left to set up my own business in February was the purchase of Royal Zenith in the United States by Kombinat Polygraph.''
 
East German Acquisition
That $35 million purchase on Jan. 10 was the first time an East German company had acquired a concern in the United States. Royal Zenith Inc., a trading and marketing company for the printing industry, is based in Great Neck, L.I. It was the United States distributor for Polygraph's Planeta unit, which makes sheet-fed printing presses that are rated among the finest in the world.
''That acquisition made a good bridge,'' said Mr. Ackert, who was deputy head of Iberma until the end of last year. ''It was the biggest and most interesting project I worked on, and it gave me excellent contacts in the United States. And the time was right to leave the company where I was working. They have a lot of good people, but the top managers have no experience and the firm is just sitting there now, being passive at a time when the situation calls for positive action.''
Neither man is apologetic about his membership in the Communist Party. ''Everyone bears a piece of the responsibility for what happened here in the D.D.R.,'' said Mr. Ackert. ''Sometimes, from the way people talk, you get the feeling that there were 16 million resistance fighters chasing 16 million guilty people. I joined the party in the early 70's. People forget now that when Honecker came to power there was a new, optimistic outlook. We thought he would improve things. And it did go better for a while.''
 
Unused Skills and Knowledge
The severe economic downturn that helped speed Erich Honecker's fall as head of state was particularly frustrating since both men had skills and knowledge that went unused.
''We were always present in the marketplace,'' Mr. Jarowinsky said. ''We traveled to East Germany's foreign trade offices in Europe and elsewhere. But we didn't dare do anything. We weren't allowed to do anything. Now we can work, make money and do something for the people here by creating jobs and opportunities.''
Another freedom they enjoy is charging what the market will bear. Their former employer billed customers 28 East German marks an hour, about $4.60 at the time. The going rate now is between $100 and $200 an hour, Mr. Ackert said, ''Depending, or course, on the client and the job.''

HEADLINE: Balance Sheets in 90's: Less Debt

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As the stock market climbs to record highs, American corporations are rushing to issue equity with an eagerness not seen since before the October 1987 stock market crash.
Common stock offerings rebounded in the first half of 1990 after a two-year slump. Wall Street bankers say this may signal a fundamental shift in corporate balance sheets away from debt and to equity. They say the shift reflects a desire by corporations to adopt a more conservative financial structure in the face of concerns about an uncertain economy and recent bankruptcies.
''Debt is not king anymore and equity is becoming the favored way to fund,'' said John Trygg, head of investor relations at U S West, the Denver-based regional telephone company that recently issued about $331 million in new stock. ''The upfront premise is that the world is changing as far as finance is concerned.'' 
 
Shift Away From Leverage
Indeed, the leveraging of corporate balance sheets that took place in the 1980's is being replaced in the early 1990's by ''deleveraging'' as companies are replacing debt with equity. In addition the growing appetite for equity stocks among large institutional investors, with millions of new dollars to invest daily, is expected to feed this trend.
The change may also make American corporations more competitive globally. With less debt on their balance sheets, companies have the capacity to borrow and expand when times are good and are less vulnerable to downturns when times are bad.
Corporations overseas, particularly in Japan and Germany, tend to be even more debt-heavy than those in America, but have stable and deep pockets that their counterparts in America do not because many are partially owned by large banks.
To be sure, part of this recent trend toward equity is cyclical. Corporations issue stock when the market is high to get as much as possible for every share floated. During market peaks in 1983 and 1987, companies flooded the market with stock. In the first half of 1987, for instance, 515 companies issued $25 billion in equity, including both intitial public offerings and secondary offerings, according to the Securities Data Company, a research firm.
Stock offerings fell sharply after the October 1987 crash and hit bottom in the first half of 1989, when only 187 companies raised $8.9 billion. In the first half of this year, 240 companies issued equity of $12.8 billion.
But unlike the halcyon days of the 1980's, the current rise in equity issues has not been accompanied by an increase in corporate debt offerings. Debt and equity offerings marched in lock step in the 1980's, with both forms of capital-raising breaking records. At the time much of the debt was used to retire equity when corporations were taken over through raids, mergers and leveraged buyouts. Between 1984 and 1989, for instance, corporations retired about $494 billion in equity, a record amount, according to the Federal Reserve Board.
Now, the reverse is true. In the first half of this year, only $57.3 billion in corporate debt was raised, the lowest since the second half of 1985, with much of it going to debt retirement.
 
Psychology of Fear
For issuers, what lies behind these numbers is a psychology of fear. Corporations are troubled by the collapse of the ''junk bond'' market, the specter of Donald J. Trump's problems, the bankruptcy of many celebrated buyout companies and an economy that could be headed for rough times.
''Debt is becoming a four-letter word,'' said Richard L. Kauffman, director of equity capital markets at the First Boston Corporation.
''People are looking at Donald Trump and all the companies being worked out,'' said Richard L. Franyo, a managing director at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., a Baltimore investment bank. ''Companies say, 'There's plenty of risk outside my doorstep: Do I want to have that risk on my balance sheet?' ''
And Sorrell M. Mathes, head of equity origination at Merrill Lynch, said: ''Corporate managers are nervous. The economy refuses to go into a recession, but keeps driving along the edge.''
 
Concern About Banking System
Compounding these concerns are worries about the banking system, particularly in the wake of the savings and loan crisis. And with Federal regulators clamping down on loans classified as ''highly leveraged transactions,'' banks are lending less to risky corporate ventures.
Moreover, corporations are more inclined to issue equity now that the threat of hostile takeovers is all but gone. They once feared that with more shares outstanding, the chances of falling into unfriendly hands was higher. And many companies loaded on debt as a takeover defense, using up excess debt capacity before a raider did it for them.
''To remain independent, a lot of companies felt pressure to have balance sheets more leveraged than they were comfortable with,'' said Mr. Kauffman of First Boston.
Corporations, as always, have many reasons for raising equity, not all related to deleveraging. U S West, for instance, felt stock was the safest way to finance untried new telecommunications ventures overseas, including in Eastern Europe. The company did not want to be saddled with debt payments that continued if the ventures did not. At the Reader's Digest Association, a $420 million initial public offering last February provided liquidity to foundations and charitable organizations, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lincoln Center, which had been given non-voting stock by the trust of the association's founding family.
But for others, equity has become a way to separate themselves from the reality of heavy monthly debt payments as well as the stigma of debt of many investors' eyes. Some offerings are ''reverse'' leveraged buyouts, as companies that once borrowed heavily to go private now pay down high-cost debt with equity in partial spinoffs to the public.
''We did have a heavy debt load,'' said Phillip Bode, head of investor relations for Sante Fe Energy Resources. The energy company issued $170 million in equity last March in a partial spinoff from the Sante Fe Pacific Corporation, its parent company, which still owns 81 percent of the company. ''Wall Street and the business community almost mandated that we get the debt load down,'' Mr. Bode said. ''And oil equities were in favor, so it was a good time.''
 
Choices Becoming Limited
In addition, stock offerings are often the only option that the original investors in a leveraged buyout have to recoup their investments now that the junk bond market is flattened and well-heeled financial buyers are not acquiring many companies.
For still others, deleveraging is simply a way to cut debt payments. Investment bankers classify as deleveraging deals those offered by the Storage Technology Corporation, a Colorado data storage maker that raised $115 million last March to pay down debt; Maxus Energy, an energy company that raised $94.5 million last May to repurchase covertible shares, and Safeway Stores Inc., a Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company buyout, that issued $90 million in April to repay debt.
Investors, who have traditionally bid up stocks of leveraged companies are also changing their tune. ''There's been a real change in investor psychology, and corporations are responding to it,'' said Frederic M. Seegal, co-head of corporate finance at Salomon Brothers. ''In the past, people focused on the upside of leverage. Now they are thinking about the downside.''
 
'Bias Against Equity'
A debt-laden company has a greater upside than a similar-size company with more equity because there are fewer shares outstanding over which the earnings are spread. Thus, the leveraged company records higher earnings per share, a big factor in determining stock prices. ''Investors normally have a bias against equity,'' Mr. Seegal said. ''But a too-leveraged company may not survive the difficult economy of the next three to five years.''
One sign of this changing attitude was Safeway. When the stock was first announced in February, it was to be priced at $13 to $16 a share. But investors, concerned the company was too debt heavy, were unwilling to pay that price, forcing Safeway to lower its offering to $11.25 a share.
How long caution will be demanded by investors is unclear, particularly if the bull market stalls and the economy falters. Kenneth Lipper, an investment banker who heads his own firm, said: ''You can't add equity without it impacting your return on equity. And if you don't have rapid growth, which we may not have, and the market drops, these stocks could get into some real problems.'' In this situation, stocks could plummet.
 
Economic Benefit Seen
Some say that deleveraging is good for the economy. Jeffrey Schaefer, senior vice president at the Securities Industry Association, said the economy should ''be subject to less shocks.''
''The more equity companies have,'' he said, ''the safer they are relative to volatility in the economy and their earnings.''
Mr. Kauffman of First Boston points out that more equity gives companies the flexibility to invest in things like research and growth. The question is whether they will actually do this. Once the discipline of debt and the threat of takeover are gone, corporate managers could be less inclined to cut fat and curtail perks. ''Leverage imposes a discipline,'' Mr. Kauffman said, ''and with more equity companies could simply go back to the good old days.''

HEADLINE: Sudden Fame for a Compromise on Trade

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 21

 BODY:
A Dutch civil servant with a dry sense of humor and an endless supply of patience was in bed with the flu in Geneva when leaders of the world's seven major industrial powers found themselves struggling to pronounce his name at the Houston summit meeting earlier this month.
Not the sort of man interested in even a Warholian 15 minutes of fame, Aart de Zeeuw shrugged off the repeated mangling of his surname. But what did make him feel better was the unlikely interest stirred in Houston by an eight-page document he had prepared on freeing world trade in agricultural products.
''I was surprised,'' Mr. de Zeeuw (pronounced ''duh-ZAY-ow'') said in an interview squeezed between meetings at the headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade here. ''I didn't realize the paper would be so central to the summit. The entire subject is very detailed and complicated, but they spent five or six hours discussing it.'' 
The fact that they did so, though, reflected their alarm that a bitter dispute over farming subsidies and supports is threatening to ruin four years of trade liberalization negotiations. And with the United States and the 12-nation European Community moving toward confrontation, the seven turned to the ''de Zeeuw text'' as a possible peace formula.
Although they did not adopt the text, which calls for across-the-board reduction of farm supports, their final communique commended it ''as a means to intensify the negotiations.'' President Bush referred to Mr. de Zeeuw by name in a news conference, while Britain's Prime Minister Thatcher told Parliament that the report by ''a Dutchman called de Zeeuw'' would be the basis for future talks.
The first real test of the suddenly famous text will come Monday in Geneva when a 96-nation Trade Negotiations Committee begins to draft final agreements on agriculture and a range of other trade issues. Without rapid progress, there are doubts whether the December deadline for completion of what is known as the Uruguay Round of GATT-sponsored trade negotiations can be met.
Mr. de Zeeuw was made chairman of the agriculture negotiating group, because the Netherlands stands roughly midway between the free-trade stance of the United States and the more protectionist position of most Community countries. After traveling widely and listening intently, it was his job to present a compromise plan on July 2.
Yet Mr. de Zeeuw - both as drafter and ''referee,'' as he calls himself -has now assumed still greater importance because of the disproportionate weight that agriculture carries in the trade talks as a whole. ''We all know that we can expect no real result from the Uruguay Round without an agreement on agriculture,'' he said.
The Uruguay Round, the seventh in a series that began 30 years ago, aims to reduce trade restraints in 15 areas, ranging from textiles and tropical goods to services and intellectual property. At present, existing GATT agreements cover $1 trillion of a total annual world trade of around $3 trillion. If successful, the Uruguay Round will liberalize an additional $1 trillion worth of international sales.
Many governments, including that of the United States, have warned that they will not accept any package that excludes agriculture. Some developing countries have also indicated that unless they obtain concessions on agriculture they will not endorse draft accords in, say, services.
The clash between the United States and the European Community over agriculture dates back to the early 1960's, when the community -at the time, still a six-nation common market - began what became known as the Common Agricultural Policy. Justified as a way of insuring ''food security,'' it sought to protect millions of small farmers, mainly in France and West Germany, through a system of direct subsidies, import barriers and export incentives.
The United States, which failed to have agriculture included in previous GATT rounds, complains that this policy enables European countries to keep out cheaper foreign food products at the same time they are dumping their surpluses abroad at below-market prices. As a result, the United States claims to have lost $11 billion in agricultural exports in 1989 alone.
The United States itself plans to channel $8.5 billion in subsidies to its 2.2 million farmers this year, with other assistance hidden in Federal irrigation programs, low-interest credit and price supports. But Washington argues that the community's program of export subsidies has an immediate and disruptive impact on world trade. And it is these subsidies that it most wants reduced.
In contrast, while Washington often bows to pressure from the American farming lobby, the European policy is defended as the ''economic cement'' binding the community together. Europeans pay dearly to shield 11 million farmers, 7.5 percent of the work force, from market forces. In 1990, $45 billion in tax revenues will be channeled through the community as subsidies, while consumers will pay $54 billion extra for food because prices are fixed above market rates.
The debate is further complicated by bitter charges of protectionism against the United States, the European Community and Japan by the 13-nation Cairns group that represents leading agricultural exporters, including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil. For them, the answer is a total liberalization of trade in farm products so that their cheaper exports can find markets.
 
Mr. de Zeeuw's Targets
In drafting his text, Mr. de Zeeuw identified four areas in which protectionism should be reduced: domestic supports, like subsidies; nontariff barriers, like quotas; export subsidies, and plant, animal and human health controls that serve to restrict trade. He did not suggest when and by how much the reductions should take place, although he asked governments to provide a list of all their farm supports by Oct. 1.
But, to the distress of the community, Mr. de Zeeuw did express his belief that priority should be given to reducing export subsidies, which happens to be the United States' view. ''Export subsidies are the most trade-distorting measures,'' the 66-year-old agricultural economist said. ''Therefore we have to do more here than in other areas.''
The community, though, favors ''aggregate measures of support,'' meaning that all farm supports should be looked at as a package. And it points to a recent report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing that total producer subsidies for each farmer were worth $8,000 in community countries and $20,000 in the United States.
Mr. de Zeeuw brushed off the suggestion that his recognition at Houston had increased his responsibilities. ''I don't decide these things,'' he insisted. ''Governments do. I'm just a mediator; I don't count. When my name was mentioned on television from Houston, my son called up and said, 'So that's what you've been doing all these years.' ''

HEADLINE: Proposals On Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Mirroring concern about a sevenfold rise in foreign investment in United States companies in the last decade, Congress is considering a spate of bills that would help the Government assess the extent of foreign ownership and its impact on the economy.
Some of the 21 bills would require not only expanded reporting requirements by foreign investors, but much wider distribution of confidential data among units of the Government, including committees and subcommittees of Congress, in the case of a bill sponsored by Representative John Bryant, Democrat of Texas.
Another bill, by Representative Doug Walgren, Democrat of Pennsylvania, would require foreign companies seeking American takeover partners to report how they would handle technology crucial to the American industrial base and provide crucial supplies to customers.
In another indication of the ferment over the issue, the Federal Election Commission, the agency that seeks to insure fair elections, is considering barring foreign-owned companies from organizing political action committees to support political candidates. 
While the Bush Administration continues to welcome foreign investment, as have other administrations in the last four decades, Congress and some Federal agencies are questioning whether that longstanding policy should be modified.
 
Sovereignty Seen Threatened
Opinion surveys indicate that three-quarters of the American people fear that the United States's sovereignty is somehow threatened by foreign investment, which now totals $2 trillion, including $401 billion in direct investment. That includes such high-profile investments as a controlling stake in Rockefeller Center, bought by the Mitsubishi Bank and a Japanese real estate group; the Honda Motor Company's auto plant in Marysville, Ohio, and the Sony Corporation's purchase of CBS Records.
''What we're seeing,'' said Elliot L. Richardson, the former Attorney General and chairman of the Association of International Investment, a group that tries to promote foreign investment in the United States, ''is the political reflection of the loss by the United States of its position as the dominant force in the world.'' Promoting Competitiveness The Democrats introduced proposals last month to promote economic competitiveness, indicating that foreign investment is likely to be an issue in the November elections, and perhaps in the 1992 Presidential elections.
The possibility of a ban on political action committees at foreign-owned companies has followed sharp Senate criticism of the existing system. For years, American subsidiaries of foreign companies, like Royal Dutch/ Shell, British American Tobacco, American Hoechst and Ciba-Geigy, have been allowed to maintain such committees, which often make large political contributions.
Even in the waning days of the 101st Congress, some of the investment bills in the Congressional hopper stand good chances of passage. Most focus on giving the Government additional information about foreign investments or disseminating already existing information more widely within the bureaucracy.
 
Some Bills Cause Anxiety
Some of the bills cause anxiety in business groups, which worry that confidential information about companies' strategic plans may be disclosed to competitors. Backers say that confidentiality can be protected and that the data will help in evaluating the overall impact of foreign investment on the economy.
''A better understanding of the level of foreign ownership will help the Congress and President better craft economic policy,'' said Senator James J. Exon, a Nebraska Democrat and former businessman who is a joint sponsor of one bill that has aroused little controversy.
The bill, which is also sponsored by Representative Norman F. Lent, a New York Republican, would give the Bureau of Economic Analysis access to detailed data collected by the Census Bureau. Both agencies are part of the Commerce Department and both collect confidential data from companies. Under the new legislation, both would go to special lengths to preserve the confidentiality of the information.
While the Reagan Administration resisted similar proposals in the past, the Bush Administration supports the Exon-Lent bill in the interests of ''higher-quality statistics'' and a ''better understanding of the role that foreign investment plays in the American economy,'' said Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. Both the Bryant and Walgren bills, which would greatly expand the Government's role in foreign investment, are opposed by the Administration.
The change in tone from the Reagan years may also reflect acknowledgement of the high political content of the investment issue and a desire to undercut more sweeping legislation.
The first foray of Congress into the area of foreign investment came two years ago when Congress authorized a review process in which the President can stop an investment that he deems a threat to national security. The provision, an amendment to 1988 trade legislation. was sponsored by Senator Exon and Representative James J. Florio, now the Democratic Governor of New Jersey.
This year, half of the foreign companies involved in takeovers are expected to seek formal approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the inter-agency body that advises the President on matters of foreign investment.
The Treasury-led group, known as Cfius, has received 409 notifications by foreign companies seeking national security clearance before going forward with American takeovers, said William E. Barreda, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
While notification is voluntary, the law provides that a transaction may be dissolved at any time should a foreign investor fail to notify the Government, provide false and misleading information or omit material information. This is a powerful inducement to seek Government clearance.
Yet of all the transactions the committee on foreign investment has reviewed, only one has been overturned - the purchase of Mamco Manufacturing Inc. of Seattle by the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation. Mamco supplies the Boeing Corporation with metal components for commercial aircraft.
Some of the new bills would mandate the transfer of more data to the foreign-investment committee. And legislation just approved by the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Economic Stabilizationwould require the committee, which operates under strict secrecy, to make annual reports on the cases it reviews.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on July 23 about legislation to expand reporting requirements on foreign investors in the United States misidentified the Japanese company that bought a controlling stake in Rockefeller Center.

HEADLINE: Peace Starts To Take Toll

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
With big weapons makers like the McDonnell Douglas Corporation laying off thousands of employees and with communities across the country bracing for further cuts in the arms budget, many companies, workers and Government officials are scrambling to find nonmilitary uses for jobs, skills and technology long supported by the Pentagon.
To some extent, their efforts are already too late. What Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio recently called ''the dark side of the peace dividend'' is already becoming reality for tens of thousands of workers. For them, the talk of what is usually called economic conversion or adjustment -the post-cold war version of beating swords into plowshares - is a nice theory not so easily translated into reality. 
The large military contractors have shown little desire or ability to push into alternative fields. In Southern California, for example, large contractors have shown no interest in a proposal by local politicians that they help to develop an electric rail-car industry that could serve the region's growing need for mass transit. The contractors' reticence largely reflects their unsuccessful attempts in the past to crack such markets.
Many companies have found that their engineers, marketing staffs and skilled workers have difficulty shifting from the mentality of supplying the Pentagon, which puts a premium on quality and adherence to a maze of bureaucratic requirements, to that of a commercial business, where minimizing costs, the ability to bring a product to market quickly and competitive pressures play a much greater role.
''Most companies have learned the lesson that pursuing an unfamiliar customer is very tricky,'' said Robert Paulson, who advises military contractors for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
Smaller companies, many with highly specialized skills and products, often face daunting obstacles in converting to civilian markets, including the high costs of buying new tools and finding non-Government customers.
For its part, the Government remains divided over what role, if any, it should take in retraining workers, encouraging companies to pursue nonmilitary products and services and helping communities attract a more diversified industrial base.
 
New Lines of Business
To the extent that contractors are pursuing new lines, they are ''sticking with the technical skills they have and seeing if they can find applications in a related market, like space or commercial aircraft or transportation,'' Mr. Paulson said, adding, ''They're not going to go into toasters.''
But fields like commercial aviation and space, long cited by proponents of conversion plans as natural businesses to absorb workers are also reducing employment.
Still, workers at some companies are pressing management to come up with ideas to keep production lines and laboratories open. At the Unisys Corporation's defense systems division in St. Paul, where 1,800 union workers recently lost their jobs, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers came up with a list of 140 proposals.
 
Rejected by Management
''We approached the company with the ideas, and they didn't want to hear anything about it,'' said Wipali Globa, the union's local president. A Unisys spokesman said the company was open to ideas but reserved the right to decide on a strategy.
Even when large companies come up with new ways to use old skills, the benefits are often limited. The Lockheed Corporation, which has seen its military aircraft business shrivel, said recently that it would go into maintenance and modification work on Boeing 747 commercial aircraft, a venture that could eventually employ more than 900 people in Southern California. But Lockheed is eliminating 7,000 jobs in the area.
Faced with a rapidly growing list of layoffs, legislators are pushing for action to protect or help workers. The State of Washington recently appropriated $200,000 for a program to help military contractors and communities dependent on them develop diversification plans. California, like other states, is helping subcontractors and suppliers explore diversification efforts.
 
Ideological Debate
But in Congress, an ideological debate over the Government's role in managing the shrinkage of the industry makes it unclear whether there will be any significant Federal role.
''The questions are, what is going to be the mix between Federal, state and local governments in terms of responsibility for adjustment, and what is going to be the mix between public-and private-sector responsibility,'' said Gordon Adams, of the Defense Budget Project, a research group.
Congressional aides said conversion legislation would make it politically more palatable for members of Congress to vote for Pentagon budget cuts that would endanger jobs in their home districts.
''In a very direct way, the Government was responsible for getting people involved in defense work, and in order to avert or reduce economic dislocation there is an obligation on the part of Government to make the transition as limited and painless as possible,'' said Representative Ted Weiss, a New York City Democrat who is co-sponsoring economic conversion legislation in the House.
 
'We Cannot Throw It Away'
Apart from the question of jobs, some Government officials and industry executives argue that a coherent national policy is needed to preserve technologies and skills critical to national security.
''We have an infrastructure in place - scientists, engineers, facilities - that we spent trillions of dollars building,'' said Robert B. Costello, the Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition during the Reagan Administration, who is now with the Hudson Institute, a research organization. ''We cannot throw it away.''
There are some examples of companies that have transformed themselves to prepare for lower Pentagon spending.
One is the Kavlico Corporation of Moorpark, Calif., a maker of sophisticated sensors used in many military aircraft. In the last few years, Kavlico successfully expanded and diversified its business by adapting its products for use in other industries and winning big orders from customers like the Ford Motor Company. As a result, Kavlico in the last four years has more than doubled its sales, to about $50 million annually, and grown to 600 employees, from 200.
 
Extensive Studies
Kavlico's scientists and engineers made extensive studies of the company's strengths and existing technologies. The company hired sales and marketing executives with commercial backgrounds, brought in some engineers from outside the military-aerospace field and invested in research and new equipment.
''We wanted to be less dependent on a single business,'' said Michael C. Gibson, Kavlico's president. ''You can make the transition to a more diversified mix, but it's not easy.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rise in Long-Term Rates Forecast

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The bond market is likely to have a difficult time adjusting to the Federal Reserve's new, seemingly more benign attitude about inflation, credit market analysts say.
As a consequence, unless compelling evidence of serious economic weakness emerges, the analysts said, long-term interest rates were likely to move higher even though pressures on short-term rates might recede.
There were sound reasons for Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, to make it plain to Congress last week that the Fed has shifted its priorities toward avoiding recession and shoring up a weakened banking system, the analysts added.
 
'Unspoken Tenet'
''It is an unspoken tenet of Federal Reserve activity that bank profitability is in the public interest,'' said Hung Q. Tran, an economist at the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation. ''That is especially true when the margin of safety at one or more large institutions is seen as uncomfortably thin.'' 
Still, bond market participants have traditionally had difficulty with a Fed whose overriding consideration was anything but dampening inflation, since rising prices erode real returns on fixed-income securities.
''This new attention to sustaining the economic expansion and offsetting unintended restrictions in credit availability suggests that there is now less hope that the inflation premium in United States bond yields will be eliminated soon,'' said Richard Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
 
Standoff Is Seen
''Accordingly, bond investors are presented with a standoff: although a sluggish economy likely will not boost inflation, policy makers likely will not wring it out,'' he added. ''This scenario closes off the possibility that yields will dip significantly further.''
The analysts said there might be a good reason for the Fed to have chosen a tactical retreat in its fight against inflation. ''Tight monetary policy is not going to affect the price of prescription drugs or other services,'' said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''And more economically sensitive prices in manufacturing and other areas are showing signs of abating.''
Nevertheless, the market is almost certain to remain wary about inflation, and an important measure of price trends to be released tomorrow is not expected to make pleasant reading. Because of growing costs for health care and other services, analysts are projecting a second-quarter rise in the employment cost index of about 5.5 percent, duplicating its performance in the first three months of the year.
 
Inflation Viewed as Problem
''If the employment cost numbers are above 5 percent, it's kind of hard to see how inflation is coming down,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''From our point of view, we think there is a continuing inflation problem. But the Fed seems more inclined to ease policy.''
Mr. Greenspan will have another chance to amplify the Fed's intentions tomorrow, when he delivers his semiannual testimony on monetary policy and the economy to members of the House of Representatives. Last week Mr. Greenspan addressed senators on those issues.
Aside from those developments, the release on Friday of preliminary estimates of second-quarter economic growth is likely to be the highlight of the week. Forecasts from private analysts about the figures vary widely: the most optimistic are projecting economic growth in the quarter of as much as 2.5 percent, while the gloomiest show that growth limped ahead at an annual rate of 1 percent.
 
Revised Three-Year Figures
The task of analyzing the numbers will be made much more difficult because the Commerce Department will also release revised figures on the gross national product for the last three years. ''Days like that are a numerical mess for an economist,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Worries about inflation and the degree of vigilance being exercised by of Fed may dictate the overall direction of interest rates, but such concerns are not readily apparent in the $200 billion market for high-yield ''junk bonds.''
The high-yield market got long-awaited help last week when details of the $6.8 billion refinancing program for RJR Nabisco were released. As a result of that program, $4 billion to $5 billion of outstanding high-yield RJR securities will be retired this year, further diminishing the supply of bonds that are currently trading in the market.
 
Pool Will Be Refilled
In the first half of 1990, more than $7.5 billion worth of high-yield securities were retired, said Robert Long, director of high-yield research at the First Boston Corporation. That figure is more than twice the amount of securities that were retired in all of 1989. The pool of outstanding securities will be refilled somewhat by the Resolution Trust Corporation, which has a $3.7 billion portfolio of high-yield bonds that it intends to sell over time.
But over all, analysts said, the once-battered junk bond market is in good shape. ''I am very optimistic about the outlook for the next several months,'' said Martin Fridson, a managing director in charge of high-yield research at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The improved climate may encourage some underwriters to make public offerings of new high-yield securities over the next few months, Mr. Fridson and others said.
 
Private Placements Made
While no high-yield issuer has tapped the public market since February, $3.8 billion worth of high-yield securities carrying registration rights have been sold through the private placement market, Mr. Long said. Registration rights require the bonds to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission so that they can be traded publicly at a later date.
Despite the market's problems over the last year, demand for high-quality junk paper remains very strong. An example was provided last week, when the GTech Corporation, a provider of lottery systems for states and municipalities, privately placed $115 million worth of senior subordinated debentures through Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. According to market participants, the issue was oversubscribed by a ratio of 6 to 1.
''If the deal is structured properly and is priced appropriately, I will be a buyer,'' said Mark Vaselkiv, a vice president of the T. Rowe Price High Yield fund. ''Right now it is really hard to find paper to buy in the secondary market.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: TELEVISION;
Tartikoff Show Goes On, But Its Script Is Changing

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
JUST before Brandon Tartikoff faced the press for the last time as NBC's chief programming executive, he strapped on a mobile microphone and headset, a la Madonna, and sang a two-minute rap number with the network's newest star, Will Smith - also known as the Fresh Prince.
No other television executive would have dared try the stunt, let alone bring it off, as Mr. Tartikoff did last week. But Mr. Tartikoff is a showman by every possible definition.
The Tartikoff show is going to continue at NBC, but not as before. And if NBC does not show Mr. Tartikoff something that he wants to see, the show might not run too long. 
What Mr. Tartikoff wants to see is that NBC is serious about expanding in directions that will alter the entire concept of a network.
Mr. Tartikoff has been president of NBC Entertainment for more than 10 years, longer than anyone else in the business. Last week, though, he announced that he was giving up day-to-day control of NBC's programming department and becoming chairman of a newly created entity, the NBC Entertainment Group.
Several NBC executives described the move not as the end of an era at the network, but rather as a shifting of priorities. The succession of Warren Littlefield, Mr. Tartikoff's chief programming lieutenant, as entertainment president assures a smooth transition, the NBC executives said.
But it will still be a transition, and that has inescapable implications for NBC. Mr. Tartikoff has been the most successful television executive in a generation, leading a department that climbed from laughingstock to television supremacy, pulling in up to $500 million a year in profits.
He has been closely associated with NBC's hits over the last decade, from ''Cheers'' and ''Hill Street Blues'' to ''Cosby'' and ''Golden Girls.''
But those shows have made their creators and studio owners far more money from syndication profits than Mr. Tartikoff or NBC earned from selling the commercial time in them. Now, Mr. Tartikoff said, with the economics of television in upheaval, it is possible for such hits to become ''loss leaders'' for a network while they continue to make their owners rich.
As he see it, there is a need for a a new form of television network, resembling a large Hollywood studio.
The word studio is much on Mr. Tartikoff's lips these days. The new opportunity he most wants is to run a movie studio that NBC's parent company, the General Electric Company, would buy for him.
The network put in a determined effort to keep Mr. Tartikoff, who said he had communicated for seven months his ''diminished interest'' in several aspects of the programming job. Mr. Tartikoff has frequently been wooed by studios, most recently this last March when he declined a feeler to take over the troubled Orion studio.
Mr. Tartikoff called a studio a ''big toy to play with.'' He does not necessarily expect G.E. to run out and buy him one. But, he said, ''I don't rule it out either.'' He has told associates that he would like to see NBC move to buy a studio by January, especially if the networks win a ruling in December from the Federal Communications Commission authorizing them to take some profits from programs sold into syndication.
As long as the networks are excluded from those profits, owning a studio makes less sense. But Mr. Tartikoff believes that such a move is necessary - both for NBC and his own personal growth.
A small studio, he said, could provide the network with the packaging, experience and distribution to make middle-budget movies, those costing $12 million to $14 million.
But, he added, he can see NBC moving to a higher level by taking advantage of its assets, including its large news and sports staffs and the production abilities of its local stations.
Even if the studio does not work out right away, Mr. Tartikoff sees other ''sparkling opportunities.'' He has ideas for working inside NBC in a separate production unit, spinning out international co-productions and other creative programming deals.
The arrangement calls for Mr. Tartikoff to explore these areas, while maintaining ultimate authority over his previous empire, the NBC programming division.
But Mr. Littlefield says he will be running NBC Entertainment, using Mr. Tartikoff as a consultant.
Mr. Littlefield participated in developing virtually every NBC show now on the air and is respected in Hollywood for his programming talent, if not his rap singing.
In an interview last week, Mr. Littlefield acknowledged, ''Brandon casts a very large shadow.''
So despite the carefully muted talk of the end of the Tartikoff era in network programming, the evidence is growing that the shadow has moved on to a position in front of a different set of spotlights.

HEADLINE: Noriega's Troops Now Form Police With U.S. Aid, Panamanians Say

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, July 22

 BODY:
Miguel Antonio Bernal, a respected Panamanian scholar and social critic, was eating dinner with friends recently in a restaurant when his companions noticed a man they recognized as their torturer during their detention under Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Mr. Bernal and his friends started clinking their glasses with silverware in a kind of protest, and shortly after that were arrested by Panamanian officers accompanied by United States military policemen and detained for several hours. The officers were former soldiers from General Noriega's army, who now serve as the Fuerza Publica, the national police force that has replaced the military.
The arrest of Mr. Bernal, who was recently named chairman of the department of public law at the University of Panama, has propelled an already intense debate over what role the former soldiers should have and how deeply the United States should be involved in shaping the new force. 
Coming on top of an economic restructuring plan that in some aspects resembles unpopular programs of past Governments, some Panamanians are complaining that with the overnight conversion of Noriega soldiers into policemen, their country is now facing ''Noriegism without Noriega.''
 
'Reviving the Old Army'
After the invasion by the United States on Dec. 20, with widespread looting following the routing of General Noriega's forces, ''the United States told us to create a police force, to do it now,'' said Alberto Conte, a 54-year-old leader of Civic Crusade, an association of business and professional groups that organized boisterous street demonstrations in 1987 that shook the Noriega Government.
''They called the Government and said, 'You guys have anyone who knows how to handle weapons?' '' Mr. Conte said in an interview in his advertising agency offices. '' 'Sure, they are behind bars,' was the answer. And now we have almost the same number of people, in fact the very same people as before. They are not creating anything, or filtering anything. They are reviving the old army.''
In recent days, the Panamanian Government has moved to calm fears about the police. Last week, it named three civilians, including a member of Civic Crusade, to oversee the new force at the sub-ministerial level.
Mr. Conte and others have said the United States has a duty to ''watch over the security of the invaded country,'' until a new police force can be created ''clean from the first officer down.''
The arrest of Mr. Bernal, who returned last month from three years of political exile, is only the most celebrated in a growing number of cases that have raised questions about the comportment of the new police. In another incident, Panamanian officers were charged with murder in May after the death of the 3-year-old granddaughter of General Noriega's former second-in-command. Prosecutors say the girl was abducted in an extortion plot.
Defenders of the police, including the United States Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, point to such arrests as evidence that the system is working. ''When those cases turn up,'' Mr. Hinton said, referring to police abuses, ''the will exists in the Government to do something about it.''
For the 40-year-old Mr. Bernal, an academic and sometime journalist, and many active in human rights here, these incidents illustrate the urgency of quickly reducing the American military presence.
''There must be no more arbitrary arrests,'' Mr. Bernal said in an interview in his office overlooking the university campus. ''They only act this way because they are backed up by the Americans.'' A judge later dismissed all charges against Mr. Bernal and his friends.
For some, the incident demonstrates the necessity of having the United States continue to share responsibility for public order in Panama seven months after the American invasion that destroyed an army known for its corruption.
 
U.S. Asked to Do More
Despite the presence of about 200 American military police officers, who accompany the Panamanian police on patrols, and Justice Department and civilian police experts who are helping train the new Panamanian force, these critics say the United States has not done enough to assure a smooth transition to Panamanian-maintained law and order with respect for civil rights.
Where Panamanians of virtually every stripe seem to agree, however, is in their deep skepticism and apprehension over the Government's decision, made in the immediate aftermath of the invasion and supported by the United States, to build the 12,000-member Fuerza Publica almost entirely from decommissioned soldiers from General Noriega's army.
For these Panamanians, the wholesale incorporation of soldiers into a new police force with a military-style command structure means trouble in spite of the Government's declared intention to demilitarize the society.
Roberto Eisenman, publisher and editor of La Prensa, a leading Panamanian newspaper, has been a persistent critic of the way the force was formed. Everything about the Fuerza Publica, ''including its very name,'' a La Prensa editorial said, must be opened to full national debate.
''Giving up the historical opportunity to come out of this a totally demarilitarized society is a criminal shame,'' Mr. Eisenman said in an interview.
 
Warning Against Criticism
Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former director of La Prensa, is now First Vice President and oversees the creation of the new police force. He caused a stir earlier this year when opponents of his plan to use General Noriega's soldiers said he warned them, ''We will not tolerate criticism.''
Mr. Eisenman and others have focused criticism on the hiring of Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan to head the new police force.
Colonel Herrera was sent to Israel as Ambassador in 1985 after Mr. Noriega began to regard him as a serious potential rival. Many describe him as ''less corrupt'' than most of the former Panamanian Defense Force's senior officers, but the ambitious 23-year Panamanian Army veteran is still viewed as a soldier at heart who learned at the elbow of General Noriega.
Colonel Herrera has done nothing to allay concerns about his ambitions, bristling in interviews about suggestions for more civilian control and warning that the police, demoralized by their lack of automatic weapons to pursue heavily armed criminals, could eventually go on strike.
Mr. Eisenman said that ''the Government should find someone with a strong sense of civic duty who is a good administrator and knows how to handle money and then recruit university graduates'' as staff members.
 
New Recruiting Urged
''We have had thousands of people marching in the streets who have shown their devotion to the country who could have been recruited as policemen,'' he said. ''From everything I have heard, carefully looking at the question, it would be much easier to train these people to be police than to retrain the military.''
In an interview at police headquarters, Ebrahim Azbat, the senior adviser to Vice President Arias who was named as director of public security, sought to blunt the criticism and offer a reassuring assessment of the role of the former soldiers.
''It was a decision to make every Panamanian feel that he can be part of the new democracy,'' said Mr. Azbat, a boyish-faced 35-year-old lawyer.

Wall St. Volatility Reflects Larger Economic Worries

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A sharp fall in stock prices yesterday reflected growing worries over the health of the economy, especially the erosion of corporate profits, as well as a stock market that has grown increasingly fragile, some traders and analysts say.
The rapid plunge in prices, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 100 points in little more than an hour of trading, only to stabilize and end the day down by 56.44 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,904.70, came after a series of disappointing earnings reports from companies as diverse as Texas Instruments, the electronics company, and McDonald's, the hamburger chain.
The selling extended to virtually all stocks, with six stocks falling in price for every one that rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell by 6.30, or 1.7 percent, to 355.31. [Page D1.] Growing Apprehension The profit disappointments came at a time of growing apprehension about the health of the financial system -many large bank stocks are trading at their lowest levels in two years - that had generally not hurt the stock market up to now. While share prices were not as expensive, measured against such indicators as earnings and interest rates, as they were in the summer of 1987, they were approaching that level, according to many analysts. 
''The market had reached overvalued levels, the economy is sluggish, and corporate profits, while they are not horrendous, are well below the levels of expectations that were built into prices,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief American strategist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research.
The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates slightly two weeks ago, providing some help for share prices, but worries that interest rates would not fall further, and might rise, have grown. Those fears intensified yesterday after rates in Japan rose overnight, and share prices declined in Tokyo, with the Nikkei 225-stock index off 1.6 percent. But in early trading today the Nikkei's losses were trimmed. At the close of the morning session, the average was down by 67.66 points, to 31,827.13, a decline of about two-tenths of a percent.
 
Rates Quickly Turn Down
Interest rates were up in early New York trading yesterday, but quickly turned down after stock prices cracked, as traders seeking safety bought Treasury securities.
The suddenness of the plunge stunned many traders, recalling the 190-point fall on Oct. 13, 1989. But while there were a pair of causes that touched off that slide - including the collapse of financing for a takeover of United Airlines and a Washington setback to efforts to lower capital gains taxes - there were no such ready explanations yesterday morning, although some pointed to the continued rise of oil prices and to the fact that McDonald's, a consumer growth stock and market leader up until now, reported poor earnings late Friday. The company fell $1.50 that day and another $3 today, closing at $33 a share.
The plunge may have been accelerated by the fact many brokers had built up inventories of shares in recent weeks as the Dow neared 3,000, a point at which it was hoped that buyers would come flooding in. Last week, the average traded over that level on three days, but never closed there. In addition, there had been a widespread expectation on Friday that prices would rise in late trading as the scheduled expiration of a stock index futures contract in Chicago touched off a wave of buying. Instead, the buying from that was minor and was overwhelmed by late selling from other areas.
Some analysts said the decline was exaggerated by changes in the securities industry in recent years. With commission rates on stock trades falling steadily, the big brokerage houses seem less willing to risk their own capital to buy stocks that institutions are selling. Without that buying support, the volatility of stock prices is increased.
With buyers returning in the afternoon, the day ended as only the third worst decline of the Dow in 1990, and there were indications that some buyers were betting that the market would bounce back quickly.
Robert Farrell, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that it appeared more retail customers at his firm were inclined ''to want to buy something'' rather than to ''panic and sell.''
 
Impact of 'Circuit Breakers'
The ''circuit breakers'' in effect at futures exchanges - most importantly the one at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which trades contracts on the Standard & Poor's 500 index - seem to have had a dual impact. They may first have accelerated the drop, but then stabilized the market.
The rule on the S.&P. provided that if the September futures contract fell 12 points - about 3.3 percent - there could be no trading below that level for 30 minutes. When prices began to near that amount just after 10:30 A.M., there appeared to be a ''magnet effect,'' in which they fell to the level. Prices in the stock market at first continued lower, but then rallied, helping the futures quotes recover.
In the afternoon, when the market again sagged, S.&P. futures prices fell even lower. There was no circuit breaker then, and there would not have been one unless prices fell 20 points, but the market nonetheless rallied.
 
Rules Proposed by Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange has proposed rules to halt stock trading for 30 minutes if the Dow falls 100 points in a day, but they are awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by other exchanges, and were not in effect.
The Big Board did, however, put into effect a ''side car'' rule in which some program trades related to index arbitrage were delayed for five minutes after the futures circuit breaker was set off. The immediate effect of that was to cause some program trades to be executed at a loss, some traders said.
In recent weeks, as the Dow rose while many stocks were weakening, traders had increasingly focused on two groups: computer stocks, which were market stars early in the year, and companies that were thought to have consistent growth in profits, whatever happened to the economy. It was in that context that disappointments in such companies as McDonald's and Texas Instruments may have demoralized money managers, and made them hesitate to buy when prices tumbled yesterday.
Volume yesterday, at 209 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, was heavier than usual, but by no means as heavy as in previous big drops. That fact served to reinforce the feelings of some traders that the markets have become more fragile, able to plunge with only limited selling pressure.
Reports from some brokerage houses yesterday said there was only limited selling of stocks by institutions. But there seems to have been more selling of stock index futures in an effort to hedge portfolios against further losses. That selling was then translated back to the stock market through index arbitrage, in which traders sold stocks while buying the futures contracts.
The Big Board asked that brokers refrain from some forms of index arbitrage after the large fall in the morning, but some of it continued, traders said.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leaders Achieve a Subtle Balance of Power

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran

 BODY:
The relationship between the two men who run Iran is sometimes likened to that of two talented but competitive dancing partners.
''One leads at one moment, one leads at another,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Let us please hope that they never want to lead at the same time.''
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and the nation's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seem at first to be working together on an agenda to end Iran's isolation and somehow to revive its economy. 
In recent weeks, they have united on what is seen here as the most contentious foreign-policy question facing the country, agreeing that the Government should accept humanitarian aid from the United States and other nations that have had poor relations with Teheran to assist victims of the devastating earthquake in northern Iran in June.
 
Cooperation Not a Tradition
But in the murky, sometimes dangerous world of Iranian politics since the 1979 Islamic revolution, President Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Khamenei know that, in the end, cooperation has never been a strategy for survival in Iran.
In ways both subtle and overt, the two seem to be struggling for dominance in a nation still trying to find its way after the death last year of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's absolute leader for nearly a decade.
''I don't think anyone is predicting a real break between Rafsanjani and Khamenei - their policy differences are certainly not insurmountable,'' an Iranian scholar said. ''Watch them, though. They will each want to consolidate power at the other's expense.''
While Mr. Rafsanjani is the nation's chief of state, Ayatollah Khamenei wields political power beyond his title, which is supreme spiritual guide of the Islamic revolution. He controls the military and has considerable influence over the Government-controlled radio and television service.
There are rumblings, apparently from Rafsanjani supporters, that the role of spiritual leader may be eliminated over time. There are rumors, perhaps from Ayatollah Khamenei's camp, that Mr. Rafsanjani is losing the support of some of the nation's most important religious leaders because of his overtures to the West.
 
Both Were Khomeini Followers
Mr. Rafsanjani is a hojatolislam, a step below ayatollah in the hierarchy of Shiite Islam, and both he and Ayatollah Khamenei were Khomeini followers in the 1960's and 1970's, in the difficult years of resistance to the rule of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
Both were arrested, imprisoned and they say, tortured, by the Shah's notorious secret police, the Savak.
With the fall of the Shah and Ayatollah Khomeini's return to Iran from exile 11 years ago, his two trusted lieutenants took prominent posts in the revolutionary Government.
Ayatollah Khamenei, who was born in 1940, was elected President in 1981. Mr. Rafsanjani held a succession of jobs, including head of the military force known as the Revolutionary Guards, before rising to the powerful post of Speaker of Parliament.
Mr. Rafsanjani, 56, became known in Parliament as the consummate politician, a powerful orator and shrewd negotiator. ''He would do well in your Washington, D.C.,'' an Iranian supporter said.
 
Predictions Off the Mark
With the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in June 1989, many Western analysts predicted a long and possibly violent battle for succession.
But to a large extent, Mr. Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Khamenei, who are considered moderates in the world of Iranian politics, maneuvered quickly to prevent the rise of militant Islamic fundamentalists.
Ayatollah Khamenei threw his support behind Mr. Rafsanjani as the nation's new President, while he took for himself the late Ayatollah Khomeini's post of spiritual leader.
It originally appeared to some Westerners that Ayatollah Khamenei was preparing to remove himself from much of the day-to-day governance of the nation, leaving that job to Mr. Rafsanjani.
In a May 1989 speech, just a month before Ayatollah Khomeini's death, Ayatollah Khamenei said: ''A single person must be in charge of the nation. People must make demands of him, protest to him and hold him responsible.''
 
Powers Are Being Shared
To a degree that has surprised some Western diplomats and businessmen here, Government powers have been shared between President Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Khamenei.
There was surprise among diplomats when, shortly after Mr. Rafsanjani took office last year, Ayatollah Khamenei reorganized the Security Council to include well-known rivals of the President, including Ahmad Khomeini, the late Ayatollah's son.
The envoys say they were also startled when Ayatollah Khamenei moved to assert a degree of oversight over the Iranian broadcasting system, which is run by Mr. Rafsanjani's brother, Mohammed Hashemi.
Iranian businessmen say there may yet be a public clash between the two leaders over how to deal with the nation's long-running economic crisis -the spiraling inflation and business stagnation that are almost certainly the greatest threat to the survival of the Government.
Mr. Rafsanjani, from a family of bazaar merchants, is a champion of free enterprise. Although his economic views appear to have moderated with the years, Ayatollah Khamenei, from a family of religious scholars, has in the past strongly supported a planned economy and the nationalization of important Iranian industries.
 
Reports of Friction
But there are reports of friction between the two leaders, but these cannot be easily substantiated.
President Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Khamenei have shared years of sacrifice against what seemed extraordinary odds, and their mutual ties to the Ayatollah Khomeini and his vision for Iran are seen here as having created a camaraderie that should survive most challenges.
But Iran is a nation where an intelligent analyst will hesitate before making a prediction.
''Iran has always been full of duplicity and insecurity, and sometimes Rafsanjani and Khamenei must wonder about exactly what the other one is doing,'' said a European business executive whose company was active in Teheran long before the revolution.
''I don't think it will happen, but if there was a very significant break between these two men, I don't know what would happen to Iran.''

HEADLINE: Bush Presents Plan to Help Andean Nations Grow Non-Coca Crops

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
President Bush announced trade concessions, expanded agricultural development assistance and other measures to help Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, the main cocaine-producing countries of Latin America, to develop alternative exports.
The moves, announced after the visit here of President Rodrigo Borja of Ecuador, were received on Capitol Hill as a welcome gesture, but many analysts questioned the extent to which economic benefits would eventually flow to these countries.
The program responds to one of the main Latin American complaints: that American policy is too enforcement-oriented and is not designed to cope with the economic and social repercussions of its enforcement efforts.
 
Incentive to Peasants
''When you wipe out a peasant's coca field and leave him with no reasonable economic alternative, he's faced with some rather stark choices - emigration out of the region or joining a revolutionary movement,'' said Rensselaer W. Lee, head of Global Advisory Services of Alexandria, Va., a consulting firm working on narcotics issues. 
Mr. Lee said the President's measures ''will expand the range of economic opportunities of these countries, but unless there is a clear incentive to do so, growers will not switch out of coca in large numbers.''
Representative Sam M. Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subcommittee, called the program ''a step in the right direction'' and said, ''I will support it, and I hope that most members of Congress will too.''
The centerpiece is a decision, which will become effective by Presidential proclamation on Aug. 1, to abolish import duties on 67 products, from fresh strawberries to expensive bicycle frames, sold to the United States by the four countries.
United States imports of the designated products from the Andean nations amounted to $26.6 million last year. Lower duties could help stimulate sales by giving those countries an edge over competitors.
For example, Mexico, now the principal exporter of fresh strawberries to the United States, would still have to pay the 1.5 percent tariff on them.
 
Encouraging Alternative Crops
White House officials said the goal of another part of the program, expansion of agricultural assistance to the Andean region, was to encourage alternatives to narcotics production by working with countries in the region to identify products that have a potential for increased production and trade.
Mr. Lee, the narcotics consultant, said possible crops included oranges, avocados, tea, coffee, macadamia nuts and spices. But he noted that the cycle from planting to first harvest for all those crops was longer than the 18 to 24 months for coca.
Mr. Lee said 400 to 500 tons of refined cocaine was exported from Latin America annually, up from 250 tons in 1987. He placed at $9 billion to $10 billion what Latin American drug traffickers now earned from this trade.
The extension of duty-free access comes under the so-called Generalized System of Preferences, an already existing program of special trade privileges that the United States gives to 130 developing countries.
Mr. Bush has also announced his intention to seek early Congressional approval for a tariff preference system for the four countries, patterned after the Caribbean Basin Initiative, further broadening duty-free access.
 
Expansion of Existing Program
For the past half-dozen years, the United States has allowed most products made in Caribbean and Central American countries to enter duty-free. So-called sensitive products, such as textiles and footwear with important domestic production, are excluded from the preferences.
The proposed Andean preference zone would complement existing programs of economic assistance and drug control, the White House said.
On June 27 the Bush Administration announced as its ultimate goal a free-trade system in North, Central and South America. In other words, there would be no duties on any commercial exchanges within the hemisphere.
The United States recently negotiated such a zone with Canada and is moving towards similar negotiations with Mexico.
The Bush Administration has also said it is prepared to forgive a substantial portion of the $12 billion that Latin American countries owe the United States Government and to announce plans for creation of a $300 million fund to encourage Latin nations to open their economies to foreign investment.

HEADLINE: Rift Over Water On Indian Land Has Deep Roots

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOTEVILLA, Ariz.

 BODY:
From the edge of this Hopi Indian village on the rim of the Third Mesa, with hot white sky and parched high desert as far as the eye can see, the splash of cool water can be heard.
A steep climb down the cliff, two village girls with buckets are at play in a spring that bursts from deep within the sandstone. The spring is one of several that are at the heart of a bitter dispute over water rights here on the Hopi and Navajo reservations.
The struggle is a classic treaty dispute that involves a clash of cultures between the Indians - for whom the springs are a source of both irrigation and spiritual identity - and the Peabody Coal Company of St. Louis, which uses underground water to flush crushed coal through a pipeline to a power station in Nevada.
Company officials voice exasperation at the dispute, saying they have fulfilled their side of a longstanding mining contract with the Indians and have satisfied all conditions for its indefinite extension. ''We've played by the rules,'' said Edward Sullivan, the company's Western Division vice president for legal and public affairs. 
 
'Water Is Our Life'
In the past, the contract was renewed at five-year intervals with little attention. But one of the most prolonged droughts in memory has made water more precious. The Hopis say the pumping is depleting the underground springs that for hundreds of years have allowed them to live and farm around their arid mesas. In a broader sense, they say the pumping, contract or no contract, is draining away their culture. They want the coal company to find another source of water or another way to transport the coal.
''That water is our life; it is our blood; it is the blood of the Hopi,'' said Jerry Honawa, one of the 800 residents of this village 40 miles from the mine. Below him the village girls splashed water into tiny plots of corn, radishes, carrots, beans, onions and squash.
''If Peabody continues drawing the water from under us, the whole earth will dry up and we will not be able to do any farming,'' he said. ''And in essence, we will begin to dry up.''
As argued before the Department of the Interior by lawyers and hydrologists for both sides, the dispute involves questions of the mine's potential effect on the environment.
Peabody is seeking what is called a ''life of the mine'' permit to maintain operations at the 20-year-old Black Mesa-Kayenta Mine. The permit would allow it to indefinitely continue pumping 1.4 billion gallons of water a year from an underground lake, or aquifer, to flush crushed coal through the pipeline.
The 273-mile pipeline carries about five million tons of coal a year from the Black Mesa mine around the Grand Canyon to the Mohave Generating Station near Laughlin, Nev. From there, lines supply much of the power used in Los Angeles and Southern California.
A separate rail line transports seven million tons of coal a year from the adjoining Kayenta mine to the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz.
The Indians are contesting the results of a five-year environmental study for the department's Office of Surface Mining, which concluded that the pumping caused ''no material damage'' to the water source, thousands of feet underground, or to the springs.
Opposing experts disagree over whether the springs are connected to the aquifer, or whether they are suffering solely from the drought.
On July 6, under intense lobbying by both sides, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. agreed to an indefinite delay in granting the permit sought by the mining company, to allow time for further study. His decision only intensified feelings. Indians Collect Millions ''They'll never be satisfied,'' Mr. Sullivan said of the Indians. He said Peabody had done everything asked for by both the tribes and the Government, including participating in the environmental study.
Last year, he said, annual company payments for mining rights totaled $10 million to the Hopis and $23 million to the Navajos. ''We are a business. We make economic decisions,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''The Hopi tribe is not a business. They don't make economic decisions. Their chairman indicates that this is a moral issue. I disagree with him.''
Speaking of the question of environmental damage, Vernon Masayesva, the Hopi tribal chairman, framed the dispute in much the same terms. ''When they set the damage criteria, they set just economic criteria,'' he said. ''They didn't set cultural damage criteria. When we see this amount of water being pumped, it bothers our conscience.''
In Hotevilla, the village elders, some of whom say the springs were planted by their forefathers, tend to the community's conscience. Still practicing the ancient rituals in this unpaved settlement of low stone dwellings and sacred spirit houses, they have forbidden the introduction of electricity or piped water, in part to preserve the ''hard life'' that the Hopis say will keep them close to their creator.
It is important, the elders say, that their water come from pure underground springs, and that their food come from their own farms. For fuel, glistening black piles of Peabody coal lie beside the sloping dirt paths.
''It is our religious responsibility to take care of the earth for the Creator,'' Mr. Honawa said. ''He offered everything that is on this earth. We have to use it moderately and not get greedy. We have to intervene somewhere and be the spokesperson for the Creator.''
The tribal council, for whom the Peabody payments make up close to 80 percent of the operating budget, is not seeking to close the mine. But it is demanding that the company use water from another source, or replace the slurry with new technology using methanol or with a railway.
 
Specialist Studies Springs
In its campaign to moderate Peabody's use of water, the Hopi tribal council has hired Steve Blodgett, a reclamation specialist, who spends part of his time exploring the area's springs, seeps and washes for surface signs of damage to the underground lake. Although the mines are on land shared by the Navajos and Hopis, it is the Hopis, with their traditional settlements and allegiance to the underground springs, rather than the more nomadic Navajos, who have been leading the battle against Peabody.
''What it comes down to is a gray area,'' Mr. Blodgett said as he walked along the twisting ''water caves'' carved eons ago into Blue Canyon by currents that he said emerged from the aquifer. ''The reality is that in a system this large, with as few data as you have, the only conclusion you can come to is you don't know.''
The Environmental Protection Agency, in a response to the report by the Office of Surface Mining, also said insufficient data had been collected to conclude that no environmental damage was being done.
In such a case, Mr. Blodgett said, the Department of the Interior is required by law to err on the side of environmental protection.
''If they keep on pumping and the government is wrong, the Hopi and Navajo people living around here are going to have to leave,'' he said.
 
Generations of Mistrust
At the village of Moenkopi, whose name in the Hopi language means ''the place where the water flows,'' Lewis Numkena, a 63-year-old farmer, described the generations of bewilderment and mistrust that have contributed to the Hopis' concern about the Peabody mine:
''My father said: 'I've learned a lot of things.' The white man can talk to you to make you do things. He can trick you into doing things with all this sweet talk.'
''My father told me that in the future, the white man is going to be starting to come in and he's going to grab what he can. Before you know it, this place is going to be full of white men, and they'll push you aside and say, 'This is mine.' ''

HEADLINE: Health Chief Rules Out Big Growth in Programs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The Secretary of Health and Human Services today denounced ''those who call for a radical revamping of our health-care system,'' but he said the Bush Administration was looking for new ways to protect some of the 31 million Americans who lack health insurance.
In a speech in Atlanta, the first of a series that he plans on the subject, the Secretary, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, laid out the basic elements of the Administration's health policy. ''In an era of Federal fiscal constraints,'' he said, ''government dollars will never supplant private insurance.''
Likewise, he rejected Congressional efforts to require employers to provide workers with a package of basic health insurance benefits. 
''By adding overly burdensome mandates on business, we could retard economic growth and constrict employment opportunities,'' Dr. Sullivan said in the speech to the Atlanta Business Roundtable. ''Without job creation -or worse, with job destruction - we could end up with more, rather than fewer, persons lacking health insurance. If one does not have a job, one does not have access to employer-sponsored health care.''
Dr. Sullivan left the door open to unspecified incremental changes, but he ruled out a major expansion of Federal health programs of the type proposed recently by a 15-member bipartisan commission headed by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia.
 
Talking to the People
Dr. Sullivan said he was beginning ''a conversation with the American people on what they want from our health-care system and what we're willing to pay.''
In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 31, President Bush said he was asking Dr. Sullivan to ''lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health-care system.'' Mr. Bush, like some of his predecessors, said he was ''committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control.''
Dr. Sullivan has asked the Under Secretary of Health and Human Services, Constance Horner, to supervise the review of the way Americans pay for care provided by doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.
He said that there was no place for ''nationalized medicine'' in the United States, and that Canada's experience with a national health plan was of little relevance to this country.
''At a time when most Americans are receiving the finest health care in the world, I find it remarkable to hear some people proposing that we scrap the system and make a radical reform to nationalized medicine,'' Dr. Sullivan said. ''They often point to Canada as a model. But the Canadian system has some very serious problems, including long waiting lists for critical medical procedures and de facto rationing. This, I contend, would never suit Americans.'' More Preventive Services? In March, Senator Rockefeller's group, the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, recommended a program to provide health insurance and long-term care to all Americans who need such coverage. The panel did not specify how to pay the extra Federal cost of such care, estimated at $66 billion a year.
Last week the commission voted to recommend that the Federal Government help low-income elderly people pay Medicare charges, and it said Medicare should be expanded to pay for more preventive services.
In addition, the panel called for new Federal standards to eliminate abuses in the sale of commercial insurance supplementing Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
Dr. Sullivan said he accepted the premise that ''everyone should be able to obtain necessary health care.'' But he said, ''the present private-public health system should be the primary means by which we achieve this goal.''
Thus, he said, private health insurers should not be squeezed out of the market by expansion of Federal health programs. Rather, he said, ''more Americans should be able to obtain health insurance,'' and ''the nation's health care must remain essentially a free-market system.''
''Those who call for a radical revamping of our health-care system, suggesting nationalized medicine, are mistaken,'' Dr. Sullivan said. ''We need to build on our achievements by getting an even higher percentage of people covered by insurance, rather than replacing our system with something that Americans do not need and would not tolerate.''

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With Legalizing Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The call for drug legalization by Jann S. Wenner, publisher of Rolling Stone magazine (''Drug War: Another Vietnam,'' Op-Ed, June 23), shows dangerous ignorance about our nation's drug crisis.
Mr. Wenner asks alarmingly: ''Would legalization produce a flood of new addicts? With crack, which is abhorred by society at large, this question is simply irrelevant.'' Yet how can this be irrelevant if addicts are dying due to crack use while we choose to look the other way? ''Abhorred by society at large?'' The society to which Mr. Wenner refers is obviously not the one being oppressed by the drug pushers who control the streets and corrupt young minds before antidrug education programs can reach them - that is, if these communities are fortunate enough to have such programs. Many do not, but what child would pay attention to warnings by a Government that gave up the fight against drugs? Many people would wish the problem away by legalizing illicit drugs, thus abolishing the black market. Unfortunately, this vision is unrealistic and deadly. 
Mr. Wenner states, ''Legalization would eliminate the inner-city violence associated with competitive drug dealing.'' Under legalization, drugs will be cheaper and readily accessible, which will in turn increase use and the number of addicts. He concedes this, stating, ''If the legalization of drugs will result in a few more abusers, let us accept the consequences.'' Although illegal drug trafficking violence will be gone, a new crime source will be created from this influx of new addicts. Hyperactive reactions to such drugs as cocaine will spur criminal behavior.
In addition to escalating health costs under any scheme of legalization, what type of health care for addicts would we provide? Mr. Wenner offers, ''Most middle-class Americans have access to a social safety net.'' What about the poverty-stricken people in whose cities deaths from drug abuse exceed those in middle-class areas? Addicts who stay in treatment have a better chance of reducing their drug dependency, and under legal compulsion, they stay in the programs longer, reducing dependency and often becoming working members of society. Under legalization, with no legal compulsion, addicts will not pay much attention to warnings by clinicians, much less become involved in the long-range treatment vital to calming dependency.

HEADLINE: New York City Needs Strategic Planning to Keep From Drifting

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The recently approved New York City budget contains many sensible compromises and unavoidable disappointments. But the failure to appropriate funds for the Office of Strategic Planning in the City Planning Department makes no sense at all.
For years, the members of the Civic Affairs Forum, 40 of the city's leading civic groups, urged creation of such an office. Finally, Mayor Edward I. Koch established it in 1988. Its demise betrays startling shortsightedness on the part of Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration. 
The City Planning Commission was created in 1938 to provide the long-range citywide view, but over the years, the city has been slow to uncover and respond to fundamental changes. These changes have been lost in the noise of crisis management, the detail of hands-on planning and the traps of mere project and program review. In examining the city's planning process and its results, the Civic Affairs Forum has found, again and again, cases where the city has been shortsighted or caught needlessly off guard.
Some examples:
* The failure to treat mass transit as the lifeline of the city's economy.
* The deterioration of the city's physical infrastructure.
* The multiple crisis of waste disposal: solid, liquid and air borne.
* The impact on the city's economy of major technological changes.
* The mismatch between education, training and employment.
* The unmet income, service and housing needs of the poor, which have contributed to the alarming rise in homelessness.
Too often, the city has failed to shape a future that only leadership can create - opportunities to be discovered through a long and broader view of issues and options. Opportunities that could be advanced through comprehensive planning for employment, housing, waterfront development and other areas. Even when changes and opportunities have finally been acknowledged, action has been limited, weak in resources, scattered and poorly coordinated.
The Office of Strategic Planning should be reinstated with these responsibilities:
* To spot opportunities, project trends - technological, demographic, social, economic, environmental -and describe their implications.
* To identify, in light of opportunities and trends, program areas that require special planning action.
* To coordinate development of plans and secure firm, long-term commitments to carry them out.
Strategic planning is not a luxury and not deferable. Without it, New York City will fall far short of its potential. At worst, it will be overwhelmed by market forces, outwitted by international, interregional and intermunicipal competition and be defenseless against the inertia of business as usual and the local politics of ''not in my backyard.'' We therefore strongly urge Mayor Dinkins to restore funds for the Office of Strategic Planning.

HEADLINE: The S & L Horror Show: Act II

BYLINE: By Charles Schumer; Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, is a member of the House Banking Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As an outraged public reviews the first act of the savings and loan disaster - a horror show of swindling, administrative delusions and Congressional and regulatory bungling - the curtain is rising on yet another gruesome sight: the execution of the bailout itself.
Act II of the savings and loan fiasco actually began the moment the bailout law was passed in August 1989. The bill, known as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, or Firrea, was a complicated scheme of regulations and relief. The law was supposed to carefully direct tens of billions of dollars into sick thrifts under the close scrutiny of the Administration. But almost immediately, the Bush Administration, including the President himself, ignored the bailout in hopes it would take care of itself. 
A year of delay and inattention has taken a heavy toll. Several voices are calling out orders but no single hand is on the steering wheel. No one can guess the ultimate price tag for this confusion, but the $40 billion to $80 billion of new money that, last month, Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady said he needed is only a down payment.
It is no exaggeration to say that the dollar costs of the bailout are rising by the minute. This is an emergency. While it is a cliche that there is enough blame to go around for the savings and loan ripoff, there are some things that, at this point, only the President can do. How can the damage be contained? Put the bailout on budget - now. When the cost of the bailout was placed off-budget, the American people lost. Interest payments on this money are going to cost taxpayers at least $300 billion over the next 40 years.
Almost more disheartening, putting the cleanup off-budget whetted the ambition of many Administration officials to sweep the thrift crisis under the rug. Some now want ''continuous authorization'' of bailout funds - a fine print way of guaranteeing that politicians will never again have to ask, publicly, for new money to cover mounting costs.
Delay and deception have already cost this country dearly; the President must move to restore credibility to the bailout process. An on-budget cleanup would save taxpayers billions of dollars and show the nation that from now on the bailout will be dealt with openly and expeditiously. Centralize authority. We are in a crisis that will cost more than all of World War II. Like a war, the thrift cleanup desperately needs a five-star general to lead it. Bureaucratic turf fights are diverting energy from the task and destroying the morale of many valuable public servants. The health of the economy is at stake.
The Resolution Trust Corporation, which must successfully and carefully dispose of tens of billions of dollars in seized assets, needs decisive, central leadership. I recommend to Mr. Bush that he make a very humble phone call to its chairman, L. William Seidman, and not only beg him to remain in his job but strengthen his authority.
The plain-speaking Mr. Seidman is being undermined and forced out by White House backbiting and press leaks, yet he is the only man with the experience, skill and integrity to prudently, but efficiently, run the monstrous R.T.C. Mr. Bush ought to realize - fast - that he cannot afford to lose him.
If Mr. Seidman cannot be persuaded to stay past the expiration of his term in October, a search for a replacement with the same superior qualifications cannot be delayed.
Implement clear guidelines for the speedy disposition of assets. For too long, the R.T.C. has lacked simple procedures to carry out some of its most fundamental transactions. We cannot afford a trial-by-error bail-out.
Bureaucrats in the bowels of the regulatory agencies, shell-shocked by the scandal, have been afraid to make even easy decisions without guidelines from above. As a result, thousands of those interested in buying R.T.C. properties and institutions cannot get facts or answers to simple questions, costing the taxpayers untold millions as the value of these assets declines daily.
For seven months, when the Bush Administration had 413 insolvent thrifts under its conservatorship, it made only 66 mostly small deals that were badly flawed. Rather than sell a thrift whole, and give the purchaser responsibility for managing the assets, the R.T.C. too often sold only the lucrative corporate shell. The Government is absorbing heavy losses.
The $169 billion estimate of how much the bailout will cost assumes no errors in management. A vastly strengthened R.T.C. leadership must quickly formulate strict and consistent rules for the disposal of the taxpayers' property.
George Bush might not have imagined the size of the savings and loan mess when he campaigned for President. But if the chaos continues to mushroom, he - and the voters -will have no one else to blame.

HEADLINE: Rinfret Attacks Cuomo Fiscal Policies

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
The Cuomo administration is ''burning the furniture for firewood'' by borrowing extensively, using one-time revenues to fill budget gaps and dipping into state reserve funds, Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican candidate for governor, said yesterday.
Issuing a comprehensive review of the state's borrowing, Mr. Rinfret, an economic forecaster, said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's fiscal policies had produced $18 billion in borrowing in the last eight years, or $1,056 for every state resident - more than any of 26 states have borrowed in their entire histories.
''Can anyone doubt our state finances are out of control?'' asked Mr. Rinfret. ''Can anyone doubt that we are mortgaging our future?'' 
''We are burning the furniture for firewood in Albany, putting unneeded burdens on ourselves and future generations, all to keep up the pretense that the Governor knows how to manage the state's affairs,'' he said.
Mr. Rinfret's six-page single-spaced document, released at news conferences in Manhattan and Albany, represented a major plank in his campaign platform, which seeks to emphasize the Democratic Governor's fiscal shortcomings and Mr. Rinfret's strength as an economist.
Last week, Mr. Rinfret issued his first campaign paper on state spending and taxes, which he said were the highest in the nation.
 
'An Orgy of Borrowing'
Much of the language of yesterday's document was couched in the lively, unbureacratic idioms that Mr. Rinfret, as a writer on economics, was known for before he entered the political arena two months ago.
He described the Cuomo fiscal policies in terms like ''raiders of the lost reserves,'' ''spending 21st-century money today,'' ''cadging and pilfering'' and ''an orgy of borrowing.''
Governor Cuomo's press secretary, Gary Fryer, said he could not respond in detail yesterday but described the Rinfret paper as ''warmed over Assembly Republican minority propaganda.''
In his analysis, Mr. Rinfret divided the state's borrowing into several categories: borrowing approved by the voters under the State Constitution, ''backdoor'' borrowing by authorities that does not require voter approval, rolling over short-term debt from year to year, tapping reserves of various state agencies, refinancing debt at higher interest rates, reducing pension fund payments and selling off capital assets.
His language was reminiscent of Democratic attacks on Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, for his ''backdoor'' financing of the State University system, the Empire State Plaza in Albany and other capital projects.
 
'Whole Sordid Mess'
Mr. Rinfret spelled out year by year the ''whole sordid mess,'' starting in 1985 with what he called a $255 million ''windfall'' by having the state's Urban Development Corporation borrow money for new prison construction and refinancing existing prisons that had already been paid for.
A year later, he said, the state 'raided'' the State Insurance Fund for $325 million, the first of a series of withdrawals from that fund that now amount to $875 million, and the Battery Park City Authority for $69 million.
In 1987, ''like a confirmed kleptomaniac,'' the administration again borrowed from the insurance fund, $133 million from the tax reserve fund and $53 million from the State University bond reserve fund, Mr. Rinfret said.
In 1988, the state insurance fund was again tapped, along with $110 million from the Aggregate Trust Fund, a workers' compensation reserve, and $32 million from the State Dormitory Authority and other authorities. The state also raised $123 million by remortgaging the Empire State Plaza and also issued $460 million in short-term bonds that were supposed to be paid off within that year.
''As revenues continued to fall behind spending, Cuomo began breaking open every piggy bank in sight,'' Mr. Rinfret said of 1989. The State Insurance Fund, the Aggregate Trust Fund, the Hazardous Waste Remedial Fund, the Housing Finance Agency and the Court Facilities Fund were ''raided'' for a total of more than $356 million. The previous year's $460 million short-term borrowing was rolled over and $850 million added to it, he said.
 
Deferred Payments
Mr. Rinfret said the current year's ''one shot'' revenues include deferred payments to the State Employees Pension Fund and a formula change in the Teachers Retirement System; refinancing of State and City University debt, probably at higher interest rates; a $150 million Battery Park City Authority loan, with the proceeds going to New York City; the surrender of below-market-rate leases at the World Trade Center for $200 million, and a plan to sell the Cross-Westchester Expressway to the State Thruway Authority for $200 million. The nonrecurring revenues totaled $1.8 billion.
Mr. Rinfret brushed off the State Senate Republican majority's approval of these ''gimmicks'' by arguing that Mr. Cuomo was the state's chief executive.
''The present Governor has failed by every standard,'' Mr. Rinfret said. ''His 'compassion' has only been a cover for his inability to manage the state's affairs. If he spends us into bankruptcy, everyone - rich and poor - will suffer.''

HEADLINE: Faldo Uses Dedication To Reach Higher Levels

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

DATELINE: ST. ANDREWS, Scotland, July 23

 BODY:
Nick Faldo calls it ''the circle,'' a personal continuum that begins with dedication and leads to improvement, spawning renewed enthusiasm for his simple but all-consuming goal: to be the best golfer in the world.
In the four years since Faldo first closed this inspirational circle, it has become concentrically smaller and more rapid, particularly when a major championship is at its center. On Sunday, a glorious day at the Old Course, Faldo scored the fourth and best bull's-eye of his career by winning the 119th British Open by five shots.
''If you are constantly working on things, trying to get better, it's a great pressure release,'' Faldo explained today for journalists looking for an answer to the flawless consistency he exhibited for four rounds at St. Andrews. ''You see improvement, you stay focused on small goals, and you keep ticking along. It's all part of the circle.'' 
Faldo will still be on a rapid spin cycle in two weeks, when he arrives in Birmingham, Ala., to try to win the P.G.A. Championship at Shoal Creek Country Club. If he conquers the oppressive humidity likely there and the just-as-uncomfortable pressure of expectations, he will become the first player to win three major championships in one year since Ben Hogan won the Masters, the United States Open and the British Open in 1953.
 
Putt That Missed
But for a lipped-out 15-foot birdie putt on the 72d hole at the United States Open at Medinah in June that would have earned him a spot in a playoff with Hale Irwin and Mike Donald, Faldo might have been shooting at the ultimate bull's-eye at Shoal Creek: the modern Grand Slam.
''It's very difficult, but it's not impossible,'' Faldo said today of the Grand Slam. ''David Leadbetter said at the beginning of the year that I was capable of winning two majors a year, which I thought at the time was unbelievable.''
But Faldo has done just that, combining his victory at the Masters in April with his victory Sunday. And the key may be Leadbetter, a teacher whom Faldo went to in 1985 when he was a highly successful but, by his own standards, incomplete golfer. The previous year, Faldo had failed in the final rounds of the Masters, the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship, and he wanted a swing that would hold up in the majors.
 
Swing Is Upgraded
Leadbetter rated Faldo's swing, then very wristy, at ''about a 6'' on a scale of 10, and told him it would take two years to get results. The English golfer then showed the dedication that distinguishes him by agreeing to do whatever it took. And after two indifferent seasons, right on schedule, Faldo won the 1987 British Open at Muirfield and then the Masters in 1989.
Leadbetter now ranks Faldo's swing ''a 9 1/2, sometimes a 10,'' and says Faldo is the most knowledgeable practicioner of the golf swing he has ever worked with.
''He's like a building now,'' Leadbetter said recently. ''All I'm doing now is giving him a lick of paint or touching up a crack.''
As he proved at St. Andrews, Faldo possesses a swing that is extremely economical for a long-limbed man who stands 6 feet 3 inches tall. He maneuvered his wood and iron shots over and around the treacherous sands and gorse of the Old Course with so much control that he seemed immune to the ancient ground's often capricious bounces.
''It seems unbelievable that I went through all that searching so recently, it seems moons ago,'' Faldo said.
But Faldo, who turned 33 years old last Wednesday, still believes he has a lot of learning to do.
 
Age No Factor
''The way I've progressed in the last three years has nothing to do with age,'' he said. ''Really, I think I can compete at the top level for the rest of this decade.''
With his recent accomplishments, the temptations to break his inspirational circle will be great. Faldo's agent, John Simpson of International Management Group, said today that his client's British Open victory Sunday would eventually be worth $10 million in income. In a few weeks, Faldo is planning to start a golf-course-design company that will charge about $1 million per project, and his tournament appearance fees, already near $100,000 per event in Europe or Japan, will also increase.
To further concentrate on the four major championships, Faldo said, he will reduce his playing schedule from the 30 tournaments he will play this year to about 25 next year. A maximum of only 10 of those will be in the United States.
 
Avoiding a 'Burnout'
''Eventually I will cut back drastically,'' Faldo said. ''It's all part of our plan not to rush around. There will be no burnout because I won't get pushed when I don't want to go.''
In the meantime, the circle will continue.
''I don't like to think about whether I'm the best player in the game,'' Faldo said Sunday after his victory. ''It's so much of a week-to-week thing; it's better to simply be concerned with improving. But when it's over, I'd most like to be remembered as someone who could really play the game. I want people to say in years to come: 'Did you see Nick Faldo play in his heyday? I did, and it was quite something.' ''
And even if Faldo never wins another championship, those who saw him at St. Andrews in 1990 will be able to say just that.

HEADLINE: Mighty Fire Ants March Out of the South

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex.

 BODY:
IN the annals of entomological villainy, few insects are as despised, as feared and as meticulously investigated as the tiny imported fire ant, which attacks humans, animals, plants, other insects and even electrical devices.
Government and private researchers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in unsuccessful efforts to eradicate the ferocious little arthropod, which is no larger than the ''G'' at the start of this sentence. Scientists are mapping its mitochondrial DNA and studying its most intimate chemical scents. Frustrated homeowners spend tens of millions more on the counterattack, with tactics ranging from pesticides to electric prods, even fighting fire ants with fire.
Yet true to its name, Solenopsis invicta, from the Latin for ''invincible,'' has marched through the South like General Sherman. From its initial pincer-hold in Mobile, Ala., where it arrived on a ship from South America half a century ago, invicta now infests 250 million acres in 11 Southern states. 
Researchers say it has just established a successful colony in Santa Barbara, Calif., its first foray into the country's richest agricultural state. Entomologists say invicta also seems to be undergoing a fundamental evolution in its social system, establishing giant colonies with multiple queens instead of the smaller and more manageable single-queen colonies that had been characteristic.
''It's just a matter of time before we have fire ant infestations in California and Arizona that we cannot control,'' said Dr. William P. MacKay, a specialist in ant ecology and systematics at the Fire Ant Laboratory at Texas A & M University here. ''It's going to go all the way up the West Coast, all the way to Washington State.'' Colonies have been found as far north as Virginia.
The ant's inexorable spread has occurred not only in spite of, but partly because of, nearly four decades of determined campaigns to eradicate it with chemical pesticides. Through it all, the fire ant has thrived because the pesticides destroyed its enemies and paved the way for far larger colonies than had previously existed. An airborne pesticide assault in the 1960's and 70's, designed to eradicate the ant from American soil, has been described by the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson as ''the Vietnam of entomology.'' A more modest attempt to control the ant with pesticide applications on the ground also failed.
The campaigns backfired, many entomologists say, because the efforts to kill invicta with the chemicals chlordane, heptachlor, dieldrin and mirex were effective only in wiping out the ant's natural enemies, principally other ant species, and parasites, thus making it easier for the ant to spread.
The pesticides also killed birds and other non-target species. Mirex, in particular, left significant residues in human and animal tissues. Mirex was determined to be a possible human carcinogen in 1977, and the Government's aerial spraying was halted in 1978.
Today, in a reversal, most state and Federal agencies now discourage the use of pesticides against the ant. They urge the public to learn to live with the ant, which is more a nuisance than a health hazard, and they hold out hope that scientists will enlist beneficial organisms to attack the ants or develop new compounds to disrupt their reproduction.
But agriculture officials said there was again growing pressure from farmers and ranchers to explore the option of spraying. The cost of such a new program would be prohibitive, the officials said.
Adversity seems to have brought invicta new strength. Initially the species had a single queen ant in each colony, and each colony was fiercely territorial. As a result, researchers said, the average density of infestation was rarely greater than 20 or 30 mounds an acre.
But researchers have recently found that single-queen colonies are being driven out by ''supercolonies'' containing multiple queens and tens of millions of workers. Researchers do not know what is causing the change, but they note that the older single-queen colonies, which were a nuisance, are now viewed as the best defense against the newer, more powerful colonies, which are an economic disaster.
In Texas, where the multiple-queen colonies now outnumber single-queen colonies, densities of 450 mounds an acre have been reported. In a draft report prepared for the Texas Fire Ant Advisory Board, the state Department of Agriculture estimated that fire ants caused $47 million in crop losses and pest control expenses in the state last year.
No national loss figures are available. ''We don't see any hope at this point of eliminating the pest from the United States,'' said William A. Banks, a fire ant researcher at the United States Department of Agriculture's fire ant research service in Gainesville, Fla. ''The hope is that we can find better ways of coping, so that we can learn to live with it.''
 
If Bite's Bad, Sting's Worse
The prospect of peaceful co-existence with invicta is hard for many Southerners to accept, especially for those who know its sting, which is often mistakenly referred to as a bite. The ant does bite, but only to anchor itself while it stings. Unlike bees, which eviscerate themselves with each sting, the fire ant stings repeatedly with a gusto that belies its size.
The bite is sometimes felt as a minor irritation, but the sting is immediately sensed as a burning sensation, worse than a mosquito bite but not as painful as a bee sting. It is common for people to be stung many times, since the ants are highly aggressive and swarm onto an intruder in seconds. Some victims have reported suffering hundreds of stings.
A sting later results in redness and swelling and, because invicta injects bacteria along with its alkaloid venom, creates a small pustule on the skin. The pustule, typically the size of a pinhead, later causes itching, and sometimes the pustules leave small brown scars that last for months.
Fire ant stings are potentially fatal to people who are allergic to bee stings and other venoms. Ryan Wingard, a 2-year-old in Anderson, Tex., nearly died in May when he was stung by fire ants in his yard. His mother noticed that he was having trouble breathing, and soon Ryan's lips turned blue, his tongue swelled and red blotches appeared on his body. He was rushed to the hospital and treated for a severe allergic reaction. For Ryan and many others in the South, playing or picnicking in the grass is now just a memory.
''I went to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic and watched people popping up like popcorn, slapping their legs,'' said Dr. Edward Vargo, an entomologist studying fire ants at the University of Texas's Balcones Research Center in Austin.
 
Indiscriminating Palate
Dr. Vargo noted that the multiple-queen colonies can be elaborate structures that comprise hundreds of mounds covering dozens of acres, allowing worker ants - sterile females - to forage with astonishing efficiency. ''Basically, anything that stands still for longer than 15 or 20 seconds is fire ant food,'' he said.
Food, to a fire ant, is a broad term. Its diet includes everything from insects to germinating crop seeds to the rubber expansion joints on highway bridges. The ants feed day or night, as long as the temperature is 70 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.
The impact on the ecology is especially worrisome to researchers, who note that invicta drives out other ant and insect species, including native fire ants, which are less aggressive. Increasingly, landowners say the ants are driving off ground-nesting birds, lizards, rabbits and larger wildlife. The Small Animal Clinic in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A & M has treated 28 fawns this year for severe fire ant stings.
Because invicta is omnivorous, it also has some benefits. Invicta attacks corn worms, boll weevils and other costly agricultural pests, and is actually welcomed on cotton and sugar cane fields. The fire ant has also shown a fondness for fleas. However, ''Using fire ants to control the flea population does seem a lot like trading a headache for an upset stomach,'' said Kathy Palma, a researcher at Texas A & M. Fire ants do not live by food alone, Dr. MacKay at Texas A & M reported. He has found that the ant is attracted to electrical fields, the stronger the better. It is common for the ants to swarm on electrical relay switches inside air-conditioning units, until their charred bodies cause a short circuit. Municipal officials throughout Texas say fire ants are the leading cause of traffic light failures. Telephone companies say the ants can knock out switching devices. Dr. MacKay said the ants have been found in aircraft altimeters, in computers, and even in the electronic gear in boats and submarines.
The ants are aquatic at times, stinging people in swimming pools and rivers. In flood conditions hundreds or thousands of workers will form a living raft to carry the queen and her larvae to safety. Some researchers suggest that such living rafts will help carry invicta west.
 
Fatal Mating Flight
More commonly, the ants hitchhike in shipments of grass sod, trees and other nursery stock. They also spread as the queens seek new homes after their mysterious nuptial flights. Only queens and males develop wings, and because fire ants do not mate in captivity, and because it is difficult to observe tiny insects frolicking 500 to 800 feet in the air, researchers surmise that the mating is airborne.
On the first sunny day after rain, Southerners can see hundreds of winged male fire ants emerge from the soil and ascend on a sexual kamikaze mission. They fly only once, rising to several hundred feet, where they compete to mate with a flying queen who has summoned them by some unknown chemical signal. Only one will succeed, and then all the males, perhaps exhausted, fall back to earth to their deaths.
''If they mate they die happy, and if they don't, they die anyway,'' said Dr. Daniel Clair, an urban pest management specialist with the Texas Department of Agriculture.
The fertilized queen sheds her wings, burrows and either starts a new colony or joins an existing one. She stores the sperm from her nuptial flight, and for the next five or six years produces offspring, often laying her own weight in eggs each day.
Chastened by the failure of pesticides, researchers are focusing on two areas: chemical growth regulators and biological controls.
Dr. Vargo and others are trying to isolate and synthesize the chemical signals, or pheromones, given off by invicta queens. Pheromones are chemicals that act on other individuals, unlike hormones, which act within an individual.
 
Wanted: an Enemy
Among the queen pheromones of particular interest to researchers are signals that cause workers to assassinate rival queens and signals that keep immature females from developing sexually. If such pheromones can be developed, they could disrupt communications in the colony and the ants would eventually die.
The most promising chemical control, said Ronald Mulder of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is fenoxycarb ethyl, essentially a ''birth control'' agent that destroys the ovaries of sexual female ants. It is sold commercially under the brand name Logic and is believed to be much more environmentally safe than pesticides. To the frustration of homeowners, Logic is also slower acting, taking three to six months after a springtime application to take effect.
Dr. MacKay said there was also promise in biological controls. He and other entomologists who have visited invicta's native home in South America found that the ant was much less of a problem there than in the United States.
He said invicta mounds in Brazil are shared by several types of parasitic ants, beetles, wasps and flies. If one of these or some other natural fire ant enemy can be identified as a control agent and brought to the United States, assuming it does not pose a threat worse than fire ants, it could help keep invicta in check.
How about South American anteaters? ''The ones that could do the job are four feet tall with claws that could take your arm off,'' said Mr. Banks of the United States Agriculture Department. ''If we imported enough anteaters to have an impact, in a few years we'd be looking for something to control the anteaters.''

HEADLINE: A Revolution as the Bolshoi Meets Capitalism

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
''I'm the bandit who sold out the Bolshoi Theater,'' Vladimir Kokonin, the 52-year-old general director of Moscow's grand opera house, said in New York the other day. Just joking, of course, he added.
Mr. Kokonin - a musician despite his well-heeled, corporate mien -was defending a commercial agreement that he insists is essential to the future success of the Bolshoi's ballet and opera companies.
The Bolshoi Ballet, which closed in New York on Sunday and continues its United States tour with an opening tonight at Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Va., outside Washington, has already seen the results of Mr. Kokonin's attempt to restructure his organization and its touring. 
This summer, all dancers in the Bolshoi corps are being paid a per-diem allowance of $50, twice as much as in the past. Gone, presumably, are the days when Soviet dancers, saving their daily allowances to buy everything from gold chains to videocassette recorders and computers, ate only canned food from home or very little else. Shopping is still on the company's mind: the first container ship to depart with goods purchased by members of the Bolshoi reportedly carried 14 refrigerators.
 
'A New Atmosphere'
But under a newly negotiated arrangement, the Bolshoi company received, in addition to a higher daily allowance, breakfast every morning at the Ginger Man restaurant near Lincoln Center or two meals there on days off. Charles Dillingham, the president of the Entertainment Corporation, the Bolshoi Ballet's British-American producer, said his organization also provided a daily lunch to the Soviet dancers in the New York State Theater. He added that the company's two-week season there had played ''to over 90 percent capacity, with the last four days sold out.''
''It's a revolution for us,'' Mr. Kokonin said, speaking in Russian in an interview in his hotel over the weekend. ''For the first time, the artists are getting decent pay, by European standards at least. And you see the dancers acting and feeling differently. There is a new atmosphere.''
''The lowest-ranked dancer will get $1,500 in a 30-day period on this tour,'' he continued. '' As for the principals, they will average $1,000 per performance.''
Mr. Kokonin said that in the past, even a Bolshoi veteran like Maya Plisetskaya had to give back 80 percent of her touring fee to Goscontsert, the Soviet Government concert management agency. The Bolshoi Ballet itself could keep only 20 percent, with the rest going to the agency.
 
Three New Goals
Faced with economic change in the Soviet Union, a need to earn hard currency and a political freedom that allows artists to leave for the West, the Bolshoi Theater is trying to achieve three goals that Mr. Kokonin considers crucial to its operation.
One goal is a reform of management procedures to decrease the theater's dependence on state subsidy and allow greater incentives to the Bolshoi's artists: for example, more-competitive pay on tour.
A second objective is to change to the kind of contract system common in the West. The Bolshoi Ballet technically has no power to retain a dancer who leaves for the West, since it has no individual contracts with its dancers. The artists' job security is covered under general Soviet law. At the same time, the theater has needed the assent of the finance and cultural ministries to raise individual salaries, which would be negotiated directly with the dancers under a contract system. The contract arrangement would clarify the relationship between the dancers and management, allowing the latter to retire older artists who have had life tenure under the old system.
A third goal, Mr. Kokonin said, is to remove the influence of the Communist Party committee within the theater from administrative and artistic matters.
''If we do things the old way, the Bolshoi remains a conservative theater, and it will be a theater in crisis,'' he said, ''Things must change.''
 
Rising 'as a Professional'
Trained at the Moscow Conservatory, Mr. Kokonin became a clarinetist in the Bolshoi orchestra. Mikhail Chulaki, a composer who was the Bolshoi Theater's general director, encouraged him to join the Culture Ministry when its head, Yekaterina Furtseva, was ''interested in training young cadres,'' Mr. Kokonin said. Mr. Chulaki told him that if his heart were really with the Bolshoi Theater, he would serve it best by returning in 25 years. ''I did in 23,'' he said.
During the interview, he pointed to a book on a table and noted that he had been reading Talleyrand, but he did not note that that this historical figure in the French Revolution was notorious for changing his political complexion.
Mr. Kokonin said that although he was a member of the Communist Party, he did not rise in the cultural bureaucracy through a party training school but rather ''as a professional.'' His first stint at the ministry was followed by 11 years as artistic director of Goscontsert, followed by a high post with financial responsibilities at the Bolshoi, and then a couple of years at the head of the culture ministry's music department. He was named the Bolshoi's general director in 1988, with overall authority over both the ballet and opera troupes.
Turning to the role of the Communist Party in the theater's management, Mr. Kokonin said: ''As in every Soviet institution, and this is still largely true, the Bolshoi Theater has had two parallel structures: the party committee and an adminstration. The party structure decided who would go on tour or not. There were no limits on its power.''
Asked if his increased authority stems from the chaos of a transitional period, Mr. Kokonin replied immediately: ''No. This is perestroika, which is not a slogan and not just another campaign. It creates a difficult situation, but it gives us the right to work freely. We have a second chance through the restructuring of the economy. The conservatives want to take us back.''
''What I don't want is the aggressiveness that has marked so much of our lives, a repetition of the exclusions aginst Boris Pasternak and Mstislav Rostropovich, but now directed against Yuri Grigorovich. Our theater party secretary would like to banish him as ballet director. But his work is part of our history, and you can't tear out that page. It is part of a single Russian culture.''

HEADLINE: Accor Is Gambling on U.S. Motels

BYLINE: By JACQUES NEHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 23

 BODY:
The $1.3 billion deal by the French hotel and restaurant company Accor S.A. to purchase Motel 6, the Dallas-based chain of economy motels, may be the boldest move yet by two executives already known for their boldness and management skills.
In fact, the pair, Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson, Accor's co-chairmen, are often called the ''dynamic duo'' in the French press. Many industry analysts say they are among the best managers in France in their ability to capture new business with adroit marketing.
The way the two presented their proposal to their 12-member management team reflects their direct style and also their selling ability.
''They told us we could sit on our behinds and just wait for our profit-sharing dividends; that our jobs would become uninteresting and we would probably fall asleep,'' recalls an executive who attended the meeting. ''Or else, they told us, we could make a bold move by buying Motel 6, and provide ourselves a challenge well into the next century. But it was for us to decide, not them.'' 
Not surprising, the outcome of the meeting was the announcement July 13 of Accor's $22.50-a-depository-unit tender offer for Motel 6, which operates 536 motels in 42 states. Depository units trade like common stock but represent shares in a limited partnership.
If the acquisition goes through, as expected, Accor will become the world's biggest hotel owner and operator, ahead of the Marriott Corporation, in terms of rooms under direct management.
''We showed that it was now the time to move, to be the leader in this market not only in Europe, but in the United States,'' Mr. Dubrule said in an interview at Accor's 27th-floor office in Paris. He was alluding to Accor's success with the Formule 1 low-priced motel chain started in 1985 and which now has 142 motels, most of them in France.
The Motel 6 purchase is practically assured because Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company has agreed to sell its remaining 55 percent stake in the motel chain to Accor. Kohlberg, Kravis bought Motel 6 in its entirety in 1985 for $881 million.
Some dissident Motel 6 shareholders have filed suits seeking to block the sale, but an Accor spokesman said, ''We have absolutely no worry about the sale going through.''
Mr. Dubrule, who is 56 years old, and Mr. Pelisson, who is 58, started in business together in 1967, opening their first Novotel hotel, at the Lille airport in northern France. They now sit atop a diversified hotel, food service and leisure group company that reported 1989 sales of 19.9 billion francs, about $3.4 billion.
Accor - a name the men chose in 1983 partly because it sounds just like the French pronunciation of accord, or agreement - operates five major hotel chains: Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure, Ibis/Urbis and Formule 1. It also has several resort hotels. The company's main headquarters are in Evry, a suburb south of Paris.
Accor's American operations include two mid-priced Novotel motels, in New York and New Jersey, and six higher-priced Sofitel hotels, in Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Houston.
The corporation's food operations consist of a variety of restaurants and catering services, including the caterer Lenotre, and a highly profitable restaurant voucher service called Ticket Restaurant, marketed to companies as an employee benefit. The vouchers, which are accepted at most restaurants in France, allow employees to buy lunches at greatly reduced cost.
In addition, Accor has minority stakes in a cruise ship company, seawater therapy health spas, several large French casinos and the Asterix amusement park near Paris.
 
Earnings Surge
Accor's net earnings rose 29 percent last year, to 606.1 million francs ($104.7 million). It was a performance that market analysts have come to expect.
Mr. Dubrule, who worked in the United States in the early 1960's, is described by people who work with him as Accor's leading voice in long-term strategy, employee relations and marketing. Mr. Pelisson, who has a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and served as a top manager at IBM Europe, is respected as an expert with financial figures.
''These guys are pretty smart cookies,'' said Ricaldo Zavala, international director for Magnin S.A., a Paris stockbroker. ''We've seen 20 percent annual growth for the last 15 years, which is a pretty impressive track record.'' He added that Accor was the ''only company in France'' in which earnings could be expected to grow for the next decade.''
With Motel 6, Accor will have some 80,000 employees and will gain a major foothold in the United States, where it has been struggling without much success since 1979. In recent years it has sold off its fledgling Ibis hotels in Texas and Georgia, as well as the Seafood Broiler chain of 28 restaurants in California.
Last year, Accor lost 15 million francs on its remaining United States operations.
The Motel 6 addition will put 131,900 rooms under Accor's management, well ahead of the 109,600 rooms controlled by the Marriott chain. Though Holiday Inn is the world's largest chain, with 350,000 rooms, most of its hotels are franchise operations. Including franchised hotels, Accor will have around 160,000 rooms under its trademarks.
Many analysts said they favored the acquisition.
''This makes a tremendous amount of sense for Accor,'' said Burland B. East, a hotels analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, in Los Angeles. ''The economy lodging business is essentially the only part of the domestic lodging industry that's profitable and growing.''
 
'The Best Lodging Company'
He called Motel 6 ''the best lodging company in the country,'' pointing to occupancy rates of 78 to 80 percent and gross margins of 45 to 50 percent, both significantly above its competitors. He also said Motel 6 management, led by Joseph McCarthy, its chairman, was ''the best in the industry.''
Mr. McCarthy and four top managers have agreed to stay on, according to Accor.
Motel 6, structured in the form of a limited partnership, anticipates revenues in 1990 of $475 million and operating income of more than $220 million.
But Lorna Statham, an analyst with Citicorp Investment Bank in London, questioned the wisdom of a United States acquisition for Accor. She noted that the company would be exposing itself to greater risk of a falling dollar.
''We're seeing a lot of profit warnings from French companies that have expanded into the U.S. in recent years and now are taking a hit,'' Ms. Statham said.
Mr. Pelisson said Accor was investing for the long haul, and even if the dollar fell further, it would likely bounce back eventually. ''If you can't bet long term on the United States, who are you going to bet on?'' he said.
Since the deal was announced, Accor's stock has lost 4.3 percent on the Paris Bourse, closing last week at 995 francs. The decline, analysts said, reflected fears that the company would be saddled with heavy debt, not only to acquire Motel 6 but also in assuming the American company's $980 million in long-term debt, due to rise to $1.4 billion by year-end.
Olivier de Surville, Accor's controller, said the company would try to refinance Motel 6's debt, especially because the company is paying 14 to 17 percent a year. ''This should result in a much better financial situation,'' Mr. de Surville said. To ease the burden, Accor will initially take only a 40 percent stake in a new company that will hold the Motel 6 equity, with the remaining 60 percent to be spread among a group of French and international banks. By exercising convertible debentures in the holding company two or three years from now, Accor will ultimately be able to take majority control.
Mr. Dubrule said Kohlberg, Kravis had started off negotiations asking $30 a share and Accor offering $17, ''but within two hours we arrived at $25 asked by K.K.R. and $20 offered by us.''
 
Expansion Plans
Accor plans to double the expansion rate for Motel 6 motels, which are placed along major highways, adding around 75 units a year, about half of which will be existing motels that will be acquired, renovated and reopened under the Motel 6 name.
With Motel 6, Accor will operate more than 775 economy motels by the end of the year. Executives envision linking the names of Motel 6 and Formule 1 to tap business from low-budget trans-Atlantic travelers.
Formule 1 now has 142 motels with 10,000 rooms and is expanding at the rate of one new motel a week. Accor plans 1,000 motels in the chain by the end of the decade, with a good number of them in Eastern Europe, which Mr. Pelisson considers ripe for the concept.
''There will be a lot of popular tourism in these countries, as well as growing internal movement such as by traveling salesmen for whom $25 is affordable,'' he said.
Formule 1 rooms are much more austere than even those of Motel 6, whose sparse, functional decor is aimed at business travelers on a budget and vacationers trying to save money. For 120 francs a night, Formule 1 lodgers sleep in prefabricated rooms of just 30 square feet each. There is one bathroom for every four rooms.
Even while advancing aggressively in the economy sector, Accor is also moving to reinforce its higher-priced hotel operations and expand into the tourism sector. In June Accor obtained a minority stake in Cie Internationale des Wagon-Lits & du Tourism, a French-Belgian holding company that operates the luxury Pullman hotel chain and a vast network of travel agencies. The company is currently angling for a strong say in management.

HEADLINE: G.M. Goal: Restore Saab's Luster

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROLLHATTAN, Sweden

 BODY:
David J. Herman, the new chief executive of Saab Automobile A.B., faces more than the usual challenge in trying to turn a loss-ridden auto maker into one that can flourish in a crowded luxury car market.
The reason, as the native New Yorker and 17-year veteran of the General Motors Corporation acknowledges, is that not only must he improve Saab's performance to justify G.M.'s 50 percent stake, but he has to take on Sweden's social welfare state while trying. While that system has given workers a high standard of living and almost full employment, it has also delivered a 20 percent turnover and absenteeism.
''It's a paradox that these beautiful, healthy people should call in sick and not come to work,'' Mr. Herman said. ''But when they do come to work, they build high-quality'' products. ''So if you get that right, boy, you could really do something.'' 
To create an incentive for Swedes to work harder, the Social Democratic Government is slashing sky-high income tax rates while a debate rages about other steps to take. Mr. Herman, who joined Saab in January, has no intention of sitting on the sidelines.
He has no choice. At stake is not just the $600 million that General Motors paid to Saab-Scania A.B. for a 50 percent interest in Saab Automobile and the $100 million that G.M. injected into it. There is also G.M.'s future in luxury cars, a category in which the leading American car maker has been unsuccessful in Europe. A rejuvenated Saab could also help G.M. in the United States, where its Cadillac line, although on the rebound, lacks appeal to young, affluent professionals.
Mr. Herman's mission is to prove that G.M. was right in not seeking more of a sure thing: Jaguar P.L.C., the British car company that the Ford Motor Company bought last year after G.M., Jaguar's preferred partner, decided the price was too rich.
Some analysts think Ford's payment of $2.38 billion for Jaguar was far too high. Others say the Jaguar name is priceless. Saab has larger and more modern production capacity, they say, but its name does not carry the same cachet.
''Saab is a European name that has stood for high technology, performance and individuality,'' said Robert N. Murray, editor of Autocar and Motor, a British magazine for car enthusiasts. ''What Saab hasn't stood for is out-and-out luxury.''
Mr. Herman's financial strategy is to slash Saab's production costs, and his marketing strategy is to push Saab more firmly into the luxury car segment. There he hopes to compete against the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz by positioning Saabs as lower-priced alternatives.
Plans call for three models to be introduced by the mid-1990's. A replacement for the 900 line, which will sell for $17,000 to $25,000, is scheduled for late 1993. Next will be a top-of-the-line model, priced at $35,000 to $55,000, which will be positioned as a less expensive alternative to BMW's seven series. Then will come a replacement for the 9000, which will sell for $25,000 to $33,000, or just below the BMW five series.
 
Losses Continue This Year
The soft economies of Saab's three most important markets - the United States, Sweden and Britain -are not helping Mr. Herman and largely explain why Saab lost $163 million in the first four months of this year. Saab executives say they will be lucky if 1990 retail sales equal the 109,482 cars the company sold last year, when Saab lost $343.2 million on sales of $2.47 billion.
In 1989, Saab sold only 31,306 cars in the United States, its largest market, a sharp drop from the 47,414 sold in 1986, when total sales reached a record 127,180.
But Saab was so preoccupied in the fat years with meeting demand in the United States that it neglected to develop other markets, particularly in West Germany and France, which are now buoyant for other car makers.
 
Heritage in Aerospace
General Motors is striving to help Saab without destroying Saab's culture and brand uniqueness built on its heritage as an aerospace company. So G.M. sent only three executives to Saab: Mr. Herman; James P. Crumlish, the chief financial officer, and David West, head of long-term product planning.
Mr. West, a Briton, once designed cars for Aston Martin, the maker of hand-built, high-performance cars now owned by Ford. He combines that experience with 30 years at G.M. in Europe, where he last served as a product strategist.
Mr. Crumlish, an American, previously served as chief financial officer of G.M.'s Canadian joint venture with Suzuki, which makes small cars and utility vehicles that G.M. sells under the Geo name.
And Mr. Herman, who joined G.M. in 1973, has a record of improving worker productivity and lowering purchasing costs.
 
Earlier Battles
Mr. Herman, who is 44 years old, earned his ribbons in some tough battles. He had to deal with an economic depression in Chile, which caused the car market there to all but vanish, and with Government price controls in Colombia that made losses inevitable. He helped to develop Spain into an important manufacturing base for G.M. and persuaded Belgian assembly-line workers to accept 10-hour shifts. His last job was as executive director of parts and accessories at G.M. Europe. Along the way, he learned several languages and plans to add Swedish to his linguistic repertoire.
The responsibility for making sure G.M. does not steal Saab's soul weighs heavily on Mr. Herman. ''I'm ultimately making decisions about our future products,'' he said. ''If the team doesn't get that right, then we won't succeed. Believe me, that's something we remind ourselves of every single day.''
 
Bigger Engines Planned
While Saab's turbo-charged, four-cylinder engines deliver impressive power for their size, many German car buyers, for example, insist on bigger engines. G.M. Europe is developing a six-cylinder engine and hopes to provide Saab with a customized version in four years.
Engine aside, Saab's lineup is not in the same league as those of Mercedes and BMW. The 900, its biggest seller, has been continuously improved since its introduction in 1978, but it needs to be replaced. The bigger, more expensive 9000, which was introduced in 1984, suffers an uncommon detriment for a Saab: an undistinctive exterior. Moreover, Saab does not have anything that can compete with the likes of BMW's seven series of high-end luxury cars.
The hope is that this program will enable Saab to increase annual sales to 180,000 by the end of the decade. The ultimate goal is to increase sales to as much as 500,000, which would put Saab in the same league as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
 
A More Urgent Task
Perhaps an even more urgent task is lowering production costs, which is vital if Saab is to break even by late 1991 as planned.
In June, Saab announced it was closing or selling four components plants in Sweden and Norway. That will reduce employment by more than 1,300, to at total of 16,000; save Saab about $35 million a year, and enable its engineers to focus on what really makes a Saab a Saab: a roomy interior, distinctive styling and the strong and efficient power train.
Sweden's Government has called on Saab to act responsibly and to try to find jobs for those laid off.
''The most caring thing a company can do for employees is survive and prosper,'' Mr. Crumlish said in an interview.
 
Production Shifts
The vast majority of 900-line production at a half-owned Finnish factory will be moved to a new plant at Malmo, in southern Sweden. In March, capacity-constrained G.M. Europe will begin assembling its new sports coupe, the Calibra, at the Finnish plant, whose other owner is Valmet of Finland. Saab's headquarters plant in Trollhattan, which is in southwestern Sweden, will continue to assemble the 9000.
That will leave Saab with a capacity to make 120,000 cars a year and it will be able to keep profits it would have had to share with Valmet.
In addition, Mr. Herman is enlisting G.M.'s clout to obtain better prices from outside suppliers for parts like steel, tires, batteries and windows. His goal is to reduce the component costs - now about $1 billion a year -by 20 percent within four years.
 
'Significantly Less Efficient'
High labor costs may prove the biggest challenge. A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the average European luxury car maker uses 57 hours to weld, paint and assemble a car. ''Saab is significantly less efficient than the average,'' while Volvo, the leading Swedish car maker, is significantly better than average, said Daniel T. Jones, a professor of motor industry management at the University of Wales who was involved in the M.I.T. study.
Saab is slowly trying to pay more to workers with greater skills and a longer tenure, an unusual idea in a country that has long emphasized egalitarianism.
To get more workers to care, Saab is introducing career-development programs that get workers involved in decision-making.
''It seems like you have to get into a crisis before you change,'' Peter Moller, the 37-year-old production director, said. ''Now it's our turn.''

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Crown American Founder Moves Son to Key Post

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Frank J. Pasquerilla, who built a small masonry contracting business into a large real estate company, the Crown American Corporation, is relinquishing more responsibility to his 31-year-old son, Mark E. Pasquerilla.
The company said yesterday that Mark had been named president of the privately held company. Frank, 64, who has been president, chairman and chief executive, will continue as chairman and chief executive. 
''We have experienced tremendous growth in the last 10 years,'' Mark said, ''and now we must build for our future by enhancing efficiency and effectiveness.''
The 40-year-old company, which is still based in Johnstown, Pa., operates dozens of shopping malls, 21 hotels, 5 office buildings and a chain of 75 Hess's Department Stores. The company, which has assets of $1.3 billion, was recently among the bidders for the Bloomingdale's operations of the Campeau Corporation. A sale never did materialize.
Mark Pasquerilla has had little business experience outside the family company. ''I was in premed in college, but things take strange turns,'' he said yesterday. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and a Fulbright Scholar, he received a master's degree from the London School of Economics. He joined the business in 1981 and was named executive vice president of operations in 1987.
His sister, Leah, 26, is special assistant to the chairman. Nicholas Pasquerilla, a brother of Frank, also works for the company as senior vice president for facilities planning.
Mark Pasquerilla said yesterday that he would be responsible for the company's overall financial performance, as well as matters of strategy and policy. The Hess's stores will continue to report to his father, who will also be responsible for corporate policies and goals, will plan and direct mergers and acquisitions and give guidance to his son and the board, the company said.
As for the prospects for the real estate business, Mark Pasquerilla said: ''I guess everybody is worred about the economy. It's rather soft right now, but we don't see signs of a recession.''

HEADLINE: Student Loan Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The Education Department said today that it would try to resolve a financial crisis at one of the nation's largest guarantors of student loans.
 
The Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a nonprofit corporation based in Overland Park, Kan., guarantees nearly $10 billion in student loans. 
The foundation told the department that it faced serious financial problems.
Etta Fielek, a department spokeswoman, said Higher Education had asked Congress and the department to approve a federally assisted takeover by another guarantor, the Nebraska Student Loan Program. But Ms. Fielek said: ''There's a problem of scale.
There's concern on the part of the department that Nebraska would be too small an operation to consume something the magnitude of H.E.A.F.''
 
According to The Wall Street
Journal today, Higher Education expects a cash shortfall of $50 million to $100 million in the next 12 months.
 
Separately, the Student Loan
Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, does not expect problems at Higher Education to have any material effect on its earnings, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae said. The foundation is a large guarantor of loans for Sallie Mae.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Decline in Hectic Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower yesterday, gyrating wildly most of the day, as credit market participants reacted to the huge swings in the stock market.
Before the stock market opened in New York, bond traders had pushed prices of some securities down by as much as 3/4 point, a slide that may have been a reaction to a slide on Japanese financial markets earlier.
But once stock prices started their deep initial slide after trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, Treasury issues recovered rapidly. Later on, when stocks had recovered from their lows, traders began to sell securities again. 
''This was not your typical sleepy Monday,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the fixed-income and foreign-exchange markets. ''For the first time in quite a while, we had a classic flight-to-quality response in the bond market to what was going on in the stock market.''
 
Effect on Treasuries
The effect of the stock market slide was most readily reflected in the bidding for new three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.49 percent, down sharply from the average rate of 7.62 percent at last week's sale. Six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.40 percent, compared with an average rate of 7.52 percent a week ago.
However, traders said the price decline that resumed once conditions seemed to stabilize in the stock market was indicative of the bond market's mood.
''Things look pretty negative for the credit markets,'' one bond trader said, ''the long end of the market, which for the past month or so has responded positively to comments by President Bush, Fed chairman Greenspan and now this slide in the stock market, wants to go down.''
 
Changes on Greenspan
To a significant part of the trading community, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, damaged his credibility as an inflation fighter last week when he indicated to Congress that the central bank had redirected its policy efforts to help shore up the banking system and the economy.
Mr. Greenspan returns to Capitol Hill today to provide members of the House of Representatives with his semiannual review of monetary policy and the economy.
''His image has suffered a little bit over the last week, and he may want to use the testimony as a way to reassert the Fed's longer-term commitment to fighting inflation,'' Mr. McCarthy said.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 1/8, down 7/32, to yield 8.55 percent, compared with 8.53 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the price of the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes dipped by 1/8 point, to a late offered price of 102 17/ 32, to yield 8.48 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 25/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.29 percent.
 
Impact on Other Markets
The steep slide in stock prices had a limited impact in other debt markets.
Traders in the market for high-yield ''junk bonds'' said that prices of most issues dipped by about 1/2 point, but that trading was quite light.
''Most market participants were sitting back, trying to find out why stock prices fell, and weren't finding any real reasons,'' said Kingman Penniman, a specialist in the high-yield market at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a research and credit-rating agency.
Traders in the seconday market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most actively quoted issues closed higher by 1/8 to 1/4 point after moving lower early in the day. Activity was light, the dealers said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark, Declining to a 2 1/2-Year Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against most European currencies yesterday, hitting a two-and-a-half-year low against the West German mark.
It also fell against the yen, but not as sharply, reflecting the contined chronic weakness of the Japanese currency.
Traders said the big swings in the United States stock market yesterday played a role, as dollars were sold as the stock market declined -the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 100 points at one time - and then purchased as stocks recovered. 
''It was all sparked by the stock market,'' said Liliana Nealon, vice president for foreign exchange sales at the Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. She said that the fall against the mark was so sharp yesterday that it was possible the dollar could rebound against the mark today. But if the stock market slide continues, she said, the dollar could fall further.
 
Focus on Rates
But some traders said that more important factors were the increasing prospects for lower United States interest rates, which makes the dollar a less attractive investment, and the sluggishness of the American economy.
Richard Witten, vice president of foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, said that the dollar was vulnerable now because the Federal Reserve's goal of avoiding a recession and a compromise to reduce the Federal budget deficit could lead to lower interest rates.
He argued that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had indicated a possible rate lowering in his testiomy to Congress last week, but that it had taken several days for traders to digest his comments and act on them.
In New York yesterday, the dollar closed at 1.6220 marks, down from 1.6385 Friday and its lowest level since the beginning of 1988. The previous low this year was 1.6290 in May, also the lowest close in New York since Jan 4, 1988.
The dollar closed at 1.5850 on Jan. 4 and 1.6380 on Jan. 5, rising sharply as the United States and other central banks bought dollars in the market to keep the dollar from falling lower.
Against the Swiss franc, the dollar closed at 1.3815, down from 1.4043 on Friday, a new low for the year and the lowest since the beginning of 1988.
But against the yen, the dollar closed at 148.12, only down half a yen from 148.65 on Friday and still far above its low for this year of 143 yen.
The decline of the dollar against the yen was less sharp than against European currencies because the yen has been much weaker than other major currencies against the dollar all year. In addition, the talk of rising interest rates in Japan has clouded the outlook for the stock market there, reducing the attraction for foreign investors and decreasing the demand for yen.
