HEADLINE: Advertising Companies Fret Over a Digital Talent Gap

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
When the Ad:tech advertising technology conference hits New York next week, marketers, advertising agencies and recruiters may spend less time listening to the panelists and more time working the floor to find new employees.
A talent gap is growing between the skills that many new advertising jobs require and the number of people who have those skills. The dilemma, one familiar to many industries across the country, is particularly acute for jobs that require hard-core quantitative, mathematical and technical skills.
The talent pool, advertising technology company executives say, is not a deep one. And those who have the skills are in high demand, often fetching annual salaries that can reach $100,000.
''There is pain for hiring in digital at all levels,'' said John Ebbert, managing editor of AdExchanger.com, a Web site dedicated to advertising technology. 
''The marketers, the publishers, the ad tech companies, the agencies, data management companies -- they're all going for the same type of employee.''
The job board on AdExchanger, which is updated every 45 days, has postings for positions with titles like ''Yield Optimization Manager'' and ''Director of Platform Marketing.'' The number of jobs on the board has nearly doubled in the past year, Mr. Ebbert said, to 80 jobs every 45 days from 40.
The digital talent gap is driven in part by the enormous amount of user data that ad tech companies are collecting for agencies and marketers -- data that is instrumental in directing ads to consumers and analyzing trends. New hires are needed for a variety of tasks, including writing code, creating digital advertisements, Web site development and statistical analysis.
''The demand has far outstripped the supply,'' said Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, an ad tech company in New York. ''The number of things that you need to know is high and the number of people that have grown up knowing it is low.''
Mr. Zawadzki said that as of last week his company had 13 positions open and had gone to job boards, recruiters and even hosted technology-focused meet-ups to find people. In September, the company hired its first senior vice president for human capital to help with recruitment.
On average, Mr. Zawadzki said, it takes two to three months to find the right person -- someone with a combination of pure quantitative skills, applied marketing skills and an understanding of how the advertising technology business works. With a limited talent pool, many ad tech firms are after the same people.
''Half my job is maintaining a mental Rolodex of people that are at various places,'' Mr. Zawadzki said.
Edwin Lee, 40, is typical of the candidates that many ad tech companies are competing for. Mr. Lee, an economics major at Stanford who has a master's degree in business administration from the University of Southern California, was hired as an account director at MediaMath in September. He came to the company after leaving a Silicon Valley start-up and began his new job after entertaining a variety of options, including other small start-ups and Google.
''For me it was like, 'The world's my oyster here -- what do I want to do?' '' said Mr. Lee, who describes his new job as ''helping companies and clients make sense of something they don't really understand and they hear a lot about.''
The difficulty in finding qualified candidates is affecting advertising agencies as well, said Jerry Neumann, a venture capitalist from Neu Venture Capital who invests in ad tech companies like 33 Across and YieldBot.
Agencies have not traditionally hired for skills like ''number crunching, data visualization, quantitative analysis,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''They've never needed those in the past.'' Instead, media buyers and even those on the creative side of agencies need to prepare for a new digital reality.
''The kind of media buying that's happening now is much more quantitative'' Mr. Neumann said. ''The agencies are staffed for qualitative.''
Instead of coming up with one grand idea, new digitally adept workers in creative fields should be able to devise multiple ways to execute an idea. For example, a variety of Facebook ads can be devised, then tested on the fly to see which appeal to consumers, Mr. Neumann said.
The increasing ability for marketers to put specific ads in front of specific viewers at specific times, whether on mobile devices or personal computers, also creates a need for employees who can conceptualize and execute simultaneous concepts. Mr. Zawadzki said the future for creative talent would be ''to come up with thousands of ideas, put them out there and see what works.''
Jennifer Seidel, the executive vice president for agency relations and membership at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said agencies that were more general in their focus were having a harder time attracting talent with deep digital or quantitative skills.
''Part of it is to get people to recognize that it's a viable career choice,'' Ms. Seidel said. To that end, the trade organization hopes to have a Web site soon that will feature the range of people with nontraditional skill sets who work at advertising agencies. They have also formed a committee to address talent gaps at agencies and to offer training seminars for members.
Ms. Seidel and other ad tech executives said outreach to universities was also critical.
''Colleges and universities are not teaching the skills they need to survive in this environment,'' said Doug Weaver, the founder and chief executive of the Upstream Group, a company that provides digital training to publishers and agencies. While some universities have advertising and marketing concentrations, ''the traditional media sales or ad skill set was not built for this,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''You need a hybrid.''
Some agencies, like Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, part of the Omnicom Group, have put formal training programs in place. Its program, called Ed, began last July and has offered more than 100 classes on everything from ''field trips to Facebook,'' said Allison Kent-Smith, director for digital development at Goodby. Ms. Kent-Smith said employees were trained in areas like interactive design, social media, HTML and coding languages like CSS.
''You have to get very close to technology,'' Ms. Kent-Smith said. ''You have to get your hands in it.''
The Ad:tech conference will be held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan from Nov. 8 to 10, and will include a panel on how marketers can build a digitally skilled ''brand dream team.''
But panels and training may not be enough. Erika Weinstein, president of the executive recruitment firm Stephen-Bradford Search, said the bigger issue for agencies trying to fill the talent gap was managing the grand expectations of what these new employees were expected to do.
''Something has gone terribly out of whack in looking for realistic talent,'' Ms. Weinstein said. Many companies are looking for ''a five-headed monster,'' focusing on creative and highly technical skills and a strong business acumen. Agencies, Ms. Weinstein said, needed to ''get realistic not only about what they want from the candidate, but what are they going to offer.''

HEADLINE: Political Shift Seen in Rally In Pakistan

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- An antigovernment rally in Lahore, led by the former cricket star Imran Khan, attracted a huge crowd estimated at more than 100,000 people on Sunday evening. The rally represented what supporters and some political analysts said was Mr. Khan's emergence as a serious challenger to the governing Pakistan Peoples Party and its longtime rival, the Pakistan Muslim League-N.
Mr. Khan assailed the leaders of both parties -- President Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif -- as creatures of the status quo, and he has been a loud and frequent critic of Pakistan's alliance with the United States, saying it was motivated by money. 
The size of the crowd that Mr. Khan drew in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab and a traditional stronghold of the Muslim League-N, surprised his opponents and made an impression on political analysts.
Mr. Khan, 58, has languished on the political sidelines for years, and his political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Justice Party, has no seats in the current Parliament. But his popularity has soared recently as voters, especially younger ones, have grown disillusioned with the establishment parties. A survey conducted by an American polling organization, the Pew Research Center, found in June that Mr. Khan had become the most popular political figure in the country.
After the crowd gave him a rousing welcome at the rally on Sunday evening, Mr. Khan threw out challenges to both Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif on the question of personal integrity, urging them both to disclose their assets or face civil disobedience.
''This is not a flood, this is a tsunami,'' Mr. Khan said of the crowd thronging the Minaar-e-Pakistan ground in Lahore to hear him. ''Anyone up against it will be swept away.''
The government is not required to call a general election until February 2013, but with a sinking economy, rising inflation, power struggles and terrorism taking a toll on the nation, opposition parties have begun pushing for an earlier date.
The Muslim League-N staged its own rally in Lahore last week and called on President Zardari to step down.
Critics and political opponents dismiss Mr. Khan as a political nobody and question his judgment and his party's capacity to mount a serious campaign, let alone to govern. They say it relies entirely on Mr. Khan's personal charisma and lacks any other substantial figures in its ranks.
In an interview at his Islamabad residence on Friday, Mr. Khan shrugged off the criticism.
''People confuse two types of politics,'' Mr. Khan said as he sprawled on a sofa in the house, situated on a hill that overlooks the city. ''One is the politics of movement. The other is traditional power-based politics. Tehreek-e-Insaf is never going to win the traditional way.''
Mr. Khan opposes cooperating with the United States against militants based in the restive northwestern regions of the country near the Afghan border. He says that Pakistan should not send its own forces to conduct operations there and should not allow American drone strikes there, either, because of the civilian casualties they cause. He favors a negotiated peace instead.
Mr. Khan led 2,000 people in a protest outside the Parliament in Islamabad on Friday, opposing American drone strikes, and he reiterated his stance at the rally on Sunday.
''My message to America is that we will have friendship with you, but we will not accept any slavery,'' he said. ''We will help you in a respectable withdrawal of your troops from Afghanistan, but we will not launch a military operation in Pakistan for you.''
The atmosphere at the Sunday rally was electric. Several famous pop singers warmed up the crowd with music before Mr. Khan's speech, giving the rally the feel of a concert. Women and girls in colorful clothes and sunglasses and young men in Western and national dress filled the audience.
Mr. Khan's speech itself was bit of a letdown to some, wayward and unfocused, but his fans did not mind.
''I felt great,'' said Said Chaudhry, 26. ''It felt like you are part of something that has all the potential of turning into something revolutionary.''
In the interview on Friday, Mr. Khan said he expected the Lahore rally to be seen as a test of his political future.
''Lahore decides what happens in Punjab,'' he said. ''Punjab decides what happens in Pakistan.''
Analysts said that drawing a big crowd in Lahore would not necessarily translate into electoral success, but it could propel Mr. Khan to the forefront of the political conversation.
''I think it's a historic turning point in the country's politics,'' said Rasul Baksh Rais, who teaches at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. ''It showed that people are deeply touched with the message of hope and change, and also with the frustration that is written all over Pakistan with the existing political parties.''
He said that after 15 years on the political fringes, Mr. Khan may have his moment now. ''Today, he has been able to get his message across,'' Mr. Rais said. ''This is the beginning. And it will result in a big change in a year or two.''

HEADLINE: A Tax Bracket Divided Over a Plan to Pay More

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
DENVER -- At a wine-and-cheese reception in his office here, Terry M. Barr, president of Samson Oil and Gas, made a pitch to industry executives to donate to the Republican Party of Colorado so that they could defeat President Obama and elect more Republicans at the federal, state and local levels.
After his guests left, Mr. Barr offered a surprising postscript: He agrees with a proposal by Congressional Democrats to impose a surtax on income over $1 million a year.
Republicans in Congress deride the proposal for a so-called millionaires' tax as class warfare. But in an interview, Mr. Barr said, ''Wealthy people in the U.S. should be paying more tax, and I'm one of them.'' 
Mr. Barr, a petroleum geologist who said he made $1.2 million a year, described himself as a staunch conservative, and said his views of tax policy reflected his fiscal conservatism.
''The United States needs a tax increase for the sake of its fiscal health,'' Mr. Barr said. ''If you fight two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, you have to pay for them. China owns a trillion dollars of U.S. government debt. That's not a healthy position for us to be in. We have to suck it up and pay more tax to help get rid of the deficit. I would pay more tax. I can afford to.''
But the affluent are not of one mind.
Ann L. Brown, president of New Vista Image, a digital graphics company in Golden, Colo., said: ''I believe in the American dream. I don't want to destroy it by taxing those who are successful. The millionaires' tax would penalize the very people who make our economy grow, including many small-business owners. I think we already pay a fair share of the taxes.''
Those divergent views define the battle lines on an issue that has moved to the center of political debate this fall. The Democrats' campaign for a millionaires' tax will resume when the Senate returns on Monday. Democrats want to use the tax to pay for Mr. Obama's jobs bill -- the whole $447 billion package or any piece of it they can push through Congress.
Unable to pass the jobs bill as a whole, Senate Democrats decided to break it into pieces, using the same source of revenue.
This week they will try to pass a measure providing $60 billion for transportation and public works projects, financed by a millionaires' tax.
The debate offers a preview of a much larger fight over whether to extend tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire at the end of next year. Republicans generally want to preserve what are known as the Bush tax cuts for all Americans. Democrats, by contrast, want to let them expire for the highest-income taxpayers.
Representative John Garamendi, Democrat of California, said Republicans refused to ''put a little teeny, tiny tax on millionaires' income'' to create jobs. Representative Betty Sutton, Democrat of Ohio, said Republicans were ''fixated on protecting millionaires and billionaires'' -- an assertion made repeatedly by Mr. Obama as he has campaigned for re-election and for his jobs bill.
In his weekly address on Saturday, Mr. Obama expressed alarm about growing income inequality, which is also one of the grievances of the Occupy Wall Street movement and its supporters.
Mr. Obama said he believed that many high-income people agreed with his proposal. ''One survey found that nearly 7 in 10 millionaires are willing to step up and pay a little more in order to help the economy,'' Mr. Obama said.
James Walker, who manages oil and gas wells in the northeast corner of Colorado, said the proposed surtax would be disastrous.
''That tax would grab a whole lot of small businesses that are on the cusp of success,'' Mr. Walker said. ''The tax policies coming out of Washington could crush domestic oil and gas production by us little guys.''
Rick and Polly Lawrence run the Lawrence Construction Company, a fourth-generation family-owned business in Littleton, Colo., with 200 employees and $59 million in annual revenue. They build roads and bridges with union workers. The company, organized under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, does not pay corporate income taxes. Most of its income stays in the company, but for tax purposes is reported on the owners' personal tax returns, and they pay income taxes on their share of the corporation's profits.
''Our individual returns show big profits -- $885,000 of income from the company last year,'' Mrs. Lawrence said. ''But the vast majority of that income stays in the business. If Congress increases the tax rate, we would have to take more cash out of the business to pay taxes -- money that we would otherwise reinvest in the company, to buy equipment or to hire more employees.''
Mrs. Lawrence added: ''When people in Washington talk about millionaires, it's just an abstract idea. They paint a picture of somebody sitting outside a mansion next to a pool with a servant. That's far removed from reality.''
''When we go on vacation,'' her husband said, ''we fly economy. We don't have corporate jets.''
In separate interviews, people with high incomes said they would willingly pay higher federal taxes if they thought the money would be well spent by the government, but many doubt that it would be.
''I feel like a majority of that extra revenue will be wasted,'' said Gayle A. Dendinger, the owner of a Denver transportation company, who said he made $1 million to $2 million in good years.
Earl L. Wright, chief executive of AMG National Trust Bank in Englewood, Colo., which manages investments for many millionaires, said: ''If they thought that surtax would resolve the problems we have with the deficit, unemployment, Medicare and entitlement expenses, most of them would pay it in a heartbeat. But they do not believe that Washington would spend the money more effectively or productively than they do.''
From his fourth-floor office, Mr. Wright has a spectacular view of the snow-capped Rockies. ''Most of the wealth you see out here in the Front Range was created from scratch by owners of small and midsize companies operating in an innovative, entrepreneurial way,'' Mr. Wright said.
Several affluent people said they were aware of data showing increased inequality in the distribution of income, with the top 1 percent of earners making outsize gains in the last three decades.
''That bothers me,'' said Ms. Brown of New Vista Image. ''I do not like seeing that trend. And it also bothers me when I see huge multimillion-dollar bonuses going to corporate executives whose companies are not showing good performance.''
But, Ms. Brown said, the solution is not to impose a surtax on every dollar over $1 million. In good years, Ms. Brown said, such a tax could affect her because she and her husband report the profits of their business -- a limited liability company with nine employees -- on their personal tax return.
On the other hand, Jill W. Kaufman, who is active in local Democratic politics and could also be affected by a millionaires' tax, said, ''I feel we have a moral responsibility in a democratic society to pay our fair share -- to pay higher taxes so we don't have to cut education and health care and Social Security.''

HEADLINE: A New Ad Race, But the Vehicles Are Retreads

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON-In Mitt Romney's telling, Gov.Rick Perry made Texas a wasteland. Under the words ''Unemployment Has Doubled,'' a tumbleweed rolls across a barren highway.
For veterans of presidential politics, that campaign video evokes memories of an attack ad against Gov.Bill Clinton of Arkansas in 1992. ''I called it 'The Night of the Living Dead,' '' recalled Sig Rogich, the Republican consultant who depicted Mr. Clinton's tenure with a buzzard on a craggy tree.
Never mind that the unemployment rate in Texas is below the national average - or that Mr. Clinton, as it turned out, presided over an economic boom. Cartoonish imagery, repeated every four years, is a staple of the political advertising docudrama. 
The 2012 season of ''Race for the White House'' is now opening on American video screens. Even as it appears on new devices like tablets and cellphones, the quadrennial series largely features stock characters.
Heroes include Humble Statesman, Family Man and Fighter; villains include Stumblebum, Shifty-Eyed Schemer and Flip-Flopping Weasel. Same actors, different roles depending on which campaign makes the ad. The familiar 30-second plotlines endure from one election to the next.
''The winning narrative gets rewritten a million times,'' said Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant. ''Love of the easy cliche is alive and well in the political advertising business.''
The 'Flip-Flop'
The next election year promises to be exceptionally negative; the anxiety and anger of voters will make sure of that. And the templates are already sitting on ad makers' shelves.
''One of the classics you're going to see a whole lot is the Evil Limo,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican ad maker.
Ad makers use limousine shots to portray rivals as privileged louts, perhaps with black-and-white images of the Capitol for a touch of film noir. Three decades ago, Republicans placed a look-alike actor in a limo to depict Speaker Tip O'Neill as out of touch.
But Evil Limos also work against rich business executives, especially when juxtaposed with images of locked factory gates and downtrodden workers. Such attacks against Mr. Romney's financial industry career will be the flip side of his positive ads claiming job-creating know-how.
Mr. Romney's shifting on some issues also makes him vulnerable to the Flip-Flop ad genre. ''Like the Kerry wind-surfing ad,'' said Mark McKinnon, a media consultant, referring to a spot for President George W. Bush that showed Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, clad in a swimsuit, tacking with the Atlantic breeze.
One famous Flip-Flop spot, by the campaign of Gov.Michael S. Dukakis against Representative Richard A. Gephardt in 1988, used a somersaulting gymnast. A cinema verite version could simply splice quotes from Mr. Romney's 1994 Senate race debate against Edward M. Kennedy with his recent, more conservative rhetoric.
''Then you cut to black and do something snarky at the end - like, 'Oh really, Mitt?' '' said Kim Alfano, a Republican consultant. She recommends a female narrator because women in attack ads can be ''so much meaner.''
Mr. Perry will use statistics calling attention to job creation in Texas. Such spots work best by cutting swiftly among images of factories, blue-collar workers and the candidate, Ms. Alfano said, with upbeat music to lend a high-energy feel.
But Good Governor ads invariably provoke Bad Governor rejoinders.
Vice President George Bush showed dead fish in a polluted Boston Harbor to debunk Mr. Dukakis's boasts about the ''Massachusetts Miracle.'' When President Gerald R. Ford was facing former Gov.Jimmy Carter of Georgia in 1976, his campaign sent a camera crew to Atlanta to collect nasty comments from anti-Carter voters on Peachtree Street.
Blowing Smoke
There remains some market for innovation. Herman Cain, a former Godfather's Pizza executive who is now atop some national polls, tested it recently with an unusual spot featuring his campaign manager smoking a cigarette.
But if Mr. Cain sustains his support, history suggests that his more experienced rivals will pounce. In 1996, when the eventual Republican nominee, Bob Dole, faced the never-elected magazine publisher Steve Forbes, his ads warned voters: ''Untested Leadership. Risky Ideas.''
''You show an empty chair in the Oval Office with a voice-over asking viewers to imagine him sitting there,'' Mr. McKinnon suggested. That's where the boldness of Mr. Cain's 9-9-9 taxplan and Mr. Perry's new 20 percent flat tax, for that matter, can be turned against them.
''That Risky Scheme thing is tailor-made for Romney going after Cain and Perry,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic ad maker. Another option: a ''Where's the Pizza?'' version of the ''Where's the Beef?'' line that Walter F. Mondale used against Gary Hartin the 1984 Democratic primaries.
Some ads remain so well-matched to a particular candidate and circumstance that they stand alone. Mr. Rogich points to the 1984 ''Morning in America'' spots for President Ronald Reagan, which capitalized on his personal popularity and the nation's resurgent optimism.
''That campaign is the only one that's never been copied,'' he said. Nor can it be in 2012.
The way voters feel today, Mr. Rogich observed, ''It's Evening in America.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Former Adviser To White House Is Likely to Seek Rangel's Seat

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
He survived an ethics investigation and a humiliating censure vote on the floor of the House. He endured a brutal re-election battle. Now Representative Charles B. Rangel may face yet another tough challenge to his dwindling power and stature.
Clyde Williams, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and a leading Democratic official with ties to President Obama, is laying the groundwork for a possible race against the 81-year-old Mr. Rangel, a Democratic Party elder who has represented his district in Harlem for half of his life. 
Mr. Williams has commissioned a poll, met with major Democratic donors around the country and raised about $50,000 in preparation for a race against Mr. Rangel.
Mr. Williams, who has lived in the Harlem Congressional district since 2001, said in an interview last week that he was still in the exploratory phase, but he is expected to announce his candidacy in the coming weeks.
Mr. Williams, 49, has the makings of a formidable challenger given his political background with two presidents. But he made clear that he had not discussed his plans with either of them.
For all his political connections, Mr. Williams understands the enormous task involved in trying to unseat Mr. Rangel, a prominent figure in city, state and national politics who is well liked by his colleagues despite his troubles.
''I know that all the political powers will line up against me,'' he said.
The preparations by Mr. Williams, who has hired Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's pollster, come as rumors circulate within political circles that Mr. Rangel plans to retire and make way for his handpicked successor, Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a Rangel protege and a popular politician in Harlem in his own right.
Mr. Rangel has helped fuel such talk with what has been for him a relatively anemic fund-raising pace. Once considered one of the Democratic Party's most formidable fund-raisers, Mr. Rangel raised only $652,485 in the first three quarters of 2011 and has about $340,000 left in his campaign account, according to his most recent financial report.
By contrast, he raised nearly $1.5 million in the corresponding period in the previous election cycle and had $1.1 million in his campaign account at the end of that cycle, in September 2009, according to the financial reports.
In an interview, Mr. Rangel said he had not heard about the plans by Mr. Williams and declined to comment beyond saying, ''There's not much for me to react to.''
Mr. Williams would have some potential liabilities of his own in the race. He could face claims, legitimate or not, that he lacks deep roots in the district, and he has often split his time between Harlem and a job in Washington, where until March he was political director for the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Williams grew up in Washington, where he worked on the staff of the City Council as a young man. He worked in the Clinton administration as a deputy chief of staff in the Agriculture Department in the late 1990s before moving to Harlem in 2001 to serve as an adviser on domestic matters to Mr. Clinton's foundation. In early 2009, he was hired to run the political operation at the Democratic National Committee under Mr. Obama.
In 2009, The Washington Post called him and his wife, Mona Sutphen, who was a deputy chief of staff for Mr. Obama, a Washington power couple. But Mr. Williams, who has two children, insisted that he considered Harlem his home.
Mr. Williams made clear that he had no desire to run a campaign focused on attacking Mr. Rangel, who last year survived a nasty election in which his rivals sharply questioned his fitness to serve given his ethics problems.
A month after his re-election, Mr. Rangel was censured after a House ethics committee found him guilty of 11 ethical violations, including failure to pay taxes, improper solicitation of donations and failure to report his personal income accurately.
Mr. Williams declined to comment on Mr. Rangel's troubles, saying instead that he had great respect for what the congressman had accomplished. ''I have no desire to attack him,'' he said. ''The work he has done for Harlem is admirable.''
But Mr. Williams added that it was now time for Mr. Rangel to allow a younger generation of politicians to emerge as the nation faces deep problems, including high unemployment. ''I believe there comes a time for new ideas and new energy to keep our community moving forward,'' he said.
Discussing his own qualifications to serve in Congress, he noted that he had not only advised two presidents, but was behind major initiatives to help Harlem residents, including one that provided affordable administrative services, like accounting, to small businesses.
While Mr. Obama suggested last year that Mr. Rangel should retire, Mr. Williams said he was not looking for the president's support in the race. ''I would never put this president or any other president in the middle of something he had nothing to do with,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Yelp Welcomed To New York

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg went to Union Square to welcome Yelp, the latest Silicon Valley company to put down roots in Manhattan.
''This is the latest proof that New York is on its way to becoming a Number One digital hub,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, during a press conference held at the Yelp offices. Yelp follows in the footsteps of Accel Partners, a noted venture capital firm, and Twitter, which opened its New York offices earlier this month. Facebook and Google already have well-established presences in Manhattan. 
Mr. Bloomberg said that in the past year alone, the number of jobs available in the technology sector jumped 30 percent. Mr. Bloomberg cracked jokes about the Yelp offices, which have a kitchen rigged with a tap that dispenses local beer and is outfitted with software that lets employees control the keg with their iPads.
He said he hoped that start-ups such as Yelp, which employs roughly 80 people in New York, will help improve the job market and economy of New York.
''Our long-term digital future looks promising,'' he said.
Yelp has had a small footprint in New York since 2007, said Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive and founder of the company. But the expansive office, located at 104 Fifth Avenue, in the same building where Apple is rumored to be leasing space for its mobile advertising business, will be Yelp's official New York headquarters. About 10 percent of the company is based in New York. In total, Yelp has grown to more than 900 employees, the company said.
Mr. Stoppelman said that New York was one of Yelp's most active cities and he looked forward to expanding the company's relationships with its users and businesses that are on the site.
''Job growth in this country relies on growing and supporting local businesses,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Calling for Avon to Make a Change

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
A good look in the mirror might help Avon's management. Andrea Jung, the chief executive of the $8 billion cosmetics company, has twice failed to turn it around. Never mind the federal investigation into possible wrongdoing that was disclosed last week; Avon's performance even before then had been dismal.
The company's stock is down more than 20 percent since the beginning of the year, substantially underperforming peers like L'Oreal and Revlon. A big part of the decline came after its quarterly report on Thursday. 
But Ms. Jung can't blame the current tough economy, even if it has not helped matters. She presided over several years of strong performance after becoming the chief in 1999. The company's shares have significantly underperformed the broader market and major rivals at least since 2005, when Avon announced plans to flatten the management structure, streamline the supply chain and outsource certain services.
Ms. Jung took the restructuring scalpel out again four years later, but failed to produce lasting results. Sales growth ran in double digits early during her tenure, but won't even reach mid-single digits this year. Moreover, she seems to accept that her strategy in one big market, Brazil, needs to be rethought, and the company's performance in America has been disappointing, too.
Some investors may have been reluctant to rock the boat given Avon's lucrative 5 percent dividend yield. But a squeeze on the company's free cash flow has put that in doubt. The $37 million of free cash generated in the first nine months of this year is well short of the dividend outflow of $302 million in the same period. Dipping into cash holdings to maintain the payout may not be a sustainable approach.
Avon's new chief financial officer, Kimberly Ross, will have that to grapple with when she starts on the job next month. In addition, she and her colleagues will have to handle a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into whether the company broke bribery and disclosure laws.
Ms. Jung said the buck stops with her. After 12 years in charge and two ineffectual efforts to revamp the company, the Avon board should hold her to the statement and give someone else a chance.
Fixing Housing
There's a growing chorus among legislators to get the government out of the housing business. That's understandable given the possible $311 billion bill that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may hand over to taxpayers, according to an estimate last week from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the firms' regulator. But the recent failure of PMI Group's mortgage insurance business is a reminder that swaths of housing's private sector need fixing, too.
PMI, like rivals Radian and MGIC, was once a high flier during the mortgage boom. It even had a $4 billion market capitalization. This month, PMI was effectively seized by the Arizona Department of Insurance. The state regulator took over its mortgage-writing unit after prohibiting it from issuing new policies. That's a death knell in an industry that needs new premiums to counterbalance claims delivered by the housing bust.
And PMI is not the only one in trouble. Only one of the six major home loan insurers has an investment-grade credit rating. A few are dangerously close to breaching their risk-to-capital limit of 25 to 1, the minimum required to ensure they have enough to pay claims. It took just one quarter for PMI to race through this threshold, moving from 24.4-to-1 to 58.1-to-1 by the end of June, according to the brokerage CRT Capital.
The duration of the housing crisis has made life hard for mortgage insurers. They earn their money by insuring lenders against future losses on mortgages that don't come with a 20 percent down payment from the borrower. As home sales have slumped and banks become loath to lend to borrowers who don't deliver large down payments, the business has suffered.
But bad practices prevalent in the good years bear a good part of the blame. For instance, as lenders loosened their credit standards during the boom, many mortgage insurers felt compelled to give banks a share of their premium income. That left the insurers with a smaller cushion to weather losses from claims during the housing collapse.
If the government ever hopes to extricate itself from the business of housing finance, it needs to ensure private sector backstops are well-fortified and well-regulated.

HEADLINE: Buffering The Grand Canyon

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS BRINKLEY. 
Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, is the author of ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America.''

 BODY:
Houston
IN 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt didn't need a guidebook to tell him that the Grand Canyon was the most precious heirloom the United States possessed. Staring out for the first time from the canyon's rim at the immensity of the chasm, he trembled with sheer joy. This was America's Westminster Abbey, Louvre and Taj Mahal rolled into one.
Back then, the Arizona Territory was debating whether to preserve the canyon or mine it for zinc, copper, asbestos and other minerals. A similar threat looms today over the canyon vistas just beyond the park's boundaries, where mining companies, foreign and domestic, have been filing claims to extract uranium from the surrounding national forest. 
The idea of letting miners loose on the Grand Canyon struck Roosevelt as criminal. To him, the canyon was an American birthright. ''In your own interest and the interest of all the country keep this great wonder of nature as it now is,'' he told a crowd of Arizonans assembled for his visit. ''You cannot improve upon it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.''
Roosevelt fought fiercely to persuade Congress to preserve the Grand Canyon as a national park. But a cabal of mining outfits and their lobbyists blocked his efforts. After getting nowhere, on July 11, 1908, Roosevelt used his executive authority to unilaterally declare more than 800,000 acres of the Grand Canyon off limits to development. His weapon was the Antiquities Act of 1906, which empowers the president to protect federal lands as national monuments. (The canyon was upgraded to a national park in 1919.)
Few would argue today that Roosevelt was wrong. The canyon is one of the world's great natural wonders, and the park has also become a tourism engine. About 4.5 million people visit each year, generating more than $3.5 billion annually for the regional economy.
But as uranium prices escalated in recent years, there was a rush to stake claims on federal lands just beyond the park. An 1872 mining law allows free access to public lands, and thousands of claims have been filed over the last few years, many by foreign companies, including one controlled by the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom. These companies are not even required to pay royalties to the United States.
It's clear that the Grand Canyon needs a new permanent protection to safeguard it from the desecrations of uranium mining. The Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy and others are well aware of the sorry legacy left behind by uranium miners, with abandoned mines, contaminated wells and radiation hazards that endure years later.
In June, the Obama administration extended a temporary moratorium imposed in 2009 on the filing of new mining claims on a million acres surrounding Grand Canyon National Park as it studied the potential harm to the region.
The administration is now seeking a 20-year moratorium (the longest duration allowed under the law for this sort of action). A 30-day comment period began last week, after which the Interior Department is expected to make the rule final.
Twenty years is welcome but not enough. The mining industry and its allies in Congress, including Arizona's entire Republican delegation, are pushing legislation that would allow continued mining on these lands.
This is all the more reason President Obama should follow Roosevelt's example and use the Antiquities Act to preserve the national forest and other public lands surrounding the Grand Canyon as a national monument. The land is already owned by the government. All mining claims would immediately be rejected. Existing mining operations would be phased out. If the uranium companies want to use the 1872 mining law to exploit the canyon, President Obama should use the 1906 law to stop them.
President George W. Bush used the Antiquities Act in 2006 to designate 195,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. Mr. Obama could become a conservation hero for doing the same for the Grand Canyon.
''We regard Attic temples and Roman triumphal arches and Gothic cathedrals as a priceless value,'' Roosevelt wrote. ''But we are, as a whole, still in that low state of civilization where we do not understand that it is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a cliff or forest, or a species of mammal or bird.''

HEADLINE: Ever More Homeless Families

 BODY:
An increase in poverty and rising rents produced a spike in homelessness among families in recent years. With the economy still weak and 14 million people out of work, the situation is bound to get worse. 
Without an intensive federal effort to finance housing programs, the burden will fall on states and cities that are already unable to handle growing social needs.
The typical victim of chronic homelessness is a single man who suffers from a disabling condition like mental illness. Thanks to a sustained investment in specialized housing by the federal and state governments, this population has actually declined over the last four years. But the startling report to Congress issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development last June found that the number of homeless families that have turned to shelters jumped by 20 percent, to 567,334 in 2010 from 473,541 in 2007.
Things would no doubt be considerably worse without the $1.5 billion homelessness prevention program that Congress passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. With that money, HUD helped to prevent more than a million people from becoming homeless. It provided them with short- and medium-term rental assistance, moving expenses and other services. It quickly re-housed those who landed in shelters. With most of that recovery money gone, it is important that Congress provide the $2.4 billion in homeless assistance funding that the administration has requested.
Census data showing a big increase in the number of families living doubled up with friends and relatives suggests that another wave of homelessness may be in the offing. With these clear needs, Congress must preserve and strengthen the programs that are aimed at helping the vulnerable. It should also direct more money into a program that builds and renovates affordable housing, which is in increasingly short supply.

HEADLINE: Fighting Over Online Sex Ads

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
What if the price of having a vital, well-financed string of newspapers included rare, but inevitable, sexual predation of minors?
Not a tough call, right? But maybe more complicated than you think for the businesses involved.
Before you head out for the lanterns and pitchforks, it's worth remembering that a free press is not free. One of the offshoots of free speech is that it will be used to pernicious ends. In this instance, Village Voice Media has a classified network called Backpage.com that includes a section labeled ''adult'' with categories like ''escort'' and ''strippers & strip clubs.'' The vast majority of ads involves one consenting adult seeking another, but there have been instances in which the section was used to offer minors for sexual ends.
Village Voice Media, controlled by Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey, whose weeklies include The Village Voice, Westword and Phoenix New Times. It has an anything-goes approach to advertising, but in a digital age, that policy has new implications. 
In September 2010, Craigslist, which hosted a great deal of sexually related advertising, bowed to pressure and banned that advertising in the United States. A number of crimes, including several murders, had been linked to ads on the site, and many critics, including a number of state attorneys general, suggested that Craigslist was enabling the trafficking of minors.
A significant portion of the estimated $44 million in sex-related advertising on Craigslist found a home on Backpage.com. Like a lot of newspapers, Village Voice Media's chain of 13 weeklies has struggled through the terrible economic cycle and big changes in advertising spending, so the revenue from Backpage.com, much of it unrelated to sex, has played a critical role in its survival.
But in August the country's 51 attorneys general sent a letter demanding that the site close its ''adult'' section, and now a coalition of religious leaders has joined that effort. Last Tuesday, Groundswell, an interfaith social justice group sponsored by Auburn Seminary in New York, published a full-page ad in The New York Times that was signed by clergy members of all stripes and cited the arrests of adults who had sold minors for sex using Backpage.com. The ad stated, ''It is a basic fact of the moral universe that girls and boys should not be sold for sex.''
''While we empathize with your business challenges and the increasingly difficult marketplace in which Village Voice Media competes,'' the letter went on, ''we trust that you are committed to running your business without compromising the lives of our nation's boys and girls.''
The Rev. Katharine Rhodes Henderson, the president of Auburn Theological Seminary, said that while the issue was complicated, the bottom line was not.
''On Backpage.com, you can buy a toaster, a car or a girl for sex,'' she said. ''We agree with the attorney generals on the legal issues, but we are raising this as a moral issue. Even if one minor is sold for sex, it is one too many.''
Mr. Larkin and Mr. Lacey are accustomed to having people come after them. They were harassed and arrested in the middle of the night in response to the coverage by one of their newspapers of Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Mr. Lacey, who has made a career out of tweaking the powers that be, sees this battle as no different.
''I am beginning to like our odds,'' he said. ''We have all these practicing politicians and concerned clergy after us. We must be doing something right.''
In a phone call, he and Mr. Larkin pointed out that Web sites like Backpage.com are not legally responsible for posted content and added that the company had spent millions on both human and technological efforts to screen ads that feature minors. They said they had worked with law enforcement officials and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in an effort to make sure Backpage.com's ''adult'' section included only adults.
Both men see the debate as a free speech issue.
''We have always had a very libertarian approach to advertising,'' said Mr. Larkin, adding that classifieds represented 30 to 35 percent of their business. ''We don't ban cigarettes, we take adult advertising. We take ads that sell guns.''
From their perspective, the claims of their opponents are wildly exaggerated and all the money being spent trying to wipe out advertising would be better spent on the root causes of the problem, including drug addiction, poverty and family abuse.
''There is a lot of mythmaking around the issue and I think it's a way of avoiding the real problem,'' Mr. Lacey said.
Rob McKenna, the attorney general of Washington State and the head of the association of attorneys general that went after both Craigslist and now Backpage.com, says the issue goes beyond minors.
''I think we have to be careful to protect the First Amendment rights of publishers, but free speech does not extend to the knowing facilitation of criminal activity,'' he said. ''This is not just about children being prostituted, this is about human beings being trafficked into the sex trades, as adults and as children.''
It's no news to anyone that sex is an integral component of the Internet and much of the mainstream media. Early on, AOL included lots of raunchy backrooms. The brand-name cable channels make a great deal of money on sexually explicit content, and if someone is looking to buy sex, there are any number of Web sites that cater to all manner of interests.
It's worth remembering that while pressure from the attorneys general and Congress led to a change at Craigslist, the whack-a-mole on the Web continues. If Backpage.com retreats -- not likely given the predispositions of its owners -- some other alternative will immediately take its place.
It reminds me a great deal of the early 1990s, when I was the editor of The Twin Cities Reader, an alternative weekly in Minneapolis. At the time, we were under fire for publishing ads for strip clubs, escort services and massage parlors. The staff and the publisher at the time, R. T. Rybak, were keenly attuned to the community and always looking for points of difference from City Pages, our weekly competitor. With support from the staff, Mr. Rybak announced that we would no longer take ads that ''objectified'' women, a bold move. It was thought that beyond the good will we earned in the community, other, nonracy advertisers might find our paper to be a more suitable platform.
Our critics, including many women's groups, were thrilled at their victory and congratulated us on our sensitivity. The policy went into effect, wiping out, as I recall, about 15 percent of the bottom line. City Pages left its ad policy unchanged. Some of what we lost went to them and little in the way of new ads materialized to fill the hole.
City Pages eventually became the dominant paper -- in part because it was very good and run by smart people -- and when, yes, Village Voice Media decided to enter the market, it bought both papers and closed The Twin Cities Reader. I was gone by then, but I thought the decision to be selective about ads contributed to its demise.
I called Mr. Rybak, who is now the mayor of Minneapolis, to ask if he regretted the decision.
''It was absolutely the right move,'' he said. ''When you engage in a certain kind of journalism that is designed to be an alternative to the mainstream, you have a special obligation to have your editorial, your values and your advertising align.''
''If we had more time, I think it may have worked out,'' he said. ''But I often think about what would have happened if we had those two pages of ads in the back. Would the paper still be around? It wasn't the only reason it went out of business, but it played a role.''
Although Mr. Larkin and Mr. Lacey hardly agree, they are taking their own version of a principled stand. And just because it aligns with their business interests doesn't mean it isn't valid.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up After Nature Plays a Trick

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD and SARAH MASLIN NIR; Reporting was contributed by Robert Davey, Kristin Hussey and Elizabeth Maker in Connecticut; Jess Bidgood in Massachusetts; Hattie Bernstein in New Hampshire; Richard Perez-Pena and Nate Schweber in New Jersey; Matt Flegenheimer, Thomas Kaplan and Elizabeth A. Harris in New York; and Jen McCaffery in Rhode Island.

 BODY:
It was a storm of record consequence, disrupting large swaths of the Northeast in ways large and small: towns were buried in dense snowfalls, closing down streets, schools and even, in some cases, Halloween celebrations.
By the time the great snowstorm of October 2011 finally ended early Sunday, more than three million customers would find themselves without power and with the prospect of enduring several more days without it. In many communities, the storm had a far greater impact on daily life than did Tropical Storm Irene.
People emptied stores of generators and chain saws and flocked to town halls to charge phones on emergency power. The chilled and the hungry drove miles looking for a cup of coffee, or for barbecued meat inexorably defrosting in powerless freezers. In Worcester, Mass., a wedding with cranberry dresses and flowers the colors of fall foliage ended up soggy and white. In Glen Rock, N.J., orderly suburban blocks became a maze, with fallen branches draped across nearly every street.
At least nine deaths were attributed to the storm, including that of a 20-year-old man electrocuted by a downed power line in Springfield, Mass. 
Communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire expected schools to remain closed for several days as they cleaned up downed electrical wires and fallen branches. And in Central Park, as many as 1,000 trees may be lost -- eight times the damage suffered after Tropical Storm Irene.
But in the most telling sign of how the snow had turned seasons topsy-turvy -- throwing an icy and sometimes lethal blanket over trees whose leaves were often still green -- the storm threatened to obliterate Halloween.
In Hollis, N.H., officials held an urgent meeting at the town hall, where, unlike at their homes, there was heat, hot water and flushing toilets. The emergency management director, Don McCoy, gave them the bad news: He was canceling Halloween until next year.
It was too dangerous, he said, for children to meander through total darkness, live wires and fallen branches, and there was no way to know how soon it would be safe.
Later, he relented, declaring trick-or-treating merely postponed, until Nov. 5, following the lead of the nearby town of Brookline.
''Things should be a little better then, and we hate to disappoint all the kiddies who went out and bought costumes,'' Mr. McCoy said.
In Worcester, officials asked people not to trick-or-treat until Thursday; in New Canaan, Conn., a Halloween parade was canceled; and in New Jersey, town governments issued 5 p.m. curfews -- effectively banning trick-or-treating -- by sending text messages to residents on their phones.
''I told my kids we're not having a white Christmas; we're having a white Halloween,'' said Maria Ponce, 32, of Port Chester, N.Y. ''They'll have to wear boots to trick-or-treat.''
In New York City, though the storm was less severe, the threat to Halloween reared its head on Saturday during early Halloween events, as children cast off bumblebee antennas in favor of warm hats and hid superhero outfits under coats.
The storm swept harder across parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, upstate New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine, setting records in some places both for snowfall and power failures.
Plainfield, Mass., received 30.8 inches of snow; West Milford, N.J., got 19; and Jaffrey, N.H., had 31.4, according to the National Weather Service.
More than 12 inches fell at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn. The previous record for the day was less than a tenth of an inch, in 2000, the Weather Service said.
Governors in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut declared states of emergency. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York declared an emergency in 13 counties.
According to state governments and utilities, at least three million customers lost power. More than 400,000 customers lost power across New York State at the storm's peak, and most remained without electricity at midday Sunday, with the greatest damage in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties. Power failures hit 650,000 customers in Massachusetts, 10,000 in Rhode Island, 280,000 in New Hampshire, more than 400,000 in Pennsylvania and about 500,000 in New Jersey.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said more than 750,000 homes in the state were without power, breaking a record set in August when the remnants of the tropical storm passed through.
People trudging through stores in search of sold-out supplies had little time to meditate on climate change. They talked more about how recent storms -- the ice storm of 2008 in New Hampshire and Tropical Storm Irene in New Jersey -- had prompted them to buy generators and left them better prepared.
But scholars began marshaling their arguments to remind people that single storms, no matter how dramatic, say little about overall climate patterns.
Robert Stavins, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said a surprise winter storm no more disproved climate change than a hot day in August proved it.
But larger patterns of extreme storms and precipitation, even if accompanied by cold snaps, support the theory of global warming, he and several climate researchers said, because warming oceans are sending more moisture into the air.
The storm may be a death knell for apple-picking season at Hager Brothers' small orchard in Shelburne Falls, Mass.
With temperatures expected in the teens, ''that'll probably be the end of what we can pick off our trees,'' said Bethany Miles, who was working at the orchard store.
The wedding of Christine and Ryan Hubbard on Saturday night in Worcester -- with pumpkins and flowers in warm, deep colors -- was aiming for a crisp autumn look but ended up with an aesthetic that was more frigid slush.
''If somebody looks at our wedding pictures, they're going to think that we got married in December,'' Ms. Hubbard said.
To the north, the lights went out on Saturday night as Ryan Thibeault of Hollis, N.H., blew out the 16 candles on his birthday cake. Ryan's mother, Pauline, found mittens for the partygoers, and everyone made do, figuring the darkness made for a seasonally spooky setting. ''We sat in the hall in the dark laughing and ate cold pizza by candlelight,'' she said.
She was less amused on Sunday morning, when, bundled up in a parka, she trekked 25 yards through the snow to a lake to fill a bucket. The water was needed to flush the toilets.
More threatening problems were downed wires and precariously hanging branches.
In Sherman, Conn., Jerry Ryan, a lead electrician for Connecticut Light and Power, was working to restore equipment damaged by a tree, using a hand-held voltage detector that lights up if a wire is live.
''The whole town of Sherman is shut down,'' he said. ''This beats out Hurricane Irene big time. It's 10 times worse.''
Kathy Johansen, working at Woodbury Pewter in Woodbury, Conn., said she had a scare when she was stuck in the snow. Just as a passing snowplow driver was scooping out an escape route, a giant tree crashed within inches of her car.
''I would have been crushed completely,'' she said. ''And you'll never guess the name of the road: Transylvania Road.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a snowstorm that disrupted the Northeast misstated the surname of an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who said that a storm in October no more disproved climate change than a hot day in August proved it. He is Robert Stavins, not Stavin. The article also misstated the amount of snow that fell in West Milford, N.J. It was 19 inches, not 31.4. (That amount fell in Jaffrey, N.H., according to the National Weather Service.)

HEADLINE: Bombs, Bridges And Jobs

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A few years back Representative Barney Frank coined an apt phrase for many of his colleagues: weaponized Keynesians, defined as those who believe ''that the government does not create jobs when it funds the building of bridges or important research or retrains workers, but when it builds airplanes that are never going to be used in combat, that is of course economic salvation.''
Right now the weaponized Keynesians are out in full force -- which makes this a good time to see what's really going on in debates over economic policy. 
What's bringing out the military big spenders is the approaching deadline for the so-called supercommittee to agree on a plan for deficit reduction. If no agreement is reached, this failure is supposed to trigger cuts in the defense budget.
Faced with this prospect, Republicans -- who normally insist that the government can't create jobs, and who have argued that lower, not higher, federal spending is the key to recovery -- have rushed to oppose any cuts in military spending. Why? Because, they say, such cuts would destroy jobs.
Thus Representative Buck McKeon, Republican of California, once attacked the Obama stimulus plan because ''more spending is not what California or this country needs.'' But two weeks ago, writing in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. McKeon -- now the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee -- warned that the defense cuts that are scheduled to take place if the supercommittee fails to agree would eliminate jobs and raise the unemployment rate.
Oh, the hypocrisy! But what makes this particular form of hypocrisy so enduring?
First things first: Military spending does create jobs when the economy is depressed. Indeed, much of the evidence that Keynesian economics works comes from tracking the effects of past military buildups. Some liberals dislike this conclusion, but economics isn't a morality play: spending on things you don't like is still spending, and more spending would create more jobs.
But why would anyone prefer spending on destruction to spending on construction, prefer building weapons to building bridges?
John Maynard Keynes himself offered a partial answer 75 years ago, when he noted a curious ''preference for wholly 'wasteful' forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict 'business' principles.'' Indeed. Spend money on some useful goal, like the promotion of new energy sources, and people start screaming, ''Solyndra! Waste!'' Spend money on a weapons system we don't need, and those voices are silent, because nobody expects F-22s to be a good business proposition.
To deal with this preference, Keynes whimsically suggested burying bottles full of cash in disused mines and letting the private sector dig them back up. In the same vein, I recently suggested that a fake threat of alien invasion, requiring vast anti-alien spending, might be just the thing to get the economy moving again.
But there are also darker motives behind weaponized Keynesianism.
For one thing, to admit that public spending on useful projects can create jobs is to admit that such spending can in fact do good, that sometimes government is the solution, not the problem. Fear that voters might reach the same conclusion is, I'd argue, the main reason the right has always seen Keynesian economics as a leftist doctrine, when it's actually nothing of the sort. However, spending on useless or, even better, destructive projects doesn't present conservatives with the same problem.
Beyond that, there's a point made long ago by the Polish economist Michael Kalecki: to admit that the government can create jobs is to reduce the perceived importance of business confidence.
Appeals to confidence have always been a key debating point for opponents of taxes and regulation; Wall Street's whining about President Obama is part of a long tradition in which wealthy businessmen and their flacks argue that any hint of populism on the part of politicians will upset people like them, and that this is bad for the economy. Once you concede that the government can act directly to create jobs, however, that whining loses much of its persuasive power -- so Keynesian economics must be rejected, except in those cases where it's being used to defend lucrative contracts.
So I welcome the sudden upsurge in weaponized Keynesianism, which is revealing the reality behind our political debates. At a fundamental level, the opponents of any serious job-creation program know perfectly well that such a program would probably work, for the same reason that defense cuts would raise unemployment. But they don't want voters to know what they know, because that would hurt their larger agenda -- keeping regulation and taxes on the wealthy at bay.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Is Divided On Direction

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, 5 of the 10 voting members will arrive in open disagreement with the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, about the direction of monetary policy. Three conservative members say the Fed has already done too much. Two liberals say the Fed needs to do much more.
But it is still the chairman who determines whether the central bank should expand its campaign to stimulate growth for the third time since August, and lately Mr. Bernanke has been focused on an old theme: communicating the benefits of existing policies in order to increase their impact. 
The Fed ''continues to explore ways to further increase transparency about its forecasts and policy plans,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a mid-October speech in Boston. Later he described improved communication as perhaps the main lesson that makers of monetary policy should take from the financial crisis.
The Fed is focused on communication because it wants to reduce long-term interest rates, which determine the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers, but it exerts direct influence primarily on short-term interest rates. Long-term rates reflect expectations about the future path of short-term rates, so the Fed wants to convince investors that it will continue to hold short-term rates near zero.
The central bank also could expand its extensive portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, putting direct downward pressure on long-term rates, but Fed officials are reluctant to do so in the face of considerable political opposition and technical concerns that the purchases would absorb too much of the available stock of securities, crowding out private investors.
Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has proposed that the Fed should announce temporary boundaries for inflation and unemployment, pledging to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate drops below 7 percent from its current level above 9 percent, or the medium-term outlook for the rate of inflation rises above 3 percent. It is now somewhat below 2 percent, the maximum rate the Fed views as healthy.
''Given how badly we are doing on our employment mandate, we need to be willing to take a risk on inflation going modestly higher in the short run if that is a consequence of policies aimed at lowering unemployment,'' Mr. Evans said in a recent speech.
''The Fed has done a good deal of thinking out of the box over the past four years,'' he said. ''I think it is time to do some more.''
A growing number of economists outside the Fed have advocated the more aggressive approach of permanently changing the central bank's focus, from the level of inflation to a broader measure of growth -- the present value of economic output -- that would similarly make clear that the Fed was willing to tolerate a higher level of inflation in the short term. That approach, however, has gained little traction within the central bank.
Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Fed's board of governors, described Mr. Evans's idea as ''potentially promising'' in a speech in Denver two weeks ago. ''Such an approach could be helpful in facilitating public understanding of how various possible shifts in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming,'' she said.
But she added that the approach was ''not without potential pitfalls.'' In particular, Fed officials are concerned that targets would be seen as destinations, conveying that the Fed was comfortable with 7 percent unemployment or 3 percent inflation.
The Fed could formally fix the 2 percent rate as a long-term target for inflation, to underscore that the current measures are temporary. Mr. Bernanke has advocated that idea in the past, but as chairman he has hesitated to pull the trigger, in part because of concerns about the political consequences if formalizing an inflation target is seen as a disregard for unemployment.
Citing these concerns, several analysts said the Fed was likely to make a more modest shift in its approach, such as publishing a prediction of the level at which it expects to maintain short-term interest rates over the next several years, alongside existing predictions of the future path of economic growth, unemployment and the rate of inflation. That could give investors greater confidence that short-term rates will remain low.
''Communication is what monetary policy is fundamentally about,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who heads the forecasting company Macroeconomic Advisers, arguing that such policies can have a greater impact than asset purchases.
Pushing back against such proposals are three presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks, concerned that the central bank already has damaged public perceptions of its commitment to maintain inflation at a low level.
''If this drift in inflation risk tolerance were to persist, or were expected to persist, it could give rise to a damaging increase in inflationary expectations,'' one of the dissidents, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said earlier this month.
This position is embraced by many Republican members of Congress, and the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, but the dissident Fed officials have not returned that embrace. Mr. Kocherlakota, in the same speech, described the Fed's work as ''a largely technocratic exercise that is fundamentally apolitical.''
In addition to Mr. Bernanke's tolerance for public dissent -- reflecting his belief, developed during his prior life as an academic, that central banks should operate more transparently -- the fractious debate reflects the unusual challenges still confronting the Fed long after it expected to be on the road back to normalcy.
The Fed did not predict or prepare for the enduring economic malaise the country is now experiencing. Moreover, while Mr. Bernanke has led what is, taken all together, an unprecedented effort to spur renewed growth, at several points he has chosen to hesitate, avoiding the dangers of doing too much, only to find he had not done enough.
The Fed has twice paused its stimulus campaign, most recently in June, only to be forced back into action by evidence that growth once again was falling short of its predictions.
In August, the Fed announced its intention to maintain short-term interest rates near zero for at least two more years, provided that inflation remained low.
In September, at the committee's most recent meeting, the members decided to further reduce long-term interest rates by shifting $400 billion from investments in short-term Treasury securities to longer-term Treasuries.

HEADLINE: In Bid to Sell MF Global, Corzine's Grip Is Said to Slip Further

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
11:01 p.m. Updated Jon S. Corzine, whose political ambitions came to a halt nearly two years ago when he was defeated for re-election as governor of New Jersey, is running out of time to prevent his revived Wall Street career from collapsing in failure.
His firm, MF Global - a powerhouse in the world of commodities and derivatives trading but little known outside Wall Street - was working frantically toward a potential sale late Sunday. 
Those discussions, which narrowed to one bidder, Interactive Brokers, came after investors - worried that MF Global was too vulnerable to the fallout from Europe's debt crisis - deserted the firm, making it the first American financial institution to fall victim to the sovereign debt woes.
If the firm is unable to sell itself, other options, including bankruptcy, await. MF Global has hired restructuring and bankruptcy law firms including Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said people briefed on the matter but unauthorized to speak publicly. One option is for MF Global to follow a precedent set by Lehman Brothers in 2008 by seeking bankruptcy protection for the parent company while selling some assets to Interactive Brokers.
Other Wall Street firms have not been spared damage from the European debt crisis. Shares at firms as large as Morgan Stanley fell this month over concerns that they were exposed to Europe's troubles. And investment banks and brokerage firms are still licking their wounds from market volatility that has hurt trading operations.
MF Global began buying the debt of European countries like Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland last year, in a bet that the discounted prices of those bonds would soon recover. Its gamble, though, went sour, suffering as Greece's troubled economy spread woes across the Continent. Although European leaders appeared to make progress toward resolving those problems last week, and other firms rebounded, MF Global continued to suffer.
The last-ditch rescue effort is a major blow to the reputation of Mr. Corzine, 64, who formerly co-led Goldman Sachs and was also a United States senator. With a sale of MF Global, Mr. Corzine's role at the firm will almost certainly end, though he is expected to receive a severance payment of nearly $12.1 million.
Still, the departure will be bitter for Mr. Corzine, whose first stint on Wall Street ended with his ouster from Goldman Sachs. Along with Henry M. Paulson, another Goldman co-chief executive, who would later become Treasury secretary, Mr. Corzine, a former trader, led the firm through the Asian financial crisis of 1998. But trading losses in the last quarter of that year, on top of ill will within the firm over the decision to go public, led to Mr. Corzine's exit in January 1999.
He revived his career with a successful run for the Senate from New Jersey in 2000, and left the Senate in 2005 to run for governor of New Jersey. A weak economy and a corruption scandal helped Christopher J. Christie defeat him for re-election in 2009.
Mr. Corzine's arrival at MF Global in March 2010 was meant to be a triumphant return to Wall Street and to bond trading after a long absence. Though it is has operations worldwide, MF Global has just 2,800 employees, making it a fraction of the size of Goldman or Lehman.
Throughout the weekend, regulators focused on completing a deal that would sell at least a portion of the firm, a move that would avert a messy bankruptcy. But given its relatively small size, the firm is unlikely to send shockwaves in the financial system.
Most of MF Global's business involves executing and clearing trades in commodities and derivatives for clients like hedge funds. When Mr. Corzine joined, he sought to transform it into a full-fledged investment bank, in part by making riskier trades using the firm's own capital.
A large part of that strategy backfired, as analysts and regulators worried about $6.3 billion in bonds issued by Italy, Spain, Belgium, Ireland and Portugal. By contrast, the much larger Morgan Stanley disclosed this month that it had just a $2.1 billion exposure to Europe.
Regulators were less confident in MF Global's wager, asking it in August to raise the amount of money backing its bonds. The firm complied, though it argued that the bonds were trading at a few cents below par value.
Analysts appeared unimpressed. Late on Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the firm's credit rating, citing both weak financial performance and its European bond holdings. The next day, the firm reported a $186 million loss, its fourth loss in six quarters.
Two days later, both Moody's and another major agency, Fitch Ratings, downgraded MF Global to junk status. Such a move is disastrous for a financial firm, since it limits the number of trading parties willing to do business and raises borrowing costs.
Just as important, it can also scare customers, especially after the toppling of bigger firms during the financial crisis, like Bear Stearns and Lehman.
As of Friday, only a small percentage of customer money flowed out MF Global's door, according to a person briefed on the matter. By the end of last week and through the weekend, Mr. Corzine and his advisers at Evercore Partners had called seemingly every major Wall Street firm, offering to sell MF Global, or at least some of its businesses or trading positions. While the firm had held talks with another potential buyer, Jefferies & Company, by Sunday evening Interactive Brokers appeared to be in pole position.
Founded in 1977 by its chief executive, Thomas Peterffy, Interactive Brokers is a discount brokerage firm that places trades for customers on 90 exchanges.
The two firms share a deal history of sorts. In 2005, both competed for assets of Refco, which had filed for bankruptcy. MF Global emerged the victor, bidding $323 million for Refco's assets.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Flat Taxes and Angry Voters

 BODY:
By wide margins, Americans are now telling pollsters they want a tax system that raises more money and is more fair by asking the rich to pay more. They are connecting the dots between the lavish high-end tax cuts of the past decade and today's serious problems -- including widening inequality and mounting deficits -- and demanding change. The Republican presidential candidates aren't listening.
Take the flat tax plan of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. For all his talk about how it would make filing easier -- that is dubious -- what it would really do is give high-income Americans a big tax break, while almost everyone else could expect relatively modest tax savings or none at all. 
In his plan, taxpayers could choose to stick with the current system or use the flat tax, under which wages and salary would be taxed at 20 percent, versus a current top rate of 35 percent for the affluent. Investment income and multimillion-dollar estates would be untaxed, versus a current top rate of 15 percent on most investments and 35 percent on estates.
In a recent interview with The Times and CNBC, Mr. Perry said ''I don't care'' about criticisms that the plan is a giveaway to the rich. He expressed the magical belief that more and bigger high-end tax cuts would spur economic growth and generate significant new tax revenues.
That's a fairy tale, of course, and one that the conservative Republicans who vote in primaries love to hear. The rest of the country is feeling a lot more skeptical.
According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, nearly 70 percent of Americans say that Congressional Republicans' policies favor the rich and that they oppose lowering taxes for large corporations. Two-thirds polled say that wealth should be distributed more evenly; a similar share wants to increase taxes on millionaires, not cut them. In a previous Times/CBS poll from August, a majority of Americans also wanted to use tax increases to close the deficit, rather than rely only on spending cuts.
Mr. Perry has not provided the details necessary to independently analyze the plan's impact, but economists of the right and left agree that it would be a huge revenue loser. Mr. Perry's main prescription for dealing with the deficit is to slash government spending down to a level last seen in the 1960s -- before programs like Medicare, Pell grants and Head Start had kicked in and long before the baby boom generation was facing retirement.
Of course, Mr. Perry isn't the only Republican contender calling for cutting taxes on the rich and gutting the government's ability to pay for important programs. Herman Cain's ''9-9-9'' plan is a variant on the flat tax; Newt Gingrich supports a flat tax roughly similar to Mr. Perry's.
Mitt Romney has not endorsed a flat tax, and in 1996, when Steve Forbes, then a presidential candidate, floated one, Mr. Romney derided it -- justifiably -- as a ''tax cut for fat cats.'' But he is in favor of extending the Bush-era tax cuts and cutting taxes on investments and on corporations. And to tame deficits, he has called for hard spending caps, a tool that could lead to indiscriminate and overly harsh cutting.
President Obama has a better plan, but it is only a start. He has called for closing some corporate loopholes, ending the high-end Bush-era tax cuts and capping the value of tax deductions for high-income Americans. Importantly, he would use the new revenue to both finance needed government spending and reduce the deficit.
The country also needs a comprehensive reform of the tax system, one that strengthens progressivity and raises more revenue from a mix of sources. All of the needed revenue -- to meet health care needs; to improve education, infrastructure and security; to foster new technologies and protect the environment -- cannot be raised from rich Americans, nor from the income tax alone.
It is encouraging that after reflexively rejecting tax increases for so long, more Americans are recognizing that, in fact, incessant tax cutting is largely to blame for the nation's fragile condition, and that new taxes are part of the solution. If only more politicians would catch up.

HEADLINE: Obama Tries to Speed Response To Shortages in Vital Medicines

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will issue an executive order on Monday that the administration hopes will help resolve a growing number of critical shortages of vital medicines used to treat life-threatening illnesses, among them several forms of cancer and bacterial infections.
The order offers drug manufacturers and wholesalers both a helping hand and a gloved fist in efforts to prevent or resolve shortages that have worsened greatly in recent years, endangering thousands of lives. 
It instructs the F.D.A. to do three things: broaden reporting of potential shortages of certain prescription drugs; speed reviews of applications to begin or alter production of these drugs; and provide more information to the Justice Department about possible instances of collusion or price gouging.
Such efforts are included in proposed legislation that has been pending in Congress since February despite bipartisan support for its provisions.
The order, the first since 1985 by a president to affect the functions of the Food and Drug Administration, is part of a series of recent executive orders involving such disparate issues as mortgage relief and jobs for veterans. They are intended to show that the president, plagued by low approval ratings, is working to resolve the nation's problems despite a Congress largely paralyzed by partisan disagreements.
''The president's action is a recognition of the fact that this is a serious problem, and we can and should do more to help solve it,'' said an administration official who asked to remain anonymous to avoid upstaging the official announcement on Monday. ''We can't wait anymore.''
So far this year, at least 180 drugs that are crucial for treating childhood leukemia, breast and colon cancer, infections and other diseases have been declared in short supply -- a record number. Prices for some have risen as much as eightyfold, and clinical trials for some experimental cures have been delayed because the studies must also offer older medicines that cannot be reliably provided.
Patients with entirely curable diseases have been forced to take medicines that may not be as effective, adding anxiety to an already terrible ordeal.
The president's order is a modest effort that, while possibly helpful, is unlikely to resolve the problem soon or entirely. Administration officials characterized it as one step in a long and complicated effort. Indeed, Mr. Obama eschewed more ambitious proposals -- like government drug stockpiling or manufacturing -- that would have injected the government more directly into the nation's drug market and cost more but that might have been more effective.
Still, Mr. Obama's order and others he has issued recently reflect his belief in the power of government to improve people's lives. By contrast, top Republican legislators and presidential candidates have almost uniformly argued that resolving the nation's economic and other problems depends mostly on scaling back or ending government regulations to allow the free market to function more effectively. No regulatory agency touches people's lives more thoroughly than the F.D.A., which regulates 25 cents of every dollar spent by consumers.
Along with Mr. Obama's order, on Monday the administration will release two government reports that mostly blame a dysfunctional marketplace for drug shortages, directly contradicting assertions by some commentators that government rules are to blame. The analyses found that 74 percent of the medicines in short supply in 2010 were sterile injectibles, the kind of drugs delivered in hospitals or clinics to treat cancer or anesthetize patients before surgery.
The economic and technical hurdles to participating in this market have made it exceedingly inflexible, the analyses found. Just five large hospital buying groups purchase nearly 90 percent of the needed medicines, and only seven companies manufacture the vast majority of supply. In most cases, one company produces at least 90 percent of a drug's supply, and crucial ingredients -- many of them made in mammoth plants in India and China -- are often difficult to find, verify and approve, so years are needed to create new capacity. While demand has grown steadily in recent years, supply capacity has remained largely unchanged.
With so much supply dependent on so few companies and facilities, safety problems that arise anywhere in the system can result in enormous disruptions. Nearly half of the shortages followed inspections that found serious quality problems, including injectibles that had glass shards, metal filings and bacterial and fungal contamination, the reports found.
Even the generic drug industry is calling for more regulation. The industry recently agreed to provide the F.D.A. with nearly $300 million annually to bolster inspections and speed drug applications. That amounts to about 1 percent of the industry's revenues and about 5 percent of its profits in the United States, an extraordinary vote of confidence in the government's ability to improve the situation.
This money and an industry campaign to build more capacity may eventually resolve much of the supply disruptions. In the meantime, Mr. Obama will promise Monday to strengthen the staff of the drug agency's shortages team to deal with what are expected to be far more and detailed communications with manufacturers about events that could affect drug supplies, officials said.
The administration will also send letters to manufacturers reminding them of their legal responsibility to report pending supply disruptions of certain drugs and to encourage them to notify the drug agency of events that could possibly lead to disruptions even when not required to do so.
The rules needed to expand required notifications will take time to finalize, but the president's order will speed that process, administration officials said. The president will also announce his support of legislation proposed in both the House and Senate to expand even further reporting requirements from manufacturers.
Mr. Obama's order that the F.D.A. report to the Justice Department possible instances of price gouging or collusion is largely directed at the shadowy and fading world of small wholesalers that buy drugs from one set of users and in times of shortage sell them at huge markups to another. In one case, a leukemia drug that normally sold for $12 per vial was being sold for $990 per vial -- 80 times higher. A survey found that small wholesalers typically increased prices by 650 percent during shortages.

HEADLINE: Public Universities Seeking Out-of-State Students

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: Selective public universities are increasingly interested in enrolling out-of-state students, The Chronicle of Higher Education is reporting. 

 BODY:
In an article published on Sunday in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Eric Hoover and Josh Keller reported that public universities are escalating their recruitment of out-of-state students - students who not only bring geographic diversity to campus, but also pay higher tuition rates and improve a school's bottom line. That finding echoes the results of a recent Inside Higher Ed survey that concluded that more universities are seeking students based on their ability to pay.
Mr. Hoover and Mr. Keller highlighted Arizona State University's recruitment of California students and the University of California's recruitment of Texas students, among others. They wrote:
As the traditional borders on the enrollment map continue to erode, some observers have likened recruitment to an interstate game of swap. Randy Hodgins, the former chief lobbyist for the University of Washington, said he once told a joke to his counterpart at the University of California that has more than a grain of truth.
'The answer to both of our budget problems is, I take your kids and you take mine, and then they're both nonresidents,' Mr. Hodgins said.
But as the authors point out, the trend of students crossing state lines to matriculate at public institutions is not one-sided and is not simply the result of universities' recruitment efforts. As they wrote:
The story of student migration is bigger than budget cuts and tuition dollars. It's also about a mindset. Over the last half-century, the market for a college education has been transformed while the very concept of distance has changed. For many Americans, places that once seemed far away became reachable by car, on discount airlines, or online.
They go on to cite the research of the economist Caroline Hoxby -- The Choice has spoken with her before -- and her theory of "re-sorting," under which students' college choices are motivated less by distance and more by school resources.
In response to that shift, Mr. Hoover and Mr. Keller reported, colleges across the country have expanded both their class sizes and the scope of their searches for prospective students.
The authors noted that as selective public universities court students from across the country, they have started to re-appropriate merit aid dollars from in-state students to out-of-state students. (The University of California's increased focus on out-of-state students and its increase in scholarship money for such students, which The Choice pointed out last week, provide a good example of this.)
As The Chronicle reported, such a national focus has some people worried:
'Nobody would say higher education should be provincial,' said [Patrick M. Callan, founder and president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education], 'but from a broad policy perspective, this is likely to contribute to the growing stratification of higher education.'
'This is a mission issue - it's really a matter of what a public institution is,' he said.

HEADLINE: Few Americans Feel Better Off Than They Were Last Year

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Just 17 percent of Americans say they are better off financially than a year ago, a new survey finds. 

 BODY:
11/4/11 | Updated with fuller results.
Just 17 percent of Americans say they are better off financially than they were last year at this time, according to a new Bankrate.com survey. Thirty-one percent consider themselves worse off and 49 percent say they are financially about the same as a year ago. 
Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, cited the weak economy, sluggish housing sector and a volatile stock market in the results: "Americans' feelings about their savings, debt and net worth continue to erode," he said in a statement.
Bankrate.com's Financial Security Index fell in October to 92.8 from 93.9 and is now at its second-lowest level of the year. (Any reading below 100 indicates feelings of less financial security relative to 12 months ago.)
The study was conducted in October by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, using landline and cellphone interviews with 1,000 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The full survey can be viewed here.
In other findings, just 11 percent of Americans are more comfortable with the amount they have in savings now compared with one year ago, and 45 percent are less comfortable. 
Only 20 percent of Americans are more comfortable with their debt now, a figure that has dropped every month since June, and 27 percent are less comfortable.
Nineteen percent of Americans report higher net worth than one year ago, while 30 percent report lower net worth.
The survey found that older Americans have been hit hard by the economic turmoil. Thirty-one percent of Americans from ages 50 to 64 say they feel less secure in their jobs, and 14 percent consider themselves more secure. 
In addition, 56 percent in that age group say they feel less comfortable with how much they have in savings, while only 5 percent are more comfortable.
One bright spot (for waiters, at least): 70 percent said their tipping habits haven't changed due to the economy.
Do you feel your financial situation is better or worse than it was a year ago?

HEADLINE: The Depreciation of Care at Home

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: People who provide care to their own families and others deserve better protections from the government, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
At the next birthday party for your grandparents or yourselves, consider what the following public policies all have in common: 
Medicare pays for many expensive medical procedures that don't significantly prolong life, but does not cover the costs of custodial care for patients with diseases that can't be medically treated, such as Alzheimer's or dementia. 
Medicaid is far more likely to pay for nursing home care for the indigent elderly than to pay for home- and community-based services that would enable them to remain in their own homes. While some states do far better than others in this regard, at least 25 states and the District of Columbia cut spending on such services between 2007 and 2010. 
Plans to offer families affordable long-term care insurance - whose benefits would include stipends for family members providing care - were recently dropped from President Obama's health care plan.

Paid workers who care for individuals needing assistance in their own homes are not guaranteed a federal minimum wage or overtime protections because they are not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
All these policies take for granted family care, and forms of paid work that resemble family care, assuming that they don't merit public support or regulation. Yet the aging of the population means that the demand for home-care services is growing even as the supply of young people shrinks. 
Marital instability, geographic mobility, increased childlessness and the demands of paid employment all reduce the likelihood that family members will be able to fully meet care needs.
Women, who made up about 67 percent of all caregivers for adults at last count, may become increasingly unlikely to take on responsibilities that their brothers and husbands resist sharing. They may also prove reluctant to enter an occupation that is underpaid and not subject to federal labor regulation. 
Paid home and community-based services tend to be more cost-effective than nursing homes, partly because they can help organize and enable support from family members and friends. There is little evidence that they "crowd out" family care; on the contrary, families tend to use paid help when care needs exceed their own capacity, supplementing the total hours of care provided without reducing their own efforts. 
Paid home-care workers take on a variety of tasks, including preparing meals, feeding, bathing, doing laundry, changing sheets, ensuring pills are taken and providing reassurance and companionship.
But an outmoded administrative rule excludes them from coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act on the grounds that they are "merely" providing companionship. 
Pressure on both family and public budgets intensifies resistance to changing this rule, for fear of increased costs. But the small number of home-care workers who are providing companionship and nothing more could be excluded. 
Modest overall cost increases would be countervailed by reductions in turnover and improvements in care quality. Overtime restrictions would provide incentives to hire new workers and reduce unemployment. Many states are already on board (21 mandate a minimum wage, and 15 require overtime payment). 
Current and future family caregivers should favor better federal protections for paid home care workers out of respect for the value and dignity of caregiving itself. 
President Obama, who recently suggested a number of administrative rule changes in other policy areas, should urge Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis to extend coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
And everyone who hopes to grow old should demand more support for caregiving at home.

HIGHLIGHT: A plurality of American workers -- 16.9 percent -- are employed as "office and administrative support," according to a new report from the Labor Department. 

 BODY:
The occupation employing the greatest share of American workers is paper pushers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Well, technically the bureau reports that a plurality of workers -- 16.9 percent -- are employed as "office and administrative support," but you get the idea. Here's a chart from a new reporton occupational employment:
The Labor Department predictsthat many of the jobs in this group -- for example, mail clerks and proofreaders -- will be replaced by automation in the next few years. Occupations in customer service, however, are expected to add about 399,500 by 2018 "as businesses put an increased emphasis on building customer relationships," according to the bureau's Occupational Outlook Handbook.

HEADLINE: Once Revered, Business Icon is Now Reviled

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ AND HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: The India press debates R.K. Gupta's fall from grace. 

 BODY:
Since federal prosecutors charged Rajat Gupta, a former managing director of McKinsey & Co., last week with securities fraud in New York, passionate debate has raged in India about his motives and his legacy. His stunning fall from grace has inspired everything from soul-searching to conspiracy theories to folksy explanations of the charges.
For much of India's business and political establishment, Mr. Gupta, who denies the accusations against him, has long been the most visible example of the success Indians have enjoyed in the global business world. He grew up here, and advised business and political leaders.
"Why did rich Rajat Gupta turn to the grubby business of insider trading?" asked the Economic Times on Sunday in a emblematic story full of questions but short on hard answers. One theory the paper considers - he has four daughters approaching marrying age, and the cost of their weddings may have turned him.
India's media and business establishment seem to be weighing whether to disown him entirely, forgive his actions or blame someone else. The Times Now channel ran a 25-minute debate on its prime time news show about Mr. Gupta. The topic: "Pure greed or oversight?"
An extreme, but popular, view claims an anti-Indian bias in the United States. "There's a serious strand of thought among corporate chief executives in India that the prosecution of Gupta is part of a reaction to the dominance of Indian chief executives in America's boardrooms," said Dilip Cherian, a founder partner of Perfect Relations, a Delhi-based communications company. (Mr. Cherian emphasized he does not share that view.)
It should be noted here that the U.S. attorney who brought the case against Mr. Gupta, Preet Bharara, was also born in India; he and his family moved to the United States when he was a child.
A growing number of the United States' largest companies are led by Indians or Indian-Americans, including Citigroup, MasterCard and PepsiCo. But Mr. Gupta was one of the first, and for many years the most prominent, Indian face at the top echelons of corporate America. His every move and pronouncement was reported thoroughly by the Indian business press. Prime ministers looked to him for advice on improving India's economy and its education and health systems.
A month after Mr. Gupta was elected to head McKinsey & Co. in 1994, the Indian magazine Business Today put him on its cover with the headline "The Superboss." The accompanying story trumpeted the fact that Mr. Gupta was the "first-ever India-born CEO of a US transglobal corporation."
Maybe that explains why emotions are running high here in India. Suhel Seth, the marketing executive who is a fixture on Indian talk shows, decried Mr. Gupta as a "crook" on the Times Now debate, shouting down a more measured assessment from T.V. Mohandas Pai, a former executive at the technology firm Infosys. "Why are we defending the man?" Mr. Seth thundered. "Why is corporate India trying to say it was an error in judgment? There was no error in judgment. The man is a crook."
Pramath Raj Sinha, a former colleague and friend of Mr. Gupta, said he has been distressed by both the case against his friend and the reactions it has spawned here in India. Mr. Sinha, who was the first dean of the Indian School of Business that Mr. Gupta helped set up in Hyderabad, lives in New Delhi and runs a media company.
The tone and tenor of the debate "is completely unfair to Indians and to Rajat and the country," Mr. Sinha said. "You can't conveniently make somebody a mascot and then disown him."

HEADLINE: Study on 'Burn Pits' Cite Inadequate Evidence of Health Effects

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: A study released on Monday found that there was insufficient data to conclude that dust and pollution in the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan could cause long-term health problems in troops. 

 BODY:
For many years, troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have complained of breathing problems and some have been found with serious illnesses and diseases. Many doctors and researchers focused on one particular culprit: burn pits used by the military to incinerate everything from plastic water bottles to construction materials.
But a study released on Monday has found that there is insufficient data to conclude that pollution from burn pits in the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan could cause long-term health problems in troops.
The report by the Institute of Medicine, an independent policy organization, did not rule out the possibility that the fine dust and particle matter found in Iraq and Afghanistan, combined with the smoke from burn pits, could cause serious illnesses or lung injuries in troops. It just asserts that "shortcomings in research and gaps in evidence" prevent firmer conclusions.
The report also suggests that burn pits might not be the biggest respiratory-related health problem facing troops. Rather, it finds that "high particulate matter in the air" consisting of windblown dust, carbon and metals from vehicle emissions and industrial activities could be the greater danger. And the report calls for a long-term study into whether troops exposed to that pollution and dust develop illnesses or lung injuries.

HEADLINE: On a Busy Day, a Goldman Meeting and a Crucial Call

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Rajat K. Gupta's calendar for Sept. 23, 2008, provides a lens into the influential and busy life of the Goldman director and McKinsey senior partner at a time when federal prosecutors say he was also breaking the law. 

 BODY:
5:27 p.m. | Updated 
On Sept. 23, 2008, Rajat K. Gupta called the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam after a Goldman Sachs board meeting and told him secrets about the company, according to an indictment unsealed last week.
That same day, Mr. Gupta had two doctor appointments, dined with Ethiopia's health minister and got a haircut.
His calendar for Sept. 23, 2008 - entered into evidence during Mr. Rajaratnam's trial as Government Exhibit 3035 - provides a lens into the busy and influential life of Mr. Gupta at a time when federal prosecutors say he was also breaking the law.
Mr. Gupta, then 59, was an eminence grise in the worlds of international business and philanthropy, juggling his work as a senior partner emeritus at McKinsey, the elite management consulting firm that he once ran, with his public company directorships, investment activities and charitable pursuits.
After an early morning call with an executive in Qatar, Mr. Gupta spent the next several hours with physicians. He also sandwiched in a 15-minute haircut before being driven into Manhattan from his home in Westport, Conn.
Mr. Gupta did not get to his office at McKinsey until 2 p.m., the calendar says. He then had back-to-back meetings with Sandeep Tyagi, chairman of Estee Advisors, a money management firm based in Singapore, and K. Balasubramanian, a board member of the GMR Group, an infrastructure investment business in Bangalore, India.
The Goldman call came at 3 p.m. He participated in a 38-minute board meeting by phone during which the bank approved a $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett - news that the convulsing stock market, and Goldman's investors, would surely love.
The government highlighted Mr. Gupta's Sept. 23 schedule at the Rajaratnam trial during the testimony of Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive.
The calendar established for the jury that the Goldman board meeting had taken place when it did. Then, using a phone log, prosecutors showed that Mr. Gupta called Mr. Rajaratnam immediately afterward. Minutes later, just before the stock market closed, Mr. Rajaratnam bought large blocks of Goldman shares, according to trading records shown during the trial.
A jury convicted Mr. Rajaratanam in May. On Wednesday, the government charged Mr. Gupta, 62, with passing tips to Mr. Rajaratnam about Goldman and Procter & Gamble, where he also served as a director. Two of the five counts against Mr. Gupta, who is fighting the charges, relate to Mr. Rajaratnam's Sept. 23 Goldman trades.
Mr. Gupta's day did not end with the Goldman meeting. He spent the balance of the afternoon on his numerous nonprofit causes, including a meeting with Julian Schweitzer, the World Bank's head of health nutrition, and Raymond G. Chambers, the United Nations special envoy for malaria.
During those meetings, around 5 p.m., Goldman announced Mr. Buffett's big investment to the public.
Mr. Gupta closed out the day with a dinner at Django, the now-defunct Midtown Manhattan brasserie, in honor of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the health minister of Ethiopia. He then spent the night in a room at the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue, the calendar shows. His suite was booked by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm where, just that month, he had been named a senior adviser.
The next morning, prosecutors say, with Goldman's shares opening higher, Mr. Rajaratnam sold his position in the bank, booking an illegal profit of about $840,000.

HEADLINE: MF Global Bankruptcy Rattles Wall St. Firms

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: As investors sensed trouble, financial companies with a perceived exposure to the brokerage suffered in the markets. 

 BODY:
The markets were haunted this Halloween by the ghosts of the past financial crisis.
With MF Global filing for bankruptcy on Monday, investors pummeled many financial stocks, fearful that problems were lurking on the books of other Wall Street firms. It was a crisis of confidence, not unlike in 2008 when the markets punished stocks on mere speculation of trouble.
On Monday, companies with perceived exposure to MF Global bore the brunt of the pain. The Jefferies Group, which issued a statement saying it had a minimal stake in the brokerage, fell by nearly 10 percent. The Fortress Investment Group, which proactively disclosed that it had "literally zero" exposure, dropped by more than 11 percent.
"Investors across the financial sector are definitely on high alert trying to avoid or minimize these sovereign debt exposures," said Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Capital.
MF Global made a risky bet in a tumultuous market. Recently, the firm revealed that it had $6.3 billion of sovereign debt in troubled countries like Italy and Spain. The position was nearly five times the firm's equity of more than a billion dollars. As the sovereign debt crisis reached a peak in October, two rating agencies cut the grades on the company's debt, saying they questioned the firm's risk controls given the size of the position.
The downgrades sent the company into a tailspin. Trading partners asked the firm to post more money against their portfolio. Adding to the jitters, MF Global reported a third-quarter loss, which further eroded its stock and made its capital position even more tenuous. The firm drew down a $1.3 billion credit line as it fought to stay afloat. But it proved insufficient, and MF Global was forced to file for bankruptcy.
After Moody's downgrade last week, MF Global sent a letter to clients trying to reassure them of the firm's strength. On Monday, as some clients called to ask questions and liquidate their accounts, MF Global was not picking up the phone.
Some financial exchanges prevented MF Global employees from entering Monday, while others, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the IntercontinentalExchange, halted the firm's trading in the morning. That forced clients of MF Global to sit tight or liquidate their holdings.
"I'm disappointed in the way the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, MF Global and the regulators have handled this bankruptcy," said James L. Koutoulas, chief executive of Typhon Capital Management, a hedge fund client of MF Global. "They had no contingency plan in place and just cut off our trading screens, and we're forced to liquidate clients' accounts unfavorably."
It is difficult to know what other firms could face the same pressure. Most of the small brokerages that clear futures trades like MF Global are private companies, so their capital positions are not as vulnerable to the whims of the public markets. The rest of the industry is dominated by large banks, which analysts say have sufficient capital.
The irony is that MF Global's sovereign debt may turn out to be right - eventually. The firm was ostensibly making the wager that Europe would come to the rescue of its troubled economies and the countries would not default on their debt.
In such a event, MF Global's holdings would most likely have paid off. But investors and others just did not have the patience to wait and see.
"The positions still have not caused any losses to the best of my knowledge," said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill. "But this risk-taking is just excessive compared to the size of the balance sheet."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: The Backlash

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do you work with your spouse? If so, how's it going? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Economy 1: Small Beautiful?
Both small-business and consumer confidence remain low. Jared Bernstein says the perception of small businesses as job providers is wrong: "You can tweak the definitions, but even if you define 'small' as fewer than 500 people (as the federal government does, basically), you still find that half the work force is employed by large businesses." James Surowiecki says big is beautiful. Felix Salmon says it's start-ups that create jobs and that the lionization of small businesses is "unhelpful." Scott Shane says Occupy Wall Street is no friend of small business. None of this really matters to William Shatner.
The Economy 2: Here We Come
As recession fears begin to ease, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard says world power will soon swing back to America: "The American phoenix is slowly rising again. Within five years or so, the U.S. will be well on its way to self-sufficiency in fuel and energy. Manufacturing will have closed the labor gap with China in a clutch of key industries. The current account might even be in surplus." New data shows that the United States grew the most of anyone, by a lot, between 1970 and 2010. The World Bank says the United States ranks No. 4 for ease of doing business - but is not one of the top 10 countries for starting a small business (huh?). Third-quarter gross domestic product rises (pdf), and economists bump up their forecasts. The Fed considers more stimulus options. This chart shows what will happen if the deficit "super committee" fails.
Data: Property Prices Up
Caterpillar's profits are up. Durable goods orders rise. Truck tonnage increased but road traffic declined. Ninety-three percent of kids will be trick-or-treating tonight. The Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes and Moody's Commercial Property Index rise. Worldwide steel output remains strong. Retail employment stays depressed. Banks are finding they have too much cash.
Start-Ups: Leo Dives In
Leonardo DiCaprio dives into the start-up scene. A California start-up says it will create 1,200 local jobs (in Indiana). A social shopping site that lets users follow experts and celebrities who curate products raises $30 million. A start-up that began last year as a collaboration between professors and students in a Yale computer lab gets $9.5 million. Two Arizona State student-run companies are up for an award. Start-up investments rise in the third quarter. Office Depot and Century Payments introduce a new payment-processing service for small companies. Kristina Dell explains why some entrepreneurs choose to go it alone. Sarah Rich writes about an unusual incubator in Chattanooga, Tenn. SXSW 2012 is seeking health start-ups.
Marketing: Show Your Face and Allow Pets
A blogger offers seven tips on how to add more personality to your business blog: "Write as 'I' rather than 'our.' Sometimes small businesses want to make themselves look bigger than they are and run the risk of becoming rather impersonal. The use of the first person is friendlier and more personal." A free survey-authoring platform is introduced. Chapstick creates a social media controversy. Here are a few useful hashtags for Twittering owners. Shel Holtz and Cassie Pean plan a webinar on how to produce a social media news release. Kenji offers some networking tips from 125 years ago: "I've personally found that, to borrow a Japanese phrase, 'just showing your face' can often be enough to make the connections you need." A report shows how much the recession changed consumer spending in the United States. Stores that allow more pets see more customers.
Around the States: There Seems to Be a Buzz
A truck carrying millions of bees crashes in Utah. Small businesses in Florida are cringing over a new increase in workers' compensation rates. The rural economy rises slightly. Chicago's regional activity improves (pdf). Small-business owners are excited about a new Wal-Mart in Amherst, N.Y. Several barbers in Florida's Orange County are humiliated in front of their customers. Marcellus shale has been very good to Pennsylvanians. Here's what they were doing in Atlantic City 100 years ago.
Ideas: Sell Your Family?
The National Small Business Association's 2011 energy survey finds that over the past three years 82 percent of small-business owners have taken one or more steps to reduce the amount of energy their businesses consume. Admit it: you never knew these 13 punctuation marks existed. Noobpreneur finds three small-business trends to watch. Isabelle Mercier Turcotte shares ideas for making money online, such as, "Sell your family." Charles Mann explains how the potato changed the world. A truly brilliant idea: dress as a referee and start a brawl.
Your People: A Business Owner Changes 100 Lives
Zappos's chief executive tells how he keeps employees happy. A small-business owner gives 100 unemployed women makeovers for their next job interview. Here are 50 motivational people on the Web. Johnny Depp gives Ricky Gervais a piece of his mind. I.B.M. embraces gaming to train and develop employees. Small Business Trends lists the 10 best management books for small-business owners. Some people did amazing things this year. But Chaz Bono got the boot.
Red Tape Update: The I.R.S. Is on Track
A government verification system for new hires backfires and hurts small business. The Internal Revenue Service is on track to enforce taxes and penalties from the health care legislation. Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony play in a Jewish league. Here's a useful business tip: Don't delay your payment of payroll taxes. Gallup finds government regulation remains the top concern among small-business owners. The withholding tax on government contracts comes back to bite businesses.
Around the World: Some Disturbing Numbers From China
The Europeans buy some time. Brett Jensen shares 10 disturbing numbers from China (while all attention is on Europe), including: "1,400 percent. The amount of median family income in Shanghai it takes to buy an apartment. This is up from 600 percent 10 years ago. Other major cities show similar rises. This is a sign of a huge property bubble." A new service connects American manufacturers to Chinese customers. China pours money into smart grid technology. Four ideas are shared at Beijing's Startup Weekend. Jonathan Ortmans says Malaysia continues to transform itself from a producer of raw materials in the 1970s to an upper-middle-income country with a multisector economy. Business conditions improve for the Solomon Islands. A London retailer creates the world's first farm in a shop.
Technology: Can It Make a Phone Call?
Bill.com adds e-billing to its billing and invoicing app. Joe Mandese says the latest mobile app is phone calls? Here's how Netflix lost 800,000 customers. Citrix drives down the cost of virtual desktops. The iPad is killing our hotel Wi-Fi connections. Facebook is becoming an online payment provider. Apple joins Oreo and Capri Sun as the most popular youth brands. There's a new app to deter bullies. Oracle aims to expand its cloud lineup. Not all of Google's products have been successful. Cloud computing is projected to account for one-quarter of the Federal information technology budget. H.P.'s Meg Whitman joins the board of a mobile marketplace company. Ed Bott warns small businesses to beware the Office 365 fine print. Here are five iPad apps for remote workers.
The Week Ahead: An Unemployment Drop Predicted
Expect some volatility. The Institute for Supply Management tells us how much purchasing managers are buying. The Federal Open Market Committee issues its statement and will have a press conference on monetary policy. ADP releases employment numbers for the month, and on Friday we'll get the government's new unemployment rate. Gallup predicts a big drop.
The Week's Bests
Reason to Not Start a Company. Penelope Trunk suggests red flags for when you know it's time to leave your start-up, including "Marital exhaustion": "The dirty secret about start-up founders is they can't keep marriages together. Part of the reason for this is they are crazy to begin with. And part of the reason is that you have to be married to your company to do a start-up. So divorce rates are high, especially among women, because they are much less likely to have a spouse who is willing to stay home and keep the family intact. So I got a divorce. It was on the cover of The New York Times. And all P.R. is good P.R., of course, but I realized, while I was going through the process, that I wanted a successful marriage more than I wanted a successful career. And then I thought, 'No. I want both.' And I became exhausted wondering how women get both. (Until I realized, oh, this is why women don't do start-ups.)"
Reason to Not Start a Company With Your Spouse. Michael Idov opened a charming neighborhood coffee shop, "then it destroyed my life": "Within weeks, Lily and I - previously ensconced in an enviably stress-free marriage - were at each other's throats. I hesitate to say which was worse: working the same shift or alternating. Each option presented its own small tortures. Two highly educated professionals with artistic aspirations have just put themselves - or, as we saw it, each other - on $8-per-hour jobs slinging coffee. After four more months, we grew suspicious of each other's motives, obsessively kept track of each other's contributions to the cause ("You worked three days last week!"), and generally waltzed on the edge of divorce. The marriage appears to have been saved by a well-timed bankruptcy."

HEADLINE: Welcome

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Introducing The Loyal Opposition, Andrew Rosenthal's new political blog. 

 BODY:
If you don't know my name, you probably know my work. I'm the editorial page editor of The New York Times, which means I'm in charge of the paper's opinion sections in print and online - editorials, Op-Eds, letters to the editor and Sunday Review. I head the editorial board, the 19 people who produce the unsigned editorials you can read on our site and in our paper every day. Those articles represent the institutional voice of the board, the editor and the publisher - not, and I can't say this often enough even if Republican politicians refuse to believe it, the Times newsroom.
Now I'm starting this blog: The Loyal Opposition. It will be a place for me to highlight the conversation around a given day's opinion pieces, to keep tabs on the stories that have caught the board's attention, or just mine, and to provide quick takes on breaking news. While I will be sharing my personal point of view more than is usual for someone in my job, I will call upon the expertise of my colleagues on the board, asking for their informed opinions about, for instance, the latest Supreme Court decision or the most recent unemployment numbers.
The Loyal Opposition will be more informal than the editorial page, but I will not be blogging about my Netflix queue or my favorite restaurants. (O.K., maybe my Netflix queue.) Nor will I blog about bloggers. I won't wade into spats with other journalists or with political activists - an undignified practice that I can't imagine is of interest to most people. I will, however, try to respond (at a pace that I'll figure out as I go along) to the comments and questions and concerns of our ordinary readers. And I invite you to join me on Twitter and Facebook, which I'll use more or less like DVD extras for my blog.
What's with the title? Although I often find myself in opposition with what is going on in Washington, I'm not out to destroy government or to drag down individuals. My intention is to engage in and encourage debate and dissent, which are vital to democracy. So, please, no name-calling. As Woody Allen put it in "Stardust Memories" (not on my Netflix queue): "To you I'm an atheist. To God, I'm the loyal opposition." By the way, before the Twitter attacks start, I'm not an atheist - I just like the joke.
For those of you wondering why The Times decided to wait until the fourth quarter of 2011 to unleash me on the Internet, I should explain that we are undertaking a major expansion of our opinion report online, and a blog about issues large and small seemed like a necessary part of that. It's been nearly 15 years since Jorn Barger coined the term "weblog." I figured it was time to give it a try.

HEADLINE: The Fracking Divide: Who Will Prevail in N.Y.?

BYLINE: PETER APPLEBOME


HIGHLIGHT: A new poll shows that New York State residents are almost evenly divided on natural gas drilling. Opposition is stronger upstate, but the question remains whether it is potent enough for New York to do what no state has done: turn away the gas industry's favored technology. 

 BODY:
Like the blind man and the elephant, the politics of gas drilling depend a lot on where you look.
A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found residents of New York State almost evenly split on drilling, with 44 in favor because of economic benefits and 43 percent opposed because of environmental concerns. That represents a modest trend toward skepticism. In August, the poll found 47 percent to 42 percent in favor.
But polls, some more scientific than others, in many of the areas most likely to see gas drilling tend to show overwhelming opposition of two-thirds or more, particularly to horizontal hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial process that injects chemicals and massive amounts of water into shale to free natural gas. (As I noted in an article in Sunday's Times, the divide has led to ill will, often intimate and intense, in small towns and rural areas.) 
Ken Jaffe of Slope Farms in Meredith, N.Y., cited surveys by Pulse Opinion Research showing 72 percent of respondents in Delaware County and 69 percent in Sullivan County opposing fracking in their towns.

"The story is the overwhelming local opposition, and the plan of the governor to ally with the gas companies to act against local voters and their governments, and attempt to eviscerate local land use regulation that is guaranteed by the N.Y. State Constitution,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. 
Anti-fracking forces have become an increasingly potent force upstate. More than 50 local communities have approved or are contemplating bans on fracking. Anti-fracking candidates and slates are proliferating without a countermovement on the other side. And fracking opponents are hoping to raise the stakes as high as possible for Gov. Andrew Cuomo by circulating a petition that says: "I pledge that I will never vote for Andrew Cuomo for any public office, ever, if he tries to force us to exist with hydrofracking in New York."
But majority rule doesn't always dictate what people can do with their own land. And the question remains whether that opposition is potent enough for New York to do what no state has done: turn away the gas industry's favored technology, strip many landowners of their ability to lease their land and ban fracking. 
That would probably mean turning New York's back on its potential share of the Marcellus Shale, a giant gas field that an industry report estimates as worth more than $2 trillion.
Opponents say the long-term cost would exceed the benefits. But with New York State close to completing its final regulations on gas drilling, hearings at four areas around the state in November are sure to show just how high the stakes are for both sides.

HEADLINE: Better Batteries: Not Just for Cars Anymore

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A new wind farm in West Virginia relies on batteries to smooth its output to the grid. And the manufacturer says that a new generation of batteries will have far more capacity. 

 BODY:
 in Saturday's paper, energy storage will be critical to making wind power more useful. Some wind farms are forced to dump a substantial portion of their production because they churn out megawatts in the middle of the night, when there is very little demand for it. At such times, some grid operators even chargegenerators for making power rather than paying them for it. 
 A wind farm I visited last week has 98 megawatts of power, meaning it could run 30-odd Super Wal-Marts. But the maximum power of a battery installation is just 32 megawatts, or just one-third of that wind power, and it fills up in 15 minutes.
Still, the technology of batteries is changing. The ones in use at the Laurel Mountain wind farm in West Virginia are cylindrical, in a standard industry size that is between the C and D cells that are familiar to consumers. According to Bud Collins, vice president of A123 Systems, which supplied the batteries, the next iteration will be completely different, shaped like fat magazines. 
Originally developed for the electric car industry, they will have more capacity.

 The batteries at Laurel Mountain are stored in racks like those in a computer data center with air-conditioning units in between to keep them from overheating. As they charge and discharge, some of the energy is lost as heat. (In fact, the round-trip efficiency is about 90 percent; the other 10 percent either becomes heat or is used to power the air conditioners.)
But if the number of batteries is increased, the amount of current running through each one will be smaller and heat buildup will be lower. That will allow the batteries to be more tightly packed without overheating, engineers say.
Costs are falling, as they are for various electronic components, but the economics of batteries remain dicey. One factor working in favor of more battery storage, though, is changes in the way grid operates.
PJM, the 13-state grid operator, functions both as a market for electricity and a market for various other services that batteries can help supply. One is regulation, which means injecting or subtracting power rapidly to keep the grid at a strict 60 cycles per second, the alternation in alternating current. The batteries do that now. 
But another service for which batteries could be paid is "fast response." Since a wind farm or a solar farm can change power levels very quickly, faster than most fuel-burning generators can adjust to, the grid operator needs other resources that can jump in and increase output or cut it almost instantly. 
Scott Baker, a solutions analyst for PJM who specializes in the integration of energy technology with the grid, says the company is rewriting its rules in a way that will mean more revenue for batteries and other sources that can expand output quickly.

 BODY:
MF Global Said to Be Preparing a Bankruptcy Filing | Shares in MF Global Holdings were halted for trading early on Monday, as the brokerage prepared to file for bankruptcy protection and sell some of its assets to the Interactive Brokers Group, according to people briefed on the matter.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a statement that it had suspended doing any business with MF Global until the firm "is fully capable of discharging the responsibilities set out in the New York Fed's policy."
MF Global, run by Jon S. Corzine, is a powerhouse in the world of commodities and derivatives trading that became the first American financial institution to fall victim to Europe's sovereign debt woes as investors deserted the firm. It is a primary dealer, meaning that it is one of 22 firms allowed to trade directly with the Fed and make a market in securities like Treasury notes.

 DEAL NOTES
An Oil Chief's $100 Million Pay Day | Eugene M. Isenberg, chairman of the oil drilling company Nabors Industries, is receiving a cash payment that might make a Wall Street chieftain blush: $100 million, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Mr. Isenberg had also been the company's chief executive but was stripped of that title on Friday, making him merely chairman and initiating a rich, severance-style payout, The Journal reports, noting that a director of the company suggested the management shake-up was "not fun" for Mr. Isenberg.
WALL STREET JOURNAL

HEADLINE: MF Global Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The filing is a humbling blow for the firm's chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, who joined the company after a decade as a United States senator and governor of New Jersey. 

 BODY:
MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection for the United States parent company on Monday, the first American financial casualty of the European debt crisis. 
In the Chapter 11 filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the firm's parent company listed assets of $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of more than $1 billion. JPMorgan Chase is identified as the biggest creditor, as the administrative agent for a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. The bank itself only has about an $80 million exposure to the MF Global loan, having syndicated the rest, according to a person briefed on the matter. 
Deutsche Bank is the second biggest, with a $325 million claim on behalf of bondholders.
As recently as Sunday night, MF Global was expected to sell some assets to Interactive Brokers Group, a Connecticut-based brokerage firm. But by Monday afternoon, the deal appeared almost certainly dead, according to people briefed on the matter.
An initial obstacle to the deal emerged over the weekend when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of several federal regulators involved in the talks, raised questions about the capital levels at MF Global, these people said. It is unclear whether the agency's concerns derailed the deal. 
The acquisition would have been somewhat similar to what Lehman Brothers did in 2008, when its parent filed for bankruptcy but Barclays bought some of its assets. 
Earlier on Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a number of exchanges said they had suspended MF Global from conducting new business with them.
The bankruptcy filing is a humbling blow for the firm's chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, who took the reins of the firm in 2010 after a decade as a United States senator and governor of New Jersey. 
The law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom is representing MF Global in the bankruptcy proceedings.
The descent into bankruptcy came after a week when investors fled MF Global and credit ratings agencies cut their ratings on the firm to junk status. 
The agencies said they were concerned that MF Global lacked a sufficient capital cushion if its $6.3 billion in European debt went bad. The firm took a gamble in buying the troubled bonds of Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland last year, calculating that they would soon recover. 
Faced with dwindling cash, MF Global tapped a $1.3 billion credit line last week.

HEADLINE: Europe's Debt Crisis Stymies Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Changing priorities have left investment banks, hedge funds and even nonfinancial companies in a holding pattern about the compliance and costs of new regulation. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As the Continent grapples with the sovereign debt crisis, financial regulatory revision in Europe has been put on the back burner, with some rules delayed until at least 2013.
The changing priorities have left investment banks, hedge funds and even nonfinancial companies in a holding pattern about compliance and costs, a situation that is weighing on earnings prospects.
"It's the uncertainty that's killing everybody," said Anthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association, a trade organization based in London for companies involved in the derivatives markets. "No one can measure the scale or cost of the regulation until it's finalized."
In the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, European regulators outlined the broad aims of a financial overhaul. But policy makers dragged their feet in the months that followed, unable to come to a consensus on critical areas like derivatives trading. Now, rule-making has been all but forgotten as they deal with teetering economies like Greece and Spain.
Most European rules won't be in place before 2013, more than a year behind the original deadline, according to the Financial Stability Board, an international body tasked with strengthening the financial markets through improved regulation. Policy makers in the United States, which has faced its own delays, are on track to complete the bulk of their regulations by next year, with some already approved.
The biggest problems on the Continent center on how to wrangle the $600 trillion global derivatives markets. Negotiations have largely pitted Britain, which favors looser regulation, against France and Germany, which want stricter limits placed on markets.
France and Germany, two euro zone heavyweights, argue that only over-the-counter trades should be reported to central repositories that collect the data and be cleared through central counterparties. Britain, which handles 75 percent of such trading in Europe, says that would put London at a disadvantage to rivals in Paris and Frankfurt. Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has fought to extend regulation to all derivatives, including those traded on electronic platforms.
The debate comes as Germany's Deutsche Borse stands poised to become the world's largest platform for derivatives trading if its planned merger with NYSE Euronext receives regulatory approval. Under the European Union's current proposal, Deutsche Borse and Europe's other electronic platforms would face less regulatory oversight than Britain's over-the-counter financial dealers. British officials fear that would hurt London's dominance as Europe's financial capital if businesses leave in search of trading centers with fewer regulatory costs.
On Oct. 4, both sides reached a basic compromise. Initially, the European Union will regulate only over-the-counter derivatives starting in 2013. The rules will eventually expand to include electronic-traded derivatives, although no time frame was given.
"The whole process has been very disjointed," said Sean Sprackling, a director at the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in London.
For European companies, the protracted legislative process has made it difficult to know what compliance and risk management structures they will need to develop - and at what cost.
Under the European proposal, Siemens, Philips, the British supermarket giant Tesco and other nonfinancial businesses will be exempt from reporting their derivatives transactions to trade repositories and clearing them through central counterparties. But the plan has added a caveat. When the rules take hold, those so-called end users whose derivatives trading operations reach a certain threshold will have to comply with regulations governing trade repositories and clearinghouses. Details on the threshold, however, have yet to be agreed on.
End users that rely on investment banks to develop and execute their derivatives - rather than in-house teams - may still have to expand their compliance teams despite working through a financial intermediary. That would be an extra cost that would hit earnings just as Europe's nonfinancial companies are struggling to respond to a renewed slowdown in the global economy.
"A number of end users will be captured by the full regulation even if they're dealing through a licensed firm," Mr. Belchambers of the Futures and Options Association said.
Banks and other financial institutions have threatened to move their operations elsewhere if the changes in the United States and Europe become too onerous. But those fears are overblown, according to Barnabas W. B. Reynolds, head of the financial institutions advisory practice at the law firm Shearman & Sterling in London.
For one, the derivatives rules in the United States and Europe are expected to have broadly similar objectives. So even though there will be a gap when the two regions have different regimes, it is unlikely to be long enough for companies to benefit from any regulatory arbitrage.
And analysts also say they believe it is unlikely that companies will seek out regulatory-friendly markets in Asia like Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr. Reynolds said New York and London simply provided greater stability during periods of turmoil.
"The pecking order of financial centers will remain the same," he said. "In a time of uncertainty, there's always a flight to quality."

HEADLINE: Regulators Investigating MF Global for Missing Money

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS, MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Federal regulators have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money has gone missing from MF Global in recent days, prompting an investigation into the company's operations. 

 BODY:
9:55 p.m. | Updated 
Federal regulators have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money has gone missing from MF Global in recent days, prompting an investigation into the brokerage firm, which is run by Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor, several people briefed on the matter said on Monday.
The recognition that money was missing scuttled at the 11th hour an agreement to sell a major part of MF Global to a rival brokerage firm. MF Global had staked its survival on completing the deal. Instead, the New York-based firm filed for bankruptcy on Monday.
Regulators are examining whether MF Global diverted some customer funds to support its own trades as the firm teetered on the brink of collapse.
 The discovery that money could not be located might simply reflect sloppy internal controls at MF Global. It is still unclear where the money went. At first, as much as $950 million was believed to be missing, but as the firm sorted through its bankruptcy, that figure fell to less than $700 million by late Monday, the people briefed on the matter said. Additional funds are expected to trickle in over the coming days.
But the investigation, which is in its earliest stages, may uncover something more intentional and troubling.
In any case, what led to the unaccounted-for cash could violate a tenet of Wall Street regulation: Customers' funds must be kept separate from company money. One of the basic duties of any brokerage firm is to keep track of customer accounts on a daily basis.
Neither MF Global nor Mr. Corzine has been accused of any wrongdoing. Lawyers for MF Global did not respond to requests for comment.
Now, the inquiry threatens to tarnish further the reputation of Mr. Corzine, the former Goldman Sachs executive who had sought to revive his Wall Street career last year just a few months after being defeated for re-election as New Jersey's governor.
When he arrived at MF Global - after more than a decade in politics, including serving as a Democratic United States senator from New Jersey - Mr. Corzine sought to bolster profits by increasing the number of bets the firm made using its own capital. It was a strategy born of his own experience at Goldman, where he rose through the ranks by building out the investment bank's formidable United States government bond trading arm.
One of his hallmark traits, according to the 1999 book "Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success," by Lisa Endlich, was his willingness to tolerate losses if the theory behind the trades was well thought out.
He made a similar wager at MF Global in buying up big holdings of debt from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland at a discount. Once Europe had solved its fiscal problems, those bonds would be very profitable.
But when that bet came to light in a regulatory filing, it set off alarms on Wall Street. While the bonds themselves have lost little value and mature in less than a year, MF Global was seen as having taken on an enormous amount of risk with little room for error given its size. By Friday evening, MF Global was under pressure to put up more money to support its trading positions, threatening to drain the firm's remaining cash.
The collapse of MF Global underscores the extent of investor anxiety over Europe's debt crisis. Other financial institutions have been buffeted in recent months because of their holdings of debt issued by weak European countries. The concerns about MF Global's exposure to Europe prompted two ratings agencies to cut their ratings on the firm to junk last week.
The firm played down the effect of the ratings, saying, "We believe that it bears no implications for our clients or the strategic direction of MF Global."
Even by Sunday evening, MF Global thought it had averted its demise after a disastrous week. Over five days, the firm lost more than 67 percent of its market value and was downgraded to junk status, which prompted investor desertions and raised borrowing costs.
Mr. Corzine and his advisers frantically called nearly every major Wall Street player, hoping to sell at least some of the firm in a bid for survival.
On Friday, the asset manager BlackRock was hired to help MF Global wind down its balance sheet, which included efforts to sell its holdings of European debt. BlackRock was able to value the portfolio, but did not have time to find a buyer for it given the other obstacles MF Global faced, according to people close to the talks.
By Saturday, Jefferies & Company became the lead bidder to buy large portions of MF Global, before backing out late in the day.
On Sunday, a rival firm, Interactive Brokers, emerged as the new favorite. But the Connecticut-based firm coveted only MF Global's futures and securities customers.
While MF Global was resigned to putting its parent company into bankruptcy, Interactive Brokers was also willing to help prop up other MF Global units, including a British affiliate.
By late Sunday evening, an embattled MF Global had all but signed a deal with Interactive Brokers. The acquisition would have mirrored what Lehman Brothers did in 2008, when its parent filed for bankruptcy but Barclays of Britain bought some of its assets.
But in the middle of the night, as Interactive Brokers investigated MF Global's customer accounts, the potential buyer discovered a serious obstacle: Some of the customer money was missing, according to people close to the discussions. The realization alarmed Interactive Brokers, which then abandoned the deal.
Later on Monday, when explaining to regulators why the deal had fallen apart, MF Global disclosed the concerns over the missing money, according to a joint statement issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulators, however, first suspected a potential shortfall days ago as they gathered at MF Global's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, the people briefed on the matter said. It is not uncommon for some funds to be unaccounted for when a financial firm fails, but the magnitude in the case of MF Global was unnerving.
For now, there is confusion surrounding the missing MF Global funds. It is likely, one person briefed on the matter said, that some of the money may be "stuck in the system" as banks holding the customer funds hesitated last week to send MF Global the money.
But the firm has yet to produce evidence that all of the $600 million or $700 million outstanding is deposited with the banks, according to the people briefed on the matter. Regulators are looking into whether the customer funds were misallocated.
With the deal with Interactive Brokers dashed, MF Global was hanging in limbo for several hours before it filed for bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a number of exchanges said they had suspended MF Global from doing new business with them.
It was not the first time regulators expressed concerns about MF Global.
MF Global confirmed on Monday that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the S.E.C. - had "expressed their grave concerns" about the firm's viability.
By midmorning on Monday, the firm filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: It's Lonely Without the Goldman Net

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A series of blunders by former senior executives of Goldman Sachs raises questions about whether the firm's secret for success can actually be exported. 

 BODY:
That is the refrain you hear over and over again when MF Global insiders try to explain why they went along with Jon Corzine's risky trades - the same ones that caused a crisis of confidence at the firm and, ultimately, its bankruptcy on Monday.
Mr. Corzine was at Goldman Sachs for nearly 25 years, rising to become its senior partner before being ousted in a boardroom coup in 1999. He was considered a bright, aggressive trader who had a history of making big bets that paid off. When he joined MF Global last year - after a decade in politics as a Democratic senator and governor of New Jersey - he talked openly about his ambition to create a mini-Goldman.
Being a former Goldmanite has long been considered the ultimate calling card.
 But, in some cases, it has proved to be a liability: A series of blunders by former senior Goldman executives raises questions about whether Goldman's secret sauce can actually be exported. Think John Thain. Or Robert Rubin. Or J. Chris Flowers.
"Those people walked around with halos around them. Myths have been created on Wall Street. Nowhere is the myth bigger than at Goldman," William Cohan, the author of "Money and Power, How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World," a 658-page volume that explored the firm's history and culture, said in an interview.
But Mr. Cohan, pausing briefly, added that whatever myths might exist around Goldman, "Everybody puts their pants on the same way, one foot at a time."
It is a lesson that some of Goldman's smartest alumni have learned the hard way, none more so than Mr. Corzine.
His outsize bets at MF Global on European sovereign debt - many of which he made personally - proved the firm's undoing because of the large amount of leverage that he used to magnify his bets. As of the firm's filing at the end of June, it had $44.4 billion worth of liabilities; yet it only had $1.4 billion of equity. That kind of leverage was enough to scare credit ratings agencies into downgrading the firm last week, which led counterparties to stop trading with it.
In truth, Mr. Corzine's bet may still prove to be correct. Many of the Italian and Spanish bonds that Mr. Corzine bought - most of which mature in 2012 - are still trading at 98 and 99 cents on the dollar. Mr. Corzine's investment thesis always was that the European Central Bank and the European Union would find a way to prop them up. But Mr. Corzine's bets also relied on short-term funding and, given the skepticism in the market, counterparties quickly ran for cover.
Even if Mr. Corzine's gamble was right, it is hard to believe that he could have made such a large bet at Goldman Sachs.
"The one thing Goldman really does well - better than everyone else - is the internal accounting and compliance function. They give those people a lot of power," Mr. Cohan said. At MF Global, Mr. Cohan asked: "Who in the world was going to stand up to Jon Corzine? Nobody. They didn't have the compliance or the culture."
That may be the special ingredient at Goldman. While the firm encourages risk-taking by its traders, it also empowers its risk managers - at other firms considered the back office - to constantly challenge even the most senior leaders to keep them from going over the cliff.
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's current chief executive, loves to tell people that he spends "98 percent of my time thinking about 2 percent probabilities." That is not something you hear from most bank chief executives.
In the case of Mr. Corzine, at MF Global, he was the chairman and chief executive. Given that he was directing the investment strategy, he might as well have been the compliance officer too. The only people with any authority who could have meaningfully pushed back were the board. And it is possible the Goldman halo may have even kept regulators at bay.
"The firm may have been cut some slack given who he is," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. (Still, he says he think it was unlikely.)
Once outside of the Goldman fishbowl, with its layers of risk management, Wall Street can become a lonely place for some of its most famous alumni.
Mr. Thain, Goldman's former chief financial officer, took the top job at Merrill Lynch after personally doing what he thought was a deep dive into the firm's financial records and declaring that the firm had a clean bill of health. Less than a year later, he was forced to sell the firm to Bank of America and was later fired after the disclosure of huge losses. (In fairness, Mr. Thain didn't create Merrill's problems - they happened on Stanley O'Neal's watch - but he didn't manage them particularly well.)
Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman - and former Treasury secretary - joined Citigroup as a senior adviser and board member in 1999. A dazzling trader when he was at Goldman, he counseled Citigroup that the firm should take more risk. While he did not manage the firm's trading or its day-to-day activities, the firm lost more than 70 percent of its value during his tenure, and ultimately the government had to bail out the company twice. It is clearly debatable whether he deserves blame, but the outcome is incontrovertible. What is clear is that Citigroup did not have the kind of risk management or culture that Mr. Rubin had grown accustomed to at Goldman.
Likewise, Mr. Flowers, a remarkable Goldman banker, left the firm in 1998 to strike out on his own. One of his first investments - Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which became Shinsei Bank - turned out to be a grand slam home run, reaping him $1 billion in profits. But since then, the investment has lost ground and his investment record has been spotty. His most recent fund has already lost almost $4 billion.
Which brings us back to Mr. Corzine, who is a good friend of Mr. Flowers. Mr. Corzine happens to be an operating partner and investor in Mr. Flowers's firm. Mr. Flowers is, in turn, an investor in MF Global. His fund stands to lose about $48 million as a result of MF's bankruptcy. Maybe they could have used another risk manager from Goldman?

HEADLINE: MF Global: Good Bets, Bad Timing?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Corzine's firm may yet be proved right in anticipating that Europe would not let countries like Italy and Spain default. But it will be too late. 

 BODY:
The graves of Wall Street, it has long been said, are filled with those who were right too soon.
The great irony of the failure of MF Global, the firm run by Jon Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey and the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, is that its bets will, in the long run, probably turn out to have been good ones. He is said to have bet large sums that Europe would not let countries like Italy and Spain default. If that was right, then the elevated interest rates available on government bonds represented a phenomenal bargain.
And so it may be. But even it proves to play out just as Mr. Corzine forecasted, it won't do MF, or Mr. Corzine's reputation, any good.
Whatever is going to happen in the future, in the present sovereign bond prices have been sliding.
An unleveraged investor could have ridden out the current downturn, but MF, as is the fashion on Wall Street, was heavily leveraged. Its June 30 balance sheet showed $44.4 billion of liabilities and only $1.4 billion of equity. The firm was heavily dependent on short-term funding, with less than half a billion in long-term debt. That meant the firm was vulnerable if the value of its holdings fell, or if its lenders simply got nervous and demanded more collateral to back the loans.
Some combination of that may have happened. 
There are a couple of obvious questions. Did MF take risks that were too large or too concentrated? Risk officers are supposed to keep that from happening, but when the chief executive is the trader that is not easy to do. Were there margin calls that MF deemed unreasonable? Will it complain about its lenders? Wouldn't it be fun if Mr. Corzine blamed Goldman for his problems?
This is a reminder of the wisdom of the Volcker Rule. Let gambling be done by those that cannot call on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Treasury for a bailout, and by those that do not have access to low-cost insured deposits.
It is also a reminder that liquidity can be a fair-weather thing. It was only a week ago that we were hearing that MF had all kinds of available liquidity. Now it has filed for bankruptcy protection.

HEADLINE: Rich Get Biggest Break in Perry Tax Plan, Study Finds

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Compared with current tax policy, the plan would also be likely to reduce federal tax revenues by $570 billion, or about 15 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. 

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry's proposal for an opt-in flat tax would primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans, according to a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research organization. Compared with current tax policy, the plan would most likely reduce federal tax revenue by $570 billion, or about 15 percent.
The plan, released last week as part of Mr. Perry's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, allows taxpayers to calculate their personal income taxes under the existing tax code, which is progressive. But it also allows taxpayers to instead have their income taxed at a flat 20 percent rate. In this alternative system, long-term capital gains, qualified dividends and Social Security benefits would not be taxed, and only a handful of deductions would be allowed. Once a household chooses the new system, it cannot switch back.
Because no one would be forced to use the alternate system, Mr. Perry has said, no one would have to pay higher taxes (at least initially; presumably if a family's income changes a few years after entering the plan, it may no longer be advantageous). Even so, the greatest beneficiaries of the flat-tax option -- that is, the households that would be most likely to switch to this system -- are far and away the highest earners:


Cash Income Percentile Percent of Tax Units Receiving a Tax Cut Average Tax Cut Received Among Those Receiving a Cut	Lowest Quintile18.9-223	Second Quintile27.0-616	Middle Quintile39.7-1,338	Fourth Quintile56.5-2,459	Top Quintile83.3-28,519	All40.5-9,508	Addendum	80-9073.2-4,229	90-9591.1-7,987	95-9995.7-29,983	Top 1 Percent97.0-296,845	Top 0.1 Percent99.0-1,556,660	Of all households in the bottom quintile of the tax distribution, only 18.9 percent would pay less in taxes under the Perry plan.
Meanwhile, 83.3 percent of households in the top quintile would get a tax cut. Closer inspection shows that almost household in the top 1 percent would be offered a tax cut.
The size of the typical tax cut is also much larger for the richest households, both in raw numbers and as a share of that household's income. For households in the top 0.1 percent, for example, after-tax income would rise by 27.4 percent. If every American household, however, chose the flat-tax system, after-tax incomes across the country would increase by an average of just 5.3 percent.
In addition to changes to individual income taxes, the Perry plan would also reduce the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent; allow companies to expense all investment purchases immediately; make any income that American companies earn abroad exempt from United States federal taxes; and repeal the federal estate taxes and various taxes contained in the Affordable Care Act.
The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, has also created tables showing tax cuts by dollar income (as opposed to percentile) and how families with different marital structures and varying numbers of children would most likely be affected.

HEADLINE: China's Copycat Culture

BYLINE: ALEXANDRA HARNEY


HIGHLIGHT: If you're worried about China overtaking the United States as one of the world's leading innovators, don't be. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - If you're worried about China overtaking the United States as one of the world's leading innovators, consider this: While Americans mourned the passing of Steve Jobs last month, the Chinese had just finished closing near-perfect copies of Apple retail outlets in the southwestern city of Kunming. While one country celebrated a man who represented three decades of new ideas, another was still playing whack-a-mole with companies that do nothing more than copy.
This is not how Beijing would like things to go. For several years, Chinese officials have been rolling out an ambitious "indigenous innovation" policy that aims to transform China into a technology powerhouse by 2020. They've turned on a fire hose of funding, dousing sectors as diverse as genome sequencing, coal-bed methane, nanotechnology and nuclear power. They've wooed top Chinese scientists back from abroad and warned researchers in state labs to publish or perish. 
On paper, this strategy would appear to be working. Last year, China filed 12,337 international patents, a 56 percent increase from the year before. The Chinese telecommunications equipment makers ZTE and Huawei rank among the top five patent filers in the world, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
But the harder Beijing pushes its companies and scientists to come up with new ideas, the more they seem to copy the work of others. Instead of the next Apple, Beijing is getting the Apple Peel, the Apple Stoer, and the BlockBerry.

Of course, technology has always spread by adopting the innovations of others. The journeymen of medieval Europe traveled around working with diverse masters to learn new techniques, and Jobs got his inspiration for screen menus and the mouse on a visit to Xerox's research lab in 1979. But too often China's purpose is not to build on what the competition has done, but simply to steal its work and underprice it.
In a nation with such breakneck economic growth and an overburdened judicial system the dishonest frequently win. The system to protect the honest simply isn't robust enough. Dishonest copiers move quickly to secure an advantage in a rapidly growing market, and their success, in turn, perpetuates China's copycat culture.
The concept applies to both academic research and business. Pressure to publish is so great in Chinese research circles that some scientists worry they don't have time to come up with original ideas. Last year, a scientific journal in Zhejiang Province disclosedthat it found evidence of plagiarism in almost one-third of submissions over a 20-month period.
Mistrust also discourages companies and researchers from collaborating. So instead of its own Silicon Valley, China has what the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calls an archipelago: islands of researchers scattered across the country, too scared of intellectual property theft to work together. 
Many of the Chinese entrepreneurs working to develop new products and ideas say the culture of copying erodes their profit margins and provides less incentive to dream up something truly novel. Or, as the Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Adam Segal puts it in his book "Advantage,'' "With quick profits available to companies that successfully reverse engineer already proven technologies, it makes little sense to risk failure by putting money and effort into further technological innovation."
Somewhere in China today might be the next Steve Jobs. Maybe he was working at one of those recently shuttered faux Apple Stoers. But will he feel confident that his ideas will be protected, that his suppliers won't rip off his products, and that the courts will enforce the law?

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Weigh Obama as Running Mate

BYLINE: CARL HULSE


HIGHLIGHT: If incumbent Democratic senators are tempted to distance themselves from Mr. Obama by skipping a campaign event or two, they are probably wasting their time. 

 BODY:
One thing is certain in the uncertain outlook for Senate races next year - much attention will be paid to which Democratic Senate contenders do or do not share the stage with President Obama when he sweeps through their states in the heat of the election season.
It is a traditional measure of whether a down-ballot candidate is standing with or running away from a presidential candidate perceived as being more hindrance than help in certain states. Convenient scheduling conflicts have kept many a Congressional candidate away from the campaign events of embattled White House contenders of both parties.
But if incumbent Democratic senators are tempted to distance themselves from Mr. Obama by skipping a campaign event or two, they are probably wasting their time.
"Whether they get on stage with him is not going to matter," said Rob Jesmer, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "They are going to rise or fall with him in most cases. The reason he is unpopular is because of his policies and these are the policies they have voted for - health care, the stimulus, now a second stimulus. There isn't any daylight in the minds of voters."
It won't be hard for Mr. Jesmer's organization or any of the other groups targeting Democratic Senate candidates to assemble video juxtaposing the Democratic senator with the president or even showing them together at one venue or another.
And it is easy to remind the public that Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Robert P. Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, Jon Tester of Montana and every other Democratic senator up for re-election voted in 2009 for the health care legislation and the economic stimulus measure - both bills that Republicans have tried to turn into symbols of Democratic mismanagement of the economy. And since the health care bill passed a crucial procedural hurdle with the bare minimum 60 Democratic votes, Republicans will no doubt take the opportunity to paint each Democrat as the deciding vote on the issue. 
And don't think that those who weren't serving in the Senate will escape the Republican effort to join them to the president's hip. Representative Shelley Berkley, a Democratic Senate candidate in Nevada, backed much of the president's agenda in the House. 
Tim Kaine, the former Virginia governor running for his state's Senate seat in a race crucial to deciding control of the Senate, was the president's hand-picked choice to head the Democratic National Committee, making it difficult for him to act like he never met the man. While he did not appear with Mr. Obama during the recent presidential bus trip in Virginia, he did join the president in early September at the University of Richmond and is expected to meet up on the trail with him again.
But even as Republicans plot strategy to link the president with senators on the ballot, there is strong evidence to suggest that the presidential race will not be determinative in many Senate contests. And there is a case to be made that some Democrats should be grateful that the president is trying to win their state.
The Obama campaign is going to invest millions of dollars and recruit thousands of volunteers to turn out the vote in states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the voters they are seeking are exactly the ones who Mr. Kaine, Mr. Casey and Senator Sherrod Brown, respectively, will need to win. Some of those voters might not be pleased if the senators are seen as deserting the president. The effort at the presidential level will also free Senate dollars for other efforts that could help put the Democratic candidates over the top.
At the same time, most of the Democratic candidates are political heavyweights in their states and are now running ahead of Mr. Obama in the polls. They have their own identities and political brands at home. In the case of someone like Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, a two-term governor and senator, his race is probably going to be decided on his own record and reputation rather than those of the president, who is unlikely to be visiting the conservative state anyway. 
Democrats also say that any Republican attempt to focus on the president's connection to a Senate candidate will mean less effort spent on other strategies.
"If they are talking about how Jon Tester is close to Obama and we are talking about who Denny Rehberg is," said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, referring to the Republican House member challenging Mr. Tester in Montana, "we think we win that fight."
Some Senate Democrats who survived Republican efforts in 2010 to hold them up as the partners of the president think their colleagues can do the same next year if they face the matter head on.
Senator Michael Bennet, the Colorado Democrat who won a full term in 2010 after his appointment to a vacancy, didn't try to minimize his ties to the administration. But he said Democrats also have to push back hard against any Republican effort to distort their record and the president's.
"In this job you cast votes and you have to be able to defend those votes and explain why you agreed with the president," Mr. Bennet said. "Or why you disagreed."

HEADLINE: Even in Texas Poll, Perry Isn't Leading

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain leads the new poll of Texas Republican voters with 27 percent, while Mr. Perry won support from 26 percent, a statistical tie. 

 BODY:
A new poll of Texas Republican voters indicates that Rick Perry is not even leading in his home state, the latest sign that the Texas governor faces a huge task to regain the momentum and support he seemed to effortlessly generate in the first few weeks of his campaign.
Herman Cain, the former pizza-chain executive and restaurant industry lobbyist, leads the new poll by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune with 27 percent of registered Texas voters who identify themselves as Republicans. Mr. Perry won support from 26 percent, a statistical tie. 
Representative Ron Paul of Texas came in third with 12 percent, followed by Mitt Romney, 9 percent; Newt Gingrich, 8 percent; and Michele Bachmann, 2 percent. Rick Santorum, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Gary Johnson all took one percent, and 12 percent said they either did not know who they favored or wanted another Republican candidate.
The results suggest that Mr. Perry's dive in support in Texas has been similar to his decline in national polls: Another survey conducted about five weeks earlier by Public Policy Polling found that Mr. Perry had support from 49 percent of usual Texas Republican primary voters, compared with 44 percent for the rest of the Republican field combined.
The U.T./Texas Tribune poll, conducted Oct. 19-26, surveyed 800 self-declared registered voters of any affiliation. It also suggests that most Texans may not believe Mr. Perry's central campaign claim: that he is a good economic steward and that his policies deserve the credit for the state's recent job creation.
This part of the new poll, surveying all 800 voters, found that 42 percent approved of the job he has done with the Texas economy, while 41 percent disapproved and 18 percent offered a neutral response or said they didn't know. By comparison, 28 percent approved of the job President Obama has done with the economy, while 61 percent disapproved.
And of the same people surveyed, 44 percent disapprove of the job Mr. Perry has done as governor while 39 percent approve. By contrast, 57 percent disapprove of the job President Obama has done, compared with 33 percent who approve.
The Texas primary is still four months away, and many campaign experts predict that Mr. Cain's surge of popularity may not hold for that time, giving Mr. Perry an opportunity to win back Republicans.
But the findings suggest that Mr. Perry is also struggling not only among national Republican voters who went cold after his lackluster debate performances, but also among those who know him best in Texas, where Mr. Perry has served as a statewide elected official for two decades.

HEADLINE: Cain Faces Allegations, and Now, the Possible Repercussions

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: How the latest sexual harassment charges could reshape the Republican presidential contest. 

 BODY:
The political impact of the accusations leveled against Herman Cain is difficult to assess in the early hours after they surfaced. But the allegations -- and the reactions to them -- have the potential to reshape the dynamics of the Republican presidential contest.
Mr. Cain -- who recently became a leading contender for the Republican nomination in some national and state polls -- has forcefully denied that he ever sexually harassed anyone, even as he acknowledged that two women leveled such an accusation against him more than a decade ago.
The news media frenzy whipped up by the Politico report has the potential to distract Mr. Cain from his economic message, scare away donors and cause Republican primary voters to rethink their support for him.
If that happens, Mr. Cain's recent electoral surge could go the way of other Republican hopefuls who have briefly risen in surveys to challenge Mitt Romney's status as the front-runner -- only to quickly fade after stumbling on the campaign trail.
But the initial reaction to the reports about Mr. Cain from some conservatives seems to be the opposite. Ann Coulter, a conservative talk show host, helped spark a wave of support for Mr. Cain by calling the accusations"another high-tech lynching" and accusing "liberals" of going after him because he is "a black conservative."
Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, echoed that theme in an Internet posting, saying that "in the eyes of the liberal media, Herman Cain is just another uppity black American who has had the audacity to leave the liberal plantation. So they must destroy him, just as they tried destroying Clarence Thomas."
Months ago, Mr. Cain himself had noted the possibility of his being on the receiving end of accusations like those made against Justice Thomas during his confirmation to the Supreme Court.
"They're going to come after me more viciously than they would a white candidate," Mr. Cain predicted to The Washington Examiner in May. "You're right. Clarence Thomas. And so, to use Clarence Thomas as an example, I'm ready for the same high-tech lynching that he went through -- for the good of this country." 
He added: "I'm ready for the same high-tech lynching."
If that narrative takes hold -- and if more details of the alleged harassment do not surface -- Mr. Cain could be helped by the media fury surrounding the accusations.
"I've gotten used to what it feels like to be near the top," Mr. Cain joked at the National Press Club on Monday, embracing the controversy as a kind of plus for his campaign. "As a result of today's big news story, I really know what it feels like to be No. 1."
Phil Musser, who served as a senior adviser to the presidential campaign for Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, said the result of the Politico report for Mr. Cain's campaign could turn out to be less severe. 
"In the short term, I suspect there is minimal impact with G.O.P. primary voters," Mr. Musser told The Caucus. "He has made a definitive denial, which will take some of the pressure off. Plus, Cain is well liked and most will give him the benefit of the doubt, and in some cases, this will serve to intensify their support."
Steve Grubbs, Mr. Cain's Iowa chairman, told Politico Monday that the reports will help the campaign.
"I bet we'll land more precinct captains than we did before the story," Mr. Grubbs told the Web site. "These sorts of distractions are not stopping our campaign from reaching our daily goals."
Mr. Cain's Republican rivals have been completely silent since the reports first surfaced on Politico Sunday evening. That reticence to comment -- from a group of candidates who are rarely understated with one another -- may reflect a nervousness about how the story will ultimately play out.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney declined to comment about the accusations against Mr. Cain. Aides to Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, and Representative Michele Bachmann also declined to comment.
If the reports do hurt Mr. Cain's political fortunes, that could be a plus for Mr. Perry, who is seeking to cast himself as the alternative to Mr. Romney, the front-runner for the nomination.
Mr. Perry has been struggling in the polls recently, earning only single digits in some surveys even as Mr. Cain's numbers have moved higher. If Mr. Cain loses support in the days ahead, some of that could go to Mr. Perry. 
But Mr. Romney is also eager to consolidate his support and increase his lead in the polls, and a collapse of Mr. Cain's campaign could give him an opportunity to court voters who had not previously been willing to back him for the nomination.
"If the veracity of the denials - which were late in coming - are challenged by the emergence of new facts or actors, the issue could become political quicksand," said Mr. Musser, the former aide to Mr. Pawlenty. "How the Cain campaign handles the next phase of the story will tell us a lot more about its impact. "
Other Republican candidates in the race could also benefit if Mr. Cain's support starts to sag. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, has been gaining support recently after his campaign badly stumbled earlier in the summer. Mrs. Bachmann is focusing her energy on doing well in Iowa, and a diminished Cain candidacy could help.
In the end, the impact of the charges may depend on what happens next, and whether the unidentified women cited in Politico's story decide to come forward and tell their version of what happened.
Mr. Cain's decision to talk about the allegations publicly at the National Press Club on Monday may give the women some legal cover to come forward. If that happens -- and depending on what they say -- the report may have more impact.
If the women don't come forward, it's possible that the political ramifications of the accusations could quickly fade into the background as the Republican primary race moves into its most intense period this winter.
"The deal is sealed and so are the lips that could trip him," said Mark McKinnon, a veteran Republican political strategist. "So, with his forceful response, I think Cain powers on for now."
